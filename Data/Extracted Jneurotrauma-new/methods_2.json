    "Methods": "The study protocol received institutional review board (IRB) approval (Western IRB 1271583). Ethical approval was also provided by individual IRBs at the Penn State College of Medicine (STUDY00003729), SUNY Upstate Medical University (1070727), SUNY Buffalo (#00004347), Vanderbilt University Medical Center (#181814), and the Department of the Army, Regional Health Command-Atlantic (#1510001-1). Written, informed consent was obtained for all participants and written assent was provided by participants <18 years of age.\n\nParticipants\nThis prospective multi-center study included a convenience sample of 251 individuals (age 18\u2009\u00b1\u20097 years). All 251 individuals received a clinical diagnosis of concussion, as defined by the 2016 Concussion in Sport Group criteria.\n1\nParticipants included individuals with sport-related and non-sport-related mechanisms of injury, who were enrolled from emergency departments (ED), sports medicine clinics, urgent care centers, concussion specialty clinics, and outpatient primary care clinics at initial clinical presentation (within 14 days of injury). At enrollment, saliva was collected from each participant via swab, medical/demographic data was collected via survey, concussion symptoms were assessed via the post-concussion symptom scale (PCSS\n18\n), and balance/neurocognitive performance was measured with the ClearEdge Toolkit (Quadrant Biosciences, Syracuse, NY\n19\n,\n20\n). Concussion symptoms were re-assessed \u22653 weeks post-concussion using the PCSS. Participants were enrolled from April 2017 through February 2020 at seven institutions: Adena Health System (Chillicothe, OH;\nn\n=\u200937), Colgate University (Hamilton, NY;\nn\n=\u200942), the United States Army (Fort Benning, GA;\nn\n=\u20096), Penn State College of Medicine (Hershey, PA;\nn\n=\u2009112), State University of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo Jacobs School of Medicine (Buffalo, NY;\nn\n=\u200911), SUNY Upstate Medical University (Syracuse, NY;\nn\n=\u200926), and Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Nashville, TN;\nn\n=\u200917). Exclusion criteria for all participants were primary language other than English, pregnancy, active periodontal disease, neurological disorder (e.g. epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, hydrocephalus), drug or alcohol dependency, upper respiratory infection, having a legally appointed guardian or inability to provide consent/assent because of intellectual disability, Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) \u226412 at the time of initial injury, penetrating brain injury, hospitalization for current concussion, skull fracture, unresolved concussion symptoms, additional concussion within the previous 3 months, or intracranial bleed on imaging (if performed).\n\nDemographic and medical data collection\nParticipant characteristics were collected via survey and administered by research staff in the clinical care setting. Parents assisted children (\u2264 12 years) with survey completion. When possible, survey responses were confirmed through review of the medical record. The following medical and demographic characteristics were collected: age (years), sex (male/female/non-conforming), race (White, Black or African American, Asian, American Indian or Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander), ethnicity (Hispanic or Latinx/not Hispanic), body mass index (BMI) (kg/m\n2\n), chronic medical issues (presence/absence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], anxiety, depression, and chronic headache disorder). The following concussion-related characteristics were collected: number of previous concussions, time since most recent concussion (days), presence/absence of loss of consciousness. For a subset of all participants (\nn\n=\u2009208) 22 symptoms were self-reported on a Likert scale (0\u20136) using the PCSS. Total symptom severity (sum of all Likert scores), and total symptom burden (sum of all symptoms >0) were calculated for each participant. Presence/absence of persistent post-concussion symptoms (PPCS) >3 weeks after initial injury was assessed through self-report on the PCSS (\u2265 5 symptoms), or through electronic medical record review (where available).\n\nBalance and neurocognitive assessment\nBalance was assessed for a portion of participants (\nn\n=\u2009177) using the validated ClearEdge system, as we have previously reported.\n14\nClearEdge measures body sway in three dimensions during eight different stances: two legs eyes open (TLEO), tandem stance eyes open (TSEO), two legs eyes closed (TLEC), tandem stance eyes closed (TSEC), two legs eyes open on a foam pad (TLEOFP), two legs eyes closed on a foam pad (TLECFP), tandem stance eyes open on a foam pad (TSEOFP), and tandem stance eyes closed on a foam pad (TSECFP). A scaled score of 0 indicates poor balance and 100 indicates superior balance. There were 21 participants who were unable to complete balance testing because of orthopedic injury, or extreme postural instability. The remaining participants were unable to complete the assessment because of time constraints in the clinical setting of enrollment. Computerized neurocognitive assessment was performed in the same subset of participants (\nn\n=\u2009177) using the following tests: simple reaction time (SRT1), procedural reaction time (PRT), go/no-go (GNG), and a repeat of simple reaction time (SRT2). This battery is part of the Defense Automated Neurobehavioral Assessment (DANA\n21\n). The four cognitive tests were scored for speed and accuracy using a mean throughput measure of mental efficiency, where higher scores reflect better performance. Individual scores were objectively calculated with computerized software, and overall test battery means were determined for balance and neurocognition.\n\nSalivary RNA assessment\nSaliva swabs (DNA Genotek, Ottawa Canada) were collected from all participants (\nn\n=\u2009251) in a non-fasting state, as previously reported.\n22\nFollowing RNA extraction (miRNeasy Kit; Qiagen, Germantown, MD), RNA quality was assessed (Agilent Bioanalyzer, Illumina, San Diego, CA), sequencing libraries were prepared (TruSeq Stranded Small RNA Kit, Illumina), and sequencing was performed at a depth of 10,000,000, 50 base-pair reads/sample (NextSeq500, Illumina). Fastq files were trimmed using Cutadapt v1.2.1,\n23\naligned to miRBase22 using Bowtie v1.0.0,\n24\nand quantified using a custom bio-informatics architecture (Human Alignment Toolchain [HATCH]). Aligned reads were quantile normalized and each miRNA feature was mean-center scaled (divided by feature standard deviation). The miRNA profile for each sample was reduced to a panel of 22 miRNAs previously shown to differentiate concussed and non-concussed individuals.\n14\nMissing values (1.5 % of survey measures, 0.0% of miRNA measures) were imputed with the singular value decomposition imputation method. Quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) were used to validate directionality and proportion of change for a subset of miRNAs.\n\nStatistical analysis\nSaliva miRNA levels were used to divide the 251 participants into biological clusters with a K-means clustering approach. K-means clustering was selected because it provided optimal internal validity (Davies Bouldin Index), stability (figure of merit), and biological validity (biologic homogeneity) for this data set, when compared with graph-based clustering and model-based clustering.\n25\nThe optimal number of clusters (between 3 and 20) was determined using the elbow method.\n26\nInitial cluster centroids were selected to optimize the distance between clusters (Euclidean distance metric). A maximum of 1000 iterations was used to compute cluster centroids. K-means clustering analyses were performed in Partek Flow (Partek Flow, St. Louis, MO). Levels of the 22 miRNAs were compared among the biological clusters via Kruskal Wallis testing with Holm step-down multiple testing correction. For three miRNA candidates (miR-27a-5p, miR-192-5p, miR-4510), Spearman's correlations were used to repeatability with qPCR, and directionality of change across clusters was visualized using a hierarchical heat map with a Euclidan distance metric. Next, medical and demographic characteristics were compared across groups using analysis of variance (continuous variables) or \u03c7\n2\ntest (nominal variables). Finally, linear regression was used to assess the relationship of cluster group with subjective symptoms (scores on the PCSS) and functional symptoms (balance scores and neurocognitive scores), while controlling for medical factors that displayed between-cluster differences (age, days post-concussion, number of prior concussions). Between-group comparisons were performed using Jamovi v2.2 software.\n27\nFinally, miRNA function was used to explore the physiological characteristics of each cluster. Cluster-specific miRNAs (i.e., miRNAs with 1.5-fold up- or downregulation relative to the mean value for the entire cohort) were identified for each cluster group. High confidence gene targets (microT-CDS score \u22650.95, adjusted\np\nvalue <0.040) were determined for each set of cluster-specific miRNAs in DIANA miRPATH v3.0 online software.\n28\nOver-representation of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways by these target genes (adjusted\np\n<\u20090.05) was determined using a Fisher's exact test with Bonferroni correction."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll studies were approved by the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Palo Alto, CA, USA) and followed the animal guidelines of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory animals (NIH Publications No. 8023, revised 1978). Male Sprague Dawley rats (250\u2013300\u2009g; Envigo, Indianapolis, IN, USA), were housed under standard conditions with a 12\u2009h light\u2013dark cycle (6:30 am to 6:30 pm) and were given food and water\nad libitum\n. The animals were housed in pairs in 30\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u2009\u00d7\u200919-cm isolator cages with solid floors covered with a 4\u2009cm layer of wood chip bedding. Experimenters were blinded to the identity of treatments and experimental conditions. All studies were designed to minimize the number of rats required. All\nin vivo\nexperiments were performed between 7 am and 3 pm in the Veterinary Medical Unit.\n\nDrugs\nDrugs used were: PGE-2 (1\u2009\u03bcg/50\u2009\u03bcL], i.pl (14010, Cayman Chemicals, MI, USA) a principal mediator of inflammation and pain hypersensitivity; capsaicin (CAP) (10\u2009\u03bcg/10\u2009\u03bcL), i.pl. (M2028, Millipore-Sigma, MO, USA) that causes hyperalgesia to mechanical stimuli at and around the injection site; clozapine N-oxide (CNO) (3\u2009mg/kg), i.p., (16882, Cayman Chemicals) a ligand used to selectively activate DREADDs and is otherwise pharmacologically and behaviorally inert in animals at this dose; reboxetine mesylate (RBX) (10\u2009\u03bcg/10\u2009\u03bcL), i.t., (R1126, Ontario Chemicals, Canada) a noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor (NRI); atipamezole hydrochloride (ATZ) (1\u2009mg/kg), s.c., (9001181, Cayman Chemicals) an \u03b1-2-adrenoceptor (AR) antagonist; and prazosin (PRZ) (1\u2009mg/kg), i.p., (15023, Cayman Chemicals) an \u03b1-1-AR antagonist.\n\nViral vectors\nViral vectors, kindly provided by Dr. Christopher Peters, had been custom subcloned and packaged by the University of Pennsylvania Viral Vector Core. In an AAV10 vector, the synthetic PRSx8 promoter\n31\nwas used to restrict expression of the hM3Dq DREADD gene with a haemagglutinin (HA) tag\n32\nto noradrenergic neurons in the LC area. Vazey and Aston-Jones\n30\ndemonstrated 97% co-localization of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), expression of which denotes noradrenergic neurons and the HA tag that identified hM3Dq expression in the LC. Quantification of the proportion of LC neurons that were hM3Dq positive was not reported. However, CNO-induced activation of the DREADD-expressing neurons of the LC in these studies was successful in altering the anesthetic state of rats while under isoflurane anesthesia.\n30\nThe control AAV10 vector contained the PRSx8 promoter with only an mCherry reporter protein without the DREADD gene, hM3Dq.\n\nDREADD microinjection surgeries\nAll surgeries were performed under isoflurane anesthesia (5% for induction and 2% for maintenance). Rats were secured in a stereotactic frame, and the coordinates for the left and right LC (From lambda: +1.5\u2009mm A-P,\n+\n1.5mm M-L, 7.0\u2009mm D-V) were entered and marked on the skull with a surgical pen.\n33\nA 2-mm craniotomy was made into both marked locations using a mini-drill and a 1.4\u2009mm drill burr (Fine Science Tools, CA, USA), and 1.4\u03bcl of the excitatory DREADD (AAV10 PRSx8hM3D) or the control virus (AAV10-PRSx8-mCherry) was injected at a rate of 0.1\u2009\u03bcL/min using a 5-cm\u200930G beveled needle (7803-07, Hamilton, NV, USA) connected to a Hamilton 5\u2009\u03bcL syringe (7634-01, Hamilton). The needle was left in place for 10\u2009min after infusion and then slowly removed. The overlying scalp wound was closed using staples, and rats were allowed 4 weeks for recovery and viral expression.\n\nTBI surgery\nThe lateral fluid percussion (LFP) rat model of TBI was used as described previously.\n14\n,\n16\n,\n22\nBriefly, a midline incision was made in the scalp, and a 5-mm craniotomy was made on the right side of the skull using a mini-drill and a 5-mm trephine burr (Fine Science Tools). The craniotomy was placed midway between the bregma and lambda sutures and 2\u2009mm right of the midline suture. Using cyanoacrylate glue and dental acrylic, a female luer attachment was affixed to the craniotomy opening. Following recovery of pinch reflexes, the luer attachment was connected to the LFP apparatus (Amscien Instruments, VA, USA), and a pressure wave of 1.3 (\u00b10.1 atm) to produce mild level injuries or no pressure wave (uninjured) was applied to rat dura based on previous reports. Thereafter, the luer attachment and dental acrylic were removed, the bone flap replaced, and the overlying wound closed using staples. Rats were allowed to recover in their home cages.\n\nIntrathecal injection\nRats were anesthetized with isoflurane throughout the procedure and the paw pinch reflex was used to ensure the state of anesthesia. A 3\u2009cm\n2\nwindow of fur, near the base of the tail, was shaved and washed with 70% ethanol to maximize visualization during needle insertion. An empty 50\u2009mL falcon tube was placed underneath the rat to raise up the lumbar vertebral column, and the spinous process of L5 was located. The spinous process of L5 was pulled in a cranial direction and the vertebral body of L6 was pulled caudally toward the tail. This maximized the space within the groove between L5 and L6 vertebrae, into which a 25G needle was carefully inserted. Successful entry of the needle into the intradural space was confirmed by the observation of a tail flick. The needle was immediately secured into position with one hand, and the desired volume of substance was slowly injected with the other hand. Once injection was performed, the rat was placed on a warming pad prior to returning to their home cage.\n\nBehavioral testing\nMechanical withdrawal thresholds were measured using a modification of the up-down method and von Frey filaments as described previously.\n34\nAnimals were placed in clear Plexiglas boxes (17\u2009cm length x 11\u2009cm width x 13\u2009cm height) on an elevated horizontal wire mesh stand (IITC Life Science Inc, CA, USA). After 60\u2009min of acclimation, fibers of increasing stiffness with initial bending force of 4.31\u2009N (ranging from 4.31\u2009N up to 5.18\u2009N) were applied to the plantar surface of the hindpaw, and left in place for 5\u2009sec with enough force to slightly bend the fiber. Withdrawal of the hindpaw from the fiber was scored as a response. When no response was obtained, the next firmer fiber in the series was used in the same manner. If a response was observed, the next less stiff fiber was applied. Testing continued until four fibers had been applied after the first one causing a withdrawal response, allowing the estimation of the mechanical withdrawal threshold using a curve fitting algorithm.\n35\n\nDNIC paradigm\nAssessment of post-traumatic mechanical hypersensitivity was performed using a variant of a widely used noxious stimulation\u2013induced anti-nociceptive protocol.\n23\u201325\nBriefly, it was confirmed that the rats had recovered to baseline mechanical thresholds after TBI (28 days post-injury). Next, intraplantar injection of PGE-2 (test stimulus) into the hindpaw (HL) contralateral to the TBI was used to produce brief hypersensitivity.\n36\nAfter 1\u2009h, the PGE-2 injection HL withdrawal thresholds were measured using the von Frey filaments as described. Subsequent to mechanical threshold evaluations, rats were given a capsaicin injection (conditioning stimulus) into the dorsal surface of the forepaw (FP) ipsilateral to the TBI to induce DNIC. All intraplantar injections were administered using light isoflurane anesthesia. At 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240\u2009min after capsaicin injection, withdrawal thresholds were measured using the von Frey filaments as described.\n\nDrug treatments during DNIC assessment\nFor studies involving CNO, ATZ and PRZ, an injection of the drugs was given after the withdrawal threshold measurements from the test stimulus (PGE-2) were recorded. In studies involving two drugs, CNO was always given first.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nThis protocol has been described in detail previously.\n14\n,\n22\nBriefly, rats were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, and brains were then removed and cryoprotected in 20% sucrose in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 2 days at 4\u00b0C. The brainstems were cut into 12-\u03bcm transverse sections using a cryostat. Immunostaining was performed using an antibody against (1) Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) (1:500, AB152, Millipore-Sigma), which is the rate-limiting enzyme of catecholamine synthesis of which noradrenaline is a product; (2) HA-tag (1:500, C29F4, Cell Signalling Technology, MA, USA), which is a small 9 amino acid epitope of the haemagglutinin of the influenza virus; (3) c-Fos (1:4000, ABE-457, Millipore-Sigma) for neuronal activation; and (4) Dopamine-beta-Hydroxylase (D\u03b2H; 1:500, MAB308, Millipore-Sigma), the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine, which is routinely used to label NA neurons of the LC. Blocking of all the sections took place at room temperature for 2\u2009h in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, CA, USA), followed by exposure to the primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C. Sections stained with c-Fos or TH were then treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide to quench endogenous peroxidases. After washing, TH and c-Fos were visualized, using biotin-conjugated second antibodies (Vector Laboratories). For TH, this was followed by incubation with the Vectastain Elite ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories) and developed using the DAB peroxidase substrate kit (Vector Laboratories). For c-Fos, this was followed by incubation with the Vectastain ABC AP reagent (Vector Laboratories) and developed using the ImmPACT Vector Red substrate kit (Vector Laboratories). HA-tag and D\u03b2H were visualized Alexa Fluor-conjugated second antibodies (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). Controls prepared with the primary antibody omitted showed minimal background fluorescence, DAB, and vector red staining under the conditions employed. Staining was performed concurrently for each group of sections compared with one another, and photographed under identical conditions.\n\nImage analysis\nIn all data assessments, both the photography and image analysis were performed by observers who were blinded to the experimental conditions. c-Fos, HA-tag, D\u03b2H, and TH expression was evaluated bilaterally in the LC (A-P -9.0 to -10.5\u2009mm) on three coronal sections per brain spaced 400\u2009\u03bcm apart. Sections from uninjured, untreated rats were used to establish a threshold level that excluded all non-specific staining. This threshold level was then applied to all experimental groups.\n\nData analysis\nAn independent statistician (A.R.F.) tested statistical assumptions, and performed missing values analysis and descriptive statistical tests, followed by inferential tests. Data met normality, homogeneity of variance, and independence assumptions sufficiently for application of general linear models (GLM). Group comparisons were therefore performed according to\na priori\nbalanced experimental designs as two-way, three-way, or four-way mixed analyses of variance (ANOVAs), modeling between- and within-subject factors as appropriate using GLM. Significant effects were followed by interaction plots and Bonferroni's post-hocs.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS software (v.27, IBM Corp.) with base, regression, missing values, and advanced statistics modules. Statistical code is freely available upon request. Graphs were created using Prism 9.1.0 (GraphPad Software). Data are presented as mean values\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM). All experimental sample sizes (\nn\n) were selected by\na priori\npower calculations based on historical data from our laboratory. The results report precise\nF\nvalues, degrees of freedom,\np\nvalues, effect sizes, and observed power for all significant effects as well as the\nn\ns completed for each group.\n\nData availability\nAll the raw data are available through the VA- and NIH-supported open data commons for TBI (\nodc-tbi.org\n), in support of funder mandates for findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data stewardship policies. Data may be accessed at\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.34945/F5759W\nupon article publication and reused with attribution via the creative commons 4.0 BY license."

    "Methods": "Participants\nWe searched for patients within the University of California, San Francisco, Neurodegenerative Disease Brain Bank autopsy program. Selection criteria for this study were: (1) documented RHI during life from activities with high exposure risk (e.g., American football, boxing), (2) post-mortem neuropathological examination, (3) at least one antemortem neuropsychological evaluation, and (4) at least one antemortem structural MRI. We did not require that neuropsychological testing and structural MRI were obtained within a pre-specified time interval. Additional antemortem biomarkers were included in the study based on convenience of availability from the parent study protocols (see\nSupplementary Methods\n).\nDetails of type and duration of RHI during life were determined via review of available medical and research records from patients in the brain bank, including medical history and social histories ascertained through comprehensive patient and care partner interviews and neurological examinations. Activities considered high risk for RHI included American football, boxing, mixed martial arts, ice hockey, rugby, soccer, and wrestling.\n1\nAdditional sources of exposure were noted if the activity has a high risk for repeated head trauma (e.g., military service, motocross or competitive racecar driving).\nFor participants with documented evidence of RHI through collision sports, we also searched publicly available online records for additional details about duration or participation level if not explicitly mentioned elsewhere. Prior isolated traumatic brain injury was similarly determined through record review as well as data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set (UDS) Health History forms\n26\nbut did not factor into RHI determination. Because of the retrospective nature of the study and stipulations of existing study protocols, additional details could not be readily obtained prospectively (e.g., family interview).\nThe search yielded nine patients (all male and white/Caucasian) who were followed prospectively through the UCSF Alzheimer's Disease Research Center or Program Project Grant on frontotemporal dementia. Initial enrollment in research occurred between 2009 and 2018. All patients provided informed consent to participate in Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved research protocols during life and consented to brain donation.\n\nClinical diagnostic classifications\nAll patients initially received a diagnosis during life via multi-disciplinary consensus conference. Proposed criteria for symptoms associated with CTE (i.e., TES or similar terminology) have evolved significantly in the last decade (e.g.,\n1\n,\n27\u201329\n) with variable applications in research settings. Therefore, we retroactively applied the most recent National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) TES consensus criteria framework to the nine patients meeting our selection criteria.\n1\nTwo investigators (BA, JT) reviewed available neurological and neuropsychological assessments (\nSupplementary Table S1\n), which included detailed histories and clinical interviews with patients and care partners. Clinicians are trained to assess for head trauma exposure, as well as other dementia risk factors, but standardized tools were not systematically applied. Each rater first independently determined whether the patient met TES criteria and, if so, assigned a level of diagnostic certainty: \u201cSuggestive of CTE,\u201d \u201cPossible CTE,\u201d or \u201cProbable CTE.\u201d\n1\nRetroactive diagnoses were made blinded to neuropathological diagnosis. The TES determinations were made irrespective of clinical diagnoses made during life, neuroimaging, and other biomarkers (e.g., PET or cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]), although formal blinding to this information was not always feasible because of references made to existing or previous diagnostic formulations throughout clinical and research reports. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion and joint review of available records.\nA core requirement of the TES framework is \u201csubstantial\u201d RHI. In the case of American football, the framework operationalizes \u201csubstantial\u201d as at least five years of participation needed to meet Possible CTE or higher level of diagnostic certainty. Other sources of exposure such as other collision sports or military blast exposure do not have explicit recommendations for duration. For the retroactive application of the TES framework in our case series, any patients with known RHI from a qualifying activity such as American football, but unknown number of years of participation, were considered \u201cUncertain TES\u201d for this study.\nIn addition, we provide the clinical diagnoses reflecting multi-disciplinary consensus diagnosis for the patient at the time of the last research visit, because the evolving TES diagnostic criteria were not routinely applied across the time span of patient enrollment. These alternative consensus diagnoses importantly differ from the retrospective application of the current TES framework in that available neuroimaging and other biomarker data factored into the prospective consensus diagnoses.\n\nNeuropathological assessment\nAll patients underwent autopsy between 2016 and 2020 using standardized sampling and staining protocols in the UCSF Neurodegenerative Disease Brain Bank as described elsewhere.\n30\n,\n31\nSampling procedures followed recommended guidelines for CTE, AD, FTLD, and synucleinopathies classification\n21\n,\n25\n,\n32\n(phospho-tau antibody: CP-13, S202/T205, mouse, 1:250, courtesy of P. Davies; \u03b2-amyloid: 1-16, mouse, clone DE2, 1:500, Millipore; TDP-43 antibody: rabbit, 1:2000, Proteintech Group; alpha synuclein: LB509 mouse, 1:5000, courtesy of J. Trojanowski and V. Lee). AD burden (A\u03b2 plaques and AD tau tangles) was defined as \u201cNone,\u201d \u201cLow,\u201d \u201cModerate,\u201d or \u201cHigh\u201d AD neuropathological changes (ADNC) based on current National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's association (NIA-AA) criteria.\n21\nUnless otherwise noted, all patients underwent immunohistochemical analysis of hyperphosphorylated tau and TDP-43 proteinopathy in the dentate gyrus (eight of nine with TDP-43 staining), CA1/subiculum, CA2, CA3/CA4, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala (eight of nine with tau staining). We report semi-quantitative ratings of regional lesion burden (e.g., \u201cmild,\u201d \u201cmoderate,\u201d \u201csevere\u201d) made by the reviewing neuropathologist for different tau and TDP-43 inclusion types: neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal or glial cytoplasmic inclusions, neuropil threads, white or gray matter threads, dystrophic neurites.\nCTE severity was defined according to McKee staging criteria\n2\nand as \u201cHigh\u201d or \u201cLow\u201d based on recently proposed classification methods that account for the number of brain regions with CTE-tau deposition (regardless of burden/density).\n25\nWe first verified that participants with neuropathological diagnoses of CTE based on previous criteria also met recent consensus criteria (e.g., required neuronal tau inclusions). We also reevaluated participants who were considered free of CTE pathology during initial autopsy evaluation by sampling additional regions (orbitofrontal cortex, superior/middle temporal cortex) for CTE tau pathology, per recent consensus group recommendations.\n25\nNeuropathologists were blinded to clinical diagnosis and medical history at the time of autopsy when documenting neuropathological findings. After autopsy, neuropathologists were unblinded to clinical history and final neuropathological diagnoses along with designations of primary, contributing, and incidental diagnoses were made by consensus among three neuropathologists (LTG, SS, WWS).\nPrimary neuropathological diagnosis was defined as the observed entity deemed responsible for the majority of the clinical cognitive and behavioral phenotype. This determination takes into account the severity and regional distribution of the findings. Contributing neuropathological diagnoses were defined as sufficiently developed to contribute to the clinical phenotype that is better explained by the primary neuropathological diagnosis. Contributing neuropathological diagnoses also explained additional clinical features that could not be attributed to the primary neuropathological diagnosis. Incidental neuropathological diagnoses were defined as coexistent neuropathological entities thought to contribute little, if at all, to the clinical presentation.\n\nNeuropsychological testing\nAll nine patients underwent longitudinal neuropsychological evaluations (mean number of evaluations\u2009=\u20093.7, range 2\u20135; mean retest interval\u2009=\u20091.4 years, range 0.8\u20134.1 years; mean follow-up time\u2009=\u20093.7 years, range 1\u20137 years; mean time before death at last evaluation\u2009=\u20091.9 years, range 0\u20135 years) with testing protocols previously described.\n33\nCognitive composites were created for memory (California Verbal Learning Test short form, immediate and delayed recall; Benson figure recall), executive functioning (modified trail making test, lexical fluency, digit span backwards, Stroop inhibition, design fluency), and language (animal fluency, 15-item Boston Naming Test). Individual test raw scores were converted to z-scores based on a large sample of clinically normal older adults (\nn\nper test\u2009=\u2009231\u2013763, 65\u2009\u00b1\u200913 years old, 60% female, 16.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4 years of education) and then averaged within each domain to create the composite score.\n\nNeuroimaging\nStructural MRI\nWe report data from a total of 18 structural MRI scans obtained from the nine patients with TES (\nn\n=\u20095 with 2+ scans; first available scan: 4.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4 years before death, range 2\u20136 years; last available scan: mean 2.7\u2009\u00b1\u20092.6 years before death, range 0\u20136 years). Structural T1-weighted MRI was acquired at the UCSF Neuroimaging Center on one of two scanners (3T Siemens Tim Trio scanner [\nn\n=\u200912] or 3T Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma) as described previously.\n34\nBefore processing, all T1-weighted images were visually inspected for quality control and those with excessive motion or image artifact were excluded.\nTissue segmentation was performed using unified segmentation in SPM12.\n35\nEach subject's gray matter segmentation was warped to create a study-specific template.\n36\nSubject's native space gray and white matter segmentations were then normalized and modulated to study-specific template space using non-linear and rigid-body transformation. Each subject's segmentation was carefully inspected to ensure robustness of the process. Quantification of volumes in specific brain regions was accomplished by transforming a standard parcellation atlas (Desikan\n37\n) into International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM) space and summing all modulated gray matter within each parcellated region of interest (ROI).\n37\nBrain volume w-scores were then calculated voxel-wise and by ROIs based on the distribution of volumes obtained from 584 brain scans of clinically normal older adults enrolled in a longitudinal healthy aging study (Trio: N\u2009=\u2009478, age 66.2\u2009\u00b1\u200911.8 years old, range 30\u201399 years old; 44% male; 17.5\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8 years of education; Prisma: N\u2009=\u2009106, age 63.3\u2009\u00b1\u200913.1 years old, range 30\u201399 years old; 41% male, 16.6\u2009\u00b1\u20092.3 years of education).\nW-scores represent the regression-based standardized brain volume adjusting for age, sex, years of education, and scanner and are interpreted similar to a z-score. W-score maps were created that demonstrated the number of patients (out of nine) with significantly low volume (W\n<\n-2.0) in a given voxel. Voxel clusters with a high frequency of patients with low volume were interpreted as shared regions of atrophy across the cohort.\nWe identified ROIs and extracted the mean W score across all voxels within the ROI for each patient. The ROIs were selected corresponding to general lobar volumes and specific subregions of interest based on visualization of the voxel-wise W-score frequency map: dorsal frontal, ventral frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital, thalamus, and the medial temporal subset of the overall temporal lobe.\nStructural MRIs obtained closest to death for each patient were evaluated for presence or absence of cavum septum pellucidum (CSP) by the lead investigator (BA; neuropsychology fellow) and verified by a second investigator (JT; behavioral neurology fellow) using previously published methods.\n38\nIf present, we reported the grade and length of the CSP.\nAdditional structural MRI methodology is provided in the\nSupplementary Methods\n.\nDiffusion tensor imaging\nDTI was obtained in six participants using a 3T Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma (mean 3.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9 years before death, range 1\u20136 years). The b\u2009=\u20090 image was co-registered with the diffusion direction images, followed by gradient direction, eddy current and distortion correction using FSL.\n39\n,\n40\nDiffusion tensors were calculated using a non-linear least-squares algorithm in Dipy.\n41\nRegistration of diffusion data was accomplished through the DTI-TK software package.\n42\nAn intersubject template was created through iterative linear and non-linear registration of DTIs. The DTIs in the group space were diagonalized into eigenvectors from which fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were calculated.\nFA W scores (age- and sex-adjusted) were then calculated voxel-wise and by ROIs based on the mean and standard deviation of FA values obtained from 376 clinically normal older adults enrolled in a longitudinal healthy aging study (age 66.7\u2009\u00b1\u200912.2 years old, range 30\u201399 years old; 44% male; 17.5\u2009\u00b1\u20094.8 years of education). Voxel clusters with a high frequency of patients with low FA (W \u2264 -2.0) were interpreted as shared regions of decreased white matter integrity across the cohort.\nIn addition, we identified ROIs from the ICBM-DTI-81 white matter labels and tract atlas and extracted the mean FA across all voxels within the ROI for each patient.\n43\nWe selected ROIs based on visualization of the voxel-wise W-score frequency map and previous research on DTI in RHI populations (superior longitudinal fasciculus, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus, genu of the corpus callosum, uncinate fasciculus, fornix, cingulum-hippocampal bundle) as well as a presumably less affected ROI for comparison (posterior corona radiata).\n17\nAdditional DTI methodology is provided in the\nSupplementary Methods\n.\nFDG-PET acquisition and processing\nFive participants underwent FDG-PET scans (mean 4.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2 years before death, range 3\u20136 years). Acquisition protocols FDG-PET have been described previously.\n44\nPET scans were acquired at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory on a Siemens Biograph 6 Truepoint PET/CT scanner in three dimension acquisition mode. PET frames were realigned for motion correction, averaged, and co-registered onto the participant's MRI. Standardized Uptake Value Ratios (SUVR) maps were created at 30\u201360\u2009min post-injection using the pons as the reference region (defined based on FreeSurfer-derived v5.3 Desikan-Killiany atlas).\nFDG-PET hypometabolism W scores were then calculated based on the FDG-PET of cognitively unimpaired controls (N\u2009=\u200934, age 71.0\u2009\u00b1\u200911.8 years old, range 49\u201390 years old; 100% male, 17.0\u2009\u00b1\u20092.3 years of education). For this, PET images were warped to MNI space using the respective MRI-based transformation parameters and smoothed. Voxel-wise regressions were then performed adjusting for age in the control group, and used to compute W-score maps for each patient. W maps were then created that demonstrated the number of patients (out of 5) with significant hypometabolism (W \u2264 -2.0) in a given voxel.\nAdditional FDG-PET methodology is provided in the\nSupplementary Methods\n.\nPlasma GFAP, NfL, and total tau\nAntemortem plasma GFAP, NfL, and total tau were available for eight of the nine patients with TES (mean time before death\u2009=\u20094.1 years, range 2\u20137 years) who were selected for analysis in a separate study of older adults from our center with documented previous RHI exposure and at least one available blood sample. Five patients had longitudinal GFAP and NfL data (15 total plasma samples from eight patients with TES; mean number of time points\u2009=\u20092.4, range 2\u20134; mean follow-up time\u2009=\u20092.8 years, range 1\u20134 years; mean time before death at last blood draw\u2009=\u20090.6 years, range 0\u20132 years) and two had longitudinal total tau data (11 total plasma samples from eight TES patients).\nVenous blood was collected and stored at -80\u00b0C at UCSF until being packed with dry ice and sent to the University of Florida for analysis following standard shipping protocols (one thawing only). Plasma GFAP, NfL, and total tau were measured via multiplex single molecule arrays on an SR-X analyzer (Simoa, Quanterix Neurology 4-Plex B). All samples were analyzed in duplicate according to manufacturer's published protocols. We only included sample concentrations with coefficients of variance (CV) <20% (N\u2009=\u20094 total tau concentrations excluded). Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 measurement is included in this multiplex assay but was not reported because of a high rate of samples exceeding pre-specified CV thresholds.\nPlasma GFAP, NfL, and total tau concentration W scores were then calculated based on mean concentrations of each protein in plasma samples obtained from 108 AD-biomarker negative (beta-amyloid PET), clinically normal (CDR\u2009=\u20090) healthy controls (age 73.2\u2009\u00b1\u20097.3 years old, range 52\u201391 years old; 50% female). These healthy control samples were analyzed at the same time as the patient samples. The W scores were age-adjusted so that values represent protein concentrations relative to the mean of age-matched healthy controls (i.e., the difference between actual and age-predicted protein concentrations, divided by the standard error in the control group). Higher W scores are interpreted as greater than expected protein concentrations for the patient's age.\n\nData availability\nQualified researchers from academic, not-for-profit institutions can request deidentified data associated with this study through the UCSF Memory and Aging Center after obtaining IRB approval from the UCSF Human Research Protection Program and completing a resource request."

    "Methods": "The joint Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) and VA Portland Health Care System (VAPORHCS) institutional review boards approved this study (VA IRB #3988), and all participants provided verbal and written informed consent. Participants were recruited from June 2018 through March 2020 using clinical referral from VAPORHCS outpatient clinics, flyers posted at OHSU, VAPORHCS, and throughout the local community, and with online advertisements. There was no requirement of a history of TBI to be enrolled in the study, however individuals with eye diseases (e.g., glaucoma, macular degeneration) or taking eye medications were excluded. A total of 433 participants were enrolled. Thirty-eight participants did not complete the TBI interview or could not be definitively diagnosed; therefore 395 subjects, with and without a history TBI, were included in the analyses. Data were verified independently by two researchers prior to analyses.\n\nTBI evaluation\nAll participants underwent the Head Trauma Event Characteristics interview to screen for a history of TBI.\n21\nInterviews were conducted in-person or over the phone by trained study personnel and included questions on participants' most severe and most recent head injuries, if they endorsed having had one. Details of the injury were elicited, including endorsement of altered mental status, loss of consciousness, and posttraumatic amnesia. All records were reviewed by a clinical neuropsychologist who made a diagnosis of no, mild, moderate, or severe TBI.\n\nSurvey instruments\nParticipants filled out the following battery of self-report surveys: Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI) to assess post-concussive syndrome symptoms,\n22\nSymptom Impact Questionnaire-Revised (SIQR) to assess overall chronic pain and its impact on function and disability over the previous 7 days,\n23\nMichigan Body Map (MBM) to assess body areas in which participants experienced chronic pain over the prior 3 months,\n24\nPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (PCL-5) to assess PTSD symptom severity,\n25\nPatient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) to assess depression severity,\n26\nInsomnia Severity Index (ISI) to assess insomnia severity, including difficulty initiating and staying asleep,\n27\nand World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS) to assess activity limitations and disability severity.\n28\nA single question in the NSI pertaining to light sensitivity was not used in total score calculation due to its confound with our primary outcome.\n\nExperimental pressure pain\nPressure-pain threshold and pressure-pain tolerance were determined for each participant using an Algomed Computerized Pressure Algometer (Medoc Ltd. Advanced Medical Systems, Israel) applied to the thumb of the non-dominant hand (except when the individual reported a recent injury near that area, in which case the dominant hand was used). Participants were first tested for pressure-pain threshold. Participants were told to press a button and say \u201cstop\u201d at the point at which they felt any pain from the pressure. This test was repeated three times, with a 2-min inter-trial interval. After each trial, the threshold pressure was recorded and participants were asked to rate the pain of the stimulus on a scale of 0-10, with 0 indicating \u201cno pain\u201d and 10 indicating \u201cthe worst pain imaginable.\u201d Pressure-pain tolerance was assessed similarly except that participants were asked to report when \u201cthe pressure becomes intolerable.\u201d Because thresholds can decrease with repeated testing,\n29\nthe average of the second and third trials was used. The maximum level of pressure used was 1000\u2009kPa; any trial that reached that level before the participant responded was terminated and scored as 1000\u2009kPa. In all instances, pressure algometry testing was done after participants completed self-report surveys.\n\nPhotosensitivity\nVisual photosensitivity thresholds (VPT) were determined using an Ocular Photosensitivity Analyzer (OPA; Bascom Palmer Eye Institute; Miami, FL). This instrument produces light stimuli ranging from 4 to 32,000 lux using 210 white light-emitting diodes focused 50\u2009cm from the participant's eyes. We followed a previously developed protocol.\n30\nFollowing dim light adaption (10\u2009min at 4 lux), participants were seated in front of the light panel and asked to stare forward for the entirety of the test. A computer-generated voice read test instructions. Participants were exposed to each light stimulus (2-sec duration, 4-sec inter-stimulus interval) and asked to respond with a button press if the light was uncomfortable. Stimulus intensity was adjusted using a Garcia-Perez staircase, with ascending and descending steps depending on the participant's previous response. VPTs were calculated based on the mean of 10 response reversals. In all instances, photosensitivity testing was done directly after participants completed pressure algometry testing.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll analyses were performed using R version 3.3.2.\n31\nFor all tests,\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant. Differences in numerical variables between groups were assessed using t-test or one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's honestly significant difference\npost hoc\nanalysis, or a Kruskal-Wallis Test with Dunn's multiple comparison test, depending on the distribution of data. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to test for group differences while controlling for sex for some outcomes. Categorical data were analyzed using a \u03c7\n2\ntest with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Pearson's correlation coefficients of different groups were compared based on their confidence intervals using the open-source R software package cocor.\n32\n,\n33\nA multi-variate linear regression was employed to analyze potential demographic variables and testing measures related to chronic pain."

Male and female C57Bl/6 mice of ages 4-MO (Jackson Laboratories), and 14-MO (National Institute on Aging) were utilized in these experiments. Mice received either a T9 laminectomy only or a T9 laminectomy with a 60 kDyn spinal contusion\n12\n(Infinite Horizons Impactor), or na\u00efve mice were used with no injury.\nSurgeries were performed under ketamine (100.0\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg) anesthesia, and mice were given buprenorphine slow-release formulation (Buprenex SR; 1.0\u2009mg/kg), saline (1.0\u2009mL/day), and enrofloxacin (antibiotic; 5.0\u2009mg/kg) after SCI. Saline (1.0\u2009mL) and enrofloxacin (5.0\u2009mg/kg) were provided daily after injury for five consecutive days.

Data obtained for\nFigures 1\nand\n\u200b\nand2\n2\nof this article were collected from the same animals used for the data in Figures 2\u20134 and 5 (respectively) of our companion article. Animals from\nFig. 2A,B\nof this article were either given no treatment, or 250\u2009\u03bcL saline (\nip\n) as a vehicle for the experimental drug from our companion article.\n30\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nAge, sex, and spinal cord injury (SCI) increase immunoglobulin G (IgG) within the spinal cord at one and three days post-injury (dpi). The IgG 50- and 25-kD were detected on Western blots using secondary antibodies targeting mouse IgG. 14-month-old (MO) female mice had significantly more 50\u2009kD IgG compared with sham-injured-, age-, and sex-matched comparisons at both one dpi (\nA\n), and three dpi (\nD\n). After collapsing groups across sexes, 14-MO mice had significantly more 50\u2009kD IgG compared with 4-MO mice at both one dpi (\nB\n) and three dpi (\nE\n). After collapsing across ages, both males and females had a significant increase in 50\u2009kD IgG at both one dpi (\nC\n) and three dpi (\nF\n) with female mice having more 50\u2009kD IgG compared with male mice after SCI. Assessment of the 25\u2009kD IgG band revealed similar patterns as the 50\u2009kD band, specifically finding that older female mice had a significant injury- and age-induced increase in IgG at both one dpi and three dpi (\nG,J\n). Similarly, there was a main effect of age that, on collapsing across sexes, resulted in significant increases in 25\u2009kD IgG in 14- compared with 4-MO mice after SCI at both one dpi and three dpi (\nH,K\n). Similarly, a three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) did reveal a main effect of sex for 25\u2009kD IgG. In contrast to 50\u2009kD IgG, there was no difference between female- and male-injured mice (\nI,L\n). Analyses were performed using three-way ANOVA (A,D,G,J) using Sidak pairwise comparisons to assess differences between all groups deviating by one variable in both the three-way ANOVA design as well as after collapsing across sex or age.

To isolate spinal cords, mice were anesthetized using an overdose of ketamine (4.0\u20135.0\u2009mg) and xylazine (0.4\u20130.5\u2009mg), followed by transcardial perfusion using ice cold 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffer (PB) to remove blood within the circulation. Then 6.0\u2009mm of tissue, centered on the lesion epicenter, was isolated and immediately homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer in PB containing protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, EDTA-FREE; 11836170001; Sigma Aldrich). Homogenates were then sonicated on ice before addition of radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer, which does not contain sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS; 20-188; Sigma Aldrich). Samples were incubated in RIPA buffer for 20\u2009min before pelleting debris.\nProtein concentration was determined using bicystronic acid assays (BCA; 23225; ThermoFisher). All samples were diluted to 2.0\u2009mg/mL in Laemmli Buffer (1610747; Bio-Rad) prepared with 2-marcaptoethanol at a final concentration of 5%. Samples were boiled for 5\u2009min before allocation and storage at -80\u00b0C.\n\nWestern blotting\nWestern blots were performed under reducing conditions using pre-made 4\u201320% gradient gels (4561096; Bio-Rad). A total of 30\u2009mg of protein was loaded into each well, and samples were run in Tris/Glycine/SDS buffer (1610732; Bio-Rad) at 90\u2009mV for 30\u2009min, then 120\u2009mV until the indicator dye reached the bottom of the gel. Membranes were acclimated to the Tris/Glycine buffer (161073; Bio-Rad) containing 20% methanol for 15\u2009min before transferring onto nitrocellulose membranes (1620233; Bio-Rad) at 300\u2009mA for 90\u2009min.\nFor the first experiment (\nFig. 1\n), when more samples were run than available wells, multiple blots were performed with each blot having all groups represented on the blot, with one well containing a sample of liver protein on each blot to normalize transfer efficiencies. For the second experiment (\nFig. 2\n), all samples from within an age were run on separate blots because the intent was to identify injury effects. For both experiments, all blots within an experiment were run, transferred, stained, and imaged at the same time in the same conditions. After transfer, all blots were immersed in 5% milk dissolved in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 30\u2009min to block unspecific binding.\nPrimary antibodies were diluted in TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) and incubated at room temperature overnight, and secondary antibodies were also diluted in TBST and incubated for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Blots were washed 3\n\u00d7\nusing TBST after primary and secondary antibody incubations. Before imaging, blots were washed in TBS to remove residual Tween-20 that causes background on fluorescence imaging. Imaging of blots was performed using fluorescent development (Odyssey CLx; LI-COR Biosciences), and all blots within an experiment were imaged in the same exposure event.\nBecause these findings emerged incidentally with other ongoing work,\n30\nIgG bands were detected after probing for other primary antibodies. Specifically, for the first experiment (\nFig. 1\n), we evaluated for gamma-glutamyl cysteine ligase (GCLC; mouse anti-GCLC; 1:1,000; H00002729-M01; Novus Biologicals), which is observable at 70\u2009kD (not reported). Secondary antibodies against mouse IgG (1:10,000; goat anti-mouse IgG IRDye-680; LI-COR Biosciences) subsequently revealed the IgG bands of interest at 50 and 25\u2009kD. Both the 50- and 25-kD bands were used for analyses.\nFor the second experiment (\nFig. 2\n), hemoglobin was revealed using primary antibodies against hemoglobin (rabbit anti-hemoglobin; 1:1,000; PA5-97559; ThermoFisher Scientific) and detected at 14\u201316\u2009kD using fluorescent secondary antibodies (1:10,000; goat anti-rabbit IgG IRDye-800; LI-COR Biosciences). Because differences were found in hemoglobin in the second experiment, injured samples from the first experiment were run again to validate findings in a second cohort of mice.\nAfter imaging, blots were probed using a primary antibody against GAPDH as a housekeeping gene. Blots were incubated again overnight in primary antibody (rabbit anti-GAPDH; 1:5,000; ab9484; Abcam Co.) followed by secondary antibody incubation and fluorescent development as just described. For our second experiment that sought to identify hemoglobin within the injured spinal cords, IgG was revealed intentionally using only secondary antibodies targeting mouse IgG to reproduce findings on a second cohort of mice.\n\nStatistics\nOptical densities of blots were quantified using LI-COR Biosciences Image Studio Lite. First, the consistent liver sample on each blot was used to normalize values between blot densities, followed by normalizing signal intensities to the GAPDH housekeeping gene. The GAPDH intensities were normalized to a consistent value, followed by normalization of the gene of interest to the same proportion. For IgG values obtained at one and three days post-injury (dpi), male and female, 4- and 14-MO, sham and injured groups (\nn\n=\u20095/group) were evaluated using three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Because we were underpowered to detect all pairwise comparisons, effects of age or sex were also evaluated in collapsed groups.\nData from\nFig. 2\nwere detected as part of an ongoing experiment (\nn\n=\u20093-4/group for na\u00efve controls,\nn\n=\u20097/group for SCI-mice) that used all female mice of ages 4- and 14-MO at one dpi, so sex was not included as a biological variable. Evaluation of hemoglobin on the first cohort of mice was later performed and used only mice receiving SCI of both 4-MO and 14-MO, male and female mice. Detection of hemoglobin was evaluated using two-way ANOVA for both experiments. All pairwise comparisons were performed using the Sidak method of\npost hoc\ntesting. For all analyses, data were square root transformed to conform to heteroscedasticity of variance and normal distribution. Data are presented as square root transformed values. Alpha levels of\np\u2009=\n0.05 or less were considered significant."

This study was performed in accordance with the guideline by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania (protocol number: 806943). The care and handling of the animals in this study were in accord with the National Institutes of Health guidelines. There were seven pigs that were subjected to TBI by controlled cortical impact (CCI) device and five pigs subjected to Sham injury as previously described.\n20\nBriefly, animals underwent intramuscular injection of ketamine (20\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (2\u2009mg/kg). They were then intubated after induction with 4% inhaled isoflurane and maintained at 1% isoflurane during the operation. Pigs were then randomized into either TBI or Sham groups. They were subjected to central venous catheter (CVC) placement into cephalic veins, terminating in the superior vena cava. The CVC were then tunneled between the animals\u2019 scapula and securely left inside a jacket to be used over a course of 30 days for blood draws.\nPigs in the TBI group (\nn\n=\u20097) then underwent right frontoparietal craniotomy and CCI was performed at 0.7\u2009cm depth over the cortical rostral gyrus, reflecting mild-to-moderate focal contusion injury. However, pigs in the Sham injury group (\nn\n=\u20095) underwent only skin incision without craniotomy, with similar anesthetic dosages and exposure. After the operation, pigs were monitored for 24\u2009h to ensure normal recovery prior to return to animal housing. Blood samples were collected prior to the operation, then at 1\u2009h, 8\u2009h, and 24\u2009h after the operation. Subsequently, they were collected at 5 days, 10 days, 15 days, 20 days, and 30 days after the operation. Both Simoa and DTI analysis occurred in a blinded fashion, with the blood sample and imaging data processing by a blinded experimenter to the conditions of the experiments. The group designations were revealed only after the samples were processed to prevent subjective bias.\n\nNFL and GFAP immunoassay\nBlood samples were centrifuged at 4400\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 5\u2009min to isolate plasma samples. Then, plasma aliquots were stored in -80\u00b0C until analysis. We utilized a custom-made Simoa 2-plex assay for GFAP and NFL developed by Quanterix Corporation for our plasma biomarker analysis. The assay was run in house by the Human Immunology Core service available at the University of Pennsylvania using Simoa HD-1 Analyzer (Quanterix). Simoa detection of porcine GFAP has been validated by Quanterix as previously indicated.\n21\nTo confirm that porcine GFAP can be detected, we used a commercially available purified porcine GFAP (Millipore, AG230) and confirmed that 1:3 serial dilutions from 9000\u2009pg/mL to 1\u2009pg/mL standards resulted in corresponding changes in average number of enzymes per bead.\n\nDTI\nThe first magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with DTI sequence was performed at 24\u2009h from the time of injury, and repeated imaging was performed at 30 days after injury. Imaging was performed using a 3T Tim Trio whole\u2013body magnetic resonance scanner (Siemens, Germany) with 12-channel phased array head coil. Diffusion tensor imaging was performed using 64 noncollinear/noncoplanar directions with single-shot spin-echo, echo-planar imaging. The sequence parameters used were: repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u20094200\u2009msec, echo time (TE)\u2009=\u2009103\u2009msec, flip angle\u2009=\u2009180 degrees, bandwidth\u2009=\u20091186\u2009Hz/pixel, field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u2009192\u2009mm, slices thickness\u2009=\u20092\u2009mm, number of slices\u2009=\u200924, voxel size\u2009=\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009mm, b-values\u2009=\u20090, 1000, 2000, sec/mm\n2\n. Data were analyzed using track-based spatial statistics method using FSL software. Eddy current and motion induced distortions were corrected. After a composite skeleton of the entire group was made, region of interest (ROI) was drawn for anterior corpus callosum, splenium, ipsilateral (right), and contralateral (left) corona radiata by a blinded analyzer. For each ROI, FA and mean diffusivity (MD) values were calculated and compared between Sham and TBI groups. The voxel-wise map of DTI results was corrected for multiple comparisons. Although seven TBI animals were scanned, data from only six were used as one of the DTI scans was lost in data handling process. Data from all five Sham animals were used for this study. Example DTI scans are shown in\nSupplementary Figure S1\n.\n\nHistology\nAfter euthanasia, 5-mm coronal sections were fixed in 10% formalin for immunohistochemistry. The tissue sections underwent dehydration and were embedded in paraffin. Using a microtome, 10-\u03bcm sections were cut. Sections were then deparaffinized and rehydrated in ethanol at different concentrations. Antigen retrieval was performed in Tris\u2013ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid buffer, followed by 3% hydrogen peroxide block, and incubated in avidin biotin blocking kit. To label \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (\u03b2-APP), recombinant anti-amyloid precursor protein (Y188) was used at 1:10,000 (Abcam, AB32136) in 3% bovine serum albumin/1\u2009\u00d7\u2009phosphate-buffered saline/0.1% Triton-X for 1\u2009h. Then, anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody was used at 1:500 (Invitrogen, A16104) for 1\u2009h followed by BD 3,3'-diaminobenzidine substrate kit (BD 550880). Sections were then counterstained, dehydrated, clarified with xylenes, and cover-slipped. A pathologist (MH) who was blinded to the group assignment analyzed APP-stained slides, labeling them with the following scale: \u201c-\u201d for no staining, \u201c+\u201d for less than 3 \u03b2-APP positive spheroids, \u201c++\u201d for 3-10 \u03b2-APP positive spheroids, and \u201c+++\u201d for greater than 10 \u03b2-APP positive spheroids in a single 100\u2009\u00d7\u2009field. Example staining is shown in\nSupplementary Figure S2\n. Perilesional white matter, as well as ipsilateral and contralateral corona radiata were inspected.\n\nStatistical analysis\nSingle molecule array data was compared between Sham and TBI group at each time-point along the 30-day course using repeated measured Mann-Whitney U test. The DTI parameters (FA and MD) were also analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test for each white matter region and each time-point to compare Sham and TBI groups. Correlation between NFL and DTI or GFAP and DTI parameters were then inspected, using Spearman Rank correlation coefficient. For all tests in this study,\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered a significant cut-off value."

    "Methods": "Animals and ethical information\nAll procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke in accordance with policies and directives of the Canadian Council on Animal Care (Protocol no. 442-18). We obtained the current data set from four adult cats (>1 year of age at the time of experimentation), two females and two males, weighing between 3.5\u2009kg and 6.5\u2009kg (4.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6). Before and after the experiments, cats were housed and fed in a dedicated room within the animal care facility of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences at the Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke. Our study followed ARRIVE guidelines for animal studies.\n55\nAs part of our effort to reduce the number of animals used in research, some of the cats (Cats 1 and 3) were used in another study to answer a different scientific question.\n56\n\nGeneral surgical procedures\nSurgical procedures were performed under aseptic conditions with sterilized equipment in an operating room, as described previously.\n16\n,\n23\n,\n28\n,\n30\n,\n57\n,\n58\nBefore surgery, cats were sedated with an intramuscular injection of butorphanol (0.4\u2009mg/kg), acepromazine (0.1\u2009mg/kg), and glycopyrrolate (0.01\u2009mg/kg). Ketamine/diazepam (0.05\u2009mL/kg) was then administered with an intramuscular injection for induction. Cats were anesthetized with isoflurane (1.5\u20133%) delivered in O\n2\n, first with a mask and then with an endotracheal tube. During surgery, we adjusted isoflurane concentration by monitoring cardiac and respiratory rates, by applying pressure to the paw (to detect limb withdrawal), by assessing the size and reactivity of pupils, and by evaluating jaw tone.\nWe shaved the animal's fur (back, stomach, forelimbs and hindlimbs) using electric clippers and cleaned the skin with chlorhexidine soap. Cats received a continuous infusion of lactated Ringers solution (3\u2009mL/kg/h) during surgery through a catheter placed in a cephalic vein. A rectal thermometer monitored body temperature, which was maintained within physiological range (37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u00b0C) using a water-filled heating pad placed under the animal and an infrared lamp \u223c50\u2009cm over it.\nAt the end of surgery, we injected an antibiotic (cefovecin, 0.1\u2009mL/kg) subcutaneously and taped a transdermal fentanyl patch (25 mcg/h) to the back of the animal 2-3\u2009cm rostral to the base of the tail to provide prolonged analgesia (4-5\u2013day period). We also injected buprenorphine (0.01\u2009mg/kg), a fast-acting analgesic, subcutaneously at the end of the surgery and a second dose \u223c7\u2009h later. After surgery, we placed the cat in an incubator until it regained consciousness. We removed the fentanyl patch 5\u20137 days after surgery.\n\nImplantation of electrodes\nCats were implanted with electrodes to chronically record the activity (EMG) of several forelimb and hindlimb muscles. We directed pairs of Teflon-insulated multi-strain fine wires (AS633; Cooner Wire, Chatsworth, CA) subcutaneously from two head-mounted 34-pin connectors (Omnetics, Minneapolis, MN,). Electrodes were sewn into the belly of selected forelimb and hindlimb muscles for bipolar recordings, with 1-2\u2009mm of insulation stripped from each wire. We verified electrode placement during surgery by electrically stimulating each muscle through the matching head connector channel. The head connector was secured to the skull using dental acrylic.\nIn the present study, we used recordings from the following muscles: biceps brachii (BB, elbow flexor), biceps femoris anterior (BFA, hip extensor), biceps femoris posterior (BFP, knee flexor/hip extensor), the long head of the triceps brachii (TRI, elbow and shoulder extensor), lateral gastrocnemius (LG, ankle extensor/knee flexor), sartorius anterior (SRT, hip flexor/knee extensor), soleus (SOL, ankle extensor), and vastus lateralis (VL, knee extensor).\n\nSpinal transection\nAfter collecting data in the intact state (see below), a complete spinal transection (i.e., spinalization) was made at low thoracic levels. General surgical procedures were the same as described above. The skin was incised over the 12th and 13th thoracic vertebrae and, after carefully setting aside muscle and connective tissue, a small laminectomy of the dorsal bone was made. After exposing the spinal cord, we applied xylocaine (lidocaine hydrochloride, 2%) topically and made two to three injections within the spinal cord. We then completely transected the spinal cord with surgical scissors between the 12th and 13th thoracic vertebrae. We then cleaned the \u223c0.5-cm gap between the two cut ends of the spinal cord and stopped any residual bleeding.\nWe verified that no spinal cord tissue remained connecting rostral and caudal ends, which we later confirmed histologically. A hemostatic material (Spongostan) was inserted within the gap, and muscles and skin were sewn back to close the opening in anatomical layers. After spinalization, we manually expressed the cat's bladder and large intestine one to two times daily, or as needed. Cats were monitored daily by experienced personnel. The hindlimbs were cleaned as needed to prevent infection.\n\nExperimental protocol\nWe collected kinematic and EMG data before (intact state) and after cats recovered spontaneous quadrupedal locomotion after spinal transection (spinal state) during tied-belt (equal left-right speeds) locomotion from 0.4\u2009m/s to 0.8\u2009m/sec in 0.1\u2009m/sec increments. The treadmill consisted of two independently controlled running surfaces 120\u2009cm long and 30\u2009cm wide (Bertec, Columbus, OH). A Plexiglas separator (120\u2009cm long, 3\u2009cm high, and 0.5\u2009cm wide) was placed between the left and right belts to prevent the limbs from impeding each other. Data collection in the spinal state began between the 10th and 14th weeks after spinalization, depending on the locomotor recovery of the animals. During the recovery period after spinal transection, however, no task-specific training for quadrupedal locomotion was performed on a treadmill on any of the four cats.\nWe collected data from five to 30 consecutive step cycles using positive reinforcement (food, affection) in both intact and spinal states. To avoid fatigue, \u223c20\u2009sec of rest was given between episodes of locomotion. In the spinal state, all data were collected with manual stimulation of the skin of the perineal region. For perineal stimulation, the same experimenter (J. Harnie) manually pinched the perineal region (the skin under the tail) with the index finger and thumb. The strength of perineal stimulation is difficult to quantify but we adjusted the pressure applied to the perineal region on a case-by-case basis (light/strong, tonic/rhythmic) to achieve the best rhythmic behavior possible and to maximize support during stance.\n59\nWithout perineal stimulation, the hindlimbs simply dragged behind the body. If the perineal stimulation was too strong, we observed exaggerated flexion of the hindlimbs (hip, knee, and ankle) and/or improper left-right alternation, which impaired quadrupedal treadmill locomotion. In other words, too much excitability to spinal locomotor networks was detrimental. Perineal stimulation increases spinal excitability and facilitates hindlimb locomotion in spinal mammals through an undefined mechanism.\n58\nDuring data collection, the same experimenter (J. Harnie) held the tail of the animal to provide balance but did not provide weight support.\n\nData collection and analysis\nWe collected kinematic data as described previously.\n16\n,\n24\n,\n30\n,\n60\nReflective markers were placed on the skin over bony landmarks: the scapula, minor tubercle of the humerus, elbow, wrist, metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint, and at the tip of the toes for the forelimbs and over the iliac crest, greater trochanter, lateral malleolus, metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint, and at the tip of the toes for the hindlimbs. Videos of the left and right sides were obtained with two cameras (Basler AcA640-100\u2009g) at 60 frames/sec with a spatial resolution of 640\u2009\u00d7\u2009480 pixels. A custom-made program (Labview) acquired the images and synchronized acquisition with EMG data. EMG signals were pre-amplified (10\u2009\u00d7\u2009, custom-made system), bandpass filtered (30\u20131000\u2009Hz), and amplified (100\u20135000\u2009\u00d7\u2009) using a 16- channel amplifier (model 3500; A-M Systems).\nWe implanted more than 16 muscles per cat, so we obtained data in each locomotor condition twice, one for each connector, because our data acquisition system limits us to recording a maximum of 16 channels simultaneously. The EMG data were digitized (2000\u2009Hz) with a National Instruments card (NI 6032E, Austin, TX), acquired with custom-made acquisition software and stored on computer.\nTemporal variables\nBy visual detection, the same experimenter (J. Audet) determined, for all four limbs, paw contact as the first frame where the paw made visible contact with the treadmill surface and limb liftoff as the most caudal displacement of the toes.\nWe measured cycle duration from successive paw contacts, while stance duration corresponded to the interval of time from foot contact to the most caudal displacement of the toe/finger relative to the hip/shoulder.\n61\nWe calculated swing duration as cycle duration minus stance duration. We measured double support periods between homologous limbs (forelimbs and hindlimbs) from contact of the ipsilateral limb to liftoff (stance offset) of the contralateral limb (DS1) and from contact of the contralateral limb to liftoff of the ipsilateral limb (DS2).\n24\nThe DS1 and DS2 were then summed and divided by the cycle period of the reference limb.\nWe evaluated temporal interlimb coordination by measuring phase intervals between four pairs of limbs\n62\n: (1) left and right forelimbs (forelimb coupling), (2) left and right hindlimbs (hindlimb coupling), (3) left forelimb and left hindlimb (homolateral coupling), and (4) left forelimb and right hindlimb (diagonal coupling). Phase intervals were calculated as the absolute amount of time between contacts of two limbs divided by the cycle duration of the reference limb.\n62\u201367\nThe reference limb was always the forelimb, with the exception of hindlimb coupling. These values were then multiplied by 360 and expressed in degrees to illustrate their continuous nature and possible distributions.\n62\n,\n66\nTo determine whether spinal cats displayed greater variations in limb couplings, we calculated the coefficient of variation, a statistical measure of the relative dispersion of data points around the mean, by dividing the standard deviation by the mean. These values were then multiplied by 100 and expressed as a percentage.\nPostural characterization\nBy visual inspection of the videos obtained on the right side, we traced the silhouette of each animal from a representative cycle at the same scale at three key events of the locomotor cycle (liftoff, midswing, and contact of the right forelimb). To characterize the postural adjustments of the head and neck of individual cats during locomotion, the resulting silhouettes were then superimposed before (intact state) and after the recovery of spontaneous quadrupedal locomotion after spinal transection (spinal state). We then qualitatively described the differences between the two states.\nSpatial variables\nThe following spatial variables were analyzed using DeepLabCut\nTM\n, an open-source transfer learning program with deep neural network,\n68\nas we recently described in the cat.\n60\nStep length, defined as the anterior-posterior distance between the leading and trailing limbs at stance onset of the leading limb was measured for the forelimbs and hindlimbs.\n24\n,\n27\n,\n63\n,\n69\nThe left and right limbs were the leading and trailing limbs, respectively. Stride length was measured for the right forelimbs and right hindlimbs as the distance between contact and liftoff added to the distance traveled by the treadmill during the swing phase, obtained by multiplying swing duration by treadmill speed.\n60\n,\n63\n,\n70\u201372\n.\nWe measured the relative distance of the paw at contact and liftoff as the horizontal distance between the toe and shoulder or hip markers at stance onset and offset, respectively, for the right forelimb and right hindlimb, respectively. We measured limb interference as the horizontal distance between the toe markers of the forelimbs and hindlimbs on the same side at stance onset and offset of each of the four limbs of the animals.\nElectromyography\n. The same experimenter (J. Audet) determined burst onsets and offsets by visual inspection from the raw EMG waveforms using a custom-made program. Burst duration was measured from onset to offset. The onset and offset of some muscles, particularly those displaying two bursts per cycles, became clearer at faster speeds. As such, a few passes were made to accurately define the onsets and offsets of EMG bursts. We also measured the phasing of EMG burst onsets and offsets by calculating their timing in a normalized cycle.\n\nEuthanasia and histology\nAt the end of the experiments, cats were anesthetized with isoflurane before receiving a lethal dose (100\u2009mg/kg) of pentobarbital through the left or right cephalic vein. To confirm that spinal transection was complete in four cats, we performed histological analysis. Briefly, we removed a 2\u2009cm long segment of the spinal cord around the spinal lesion immediately after euthanasia. We then placed the spinal segment in 25\u2009mL of a 4% paraformaldehyde solution in 0.1\u2009M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution at 4\u00b0C. After 5 days, the spinal segment was cryoprotected in PBS with 30% sucrose for 72\u2009h at 4\u00b0C. Coronal sections of 50\u2009\u03bcm of the spinal cord were mounted on slides and stained with 1% cresyl violet. We then performed qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the injury site.\n\nStatistical analysis\nWe performed statistical analyses using IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 software. To determine the effects of locomotor state and speed on spatiotemporal and interlimb coordination dependent variables during quadrupedal tied-belt locomotion, we performed a two-factor repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) [(states: Intact, Spinal)\u2009\u00d7\u2009(speeds: from 0.4\u2009m/sec to 0.8\u2009m/sec)]. Significance level was set at\np\n<\u20090.05.\nThe Rayleigh test was performed to determine whether phase intervals shown in circular plots were randomly distributed, as described.\n62\n,\n63\n,\n73\n,\n74\nBriefly, we calculated the r value to measure the dispersion of phase interval values around the mean, with a value of 1 indicating a perfect concentration in one direction, and a value of 0 indicating uniform dispersion. To test the significance of the directional mean, we performed the Rayleigh z test: z\u2009=\nn\nr\n2\n, where\nn\nis the sample size (number of steps). The z value was then compared with a critical z value on the Rayleigh table to determine whether there was a significant concentration around the mean (\np\nvalue)."

    "Methods": "Animals, surgical procedures, and NACA delivery\nAll procedures were approved with the University of Kentucky's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. In total, data from\nn\n=\u2009202 mice were used for these studies. All mice were group housed at 3\u20135 mice per cage under normal light cycle. The 14-MO (\nn\n=\u200995; originally from Jackson Laboratories and maintained at Charles River Laboratories by the National Institute for Aging) and 4-MO (\nn\n=\u2009107; Jackson Laboratories) male and female C57/Bl6 mice were anesthetized using intraperitoneal (\nip\n) injections of ketamine (100.0\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (10.0\u2009mg/kg) and then received a surgical laminectomy followed by either 60 kDyn T9 contusion SCI (Infinite Horizons Impactor\n33\n) or laminectomy only (sham) as described previously.\n5\nMice received analgesic (Buprenex SR, 1.0\u2009mg/kg), antibiotic (Enrofloxacin, 5.0\u2009mg/kg), as well as saline (1.0\u2009mL/day for up to 5 days) after surgery. Bladders from all SCI mice were manually expressed 2x/day for the duration of the study. In addition to the data obtained from 202 mice, four additional mice died during surgery and one other was euthanized for being moribund at 48\u2009h post-SCI.\nMice of ages 4- and 14-MO were chosen as ages that represent two important benchmarks in clinical demographics. Specifically, 4-MO mice represent developmental stages corresponding to early adulthood in humans, which at 18\u201320 years old, is the most frequent age to receive an SCI.\n13\n,\n34\nThe 14-MO mice represent developmental stages corresponding to middle age, of which the average age at time of SCI in humans is 43 years of age.\n13\n,\n34\nThese ages were chosen to address concerns about the shift in demographics of SCI occurring at older ages since the 1970s and raise awareness about how modeling SCI in young rodents might not capture important physiological adaptations occurring during midlife aging. These age differences do not represent differences between young and elderly mice.\n\nProtein preparation\nAt 24- or 72-h post-injury, mice were again anesthetized with ketamine (4.0\u20135.0\u2009mg) and xylazine (0.4-0.5\u2009mg) and transcardially perfused with 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffer (PB). A 6.0-mm section of spinal cord centered on the injury site was isolated and mechanically homogenized in 0.1\u2009M PB containing protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, EDTA-FREE; 11836170001; Sigma Aldrich). Homogenates were sonicated on ice before addition of radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer without sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS; 20-188; Sigma Aldrich) and incubated for 20\u2009min with gentle agitation.\nHomogenates were centrifuged to pellet loose debris, and supernatants were allocated and frozen at -80\u00b0C or processed for Western blotting. The RIPA buffer was omitted when protein was isolated for GSH assessments to avoid lipidation of protein extract. Protein concentrations were assessed using bicistronic acid assay (BCA; 23225; ThermoFisher) and quantified against a standard curve prepared with bovine serum albumin (BSA).\n\nWestern and dot blotting\nProtein was prepared at 2.0\u2009mg/mL in Laemmli buffer (1610747; Bio-Rad) with a final 2-mercaptoethanol (M3148; Sigma Aldrich) concentration of 5%. Protein was boiled for 5\u2009min before loading 30\u2009mg of protein into gels. Pre-made 4\u201320% gradient gels (4561096; Bio-Rad) were used, and protein was separated under reducing electrophoretic conditions. Protein was tank transferred in Tris/Glycine buffer (161073; Bio-Rad) containing 20% methanol onto nitrocellulose membranes (1620233; Bio-Rad). Membranes were transferred to blocking buffer containing 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 30-min at room temperature.\nBlots were imaged using fluorescent development (Odyssey CLx; LI-COR Biosciences) and probed sequentially against GR (56\u2009kD; 1:2,000; ab124995; Abcam Co.) and GCLC (70\u2009kD; 1:1,000; H00002729-M01; Novus Biologicals), followed by GPx-1 (22\u2009kD; 1:1,000; VPA00488; Bio-Rad) and GSH Synthetase (56\u2009kD; 1:2,000; VMA00364; Bio-Rad), and finally against GAPDH (36\u2009kD; 1:5,000; ab9484; Abcam Co.). To account for having too many samples to fit onto a single blot, a sample of liver homogenate was loaded onto each gel and density differences between blots were used to normalize samples across blots.\n3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) or 4-hydroxy-nonenol (4-HNE) was assessed as a biomarker for free-radical damage generated downstream from ROS production.\n2\nTo assess 3-NT and 4-HNE, 2\u2009\u03bcL of protein (1\u2009mg/mL) was spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and allowed to dry overnight. Membranes were immersed in blocking buffer containing 5% BSA for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated in antibodies derived against 3-NT (1:2,000; 06-284; Millipore Sigma) or 4-HNE (1:1,000; HNE11-S; Alpha Diagnostic International) overnight at room temperature followed by incubation in fluorescent conjugated secondaries (1:10,000; goat anti-IgG IRDye-680 or goat anti-IgG IRDye-800; LI-COR Biosciences) for 1\u2009h before development.\nFor all Western blot and dot blot experiments\nn\n=\u20094\u20135 mice were used for each of the eight groups before combining sexes. When sexes were combined,\nn\n=\u20098\u201310 mice/group were used.\n\nGSH peroxidase and reductase assays\nProtein allocations derived from spinal cord homogenate obtained at one and three dpi were used at 30-mg/well in duplicate. Commercial kits were obtained to analyze total GPx activity (ab102530; Abcam Co.), as well as total GR activity (ab83461; Abcam Co.). Baseline densities were obtained before starting the colorimetric assays, and kinetic readings were used to assess catalytic rates. Standard curves of obtained values were generated, and sample values were interpolated against best fit curves using Prism (version 9). For both activity assays at each time point,\nn\n=\u20094-5 mice were used per group before combining sexes. When sexes were combined,\nn\n=\u20098\u201310 mice/group were used.\n\nGSH determination\nA housekeeping experiment was performed to determine at which time post-injury SCI exerted the greatest effects on GSH depletion. This first experiment utilized 4- and 14-MO, sham- and SCI-, female mice at both one and three dpi (\nn\n=\u20094\u20135) (\nSupplementary Fig. S1\n). Next, both sexes were included and 4- and 14-MO, male and female, sham and injured mice were used to determine effects of injury at three dpi (\nn\n=\u20094\u20135/group). Three dpi was chosen because it corresponded to the largest SCI-induced depletion in GSH from our first experiment.\nThe GSH content was assessed in tissue homogenate using deprotonated samples, with a starting concentration ranging from 0.67\u20131.2\u2009mg protein/mL depending on the experiment. For each experiment, all samples were diluted to the same final protein concentration. Samples were pre-treated using 1 volume 5% 5-sulfosalicylic acid (SSA) to remove protein and tested using commercially prepared GSH colorimetric detection kits (EIAGSHC; ThermoFisher). To distinguish total GSH from free GSH, GSSG was tested in allocations of the same samples that were pre-treated with 2-vinylpyridine to alkylate and block free GSH from reacting. Reaction densities were obtained using kinetic readings and interpolated against standard curves using a four-parameter logarithmic best fit equation.\n\nGSH augmentation\nTo determine whether age or injury affect GSH synthesis capacity after SCI, na\u00efve 4-MO female mice (\nn\n=\u20094) were treated with the cysteine analog NACA 1.5\u2009h before tissue extraction (150\u2009mg/kg/dose prepared at 150\u2009mg/mL in saline; NACA was a gift from Sentient Lifesciences, New York, NY\n9\n,\n25\n). Protein was isolated as described above and diluted to 1\u2009mg/mL for GSH analysis using colorimetric detection assays. For SCI animals, 4- and 14-MO female mice (\nn\n=\u20096\u20137/group) received SCI and were treated with 150\u2009mg/kg NACA starting immediately post-injury, 12\u2009h after SCI, and 24\u2009h after SCI. Spinal cords were harvested 1.5\u2009h after the last dose for GSH determination. Total and free GSH as well as GSSG and the GSH/GSSG ratios were determined.\n\nCysteine substitution with NACA as a treatment for SCI\nTreatment paradigm\nTo determine effects of cysteine replacement using NACA on long term outcomes after SCI, 4- and 14-MO female mice (\nn\n=\u200910) were given 60 kDyn SCI and treated immediately after injury with a booster injection of NACA (150\u2009mg/kg) or saline. Next, primed osmotic pumps (1003D; Alzet Inc.) were implanted that were calibrated to deliver saline or 150\u2009mg/kg/day of NACA for three days as published previously.\n9\nAt three days post-injury, mice were lightly anesthetized using isoflurane, and osmotic pumps were removed. Mice were examined for functional recovery for a total of 28 days after SCI. All behavioral and histological analyses were performed by experimenters who were blinded to group identities.\nLocomotor assessments\nLocomotor assessments were made using the horizontal ladder foot slip analyses\n35\nand during open field exploration using the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS\n36\n). The BMS utilizes a 9-point rating scale to characterize gross locomotor functions ranging from complete paralysis (score 0) to normal functions (score 9) as mice explore an open field for 4\u2009min. The BMS scores were obtained at one, three, seven, 14, 21, and 28\u2009dpi by two experimental raters who were blinded to treatment groups. The horizontal ladder was used to determine the extent of sensory-motor coordination and was performed both pre-SCI, and at 28\u2009dpi in mice capable of weight-supported stepping.\nVideo recordings were made of mice traversing the 1.0-m ladder, and events of foot slips below the ladder were counted. Foot slips were normalized to total steps taken by the respective hindlimb, and the average of both hindlimbs was taken for each trial. Three trials were used and averaged for each day of testing.\nThermal sensitivity\nThe Hargreave test of thermal hypersensitivity was used as described previously.\n37\n,\n38\nMice were acclimated to testing boxes for 2\u2009h/day for two days before testing and similarly acclimated for at least 1\u2009h before data acquisition. The Hargreave test was performed both pre-SCI as well as at 28\u2009dpi. An infrared beam that was calibrated to reach 55\u00b0C over 25\u2009sec was placed under the plantar surface of the hindpaws of mice as they were standing still. A deliberate flinch, indicated by an abrupt lifting and replacement of the paw, or picking up and licking of the paw, was counted as an intentional movement, and the duration of stimulation before the intentional movement was recorded.\nTrials where mice began walking without an explicit reaction to the heat were not considered valid and were discarded. The paws were given at least 2\u2009min of rest or longer before the next trial. In total, at least three trials were obtained per foot, and the obtained numbers were averaged for both feet to generate one score per subject per time point.\n\nHistology and immunohistochemistry\nAt 28\u2009dpi, mice were anesthetized using an overdose of ketamine (4.0\u20135.0\u2009mg) and xylazine (0.4\u20130.5\u2009mg) and euthanized via transcardial perfusion using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% formaldehyde made from paraformaldehyde prills (Millipore Sigma). Spinal cords were extracted and post-fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 2\u2009h at room temperature before being transferred to 0.1\u2009M PB overnight. Spinal cords were acclimated to 30% sucrose for dehydration, embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature-Compound (OCT), and frozen on dry ice. Tissue was blocked together with at least one cord from each group randomly selected and placed per block. Blocks were sectioned coronal at 10\u2009\u03bcm thickness with every 10th section being collected per slide.\nTissue sparing and neuron survival were assessed in sequential sets of tissue. Tissue sparing was assessed by immunolabeling against neurofilament-200\u2009kD (1:1,500: Ck x NF200; NFH; Aves Labs) and counterstained using eriochrome cyanine to evaluate white matter as described previously.\n11\nNeuron survival was assessed by immunolabeling against neuronal-specific nuclei (1:4,000; Rb x NueN; NBP1-77686; Novus Biologicals). Primary antibodies were targeted using biotinylated secondary antibodies against the host species (1:500, goat anti-chicken, BA9010, or goat anti-rabbit, BA-1000; Vector Laboratories) followed by incubation using avidin biotin complex (ABC; 1:200; PK-6100; Vector Laboratories) and developed using 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) with or without nickel.\nAll sections received antigen retrieval at 80\u00b0C in sodium citrate buffer with 0.1% Tween-20 (pH 6.0) for 5\u2009min, were then treated with 0.3% H\n2\nO\n2\nin 40% methanol in PBS to quench endogenous peroxidase activity for 30\u2009min, then incubated in 5% normal goat serum in PBS/0.1% Triton-X 100 for 1\u2009h at room temperature before primary antibody incubation overnight at room temperature. Stained slides were dehydrated using graded ethanol dilutions, cleared using Histoclear (101412-878; VWR Scientific), and coverslipped using Permount (SP15-500; Fisher Scientific). Slides were imaged using Axioscan (model Z1, Carl Zeiss AG., Oberkochen, GE) at 20x magnification and visualized and quantified using Halo software (Indica Labs, Albuquerque, NM).\nTo assess tissue sparing, the white matter and intact gray matter were traced in each section within 700\u2009mm rostral and caudal to the lesion epicenter. The lesion epicenter was objectively determined as the section containing the least amount of spared tissue. All analyzed sections were oriented with respect to this objectively defined epicenter. To account for size differences between 4- and 14-MO spinal cords, the total spared tissue was divided by the total tissue area to get a percent spared tissue.\nTo analyze spared neurons, a cell-counting algorithm was created on Halo and applied to all stained sections as described previously.\n11\nThe cell-counting algorithm allows for distinguishing cells based on size, morphology, and staining density and applies the standards consistently across all sections in all samples. Neurons in the ventral horns were counted by limiting the analysis view to all neurons below the central canal. Every section up to 700\u2009mm rostral and caudal to the lesion epicenter was counted.\n\nStatistics\nThree-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for Western blots, dot blots, activity assays, and GSH assays to determine main effects of injury, sex, and age as well as to screen for significant interactions. If there were no significant sex-by-age or sex-by-injury interactions or main effects of sex, data from both sexes were collapsed, and two-way ANOVAs were performed against injury and age. If sex effects were found, data from both ages were collapsed, and a two-way ANOVA was performed against injury and sex. When significant sex-by-age interactions were detected, pair-wise comparisons against all groups were performed to evaluate for injury effects within a group. Otherwise, pair-wise comparisons were made across collapsed groups.\nFor GSH determination after NACA treatment, only female mice of ages 4- and 14-MO were used, which was assessed using two-way ANOVA. Mice in NACA treated experiments were performed in cohorts of a single age, so data were either normalized to the average of vehicle-treated mice to control for batch-to-batch variability or assessments were limited within a single age. Two-way ANOVA was used to compare between-group effects in horizontal ladder, Hargreave test, tissue sparing at the lesion epicenter, and neuron survival.\nTwo-way repeated-measures ANOVA was used to evaluate total tissue sparing throughout the length of the analyzed lesion (distance x group), and individual two-way ANOVAs were performed to assess effects of NACA on BMS scores and BMS subscores (time x group). The Sidak pairwise comparisons were used as a\npost hoc\ntest when appropriate. Significant \u03b1 levels were set to less than or equal to\np\nvalues of 0.05."

    "Methods": "Experimental design\nAnimals in each litter were randomly assigned to receive a closed head brain injury (\nn\n=\u200978) or were treated as sham-injured controls (\nn\n=\u200974). Sham- and brain-injured animals from a subset of litters were randomly assigned to receive a microinjection into the DH containing a GR-expressing lentivirus (\nn\n=\u200948) or control lentivirus (\nn\n=\u200944). Animals were tested beginning at 1 month after injury in the MWM (spatial learning/memory) and spatial object recognition test (spatial memory). Behavioral testing was performed in adolescent rats (38\u201350 days old) because of our previous findings demonstrating sustained cognitive deficits at 1 month following TBI in neonate rats.\n17\n,\n40\nMoreover, cognitive and behavioral symptoms following TBI in infants and toddlers can become more noticeable as they age into adolescence,\n41\n,\n42\nvalidating that this is a clinically relevant time point for assessing post-traumatic cognitive impairments. At the end of behavioral assessments, subgroups of animals were randomly assigned to generate tissue for histological analysis, long-term potentiation, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), or Western blots.\n\nTBI\nSurgical procedures were performed in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Drexel University and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guide for the care and use of Laboratory animals (NIH Publications No. 8023, revised 1978). Raghupathi and Huh\n17\noriginally characterized the pediatric injury model used in this study, which has been used in multiple subsequent studies.\n40\n,\n43\n,\n44\nTimed-pregnant (E20) dams were ordered from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington MA) and housed under 12\u2009h light:12\u2009h dark conditions with access to food and water\nad libitum\n. On post-natal day 11 (the neurological equivalent of a child <4 years of age,\n45\u201347\nmale and female Sprague Dawley rat pups were anesthetized using isoflurane (Patterson Veterinary, Greeley CO, 5% induction, 2\u20133% maintenance), and an incision of 2\u2009cm was made to expose the skull. Animals were then transferred to a plastic rodent restrainer (Braintree Scientific, Braintree MA, USA) and moved onto the stage of an electronic controlled cortical impact device (eCCI, Custom Design and Fabrication, Richmond VA, USA). The impactor tip (5\u2009mm diameter) was positioned over the left parietal cortex midway between the bregma and lambda sutures and was driven into the intact skull at a velocity of 5\u2009m/sec (3\u2009mm distance from zero point, 100\u2009ms dwell time). After receiving the impact, animals were placed on their backs and the time to right themselves (righting reflex) and time to return to normal breathing (apnea) were recorded. Animals were then re-anaesthetized, and the presence of a skull fracture and hematoma were recorded prior to the scalp being sutured closed. The severity of the hematoma was determined based on the degree and extent of discoloration at or around the site of impact, and was characterized as mild, moderate, or severe, as previously described.\n48\nSham-injured animals were surgically prepared but were not injured. Animals were allowed to recover in a separate cage before being placed back with the dam. Surgical procedures and recovery were performed on heating pads at 37\u00b0C to maintain the body temperature.\n\nLentivirus injections\nThe lentivirus plasmid encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-glucocorticoid receptor was subcloned into a modified pCSC-SP-PW-GFP (Addgene plasmid # 12337, a gift from Inder Verma).\n49\nThe modified plasmid, pBOB-mcs, was created by removal of the GFP by restriction digestion using XbaI/PmeI sites and subcloning of a multiple cloning site 5\u2032 TCTAGAGGATCCACCGGTGGCCGCCTGGGCCCGTTAACGTCTCGAGTTTAAAC 3\u2032 into the XbaI/PmeI sites. The GFP-glucocorticoid receptor was then cut from pEGFP-GR (Addgene plasmid # 47504, a gift from Alice Wong) using the restriction sites NheI/BamHI and subcloned into the XbaI/BamHI sites of pBOB-mcs. Successful clones were isolated and verified by DNA sequencing (GENEWIZ, South Plainfield, NJ) and Western blot analyses. Viral stocks were generated by calcium-phosphate transfection of 293T cells with plasmid encoding either pBOB-EGFP-GR or pBOB-GFP plus Mb1, Rev and vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV G)-plasmid encoding envelope glycoprotein. The supernatants were collected 72\u2009h after transfection and concentrated by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Purified virus was suspended in Tris buffer containing rat albumin and mannitol, aliquoted, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until further use. Lentiviral titers were estimated using a commercially available p24 ELISA kit (HIV-1 p24 antigen ELISA, Aalto, Ireland). The lentiviral titers for the GFP-GR lentivirus and GFP-control lentiviruses were 1.81\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n7\nviral particles/\u03bcL and 3.19\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n7\nviral particles/\u03bcL, respectively. Both viruses were prepared by the Dr. George Smith Lab (Temple University, Philadelphia, PA). The GFP-GR lentivirus or GFP-control lentivirus was unilaterally microinjected into the left DH (1\u2009\u03bcL delivered at 0.2\u2009\u03bcL/min) on post-natal day 18, 1 week following TBI or sham surgery, to allow the animals time to recover. The coordinates used for the injection were (in mm) -2.5\u2009A/P, +2.75\u2009M/L, and -3.25 D/V.\n\nMWM\nSpatial learning was assessed in the MWM between 5 and 6 weeks post-injury as previously described.\n48\nTesting was conducted between 8:00 and 10:00 AM on each day. The maze consisted of a 1-m diameter circular pool containing 18\u00b0C water made opaque with white non-toxic paint. The length of time taken (latency) and the distance traveled to reach a submerged, hidden platform were recorded. The platform was submerged 2\u2009cm below the surface of the water. Rats were initially placed in the center of the pool and guided to fixed start points located around the periphery of the pool. Visual cues were placed around the pool to help animals locate the hidden platform. Each animal was exposed to four trials/day over four consecutive training blocks (16 total trials). If an animal did not reach the platform within 120\u2009sec, a latency of 120\u2009sec was recorded for that trial. The average latency to reach the platform was averaged among the four trials on each training day, and data are presented as a function of training day to demonstrate the \u201clearning curve.\u201d\nAt 24\u2009h following the final training day, spatial memory was tested in two probe trials during which the platform was removed from the maze. Animals went through two probe trials that consisted of 120\u2009sec each, with an inter-trial interval of \u223c15\u2009min. Animals were placed in the pool in the same manner as they were during training. Probe trials were recorded with an overhead camera and the time spent in various zones surrounding either the platform location or the perimeter of the maze was computed (AccuScan, San Diego Instruments, San Diego CA, USA). The scores received in the two probe trials were averaged for each animal and presented as time spent in the platform or periphery zone.\n\nTissue preparation for extracellular recordings\nLTP was measured in the DH after the conclusion of behavioral testing (5\u20137 weeks post-injury; post-natal day 48\u201360). Rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of Euthasol (100\u2009mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with 60\u2009mL of carboxygenated (5% CO\n2\n, 95% H\n2\n0) slicing artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) consisting of the following (in mM): 126 NaCl, 10 glucose, 26 NaHCO\n3\n, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 5 MgCl\n2\n, and 1 CaCl\n2\n, pH of 7.4. Brains were then rapidly removed and glued to the slicing stage of a vibrating microtome (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL), and 400\u2009\u03bcM horizontal slices containing the DH were obtained between 3 and 4.5\u2009mm from the dorsal surface. Slices were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1\u2009h in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing the following (in mM): 126 NaCl, 10 glucose, 26 NaHCO\n3\n, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 1 MgCl\n2\n, and 2 CaCl\n2\n, pH 7.4. Brain slices were then kept at room temperature for at least 1\u2009h prior to recording.\n\nField potential recording and LTP quantification\nBrain slices were individually transferred to a recording chamber and continually perfused with oxygenated aCSF maintained at 34\u00b0C. The Schaffer Collateral pathway was stimulated with a bipolar electrode and excitatory field post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded in the stratum radiatum (SR) of area CA1 using borosilicate glass pipettes filled with aCSF (resistance 1\u20132\u2009M\u03a9). Signals were acquired using an axon MultiClamp 700A amplifier and pClamp 9.2 data acquisition software (Molecular Devices), digitized using a DigiData 1332A digitizer (Molecular Devices) at 10\u2009kHz, and low pass filtered at 1kHz. Input/output (I/O) curves were conducted using stimulation intensities from 10 to 80\u2009V (duration\u2009=\u20090.2\u2009ms), and the stimulation level that produced the half maximal response was used. Baseline field potentials were recorded every 30\u2009sec for 20\u2009min. If a stable baseline was obtained, LTP was induced by theta-burst stimulation, consisting of 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009100\u2009Hz bursts (5 pulses per burst, 200\u2009ms inter-burst interval) at the test pulse intensity, which was repeated four times (10\u2009sec interval in between each series of bursts). Field potentials were subsequently recorded every 30\u2009sec for 60\u2009min. The amplitude of the field potentials was measured in Clampfit 10.5 (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA), and reported as the percent change from baseline measurements (average of the last 10 responses prior to Theta Burst Stimulation [TBS]). Potentiation was assessed from fEPSPs evoked 10 and 60\u2009min after high frequency stimulation (HFS) (average of 10 responses taken at each time point).\n\nHistological confirmation of lentivirus expression\nA subset of animals was transcardially perfused at 4 weeks following injury using 0.9% saline containing heparin (1000 units/L, Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Schaumburg, IL, USA) followed by 10% formalin (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Brains were post-fixed in formalin for 24\u2009h before being transferred to a cryoprotective solution containing 30% sucrose. Brains were frozen between -40 and -50\u00b0C and 40\u2009\u03bcM coronal sections were obtained between 2\u2009mm and 8\u2009mm posterior to bregma using a freezing sliding microtome. Sections were incubated in anti-GFP (1:500; Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) at 4\u00b0C for 16\u201324\u2009h, and were incubated in an anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 2\u2009h at room temperature. Sections were then mounted on gelatin-coated glass slides and cover-slipped using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) mounting medium. GFP expression was visualized in three non-adjacent dorsal hippocampal sections per animal using a fluorescent microscope.\n\nqRT-PCR\nA subset of animals was used to harvest tissue from the hippocampus for qRT-PCR analysis immediately following the 1st day of training in the MWM. The DH was micro-dissected from coronal sections taken between 2\u2009mm and 4\u2009mm posterior to bregma and stored in RNA-Later (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis MO, USA) until processed. The ventral hippocampus (VH) was taken between 5\u2009mm and 7\u2009mm posterior to bregma. As described previously,\n40\n,\n50\nthe RNA from the tissue was extracted using a RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc.) along with DNase 1 (Qiagen Inc.). RNA yields were measured with a NanoDrop Lite spectrophotometer (Thermo Electron North America LLC, Madison WI, USA) and resulted in A\n260\n/A\n280\nratios of 2.0\u20132.1, indicating high purity. RNA was converted to cDNA using SuperScript\n\u00ae\nVILO\u2122 Master Mix (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) in a SimpliAmp\u2122 Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA). Triplicate samples of cDNA, SYBR Green PCR reagent (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY, USA), and target primer or cyclophilin primer were run on a 96-Well MicroAmp\n\u00ae\nFast Optical Reaction Plates (Applied Biosystems). The protocol was set to be 2\u2009min at 50\u00b0C, 10\u2009min at 95\u00b0C, 40 cycles of 15\u2009sec at 95\u00b0C, and 1\u2009min at 60\u00b0C. Primers were designed using the NCBI primer design tool (\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/\n) and purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific. The primers were validated by testing primer dilutions against a series of cDNA dilutions and determining the efficiency of the standard curve [10^(-1/slope)], as well as running a melting curve analysis to confirm primer specificity. The concentration and sequences of the primers used are listed in\nTable 1\n.\nTable 1.\nPrimers Used for Analysis of mRNA Expression in the Dorsal Hippocampus of Sham- and Brain-Injured Rats\nGene\nAccession number\nConcentration (nM)\nForward\nReverse\nCyc\nNM_017101.1\n200\nGTGTTCTTCGACATCACGGCT\nCTGTCTTTGGAACTTTGTCTGCA\nGR (rat)\nNM_053859.2\n200\nAACATGTTAGGTGGGCGTCA\nAGTTTCTGAAGCCTGGTATCGC\nMR (rat) (rat)\nNM_053427.1\n200\nAGAAAGGTGCTCACGACGTT\nGCCAGTCACACCATTGGAGA\nSgk1\nNM_001193568.1\n50\nTCAGGAGCCCGAACTTATGAA\nGGACCCAGGTTGATTTGTTGA\nGR (human) (human)\nNM_000176.3\n50\nGGACCACCTCCCAAACTCTG\nGCTGTCCTTCCACTGCTCTT\nGluA1\nNM_031608.1\n200\nGAAATGTGCAGTTCAACGAGAAAG\nTTTCGGATTCCATCATGTTTCAT\nGluA2\nNM_017261.2\n200\nCTACCAATGGGACAAGTTCG\nCAGGATTACACGCCGTT\nGluN1\nNM_001270602.1\n100\nCACCAGACTAAAGATAGTGACAATCCA\nCCTCTTTGCATGTCCCATCA\nGluN2A\nNM_012573.4\n100\nAGGACAGCAAGAGGAGCAAG\nACCTCAAGGATGACCGAAGA\nGluN2B\nNM_012574.1\n200\nTGAGTGAGGGAAGAGAGAGAGG\nATGGAAACAGGAATGGTGGA\nOpen in a separate window\nAll sequences are listed as 5\u2032-3\u2032.\nCyc, cyclophilin-A; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; MR, mineralocorticoid receptor; Sgk1; serum-and-glucocorticoid inducible kinase 1; GluA1, glutamate ionotropic receptor \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) type subunit 1; GluA2, glutamate ionotropic receptor AMPA type subunit 2; GluN1, glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit 1; GluN2A, glutamate ionotropic receptor\nN\n-\nmethyl-\nd\n-aspartate (NMDA) type subunit 2A; GluN2B, glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit 2B.\n\nCorticosterone analysis\nTrunk blood was collected from animals immediately after the fourth trial on the 1st day of MWM training. Blood samples were centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 10\u2009min at 2000\ng\n, after which the blood serum was collected into a separate tube for analysis. Corticosterone was measured by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry modified from a previously reporter steroid assay.\n51\nBriefly, 5-20\u2009\u03bcL of sample was spiked with 50\u2009\u03bcL of 100\u2009pg/ \u03bcL d3-corticosterone in methanol. Samples were extracted by liquid-liquid extraction by addition of 250\u2009\u03bcL of water, 150\u2009\u03bcL of saturated sodium chloride in water, 10\u2009\u03bcL of HCl, and 1.3\u2009mL of methyl-tertbutyl-ether and vortexed for 10\u2009min. Phases were separated with 5\u2009min of centrifugation at 2000\ng\n, the lower layer was frozen at -80\u00b0C and the supernatant transferred to a new tube and then evaporated to dryness under nitrogen gas. Extracts were derivatized using Girard P reagent by adding 200\u2009\u03bcL of 10% (v/v) acetic acid in water, 20\u2009\u03bcL of Girard P reagent at 1\u2009mg/mL in water, vortex mixing for 10\u2009sec, incubation for 10\u2009min at 60\u00b0C, evaporation to dryness under nitrogen gas, and resuspension in 100\u2009\u03bcL of 80:20 (v/v) methanol:water. Ten microliters of each sample were analyzed on an Ultimate 3000 HPLC coupled to a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer. The double charged doubly derivatized form of corticosterone was predominantly observed and was used for peak integration. Calibration curves were prepared in an identical manner to the samples, spanning 3.9\u201362.5\u2009pg/\u03bcL and 15\u20135000\u2009pg/\u03bcL to provide linear ranges for interpolation of sample concentration.\n\nWestern blot analysis\nBrain tissue was homogenized in lysis buffer A (10mM Hepes, 1.5mM MgCl2, 10mM KCl, 0.5mM DTT, 0.05% NP40, 0.05M sodium vanadate) adding one tablet of Complete Protease Inhibitor (ThermoScientific, Pierce Protease Inhibitor Mini Tablets, A32953) per 10\u2009mL lysis buffer A. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 3000\ng\nfor 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and kept as the cytoplasmic fraction (CF). The resulting pellet was re-suspended with equal volume of lysis buffer B (5mM Hepes, 1.5\u2009mM MgCl2, 0.2mM EDTA, 0.5mM DTT, 26% glycerol, 300\u2009mM NaCl) and sat on ice for 30\u2009min. After centrifugation (20,000\ng\n, 20\u2009min, 4\u00b0C) the supernatant was collected and kept as the nuclear fraction (NF). Protein concentration was measured by Bio-Rad DC protein assay using TCAN Plate Reader, after which the supernatant of both the NFs and CFs were denatured in 80% sample buffer (125mM Tris, 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], 0.005% bromophenol blue, 20% glycerol), 20% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (BME) and boiled for 5\u2009min. Samples were separated by SDS electrophoresis (Mini-PROTEAN 11 Cell chamber, Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA) in 4\u201320% polyacrylamide gel (GenScript SurePAGE, Bis-Tris, 10\u2009\u00d7\u20098\u2009cm). Electrophoresis was performed in a Tris-MOPS-SDS (50mM Tris Base, 50mM MOPS, 0.1% SDS, 1\u2009mM EDTA, pH 8.5) electrophoretic running buffer (GenScript, Cat.No.:M00138) at a voltage of 100\u2009V. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a 0.2\u2009\u03bcm polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (BioRad Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer Pack, Cat#1704156) using Bio-Rad Trans-Blot Turbo Transferring System at a current of 1.3\u2009A, 25\u2009V, for 7\u2009min.\nMembranes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C on a rotary platform with the following antibodies: HMGCR (rabbit monoclonal, dilution 1:1000, ab183127; Abcam, Cambridge MA, USA) and secondary (goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody, dilution 1:30,000 Licor IRDye 800CW). The membrane containing CF samples were then incubated, as detailed, with anti-actin, clone C4 (mouse monoclonal, dilution 1:5000 Chemicon MAB1501R) and secondary (goat anti-mouse IgG antibody, dilution 1:30,000, Licor IRDye 680CW). The membrane containing NF samples were then incubated, as detailed, with Lamin A/C (mouse monoclonal, dilution 1:1000 Active Motif AB_2793218) and secondary (goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin [Ig]G antibody, dilution 1:30,000, Licor IRDye 680CW). Fluorescent detection was visualized using the Li-Cor system. The staining intensity of the bands corresponding to the analyzed proteins was assessed by using Image Studio 5.2.5 (Li-Cor).\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM). All statistical tests were performed using Statistica 7 (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK, USA). All data sets were confirmed to contain a normal distribution and homogenous variances, as indicated by a Shapiro\u2013Wilk and Levene's test, respectively. An independent samples\nt\ntest was used for comparisons between two means. For comparisons between more than two means, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used. For comparisons between more than two means across multiple time points or conditions, a repeated measures ANOVA (RMANOVA) was used (e.g., I/O responses in the CA1 hippocampus). Correlation analysis was used to quantify the strength of the relationship between two independent variables (e.g., hippocampal sgk1 mRNA vs. latency to platform). Post-hoc tests, when necessary, were conducted using the Neuman\u2013Keuls correction. In all cases, a\np\nvalue <0.05 was considered significant."

(For a description of all GOSE levels, see Nelson and colleagues\n17\n.) Only patients classified as Vegetative State (2)* or better were included in this study, because GOSE interview questions were only relevant and scored for TBI survivors. We limited the sample to survivors for two reasons. First, there are no item responses for people who died. Second, we conceptualized the IRT model as placing individuals along a latent continuum of disability, and we do not consider death to be a floor level of disability; rather, we consider it a conceptually distinct category. For these reasons, the IRT scoring approach as described here is limited to survivors.\nThe TRACK-TBI used the structured interview of the GOSE,\n4\nwhich queries individuals with TBI or informants about changes since pre-injury across seven domains. We say \u201cdomain\u201d to refer to each content area of the interview; domains are assessed with 1\u20133 semi-structured interview questions. The measure is scored such that impairment in each domain is associated with a rationally derived disability level, and the lowest score across all domains is used as the overall GOSE (GOSE-Ordinal) score.\nAs described by Boase and associates,\n19\nall interview variables were curated through a central review process to minimize missing and inaccurate data and as a tool to maximize consistency in interview practices across sites and examiners. Some questions were either omitted or recoded before IRT analysis; these details can be found in\nSupplementary Table 1\n. For the present study, we refer to the recoded questions as items, and it is responses to these items that are used in subsequent analyses.\nWe scored all items such that higher scores indicated more severe levels of functional disability. The second (Independence at Home) and third (Independence Outside the Home) domains, which each consist of two dichotomous-response items (2a, 2b, 3a, and 3b), were combined into a single item with a 3-point ordinal scale.\n+\nResponses to two-part questions within the domains of Work, Social and Leisure Activities, and Family and Friendship were collapsed into 3-point or 4-point ordinal items, reflecting all possible outcomes for each domain. The final domain, Return to Normal Life, asks whether any remaining injury-related problems exist (Yes/No).\nFor the present study, we used GOSE responses that reflected any change in functioning/participation from injury, regardless of whether it occurred because of TBI or peripheral injuries. With the exception of the Work item (which did not apply to 14% of the sample), the percentages of item-level missing data were very small (<0.1%).\n\nCriterion variables\nOther injury-related variables and three-month outcome measures were used in criterion validity analyses. The TBI severity was measured by the Glasgow Coma Scale and the presence versus absence of acute intracranial findings on computed tomography scans (CT+/-). Self-reported mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)-related and psychological symptoms were assessed using the Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire\n20\n(RPQ) and the 18-item Brief Symptom Inventory\n21\n,\n22\n(BSI-18) Global Severity Index (GSI). Quality of life was measured with the Quality of Life after Brain Injury Overall Scale\n23\n(QOLIBRI-OS) and the Satisfaction With Life Scale\n24\n(SWLS). Missing data percentages were under 10% for all outcome variables.\n\nStatistical analyses\nWe used a unidimensional IRT model, which assumes that GOSE items reflect a single latent variable (injury-related disability) that sufficiently captures individual differences; the relationship between the latent variable and item responses is modeled with an item response function. As described above, the items submitted for analysis included both a binary item (Return to Normal Life) and several polytomous (3\u20134 category) items. A common IRT model for binary responses is the two-parameter logistic (2PL), for which each item is characterized by a discrimination (\na\nj\n) and a threshold parameter (\nb\nj\n).\nDiscrimination describes the relationship between the item and the latent variable, such that the larger the discrimination, the better the item is able to differentiate among levels of disability. A threshold (also called difficulty) reflects the location on the disability continuum where a respondent has 0.5 probability of endorsing the item. Items with higher thresholds are associated with more severe disability.\nThe graded response model (GRM) is a generalization of the 2PL model that allows for the estimation of discrimination and threshold parameters for items with more than two ordered response categories (e.g., Social Activities). Like the 2PL model, the GRM estimates a discrimination parameter for each item, (\na\nj\n), but unlike the 2PL model, it estimates multiple category-specific threshold parameters for each item. The threshold parameter for category\nk\n(\nb\nj\nk\n) describes the location on TBI-related disability where a respondent has a 0.5 probability of endorsing that category or a more severe one. As is true of the 2PL model, items with higher threshold parameters are associated with more severe disability.\nAn attractive feature of IRT is that it yields an information function for each item, which indicates how precisely the item can measure individual differences along all points of the TBI-related impairment continuum. Items with larger discrimination parameters provide more information (i.e., greater precision) than those with smaller discriminations; the amount of information an item provides is greatest near its threshold parameter(s).\n25\nThe sum of the item information functions yields a test information function, which helps summarize how well an entire set of items measures individual differences across levels of disability. Importantly, test information can be thought of as an inverse function of the standard error of measurement from classical test theory, but unlike the standard error of measurement, which is a constant, the test information function varies across the range of the latent variable. Thus, IRT allows us to pinpoint where on the TBI-related impairment continuum the items measure individual differences with the greatest precision.\nA further benefit of IRT is that we can compute an IRT scale score and standard error for each respondent. Rather than simply adding responses to obtain a single summed score with the same standard error for everyone in the sample, we can estimate the error around the scale score for each individual's specific response pattern.\nWe fit a unidimensional IRT model to the item responses at three months, using a hybrid 2PL-GRM model. The model uses full information maximum likelihood estimation, which includes participants with item-level missingness and is robust to missing at random (MAR) data. Fit statistics for this model indicate good fit (\nG\n2\n=\u2009313.18,\np\n=\u20090.04, RMSEA\u2009=\u20090.01)\n#\n. An assumption of IRT is that after accounting for the latent variable, no relationships remain among pairs of items\u2014otherwise, items are said to exhibit local dependence.\n26\nWe evaluated this assumption using \u03c7\n2\nlocal dependence statistics after fitting the model, paying particular attention to item pairs with \u03c7\n2\nvalues greater than 10. There was some evidence that the Return to Normal Life item shares local dependence with the Family and Friendship (\u03c7\n2\n=\u200916.6) and Independence items (\u03c7\n2\n=\u200915.6); however, because these statistics were not unusually large and our goal was to preserve all original GOSE items in some form, we kept all items intact. The IRT-estimated functional impairment scale scores (GOSE-IRT, computed as response pattern-based\nexpected a posteriori\nscores or EAPs) and standard errors were computed from the parameter estimates of the final model. All IRT analyses were conducted using IRTPRO.\n27\nTo evaluate the degree to which IRT-GOSE scores may offer improvement over GOSE-Ordinal scores in terms of criterion validity, we compared dependent robust Spearman or Pearson correlations between GOSE and other measures (injury severity, neuropsychological function, quality of life) using a percentile bootstrap as described by Wilcox.\n28\nWe selected this approach because of the non-normality of the standard GOSE-Ordinal scores. Correlational analyses were performed using the twoDcorR R function developed by Wilcox.\n28\nAt the time of this writing, twoDcorR requires complete cases; analytical samples ranged from 1392 to 1410 for correlational analyses."

    "Methods": "Mouse models\nThree mouse models were used to study the impact of BDEVs on vascular regulation and CBF: fluid percussion injury (FPI; Supplementary Methods and Results), controlled cortical impact (CCI), and adaptive transfer. We have extensively used the FPI model to study TBI-induced coagulopathy.\n9\n,\n30\nIn addition, we also subjected mice to injury induced by CCI\n31\nto validate data obtained from FPI mice. Briefly, an anesthetized adult male C57BL/6J mouse (12\u201316 weeks and 22\u201325\u2009g; Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) was affixed to a mouse stereotactic frame (Harvard Apparatus) to expose the skull through a midline incision. A 2-mm hole was drilled through the skull, with the dual matter intact. The CCI was applied at a speed of 5\u2009m/sec, depth of 1.5\u2009mm, and exposure time of 150\u2009msec. The skin incision was closed under sterile conditions. Vital signs were monitored during and immediately after injury. The mouse was examined for Evans blue extravasation, CBF, and the levels of BDEVs in peripheral blood samples.\nFor the adaptive transfer model, non-injured mice were infused with BDEVs made from brains subjected to freeze-thawing injury (Supplementary Methods and Results).\n9\n,\n10\n,\n32\nBriefly, adult male C57BL/6J mice (12\u201316 weeks and 22\u201325\u2009g; Jackson Laboratory) were infused with BDEVs through the tail vein\n9\nand monitored for outcomes discussed in the following sections. Control mice received an equal volume of the supernatant from the brain homogenates centrifuged at 100,000\u2009\u00d7\ng\nfor 60\u2009min (twice) at 4\u00b0C.\nBlood pressure (BP) was measured using a tail-cuff device (CODA; Kent Scientific Co, Torrington, CT) 30\u2009min after BDEV infusion. In a subset of mice, nimodipine (Nimotop, Bayer) was given intravenously at 1\u2009mg/kg 5\u2009min before BDEV infusion. Nimodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that was originally indicated for hypertension but is now used primarily for relieving the cerebral vasospasm of patients with SAH,\n33\nincluding traumatic SAH.\n34\nFor TBI experiments, we chose to study male mice because TBI occurs predominantly with men. The mice were randomized to be subjected to FPI/CCI or sham surgery and for the adaptive transfer model, non-injured mice were randomized for infusion with BDEVs or the supernatant of brain homogenates, which was obtained through two consecutive ultracentrifugation cycles, each at 100,000\u2009\u00d7\ng\nfor 60\u2009min at 4\u00b0C.\n\nLaser speckle contrast analysis (LASCA)\nWe used non-invasive LASCA to measure the effects of FPI and BDEVs on cerebral cortical blood flow in real time.\n30\nIn brief, an anesthetized mouse was fixed on a temperature-controlled surgery platform with the head constrained (\nSupplementary Figure S1\n). The hair was removed from the frontoparietal region to expose the scalp, which was then exposed to a laser beam from the PeriCam PSI HR System (Perimed AB, J\u00e4rf\u00e4lla, Sweden). After allowing the baseline CBF to stabilize for 5\u2009min, the mouse was subjected to either FPI or CCI or infused with 3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n7\nof BDEVs. The CBF was monitored continuously, and the data were quantified at the time period of interest (TOI).\n\nEndothelial injury, permeability, and cerebral edema\nWe used four complementary methods to measure BDEV-induced endothelial injury and permeability. First, the Evans blue-dye extravasation test measured the vascular leakage of mice subjected to FPI or infused with BDEVs.\n15\nBriefly, a mouse received 50\u2009\u03bcL of 2% Evans blue (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) through the tail vein and 60\u2009min later was exposed to FPI or infused with BDEVs. The mouse was euthanized 30\u2009min later and perfused with 50\u2009mL of warm phosphate buffered saline (PBS) through cardiac puncture to remove the dye and blood cells from the vasculature. The brain was dissected and its topical and coronal views were photographed. It was then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, homogenized in formamide (1:20 w/v), and incubated at 60\u00b0C overnight. The brain homogenate was centrifuged at 16,000\u2009\u00d7\ng\nfor 30\u2009min. Evans blue in the supernatant was quantified at OD620\u2009nm in a SpectraMax M5 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).\nSecond, we also used a transwell system to measure the transendothelial migration of BDEVs\nin vitro\n(Supplementary Methods and Results).\n9\n,\n30\nThird, we measured brain water content to detect vascular leakage and cerebral edema (Supplementary Methods and Results).\n30\nFinally, tissue histology was performed to detect microvascular bleeding and fibrin deposition.\n\nDeath, autopsy, and tissue histology\nMice subjected to TBI and those infused with BDEVs were monitored for survival. Autopsy was performed on mice that died during the monitoring period, and the brains, hearts, lungs, and intestines were collected, washed extensively with PBS, and fixed in 5% paraformaldehyde.\n9\n,\n10\nBlood was also collected using 0.38% sodium citrate as an anticoagulant (final concentration). Surviving mice were euthanized under anesthesia 12\u2009h after BDEV infusion to collect blood and organs. The organs were fixed in 5% paraformaldehyde, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to detect microvascular bleeding, tissue infarction, and occlusive thrombosis or with phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin (PTAH) to detect intravascular fibrin deposition, which is a hallmark of intravascular coagulation.\n9\n\nFlow cytometry\nFlow cytometry (LSR II, Becton Dickinson and Co, San Jose, CA) was used to quantify plasma levels of BDEVs from neurons and glial cells and EVs from endothelial cells (eEVs) and platelets (pEVs) of TBI and control mice.\n9\nThese EVs were identified first by their sizes (<1\u2009mm) using 0.5, 0.9, and 3\u2009mm standard microbeads (Biocytex, Marseille, France), and then by their expression of anionic phospholipids by APC-conjugated annexin V (ANV\n+\n, eBioscience) together with one of the following antibodies: a monoclonal fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-anti-NSE antibody (neuron specific enolase; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) for neuronal EVs, a polyclonal anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) followed by a PE-anti-rabbit IgG (eBioscience) for glial EVs, an eFluor 450-anti-mouse CD144 antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for endothelial EVs (eEVs), and an eFluor 450-anti-mouse CD41a antibody (Invitrogen) for platelet-derived EVs (pEVs).\nIsotype-specific IgGs were tested as negative controls. Sphero AccuCount beads were used to quantify EVs. All buffers were filtered with a 0.1\u2009mm filter (EMD Millipore, Burlington, MA) to reduce small-particle contaminations.\n\nProtein and phospholipid extraction from BDEVs\nThe known numbers of BDEVs were lysed in a 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) buffer for 30\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. The SDS was then removed using an SDS-Out\u2122 kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The protein extract was centrifuged at 13,000\u2009\u00d7\ng\nfor 20\u2009min at 4\u00b0C to collect the supernatant, which was tested as BDEV-derived proteins. Phospholipids were extracted from BDEVs and profiled using mass spectrometry (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Alabaster, AL). The phospholipids thus identified were mixed proportionally according to mass spectrometry data.\nThe phospholipid mix was sonicated at 60 mH for 10\u2009min to promote the formation of lipid micelles immediately before testing as BDEV-derived phospholipids. The protein and phospholipid components of BDEVs were tested separately at amounts equivalent to 10 times the IC50 number of BDEVs.\n\nBDEV-induced vasoconstriction\nA 2-mm segment was dissected from the carotid artery of a C57BL/6J male mouse immediately after euthanasia and mounted on two wires of the DMT 610\u2009M multi myograph system (Danish Myo Technology, Hinnerup, Denmark). The segment was incubated with 5\u2009mL of the physiological salt solution (PSS), which contained 130\u2009mM NaCl, 4.7\u2009mM KCl, 1.17\u2009mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 1.17\u2009mM MgSO\n4\n.7H\n2\nO, 14.9\u2009mM NaHCO\n3\n, 5.5\u2009mM glucose, 0.026\u2009mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and 1.6\u2009mM CaCl\n2\n(pH 7.4) for 30\u2009min at 37\u00b0C to set the baseline (2 mN).\nThe PSS was then replaced with the oxygenated (95% O\n2\n) potassium-enriched PSS (KPSS), which contained 74.7\u2009mM NaCl, 60\u2009mM KCl, 1.18\u2009mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 1.17\u2009mM MgSO\n4\n.7H\n2\nO, 14.9\u2009mM NaHCO\n3\n, 5.5\u2009mM glucose, 0.026\u2009mM EDTA, and 1.6\u2009mM CaCl\n2\n(pH 7.4) to trigger vasoconstriction to ensure the contractility of the arterial segment. After washing with PSS to reset the baseline, the segment was incubated with BDEVs and monitored continuously for 60\u2009min at 37\u00b0C. Changes in vascular wall tension were recorded by the PowerLab system (AD Instruments, Sydney, Australia).\n\nHopping probe ion conductance microscopy (HPICM)\nThe BDEV-induced morphological changes of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and rat brain smooth muscle cells (RBSMC; ATCC, Manassas, VA) were monitored in real-time using HPICM (Ionscope Ltd, Cambridge, UK).\n35\n,\n36\nThe Axon MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA) supplied a DC voltage of +200\u2009mV to generate an electrical current between the nanopipette electrode and bath electrode. After baseline scanning, cells were treated with BDEVs for 2\u2009min at 37\u00b0C and scanned for up to 60\u2009min under an inverted TiU microscope (Nikon Corporation, Japan). Topographical data were continuously acquired and linearly interpolated into images with ScanIC Image Viewer (version 1.0; Ionscope Ltd, Cambridge, UK).\n\nCalcium influx imaging\nThe RBSMCs were cultured in a Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) medium (ThermoFisher Scientific) containing 10% fetal bovine serum until confluent. They were then labeled with the fluorescent calcium-binding dye Fluo-3 (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) for 10\u2009min at 37\u00b0C. After being washed with PBS, the cells were treated with BDEVs for 10\u2009min at 37\u00b0C, counter-stained with the DNA-binding dye Hoechst (Beyotime, Shanghai, China), and reviewed under a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Olympus, Japan).\n\nStudy design and statistical analysis\nTo minimize the confounding influence of blood draws and other technical manipulations on the outcome assessments of the TBI mice, blood collection and analyses, histopathology assessments, measurements of the CBF, and evaluation of vascular permeability were performed on separate groups of mice and analyzed as independent variables. To reduce experimental and analytical biases, experimental results were analyzed by a designated biostatistician who was blinded to the experimental conditions.\nPower analyses were performed for individual experiments. Categorical (frequency) and continuous variables were expressed as the percentage and mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM), respectively. They were analyzed using a paired\nt\ntest, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or repeated measures ANOVA for Bonferroni\npost hoc\ncomparisons, as indicated in the specific datasets. Cumulative survival was analyzed with a Kaplan-Meier plot. The analyses were performed using SYSTAT software SigmaPlot (version 11.2; San Jose, CA). A\np\nvalue of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll animal studies were performed in compliance with the Loma Linda University School of Medicine regulations and institutional guidelines consistent with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The present study used 220-225\u2009g female Sprague-Dawley rats (\nn\n=\u200970; Charles River Laboratories, Portage, MI) housed in individual cages on alternating 12-h light/dark cycles with food and water\nad libitum.\n\nSpinal cord contusion injury and BMS309403 treatment\nTwo different cohorts were used in this study. In the first cohort, rats were anesthetized, and spinal cord injury was generated using the Multicenter Animal Spinal Cord Injury Study (MASCIS) Impactor as previously described.\n36-38\nAnimals received a moderate contusion injury at T9-T10. The MASCIS software values for compression and compression rate ensured injury severity and reproducibility. Only animals with a compression value of 0.397\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0303 and a compression rate of 1.924\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2134 were included in the study. Sham controls only received a T9-T10 laminectomy. For both sham and injured groups, 5\u2009mm lesion epicenter segments were harvested 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days post-injury (dpi). A minimum of three animals were used for each time-point (see figure legends for\nn\nat each time point).\nThe second cohort of animals was injured as described above and concomitantly treated with the FABP4 small molecule inhibitor BMS309403, which targets the fatty acid-binding pocket.\n39\nA small subcutaneous pocket over the sacral vertebrae was created to house a primed osmotic mini-pump (DURECT\nTM\n, Cupertino, CA). The pump was previously filled with 200\u2009\u03bcL of 100\u2009\u03bcM BMS309403 solution (inhibitor), or 100\u2009\u03bcM ethanol solution (vehicle) dispensed to the epicenter at a mean flow rate of 0.25\u2009\u03bcL/h. Surgeries, pump preparation, and pump placement were conducted in the manner previously reported.\n36\nBehavioral studies were conducted 7, 14, 21, and 28\u2009dpi. The Crede's maneuver was performed twice per day to express retained urine from the bladder of all injured rats in the study. Autonomic bladder recovery was assessed by measuring expressed urine volume (in mL) of vehicle and inhibitor-treated rats for 9 days. Bladder function was restored once expressed urine volume was \u22640.5\u2009mL. From this cohort, 7\u2009mm lesion epicenter segments were harvested 28\u2009dpi. Post-operative care and euthanasia for all animals were conducted as previously reported.\n36\n,\n37\n\nQuantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction\nComplementary DNA was amplified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers for the detection of FABP4 and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH;\nTable 1\n), which served as the internal control. Amplification was conducted using the CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Relative gene expression levels were normalized to control (median sham).\nTable 1.\nqPCR Gene Expression Analysis Primers\nOpen in a separate window\n\nWestern blot\nWestern blots were conducted as previously described.\n3\n,\n36\n,\n40\nBriefly, membranes were incubated overnight with rabbit anti-FABP4, anti-rabbit PPAR\u03b3, anti-rabbit P-NF-\u03baB, or mouse anti-P-I\u03ba\u03b2\u03b1 and mouse anti-\u03b2-actin (\nTable 2\n). Secondary anti-rabbit 800 and anti-mouse 680 antibodies (LI-COR\n\u00ae\nBiosciences, Lincoln, NE) were applied to the membranes for detection. Finally, membranes were imaged using the Odyssey\n\u00ae\nInfrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). Relative protein levels were normalized to \u03b2-actin, and fold change was assessed as the level of FABP4 protein over control (median sham). Image Studio\u2122 Lite Software was used for protein quantification (LI-COR Biosciences).\nTable 2.\nWestern Blot and Immunofluorescence Analysis Antibodies\nOpen in a separate window\n\nBehavioral evaluation of spontaneous locomotion\nThe Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) 22-point locomotor scale was used to assess spontaneous open-field locomotion 7, 14, 21, and 28\u2009dpi.\n41\nBefore testing, animals were acclimated to the open-field environment, and baseline values were taken. Testing sessions were recorded and evaluated as previously described.\n36\n,\n37\nTwo blinded observers scored the degree of locomotor function and recovery.\nPost hoc\ntransformation of scores was conducted to improve the scale's metric properties and reduce scale-introduced variability.\n42\n\nCatwalk analysis\nThe CatWalk Gait Device (Noldus Information Technology Inc., Leesburg, VA) was used to analyze the walking patterns of animals during conditioned locomotion.\n43-45\nEach animal's baseline performance was acquired before the injury. The locomotor recovery of BMS309403-treated rats and vehicle controls was assessed after injury at 7, 14, 21, and 28\u2009dpi. Average values for baseline and time-points were gathered for analysis. The Catwalk software (ver. 20.6) classified front paws and hind paws by adjusting intensity thresholds. Significant differences in regularity index, average speed, cadence, maximum variation, and step variation are presented as indicators of locomotor recovery.\n\nHistology\nSpinal cord epicenters were prepared as previously described.\n36-38\nLongitudinal sections of 20\u2009\u03bcm thickness were double-labeled with rabbit anti-FABP4 and mouse anti-CD11b (monocytes, macrophages/ microglia) or with mouse anti-NeuN (neurons) or mouse anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; activated astrocytes;\nTable 2\n). Rabbit anti-FABP4 was also used to quantify levels of FABP4 protein in the second cohort. Mean fluorescent intensity was calculated from each animal's averaged fluorescence intensity values. Additional slides from this cohort were used to stain M\u03d5MG using anti-mouse FITC-CD163 and rabbit anti-liver arginase (\nTable 2\n). Sections were incubated with the appropriate combination of Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody, Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated donkey anti-mouse (1:1000; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cell nuclei were stained using Invitrogen\u2122 Prolong\u2122 Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI. Sections were imaged using the confocal laser scanning microscope (FV1000, Olympus or LSM710; Carl Zeiss GmbH, Jena, Germany) or fluorescence microscope (BZ9000; Keyence Corporation, Osaka, Japan). A minimum of three sections were analyzed per animal. Images were analyzed and prepared for publication using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were performed using Prism Software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Outliers were identified using the Grubbs\u2019 method. All data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean.

    "Methods": "Overview\nTRACK-SCI is a multi-center, prospective observational study conducted by the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Brain and Spinal Injury Center (BASIC) that recruits patients from Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (ZSFGH) and Fresno's Community Regional Medical Center, two level I trauma centers. Created in 2013, TRACK-SCI is funded by the Department of Defense (DOD) and is described in depth in a previous publication.\n16\nInstitutional review board (IRB) approval was obtained at this site for all study procedures.\n\nPatient selection and demographics\nPatients enrolled in the TRACK-SCI study from 2015 to 2020 were identified and included in this secondary analysis of a prospective observational study\n16\n(\nFig. 1\n). Inclusion criteria for the TRACK-SCI study is composed of (1) all traumatic SCI patients presenting to the emergency room of a level I trauma center, (2) presence of neurological deficit with an associated spinal fracture or ligamentous injury based on computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and (3) ability to consent to the study. Exclusion criteria consisted of patients being (1) < 18 years old, (2) prisoners or patients in custody, (3) pregnant, or (4) on a medically indicated psychiatric hold or otherwise unable to consent to study participation. Our current study further excluded patients missing data regarding the (1) presence/absence of an appendicular fracture, (2) measure of SCI severity at hospital discharge, and (3) Injury Severity Score (ISS), an internationally recognized scoring system assessing the combined effects of multiply injured patients.\n17\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nFlow diagram for study inclusion/exclusion.\n\nData variables and outcomes\nThe International Standard for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) is published by the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) and assesses patients' motor function and sensory impairment. The ISNSCI examination uses the ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) to test bilateral body motions and degree of sensation after light touch.\n18\nThe scale has five classification levels ranging from total loss of neural function in the affected area (Grade A) to completely normal motor and sensory functions (Grade E).\n18\nISNCSCI examinations were performed by healthcare providers who completed in-person training and the ASIA International Standards Training E Program (InSTEP). If a reliable ISNCSCI examination was possible, providers conducted examinations at regular intervals \u2013 including admission (day 0\u2009=\u20090\u201323\u2009h from injury), every 48\u2009h until post-injury day 7, discharge, 6-month follow-up (\u00b1 2 weeks), and 12-month follow-up (\u00b1 2 weeks) \u2013 either for clinical care or research. However, the ISNCSCI was not always performed, because of staff limitations and patients' altered mental state, sedation, language barriers, polytrauma, refusal to complete examination, withdrawal from study, and death. When the ISNCSCI examination was unobtainable or not performed, an estimated AIS grade was periodically determined by providers. Our primary outcome was AIS grade at hospital discharge, specifically A versus non-A grades, which is a clinically useful distinction for SCI treatment and prognosis.\n19\nBased on significant 0.93 (\np\n<\u20090.001) and 0.84 (\np\n<\u20090.001) Spearman's correlations between estimated and ISNCSCI-determined AIS scores at hospital discharge and admission, respectively, the AIS-estimated and AIS-determined variables were pooled to increase sample size. If conflict occurred during pooling, ISNCSCI-determined AIS scores were selected over estimated AIS scores. Secondary outcomes were the probability of improvement of \u22651 AIS grade and the hospital and ICU lengths of stay (LOS) between SCI-isolated and SCI-concomitant appendicular fracture groups.\nOur analyses included ISS on arrival and injury etiology. The ISS is based on the Abbreviated Injury Scale, in which injuries are assigned to six body regions (head and neck, face, chest, abdominal or pelvic contents, extremities or pelvic girdle, and external\n20\n) and assigned a value from 1 (least severe) to 6 (most severe). The scores from the three most severely injured ISS body regions are squared then added together to produce an overall ISS.\n20\nThe injury etiology describes SCI etiology according to the following six categories: assault, crush, fall, sports or leisure, transport, or other traumatic cause.\nTo control for the impact of non-fracture injuries on AIS discharge scores, a recalculated ISS score was produced that excluded extremity and pelvic girdle injuries, such as sprains, fractures, dislocations, and amputations. A Pearson's product-moment correlation test revealed a significant 0.99 (\np\n<\u20090.001) correlation between the original ISS and the recalculated ISS that excluded extremity and pelvic girdle injuries.\nAll data were stored in the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database, which is in full compliance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) security standards for protection of personal health information (PHI).\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were conducted with R Version 4.1.0 GUI 1.76 High Sierra Build.\n21\nDifferences in subject characteristics (\nTable 1\n) between patients with isolated SCI and patients with SCI-concomitant appendicular fractures were assessed for statistical imbalance using Mann\u2013Whitney\nU\ntests and two-sided\nt\ntests (ordinal and continuous variables, respectively), and Fisher exact tests (categorical variables).\nTable 1.\nDemographic and Injury Characteristics of Included Patients (\nn\n=\u2009147)\nVariable\nIsolated SCI group (\nn\n=\u2009120)\nSCI + appendicular fracture group (\nn\n=\u200927)\np\nvalue\nAge (mean)\n53.0 (20.5)\n45.7 (18.7)\n0.078\na\nGender\n0.643\nb\nMale\n86 (71.7)\n18 (66.7)\nFemale\n34 (28.3)\n9 (33.3)\nAIS Grade on admission\n0.007\nb\nA\n23 (23.2)\n13 (59.1)\nB\n7 (7.1)\n3 (13.6)\nC\n20 (20.2)\n2 (9.1)\nD\n46 (46.5)\n4 (18.2)\nE\n3 (3.0)\n0 (0)\nUnspecified\n16 (Excluded from analysis)\nAIS Grade on discharge\n0.187\nb\nA\n23 (21.5)\n11 (45.8)\nB\n5 (4.7)\n1 (4.2)\nC\n19 (17.8)\n3 (12.5)\nD\n56 (52.3)\n9 (21)\nE\n4 (3.7)\n0 (0)\nUnspecified\n16 (Excluded from analysis)\nOriginal Injury Severity Score (ISS) on arrival\n23.0 (15.9)\n30.9 (11.9)\n<0.001\nc\nInjury etiology\n0.865\nb\nAssault\n18 (15.0)\n3 (11.1)\nCrush\n1 (8.0)\n0 (0)\nFall\n58 (48.3)\n16 (59.2)\nOther traumatic cause\n4 (3.3)\n1 (3.7)\nSports/Leisure\n6 (5.0)\n0 (0)\nTransport\n33 (27.5)\n7 (25.9)\nOpen in a separate window\nBold indicates statistical significance.\nContinuous variables are presented as mean (SD) and analyzed using either the Mann\u2013Whitney\nU\nTest or two-sided\nt\ntest; categorical variables are presented as\nn\n(%) and analyzed using a Fisher's exact test.\na\nWelch two sample\nt\ntest\nb\nFisher's exact test\nc\nMann\u2013Whitney\nU\ntest\nSCI, spinal cord injury; AIS, American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale; SD, standard deviation.\nBinomial logistical regression analyses assessed whether SCI-concomitant appendicular fractures are predictors of SCI neuromotor outcome. Linear regression (lm R function) and binomial logistical regressions (glm R function with binomial family) analyzed secondary outcomes of probability of SCI improvement and ICU and hospital LOS. All analyses were adjusted for putative confounding or covariate factors including age, gender, and other associated polytrauma through the recalculated ISS variable that excludes extremity and pelvic girdle injuries. Significance was assessed at\np\n<\u20090.05.\nTo detect potential inflated effects of predictors on SCI outcomes caused by collinearity between predictor variables, a logistical least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis was conducted, which shrinks regression coefficients from a large and potentially multi-collinear set of variables in the regression and ultimately removes less predictive or redundant predictors from the model.\n22\n,\n23\nLASSO was fitted using the glmnet R package.\n24\nThe amount of shrinkage parametrized by the penalty factor (\u03bb) was decided by cross-validation over the binomial deviance metric."

    "Methods": "Two hundred and ninety-eight serum samples were obtained from CENTER-TBI for spectroscopic analysis. The CENTER-TBI study was a prospective observational clinical study conducted in 65 sites from 17 European countries and Israel between December 19, 2014, and December 17, 2017. Patients with all severities of TBI presenting to a study center within 24\u2009h of injury and scheduled for CT scanning were enrolled. The only exclusion criterion was severe pre-existing neurological disorder.\n\nAll the measured 298 samples were randomly selected on admission samples from the CENTER-TBI serum biobank, collected within 24\u2009h post-injury in 11 of the 65 participating clinical sites of the CENTER-TBI project. The samples underwent two freeze-thaw cycles before analysis, because serum aliquots were primarily used for other biomarker tests by the CENTER-TBI group. Of these, 222 patients were analyzed who had both GCS scores recorded from the time of injury and Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) values at six months post-injury. The 222 cohort samples were compared with those of 87 asymptomatic controls whose serum samples were obtained from Royal Preston Hospital (Preston, UK).\n\nThe TBI patient cohort had a mean age of 50.7 years and were represented in a 70:30% male to female ratio. The asymptomatic controls had a mean age of 34.4 years and a 55:45% female to male ratio. At the time of injury, 49% (108) of patients presented with a mild head injury, 14% with moderate head injury, and 37% with severe head injury. These classifications were based solely on GCS score: mild 13\u201315, moderate 9\u201312, and severe 3\u20138.\n\nFrom the CT imaging, 23% of patients with TBI had no abnormalities. The remaining 77% with abnormalities presented with one or more of the following six: small hyperdense lesions, extradural hematoma, acute subdural hematoma, contusion, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or basal cisterns absent compressed. Six months post-injury, 21% of patients had died as a result of their injury, while 20%, 18%, and 41% had severe, moderate, or good recoveries, respectively. A summary of patients included within the study is outlined inTable 1.\n\nA Perkin Elmer Spectrum 2 FTIR spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, UK) was used for all serum spectral data collection. This involved a Specac Quest ATR accessory unit with a specular reflectance puck (Specac Ltd, UK), allowing a Dxcover optical sample SIRE (Dxcover Ltd) to be positioned directly on top of the aperture. Nine spectra were collected for each patient within the wavenumber range of 4000\u2013450\u2009cm\u22121, at a resolution of 4\u2009cm\u22121, with 1\u2009cm\u22121data spacing and 16 co-added scans; resulting in a total of 2781 spectra acquired. For nine repeats and background, each patient took approximately 15\u2009min for data collection.\n\nThe data analysis was completed using either MATLAB R2020a or R Statistical Computing Environment software with the PRFFECT toolbox,21a principal component analysis (PCA) code written in house, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve code written in house, or a partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) bootstrapping code for permutation analysis.\n\nData pre-processing was a trial-and-error iterative approach utilizing the PRFFECT toolbox and was completed before each PCA or classification. The optimum pre-processing techniques for these data involved a min max normalization, a binning factor of 8, cutting to the spectral region of 1800\u20131000\u2009cm\u22121, and an extended multiplicative signal correction (EMSC) that used the average spectrum of 10 background measurements of the SIRE as a reference.\n\nThree classifications within the PRFFECT toolbox were chosen including random forest (RF), PLS-DA, and support vector machine (SVM). Patients were split randomly into training (70%) and test sets (30%) where the models were tuned on the training set and then used to make predictions for the spectra within the test set. A five-fold cross-validation on the training set was performed on a per-spectra basis. To ensure that the models were trained and validated correctly, spectra from a single patient's sample could only appear in one cross-validation fold, and in either the training or test set. The consensus vote among the nine spectra that were analyzed for each patient was reported as the diagnostic outcome. The 51 reiterations reshuffle the training and test sets to ensure all patients are included within the test set at least once.\n\nBecause of the imbalance between the two groups (injury and non-injury), a synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was used for all classifications. The SMOTE sampling technique is an oversampling approach that creates synthetic data for the minority class to create a class balance, and it is used widely for high dimensional data.22Sensitivity, specificity, and balanced accuracies contribute to the performance of each algorithm23while a ROC curve can measure performance capabilities and the AUC represents a degree of separability.24The statistical significance of the classification was obtained by an empiricalpvalue, where 1000 permutation tests with randomized labels were completed. This was done with a PLS-DA classification model with SMOTE sampling and 1000 bootstrapping validations.25\n\nAnalysis first involved comparison between injury patients (all severities) and a healthy volunteer non-injury control group. Following this, patients who presented with a mild GCS score were compared with non-injury controls, and, finally, comparisons were made between patients with mild GCS scores with at least one CT abnormality against mild patients with GCS scores with no CT abnormalities. Patient age and gender were also investigated to establish any influence on test accuracy because of these two variables."

    "Methods": "Animals\nA total of 68 7- to 8-week-old male and female C57BL/6J mice (00664) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and housed in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International\u2013accredited animal facility for at least 3 days of acclimation before the experiments were started. All procedures were approved by the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were group-housed (4\u20135/cage), had access to food and water\nad libitum,\nand were maintained on a standard 12\u2009h:12\u2009h light-dark cycle.\n\nCHIMERA\nAnimals were randomly assigned to the injured or sham conditions (\nTable 1\n). Groups were further divided into either single (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009,\nn\n=\u200919) or repetitive (4\u2009\u00d7\u2009, 1/day,\nn\n=\u200918) CHIMERA-related TBI with appropriate sham counterparts (1\u2009\u00d7\nn\n=\u200919, 4\u2009\u00d7\nn\n=\u200912). All mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (3% Forane, Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL, with 100% O\n2\n) inside an induction chamber for approximately 2\u2009min. Respiration was monitored, and when deeply unconscious, the mice were transferred to the CHIMERA animal bed and placed in a supine position at a 30\u00b0 angle with the animal head laid flat horizontally on the head plate. Instrument crosshair markings were used for head alignment for impact of the region surrounding bregma. Velcro straps secured the body but also allowed free rotation of the head and upper torso. During placement, a nose cone on the animal bed delivered isoflurane (2% isoflurane with 100% O\n2\n) for about 3\u2009min before being removed just prior to impact. For the injured groups, the CHIMERA device piston was driven upward to impact the closed mouse head dorsally (\u223c0.6\u2009J, 4.9\u2009m/sec velocity). After impact, the mouse was removed from the holder and positioned in a supine orientation in a clean cage to assess the time to return of the righting reflex, a surrogate measurement of return to consciousness. Once the animals turned upright, they were placed back into their home cage. Acetaminophen diluted in water (3% concentration) was administered after injury to all animals. Sham animals were handled identically, including anesthesia treatment of equal duration, placement on the CHIMERA platform, and acetaminophen administration, but were not exposed to the impact.\nTable 1.\nMRI Cohort Sample Sizes\n*\nCohort\nInjury\nSham\nResolution for T2W (\u03bcm\n3\n)\nDCE Resolution (\u03bcm\n3\n)\n1\n4\u2009\u00d7\nn\n=\u200912\n4\u2009\u00d7\nn\n=\u20093\n150\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u2009\u00d7\u20091000\n150\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u2009\u00d7\u20091000\n2\n4\u2009\u00d7\nn\n=\u20096\n4\u2009\u00d7\nn\n=\u20099\n150\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u2009\u00d7\u20091000\n150\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u2009\u00d7\u20091000\n3\n1\u2009\u00d7\nn\n=\u20098\n1\u2009\u00d7\nn\n=\u20094\n150\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u2009\u00d7\u20091000\n150\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u2009\u00d7\u2009500\n4\n1\u2009\u00d7\nn\n=\u20096\n1\u2009\u00d7\nn\n=\u20098\n150\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u2009\u00d7\u20091000\n150\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u2009\u00d7\u2009500\n5\n1\u2009\u00d7\nn\n=\u20095\n1\u2009\u00d7\nn\n=\u20097\n150\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u2009\u00d7\u20091000\n150\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u2009\u00d7\u2009500\nOpen in a separate window\n*\nMRI cohort sample sizes.\nPre-contrast and post-contrast T2-weighted images were acquired during each MRI.

First, a baseline MRI (Baseline) was conducted 1 week before CHIMERA injuries or sham treatment. The second MRI (Day 1) was initiated within 15\u2009min after the last CHIMERA injury or sham treatment, and the third scan (Day 7) took place 1 week post-injury (\nFig. 1\n). A transmit birdcage coil (Bruker) in combination with an actively decoupled four-channel mouse head receive array coil (Bruker) was used. Pre-contrast and post-contrast T2-weighted images were acquired for each scan. All measurements, T2 and DCE, were acquired during each of the three scans per animal: T2W/PDW/T2 map two-dimensional rapid imaging with refocused echoes repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u20094000\u2009msec; echo time (TE)\u2009=\u200910, 30, 50, 70, 90, 110\u2009msec; echo train length\u2009=\u20092; number of angles (NA)\u2009=\u20092; field of view (FOV) 13.8\u2009\u00d7\u200913.8\u2009mm\n2\n; matrix 92\u2009\u00d7\u200992; number of slices (NS)\u2009=\u200925; fat suppression; band width (BW) 36\u2009kHz; and time 6:08\u2009min.

For all groups, three magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed at Baseline (1 week before the final CHIMERA), on Day 1 (immediately after the single or last CHIMERA), and Day 7 (1 week following the final injury). The single CHIMERA animals only received one impact immediately before Day 1 scanning, while repetitive CHIMERA mice underwent three impacts separated 24\u2009h apart on the 3 days before the fourth and final impact that was performed immediately before Day 1 scanning. Total scan time was approximately 55\u2009min for each MRI. Regions of interest (ROIs) used for magnetic resonance imaging analyses are displayed in\nSupplementary Figure S1\nand histology ROIs are outlined in\nFigure 6A\n. Color image is available online.\nPrior to each scan, animals were weighed and placed in an isoflurane anesthesia (4% isoflurane in medical air) induction chamber. A syringe and catheter containing the contrast agent ProHance (Bracco Diagnostics Inc, Milan Italy; 50% Gd in saline) was prepared and the needle tip was directed to the intraperitoneal cavity, but not injected. The mouse was then transferred to the MRI bed, placed in a prone stereotaxic holder for head alignment, and positioned on a circulating water warming pad while maintained under isoflurane through a nose cone. Each MRI session was approximately 55\u2009min in duration and animals were monitored by temperature (maintained 34\u201337\u00b0C) and respiration (maintained 30\u201370 breaths/min), with appropriate adjustments made to the isoflurane anesthesia (maintained between 1.5\u20132.0% isoflurane in medical air) while inside the scanner. At the start of the DCE acquisition, ProHance was intraperitoneally injected (0.5\u2009mL 1:1 ProHance:Saline per mouse) with an 11:00\u2009min DCE acquisition time where the injection commenced beginning 2\u2009min into the sequence. Experimenters were blinded to the animal conditions for MRI acquisition and analysis. Following the third scan, animals were euthanized and tissue was collected for histology.\nTo accommodate time constraints on the treatment sequences, the mice were utilized in cohorts that were divided by single or repetitive injuries and balanced for treatment condition. There was a total of five cohorts. Cohorts 1-2 included 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009CHIMERA and sham counterparts, while Cohorts 3-5 consisted of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009CHIMERA and sham treatment (\nTable 1\n). One male 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009CHIMERA mouse died immediately following impact and the baseline data from this animal was not included in the analysis. One female 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009CHIMERA mouse displayed hindleg paralysis following the fourth impact. The scan (Day 1) indicated intracerebral hemorrhaging and this mouse was euthanized resulting in no Day 7 scan. Finally, one male 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009Sham mouse died just before the Day 7 scan, possibly due to anesthesia exposure, and the Day 7 data from this animal was not available.\n\nData processing\nMRI data were processed using Matlab R2020a (The MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA). T2-relaxation time maps were computed from the multi-echo T2-weighted images. For DCE, the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to provide a more robust metric for image enhancement.\n29\nDetails of the image processing are provided in the Supplementary Methods.\nMRI data were analyzed for changes in enhancement using a region-of-interest (ROI) approach; which were selected based on previous CHIMERA literature.\n21\nROIs were hand drawn on the pre-contrast 30\u2009msec TE T2-weighted image and on the average of the first three DCE image frames from each scan session using VivoQuant Software version 3.0 (inviCRO LLC, Boston, MA) and ITK-SNAP version 3.8 (Yushkevich, P.A. and Gerig, G., National Institutes of Health [NIH]) software (\nSupplementary Fig. S1\n). A bilateral ROI was drawn in the muscle to normalize the data. Animal and voxel exclusion criteria were applied to omit scans with poor contrast uptake and to remove potential errors in ROI drawings (see MRI data processing in the Supplementary Methods). As discussed in the Supplementary Methods, only T2 pre-contrast data was analyzed because T2 pre-contrast is a clinically relevant measurement and is comparable to T2 post-contrast in this study.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nImmediately following Day 7 MRI scans, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine and then transcardially perfused with cold phosphate buffer solution (0.10\u2009M) and 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer. Brains were dissected and further fixed in paraformaldehyde for an additional 24\u2009h. They were then transferred to 20% sucrose solution in phosphate buffer for 72\u2009h before freezing the tissue and stored at -80\u00b0C until sectioning. A Leica microtome was used to cut 30\u2009\u03bcm thick coronal sections. The tissue was stained at least 1 week after sectioning and were washed in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% triton (TBS-T). Sections were then processed with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 30\u2009min and afterwards washed with TBS-T again before blocking buffer (TBS-T with 0.20% triton, 10% goat serum, Vector Laboratories, S-100), and 0.02% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich, A7906) incubation for 1\u2009h at room temperature.\nGlial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody (1:500; Thermofisher Cat: Ab-6 ASTRO06, Lot: 1376P1810J) was applied to the sections before storage at 4\u00b0C overnight. The next day, sections were washed with TBS-T and secondary antibody goat-anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG; 1:500 Jackson Immunoresearch Cat: 115-065-003, Lot: 92050) was applied diluted in blocking buffer for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Sections were again washed with TBS-T before incubation in ABC solution from Vectastain ABC HRP Kit (PK-4000, Vector Laboratories) for 45\u2009min at room temperature. The tissue was washed a final time with TBS-T prior to DAB development with DAB Peroxidase (HRP) Substrate Kit (with nickel), 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (SK-4100, Vector Laboratories) for 3\u2009min. The free-floating sections were mounted onto glass slides and left to dry overnight. Lastly, sections were dehydrated in ethanol gradients (75\u2013100%), cleared in xylene twice, and cover-slipped with Permount mounting media (Fisher Chemical).\nVisual pathway ROIs\nOPT, LGN, and SC were investigated for GFAP staining. Twelve mice (six female and six male mice) per group where successful MRI scans were obtained on all three scans were randomly selected for Carl Zeiss El-Einsatz model #451485 light microscope imaging. Images for the OPT and LGN ROIs were taken at 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification, whereas the SC were captured at 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification. To quantify GFAP in each ROI, percent area stained was measured for black/white GFAP images with the threshold function on Image J software (NIH). GFAP values were averaged for three or more sections per animal. Additional regions were investigated, corpus callosum, anterior commissure, and hippocampal fimbria (\nSupplementary Table S3\n), but no differences in GFAP were observed.\n\nStatistical analysis\nGraphpad Prism version 8.42 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) was used for figure generation. Data are reported for means or medians, as appropriate, and standard error of the mean (SEM) and coefficient of variation (COV). Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (IBM, Armonk, NY) and SigmaPlot (Systat Software Inc, San Jose, CA). The body weight data for the 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009CHIMERA and 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009Sham groups were analyzed as a two factor (Sex\u2009\u00d7\u2009Day) analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009CHIMERA and 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009Sham groups were assessed with a three-factor mixed model ANOVA (Injury\u2009\u00d7\u2009Sex\u2009\u00d7\u2009Day) with Days as a repeated measure. Righting reflex data did not meet the assumptions of normality and was analyzed using separate Kruskal-Wallis ANOVAs for 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009CHIMERA data and separate analyses each day for the 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009CHIMERA experiment.\nFor MRI meningeal analysis, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009and 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009CHIMERA data were analyzed separately with a three-factor linear mixed model analysis (Injury\u2009\u00d7\u2009Sex\u2009\u00d7\u2009Day), with Days treated as a within subjects variable.\nPost hoc\npairwise comparisons were made using the Bonferroni correction method. Brain regions were analyzed with a four-factor linear mixed model (Brain Region\u2009\u00d7\u2009Injury\u2009\u00d7\u2009Sex\u2009\u00d7\u2009Day) for the brainstem, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, corpus callosum, dorsal hippocampus, lateral geniculate nucleus, and superior colliculus, and multiple comparisons were evaluated with the Bonferroni correction (Supplementary Methods). The optic tract was analyzed separately for 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009and 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009AUC because optic tract mean AUC values greatly differed compared with other brain regions. Since different levels of resolution were performed for 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009and 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009cohorts, effect sizes were computed using the Hedge's g formula (equation in Supplementary Methods). The Mann Whitney U-test was used to analyze GFAP histology. GFAP data were also collapsed across sex. A\np\nvalue of \u22640.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "We used 82 male mice in total throughout the experiments, 8\u201312 weeks old, with body weight between 17.1 and 23.6\u2009g. The kidney cortex used in the Western blot of ANP, NPR-A, and ENaC subtypes and the kidney used in the patch clamp experiments are from the same mice. In the remaining experiments, mice were only used for individual experiments.\n\nSpinal cord injury, sham surgery, and measurement of urine volume\nAll animal care and experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Emory University and were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health. Experiments were undertaken in adult B6 mice with contusion SCI at the T\n10\nspinal level. Although no single animal model of SCI represents the complex heterogeneity of clinical SCI phenotypes, the contusion injury mimics a more clinically relevant SCI model.\n11\n,\n12\nMice were assessed for impairment of locomotor function 1 day after surgery to ensure effectiveness of the injury using the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS),\n13\nand as similarly described in our rat studies.\n14\n,\n15\nSCI mice were only included in the study if they recorded BMS scores of 0 or 1 at 1 day post-surgery. The mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane. Under sterile conditions, a skin incision and dorsal laminectomy were performed to expose the spinal cord at T\n10\n. In all experiments, contusion SCI was made at the dorsal surface of the T\n10\nspinal cord with the Infinite Horizon impactor,\n16\nat force of 70 kdyn (\u223c 0.5\u2009mm displacement). The overlying muscle was sutured, and the skin was stapled with surgical wound clips (Reflex #7). Topical veterinary triple antibiotic ointment (neomycin, Polymyxin B, and bacitracin available from multiple sources) was applied to the skin. Mice received sterile Ringers solution (0.5\u2009mL, ip) for hydration, meloxicam (analgesic, 5\u2009mg/kg SC) and Baytril\n\u00ae\n(antibiotic, 2.5\u2009mg/kg, sc) and were left to recover on a temperature-controlled heating pad. Sham surgery (surgical procedure without injury to the spinal cord) mice served as controls. All the experiments were performed on day 7 after either T\n10\ncontusion or sham surgeries. For sham mice, urine was collected for 24\u2009h via mouse metabolic cages. As SCI mice were unable to urinate, 24\u2009h urine was collected three times by applying gentle pressure to the bladder.\nA71915 (Tocris Bioscience, catalog 6715) is a highly potent and competitive NPR-A antagonist (pKi\u2009=\u20099.18). In some experiments, we injected via tail vein 4\u2009\u03bcL/g body weight of a 100\u2009\u03bcM stock solution of A71915 to both the SCI and sham groups of mice on days 3, 5, and 7 after the SCI or sham surgery. On day 7 after the surgery, 4\u2009h after the third administration, we used a split-open distal tubule and cell-attached patch-clamp to detect ENaC activity, and we used the kidney of the same mouse to perform Western blotting to detect the expression of ENaC. At the same time, we collected 24\u2009h urine on the 7th day after surgery. Similarly, in the SCI + A71915 group, we pressed the bladder twice a day to assist micturition. In the SHAM + A71915 group, we used metabolic cages to collect 24\u2009h urine volume.\nIn all mouse experiments, the availability of food for all mice was the same.\n\nIntravital imaging of renal tubules and capillaries in live mice\nIntravital imaging of the kidney was performed as described previously.\n17\u201319\nBriefly, sham mice and SCI mice on day 7 were anesthetized with isoflurane together with intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of 100\u2009mg/kg ketamine and 10\u2009mg/kg xylazine. The mice were shaved on the right side of their backs, disinfected, and cut open to expose the kidney. The subcutaneous tissue was carefully separated with forceps to free the kidney. To avoid the movement of the kidney caused by breathing, the kidney was held and slightly lifted from the mouse. A cover-slip bottom 50\u2009mm petri dish was placed against the kidney and fixed with wax in a bottom-up position (\nFig. 1A and B\n). Then, the mouse was given a tail vein injection with a mixture of Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes H3570) shown in blue to label nuclei and 3\u2009kD dextran Alexa Fluor\u2122 488 (Invitrogen, D34682) shown in green to label the proximal tubule and distal tubule lumen. An HC PL Apo 40\u2009\u00d7\u2009, 1.3 NA oil objective lens was lowered down to the cover-slip to perform optical scanning of the kidney using a Leica SP8 multiphoton confocal microscope at the Emory Integrated Imaging Core facility (\nFig. 1C\n). To minimize the interference caused by the movement of the kidney as a result of breathing and pulse, the resonant scanner was set at a speed of 12000\u2009Hz, was bidirectional, and 32 averages were used. The experiments were performed at 1\u2009h after injection of the mixed fluorescent compounds in order to allow sufficient time to laser-activate the Fluor without doing peripheral damage to nearby tissues. The images were saved at 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009digital zoom on a hard disk and analyzed with FIJI software.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.(A\u2013C)\nSchematic diagram of the arrangement for imaging a living mouse on an upright Leica SP8 multiphoton confocal microscope. The kidney was exposed and slightly lifted with a device against a glass cover-slip attached to a 50\u2009mm petri dish that was fixed with wax in a bottom-up position\n(A)\n, so that a 40\u2009\u00d7\u2009oil objective lens can access the glass cover-slip\n(B)\n, and the fluorescence was detected with a Leica SP8 multiphoton confocal microscope\n(C)\n.\n(D)\nCell-attached patch-clamp configuration formed on a cell of a split-open distal tubule from a mouse kidney. Color image is available online.\n\nWestern blot analysis\nKidney cortex sample was collected on day 7 after SCI and sham, and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. Overall protein levels in the samples were assayed using a Protein Assay Kit (Pierce\u2122 BCA Protein Assay Kit, catalog. 23225). The sample was diluted 10 times, a pipette of 25\u2009\u03bcL of each standard and samples was replicated into a 96-well microplate, 200\u2009\u03bcL of the working reagent were added to each well and the plate was mixed thoroughly on a plate shaker for 30\u2009sec, covered, incubate at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min, cooled to room temperature (RT), and then the absorbance was measured at 562\u2009nm on a plate reader. A standard curve was prepared by plotting the average blank-corrected 562\u2009nm measurement for each bovine serum albumin (BSA) standard versus its concentration in \u03bcg/mL. The standard curve is used to determine the protein concentration of each sample. Kidney cortex lysates (100\u2009\u03bcg) were loaded and electrophoresed on 10% sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels for 60\u201390\u2009min. Gels were blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes for 1\u2009h at 90\u2009V. After 1\u2009h blocking with 5% BSA-phosphate-buffered saline/Tween (PBST) buffer, PVDF membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (1:1000 dilution) to ENaC (Anti-ENaC \u03b1 Antibody, SPC-403; Anti-ENaC \u03b2 Antibody, SPC-404; Anti-ENaC \u03b3 Antibody, SPC-405; STRESSMARQ BIOSCIENCES); AQP-2 (sc-515770, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); ANP (sc-515701, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); or NPR-A (ab40817, Abcam) overnight at 4\u00b0C, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Ig)G secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution, GE healthcare) for 1\u2009h after four vigorous washes. Finally, blots were visualized with chemiluminescence using ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection System (GE healthcare).\n\nSplit-open distal tubule and cell-attached patch-clamp technique\nAs we described previously,\n20\nrenal tubules were manually dissected, and the distal tubule was identified by morphology. Tubules were placed in physiological saline (in mM) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, and 10 HEPES adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH) in a plastic dish before being split open to reveal the apical surface of the cells. Using the split-open tubule, cell-attached patch-clamp single-channel recordings were made as we described previously.\n20\nBriefly, a microelectrode was filled with physiological buffer solution in which lithium was substituted for sodium (in mM: 140 LiCl, 5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, and 10 HEPES adjusted to pH 7.4 with LiOH) and lowered to a single cell of a split-open distal tubule from a mouse kidney (\nFig. 1D\n) before application of a small amount of suction to achieve a >1 G\u03a9 seal. ENaCs were identified by characteristic channel kinetics (long mean open and closed times >0.5\u2009sec) and the current-voltage relationship of the channel (unit conductance close to 6 pS and a very positive, >40\u2009mV, reversal potential). As we performed previously,\n21\nsingle-channel ENaC currents were recorded in a cell-attached configuration with an Axon Multiclamp 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA, USA) interfaced via a Digidata 1420 (Axon Instruments) at RT (22\u201325\u00b0C). Data were sampled at 5\u2009kHz with a low-pass filter at 1\u2009kHz using Clampex 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Before analysis, the single-channel traces were further filtered at 50\u2009Hz. The single-channel amplitude was constructed by an all-point amplitude histogram, and the histograms were fit using multiple Gaussians and optimized using a simplex algorithm. The total number of active channels (\nN\n) in the patch was determined by the maximum multiple channel events observed in a patch during a recording of at least 3\u2009min. ENaC open probability (\nP\nO\n) was calculated using Clampfit 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).\n\nConfocal microscopy using fixed kidney tissue\nAs we described previously,\n20\nkidneys were perfused\nin situ\nwith PBS followed by 2% paraformaldehyde. Kidneys were removed, put in 20% sucrose solution at 4\u00b0C overnight, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin wax. Four-micrometer sections were made, and slices were rehydrated before addition of antibodies NCC, ENaC, or Aquaporin 2 (AQP2). Antibodies were detected using a secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes). To co-localize ENaC subunits with AQP2, kidney slices from sham and T\n10\ncontusion mice were stained with rabbit primary antibodies to \u03b1-, \u03b2-, or \u03b3-ENaC and goat anti-AQP2. Following treatment with fluorescent secondary antibodies, ENaC (green) and AQP2 (red) were examined using confocal microscopy on an Olympus Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope. To determine co-localization, we first determined that there was no fluorescence bleed-through from the green channel to the red channel or vice versa. Then we merged images from the green channel and the red channel; yellow in the merged image was an indication of co-localization.\n\nData and statistical analysis\nData are reported as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error (SE). Statistical analysis was performed with SigmaPlot and SigmaStat software (Jandel Scientific). Differences between groups were evaluated with student\nt\ntest. Z-test and \u03c7\n2\ntest were used for comparisons between the changes in percentage. The results were considered significant if\np\n<\u20090.05."

Maximal heart rate determined during graded exercise test. Early chronic <3 years, late chronic >3 years since spinal cord injury.\nAll participants were at least three months since injury given the need to be medically stable and on outpatient status to participate in the study. Time since injury was dichotomized to <3 years (early chronic) and >3 years (late chronic) after empirically recognizing that differentiation in the data was present at this cutoff. The early and late chronic groups were balanced with regard to neurological level of injury such that the proportions of those with paraplegia and tetraplegia were roughly even in both groups.\nIndividuals were excluded if they were taking cardioactive medications or had a history of cardiopulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, neurological disorders (other than SCI), ongoing pressure injuries, peripheral nerve compression, or rotator cuff tears that would limit ability to row. The Institutional Review Board at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital approved all procedures, and all participants provided written informed consent.\n\nFES row training and testing\nTo facilitate high intensity exercise, individuals with SCI used a hand-activated electrical stimulator (Odstock 4 Channel Stimulator Kit, Odstock Medical Limited Inc., Salisbury, UK) and indoor rowing ergometer (Model D Indoor Rower, Concept2 Inc., Morristown, VT) with adaptations (Paddlesport Training Systems/Vermont Waterways Inc., East Hardwick, VT). These have been described previously,\n18\nbut briefly, a hand activated button on the rower handle allowed the synchronization between voluntary upper body rowing movements and electrical stimulation of lower body rowing movements.\nSubjects participated in training sessions at a goal of three days/week at 45\u201360\u2009min per session consisting of multiple short intervals of FES rowing. Exercise intensity increased from 60\u201370% to 75\u201385% of heart rate reserve established from graded exercise testing at the beginning of the intervention. Duration of rowing, heart rate, power (watts), and total distance rowed were recorded on a per-visit basis.\nParticipants completed peak graded FES rowing exercise tests pre- and post-six months of FES row training. The pre-test was conducted once the participant developed sufficient muscle strength and endurance to allow continuous rowing for >10\u2009min. Before testing, individuals had not eaten for 2\u2009h and had refrained from caffeine and alcohol for 24\u2009h and vigorous activity for 48\u2009h.\n19\nThe graded exercise test consisted of an increase in work output every 1\u20132\u2009min until volitional exhaustion for a total testing duration goal between eight and 12\u2009min.\nThe VO\n2\nwas determined from computer-assisted open circuit spirometry (TrueOne 2400, Parvo Medics Inc., Sandy, UT). Ventilation and expired oxygen and carbon dioxide were measured to determine oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide output (VCO\n2\n), and respiratory exchange ratio (RER). Attainment of VO\n2\nmax was defined as meeting at least three of the following validated criteria: (1) plateau in oxygen consumption despite increasing workload, (2) RER \u22651.1, (3) 85% of age-predicted maximal heart rate (220\u2013age), (4) fingerstick lactate >8\u2009mmol/L (Lactate Plus Meter, Nova Biomedical, Waltham, MA) between 120\u2013180\u2009sec after test completion, (5) rate of perceived exertion (RPE) on Borg scale \u226517 (scale range 6\u201320), as well as (6) decline in power >20 watts despite maximal leg stimulation.\n20\nThe AT during graded exercise testing was determined by the V slope method validated by Beaver and associates,\n21\nin which VO\n2\nis plotted against VCO\n2\n(\nFig. 1\n). This automated method uses a piecewise regression analysis to identify a breakpoint where increases in VCO\n2\nexceed those in VO\n2\n, resulting in a steeper slope. Past this breakpoint, excess CO\n2\nproduction indicates bicarbonate buffering of lactic acid from anaerobic metabolism. The V slope method provides a sensitive index for AT even in those individuals with higher-level, motor-complete SCI.\n22\nMoreover, this method may be more appropriate than methods using minute ventilation for assessing AT in individuals with SCI because of known differences in peripheral ventilatory chemosensitivity.\n23\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExample of V slope plot during graded exercise test. Individual data points represent 10-sec averages in gas exchange. At the anaerobic threshold, increases in carbon dioxide production (VCO\n2\nin L/min) exceed increases in oxygen uptake (VO\n2\nin L/min).\n\nData and statistical analysis\nMaximal values for oxygen consumption, minute ventilation, respiratory exchange ratio, and heart rate were determined from the highest, non-overlapping 10-sec averages during graded exercise tests generated with custom code (MATLAB R2018b, Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA). Neurological level of injury was treated as a dichotomous variable (tetraplegia vs. paraplegia). Average training intensity was calculated from the difference between average training heart rate (across all training sessions) and resting heart rate divided by heart rate reserve; this method has been validated for endurance training.\n24\nTraining impulse was determined by multiplying cumulative training duration by average training intensity. The VO\n2\nmax and AT values were analyzed both as absolute values and relative to body mass because of the correlation between oxygen consumption and body mass; AT was also analyzed relative to VO\n2\nmax.\nDifferences between pre- and post-tests and between early chronic and late chronic groups were assessed via two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and\npost hoc\npaired and unpaired\nt\ntests. The Pearson r was used to assess relationships between training variables and maximal exercise parameters. Significance was set at\np\n<\u20090.05. Tests were run using SPSS Statistics 28.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY). Values are presented as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation."

A high score implies a high level of self-perceived symptoms.\n35\n,\n36\n\n7T MRI\nThe MRI was performed with an actively shielded 7T scanner (Achieva, Philips, Best, Netherlands) equipped with a two-channel transmit and 32 channel receive phased-array head coil (Nova Medical, Wilmington, MA). B1 inhomogeneities were reduced by using dielectric pads (Teeuwisse, Brink, & Webb, 2012). The MRI protocol consisted of three-dimensional T1-weighted imaging, DTI, and DKI. Further details are provided in\nSupplementary Methods 1\n.\nVolumetrics\nAnatomical regions of interest were segmented from the T1w images using FreeSurfer\n37\nand cerebellar white and gray volumes were analyzed (\nFig. 1a\n). An expert reader (ENK) inspected and corrected the material for misclassification.\n38\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nVolumetrics, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) of the cerebellum. Sagittal (upper row), axial (middle row), and coronal (lower row) views of the cerebellum are shown. (a) Cerebellar segmentation. Visualization of the performance of semi-automatic FreeSurfer approach for cerebellar white matter and gray matter segmentation. White matter is depicted with yellow color and gray matter with brown color. (b) Segmentation of white matter cerebellar tracts. Visualization of the performance of TractSeg in DKI. The superior cerebellar tract is depicted in yellow, the middle cerebellar tract in purple, and the inferior cerebellar tract in green. The cerebellar tracts are depicted on top of the fractional anisotropy image. A similar segmentation of the cerebellar tracts was also performed with TractSeg in DTI.\nDTI and DKI\nThe DTI and DKI processing included denoising,\n39\ncorrection for Gibbs-ringing artefacts,\n40\nbrain extraction and correction of distortions from head motion and eddy currents,\n41\n,\n42\nand median filtering (for DKI only). The DTI parameters were estimated through DTIFIT in FSL\n43\nand DKI parameters through dipy and its module DiffusionKurtosisModel.\n44\nTract segmentation was performed using TractSeg.\n45\u201347\nThree cerebellar tracts were selected for analysis: the inferior (left and right merged), middle, and superior (left and right merged) cerebellar tract (\nFig. 1b\n). The fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were analyzed for DTI and mean kurtosis (MK), axial kurtosis (AK), and radial kurtosis (RK) for DKI.\n\nVestibular tests\nThe vestibular tests included video head impulse test (vHIT), caloric test, cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMP), videonystagmography (VNG), posturography, pursuit eye movements (PEM), and an audiogram. Before testing, the subjects were examined to exclude middle ear pathology, eventual ear wax was removed, and an audiogram was obtained. Tests were performed by two experienced audiologists according to manufacturer's instructions.\nA blinded assessment by a physician specialized in neurotology (MM) was made. Tests were graded as normal or pathological whereafter an overall assessment was performed and deficits were classified as peripheral, central, or of combined origin. Peripheral signs included impairments of vHIT, caloric test, cVEMP, and a peripheral pattern of the VNG. Central signs included a central pattern of the VNG (i.e., gaze shifting nystagmus, continuous positional nystagmus), PEM, and posturography. If both peripheral and central test-deficits were found, the pathology was classified as combined. For additional details see\nSupplementary Methods 2\n.\nvHIT\nThe vHIT evaluates the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), which depends on the integrity of the vestibular nerve and the semicircular canals.\n48\nThree vHITs were performed, one for each pair of semicircular canals.\n49\n,\n50\nEvaluation was performed by calculating gains in the VOR, but mainly by classifying responses as normal or abnormal, because of the risk of possible shortcomings in calculations within the measuring system, especially for the vertical canals.\n51\nCaloric testing\nThe caloric test evaluates unilateral peripheral deficits of the lateral semicircular canals and the function of the VOR. A shift in temperature of the endolymph in the semicircular canals stimulates the ampulla, causing an imbalance of the left and right VOR, resulting in nystagmus.\n52\u201354\nPathological outcome was defined as a reaction differing 25% or more from the opposite side.\ncVEMP\nThe cVEMP is a test of the ipsilateral saccule and, hence, the inferior branch of the vestibular nerve. Central deficits delay the myogenic response, while peripheral deficits give an absent or reduced response.\n55\nEvaluation was performed both by inspecting the recorded curve and by assessing calculated amplitudes, latencies, and asymmetries. The overall responses were classified as normal or abnormal, for one or both sides, according to standardized laboratory procedures.\nVideonystagmography\nThe VNG registers the eye movement during different gaze directions, body positionings, and head movements. The response pattern was classified as normal, peripheral, or central. Nystagmus with a peripheral pattern beats toward the contralateral side, improves with gaze toward the lesion, worsens with gaze away from the lesion, and suppresses with visual fixation. A central pattern can be solely vertical or torsional, is not affected by fixation, and can change direction with the gaze.\n56\nPosturography\nThe posturography tests integration of somatosensory, visual, and gravitational signals, and therefore studies the collective vestibular system. The recorded body sway was analyzed for frequency peaks and the variance of the forces actuated against the support surface during the body sway.\n57\nPEM\nIn the PEM-test, the ability to fixate and track a visually moving object is evaluated. Visual information travels to the middle temporal area and frontal eye field of the cerebrum, to the oculomotor regions of the brainstem, projects to the striatum and cerebellum, back to the brainstem before controlling eye movement.\n58\nHence, it is a test of comprehensive visual function and depends on several central structures, including the cerebellum. Abnormal PEM was defined as prominently reduced velocity versus the stimuli, saccadic, or loss of pursuit.\n\nStatistics\nThe data were analyzed using SPSS 25 (SPSS Inc., version 25, IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY). The significance threshold was set to 0.05 for all tests but the DTI and DKI where a Bonferroni correction was made to adjust for the three cerebellar tracts, and the significance threshold was set to 0.017. The metrics test different features, why they were not corrected for multiple comparison.\n59\nTime is reported as mean values with\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviations (SD), or with a time-range interval. The vestibular tests were reported dichotomously. Data were analyzed for normal or skewed distribution using a Shapiro-Wilk test and histograms. Normally distributed data were compared using means and analyzed with\nt\ntests and analysis of variance regression analysis. Skewed or categorical data were presented as median and interquartile range (IQR) and analyzed with a Mann-Whitney\nU\ntest for pairwise comparisons and with a chi- square test for categorical and binominal values."

    "Methods": "Experimental animals\nAll procedures were approved by the University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Rats were housed in an Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)-accredited facility with a 12:12 light/dark cycle with\nad libitum\naccess to rodent chow and water. Adult female Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (200\u2013250\u2009g, Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN, USA) were studied in two groups: SCI (left lateralized contusion injury,\nn\n=\u20098), and SCI + HBO (\nn\n=\u20098).\n\nSurgical procedures\nAnesthesia was induced with 3% isoflurane in O\n2\nand maintained at 2\u20133%. A dorsal midline incision was made from the second to fifth cervical segment and the C3-4 laminae were removed. A left lateralized contusion was induced using the Infinite Horizon impactor (Precision Systems & Instrumentation, Lexington, KY\n22\n). The impactor probe (2.5\u2009mm diameter tip) was positioned between midline and the lateral edge of the spinal cord at C3/C4, and was raised 5\u2009mm above the intact dura. The cord was contused at a pre-set force (200 kd, dwell time\u2009=\u20090). Overlying muscles were sutured with 4\u20130 Vicryl and the skin incision was closed using wound clips. Post-surgical care included buprenorphine at 12\u2009h intervals (0.03\u2009mg/kg, s.q.) for 48\u2009h, lactated Ringers solution (5\u2009mL/12\u2009h, s.q.), and oral Nutri-cal supplements (1\u20133\u2009mL/12\u2009h, Webster Veterinary, MA, USA) until volitional drinking and eating resumed.\n\nHBO treatment\nHBO exposures began at 4\u2009h after anesthesia recovery and continued daily for 10 days. Rats were placed in an HBO chamber (volume\u2009=\u200917\u2009L; Hyperbaric Systems, Alexandria, VA, USA) that was sealed and flushed with 100% O\n2\n. The chamber was pressurized over 6\u2009min (\u223c5 psi/min) until reaching 3.0 ATA. The pressure was maintained for 60\u2009min, and the chamber was continually flushed with 100% O\n2\n(3\u2009L/min). After the 60\u2009min, the chamber was depressurized over 6\u2009min. Body temperature was recorded immediately prior and following HBO.\n\nHistology and immunochemistry\nRats were euthanized with intraperitoneal Beuthanasia\n\u00ae\ninjection (150\u2009mg/kg; Patterson Veterinary Supply, Alachua, FL, USA). Intracardial perfusion with ice-cold saline (500\u2009mL) was followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (500\u2009mL). The spinal cord was harvested and transferred to 30% sucrose in 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The C2-6 spinal cord was longitudinally sectioned (20\u2009\u03bcm) and slide mounted. For ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1) immunostaining, a rabbit anti-Iba-1 (WAKO cat# 019-19741) was used at 1:400 dilution. Iba-1 can label microglia as well as filtrating macrophages, and accordingly, in the\nResults\nsection we refer to cells simply as Iba-1 positive, rather than drawing a conclusion regarding the precise nature of the cells. For the neuronal marker, a mouse anti-NeuN antibody was used (1:1000; Encor Biotechnology, cat# MCA-1B7, Gainesville, FL, USA). Tissue sections were rehydrated in PBS prior to 95\u00b0C antigen retrieval in Trilogy solution (Cell Marque, Rocklin, CA, USA). Slides were blocked for endogenous peroxidase activity, serum blocked and incubated overnight with NeuN or Iba-1 antibodies, or isotype matched mouse immunoglobulin (negative control). Antibody binding was detected using the Elite HRP kit and ImmPACT DAB (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA, USA). Following chromogenic development, slides were stained with rabbit anti-Iba-1 (1:400; Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA, USA) and detected using a Vector Alkaline Phosphatase kit with Blue Alkaline Phosphatase Substrate. Positive control tissues and concentration matched immunoglobulin controls were included. For hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, sections were cut, air dried to improve adherence, and then rehydrated in distilled water. Tissues were stained using standard H&E methodology (SelecTech staining system, Leica Biosystems).\n\nMicroscopy\nImages were captured and quantified by a blinded investigator. An Olympus BX43 upright microscope and DP80 camera with CellSens software was used. Three cervical cord sections were imaged from each animal and included the dorsal horn (laminae 1-3), the lesion epicenter, and the ventral horn (laminae 7-9). Neurons and microglia were quantified using custom-written MATLAB software (version 2019a, Natick, MA, USA; code available by request). Images were captured at 4x, loaded into MATLAB, and separated into individual color channels. A gray scale image was converted to a black and white image using a thresholding procedure (im2bw function). We then excluded items in the image <10 and 25 pixels for the microglia and neurons, respectively. Further, any item >1000 pixels was excluded. The remaining cell boundaries were counted, and average cell counts were calculated across the dorsal, epicenter, and ventral images.\n\nMicroarray analysis\nRats (\nn\n=\u20094/group) were injected intraperitoneally with Beuthanasia (150\u2009mg/kg) solution. Cervical spinal tissues (C3-C5) were harvested, placed into RNA Later (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and stored at -80\u00b0C. RNA extraction was performed using TRIzol, and isolated total RNA was purified using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). The resulting quantity and purity of total RNA was tested through absorbance spectrophotometry at 230, 260, and 280\u2009nm. RNA samples were sent to the Boston University Medical Center Microarray Core Facility for analysis using the Affymetrix Rat Gene Array 2.0ST. Raw Affymetrix CEL files were normalized to produce gene-level expression values using the Robust Multiarray Average (RMA)\n23\nin the\naffy\npackage version 1.36.\n24\nincluded in the Bioconductor software suite (version 2.12\n25\n), and an Entrez Gene-specific probeset mapping (17.0.0) from the Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience Institute (Brainarray) at the University of Michigan\n26\n(\nhttp://brainarray.mbni.med.umich.edu/Brainarray/Database/CustomCDF\n). Expression values were log2-transformed. Array quality was assessed by computing Relative Log Expression (RLE) and Normalized Unscaled Standard Error (NUSE) using the\naffyPLM\nBioconductor package (version 1.34.0\n27\n). Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using the\nprcomp\nR function with expression values that had been normalized across all samples to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Pairwise differential gene expression was assessed by performing Student's\nt\ntest on the coefficients of simple linear models created using the\nlmFit\nfunction in the\nlimma\npackage (version 3.14.4). Correction for multiple hypothesis testing was accomplished using the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR).\n28\nHuman homologs of rat genes were identified using HomoloGene (version 68\n29\n). Microarray analyses were performed using the R environment for statistical computing (version 2.15.1). Both .cel files and expression values were deposited into minimum information about a microarray experiment (MIAME) compliant NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO Series ID GSE185600).\nA GSEA (version 2.2.1)\n21\nwas used to identify biological pathways and processes that were coordinately up- or downregulated within each pairwise comparison. The Entrez Gene identifiers of the human homologs of the genes interrogated by the array were ranked according to the\nt\nstatistic computed for each pairwise comparison. An enrichment score (ES) for each gene set measured the skewedness. Enrichment scores were then normalized (NES) by computing the ratio of the observed ES to the mean ES across 1000 random distributions of the members of the gene set across the ranked list. Because multiple comparisons were tested, we used the optimized FDR q value (FDR-q) with statistical significance set to \u22640.25.\n\nRT-PCR\nRNA extracted from cervical spinal tissue was used to examine genes of interest from the microarray analysis (\nn\n=\u20094/group for SCI and SCI+HBO); 2.4\u2009\u03bcg RNA was reverse transcribed with the Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and 1\u2009\u03bcL cDNA was added to a 24\u2009\u03bcL PCR reaction using Taqman chemistry and the StepOnePlus RT-PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Relative quantification of gene expression was performed using the comparative computed tomography method,\n30\nand values are expressed as fold difference relative to SCI. NF\u03baB Inhibitor alpha (NF\u03baBia; Rn01473557_g1), v-rel reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A (RELA; Rn0150226_m1), Fas-associated via death domain (FADD; Rn00596168_m1), apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1 (APAF1; Rn00576832_m1), Caspase 9 (CASP9; Rn00581212_m1), slit homolog 2 (SLIT2; Rn00575268_m1), neurexin 1 (NRXN1; Rn00665869_m1), microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT; Rn00691532_m1), leucine rich repeat containing 4C (LRRC4C; Rn01513938_m1), and netrin G1 (NTNG1; Rn01518579_m1) mRNA transcripts were assayed using pre-designed rat primer and probe sequences commercially available (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Rn01775763) was chosen as the reference gene based on evidence of unchanged expression with our experimental manipulations. Each data set was tested for equal variances followed by comparison between groups by unpaired\nt\ntest. Significance was established at\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Animals\nSprague-Dawley male rats (\nn\n=\u200995 total) weighing 300-350\u2009g were purchased from Envigo, and randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. All experiments and analyses were performed by individuals blinded to the groups. All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, University of California at Davis. The manuscript was written to be compliant with the Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments guidelines.\n\nAssessment of knocking down efficiency of nanoparticle-siRNA using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction\nRats (\nn\n=\u200915) were divided into five groups (3 rats/group). The siRNA-scramble or siRNA-Fyn/c-Src was dissolved in distilled water at the concentration of 100\u2009\u03bcg/5\u2009\u03bcL, and incubated with 5\u2009\u03bcL nanoparticle (Altogen Biosystems, Las Vegas, NV) at room temperature for 30\u2009min prior to intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection into the right lateral ventricles of the rats. Apart from na\u00efve rats used for blank controls, animals received i.c.v. injections (coordinates: 0.9\u2009mm anterior-posterior, 1.4\u2009mm lateral to the right, and 4.6\u2009mm depth, with respect to bregma) of either 10\u2009\u03bcL vehicle control (50% nanoparticle, 5\u2009\u03bcL nanoparticle mixed with 5\u2009\u03bcL distilled water), 10\u2009\u03bcL nanoparticle coupled 100\u2009\u03bcg scrambled siRNA controls, 10\u2009\u03bcL nanoparticle siRNA-Fyn (100\u2009\u03bcg/rat), or 10\u2009\u03bcL nanoparticle siRNA-c-Src (100\u2009\u03bcg/rat). One day after i.c.v. injections, rats were euthanized, and hippocampi dissected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80\u00b0C.\nTotal RNA was extracted from the brain tissue using mirVana PARIS kit (Lifetech, Carlsbad, CA). Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted using primers specific for Fyn (Fyn 270 FWD: CTGACGGAGGAGAGGGACG; Fyn 399 REV: GGCTGCGTGGAAGTTGTTGTA) and primers specific for c-Src (c-Src 1224 FWD: GTGCAAAGTGGCCGACTTTG; c-Src 1363 REV: ACACGTCCGACTTGATGGTG) (Lifetech) according to a standard SYBR Green RT-PCR protocol. 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was used as internal controls for RT-PCR. Statistical differences were determined using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett's\npost hoc\ntest.\n\nLateral fluid percussion\nRats were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane (Minrad, New York, NY), intubated, and mounted in a stereotaxic frame. Experimental TBI was produced using a fluid percussion device (VCU Biomedical Engineering, Richmond, VA) as described previously.\n7\nBriefly, a 4.8-mm diameter craniotomy was performed with a trephine that was centered at 4.5\u2009mm posterior to bregma and 3.0\u2009mm lateral to the sagittal suture on the right parietal bone. A rigid plastic injury tube (modified Luer-Loc needle hub, 2.6\u2009mm inside diameter) was glued over the craniectomy with cyanoacrylate adhesive. After connecting the injury tube to the fluid percussion device, a fluid percussion pulse of 2.15 atm was delivered within 10\u2009sec to achieve moderate TBI.\n\nTreatment groups following TBI in rats\nRats (\nn\n=\u200939) were divided into five groups, including sham operation/ siRNA-scramble (\nn\n=\u20095), TBI/siRNA-scramble (\nn\n=\u200910), TBI/siRNA-Fyn (\nn\n=\u20098), TBI/siRNA-c-Src (\nn\n=\u20098), TBI/siRNA-Fyn/siRNA-c-Src (\nn\n=\u20098). The animals had i.c.v. injections of siRNA-scramble (100\u2009\u03bcg/animal, in 10\u2009\u03bcL volume with 5\u2009\u03bcl distilled water and 5\u2009\u03bcL nanoparticle, siRNA-Fyn (100\u2009\u03bcg/animal), siRNA-c-Src (100\u03bcg/animal), or combined siRNA-Fyn (100\u2009\u03bcg/animal) and siRNA-c-Src (100\u2009\u03bcg/animal) 1 day prior to TBI or sham surgery in rats. The siRNA-Fyn (Sense, GCUUGUACAGCAUUACUCATT; Antisense, UGAGUAAUGCUGUACAAGCTG), siRNA-c-Src (Sense, GGCUCAUAGAGGACAACGATT; Antisense, UCGUUGUCCUCUAUGAGCCGG) or siRNA-scramble (Ambion, Austin, TX) were wrapped with nanoparticles (Altogen Biosystems) and incubated at room temperature for 30\u2009min prior to being injected into the right lateral ventricles of the rats.\nLateral fluid percussion\u2013induced moderate TBI was performed 24\u2009h after i.c.v. injection of siRNA-nanoparticle complexes. Following spatial memory assessments in the Morris water maze (MWM), the rats were anesthetized and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), and brains were removed for immunohistochemistry.\n\nTreatment with ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 following TBI in rats\nRats (\nn\n=\u200918) were divided into three groups (4-6 rats/group) for the acute study: sham operation/vehicle (5% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] in 2\u2009mL saline, intraperitoneally [i.p.],\nn\n=\u20094); TBI/vehicle (5% DMSO in 2\u2009mL saline, i.p.,\nn\n=\u20098); and TBI/Y-27632 (10\u2009mg/kg, i.p., immediately after TBI,\nn\n=\u20096). For example, a rat (body weight at 300\u2009g in the group of 10\u2009mg/kg) received i.p. injection of 2\u2009mL saline containing 3.33\u2009mg Y-27632 pre-dissolved in 0.1\u2009mL DMSO. Twenty-four hours after TBI, the rats were anesthetized and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, and the brains were fixed for immunohistochemistry.\nRats (\nn\n=\u200923) were divided into three groups for the chronic study, including sham operation (\nn\n=\u20095), TBI/vehicle (\nn\n=\u200912) and TBI/Y-27632 (10\u2009mg/kg, i.p.,\nn\n=\u20097). The three groups of rats received the same TBI surgery and treatment (either Y-27632 or vehicle) as in the acute study, except that these animals were sacrificed after spatial memory assessments.\n\nMorris water maze\nSpatial memory was assessed using the MWM on Days 12-16 after TBI as described previously.\n7\nThe test apparatus consisted of a large white circular tank (183\u2009cm diameter by 60\u2009cm high) filled with water to a depth of 22\u2009cm. Water temperature was maintained at 24-28 \u00b0C. A transparent circular escape platform (12.8\u2009cm diameter, 20\u2009cm high) was placed in a fixed position in the tank 2\u2009cm below the water surface. Four consistent visual cues were located in the test room outside of the maze. Rats were released from one of four starting points (selected randomly on each day for each rat) and allowed 120\u2009sec to find and mount the escape platform. If the rat did not find the platform within 120\u2009sec, the experimenter placed the rat on the platform. The rat remained on the platform for 30\u2009sec before being removed from the maze. The rat received a 4-min inter-trial interval in a warmed holding cage before being returned to the maze for subsequent trials. Rats received a total of four trials per day, one from each starting point, over 5 consecutive days, and probe trials 24\u2009h after the last trial. Mean latency to find the platform was calculated for each day as well as the mean swim speed. Statistical differences were determined using repeated measures ANOVA with assessment days as the repeated variable within subjects followed by Dunnett's\npost hoc\ntest.\n\nBrain processing and immunohistochemistry\nAfter completing probe trials in MWM, rats were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane and transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then 4% PFA on Day 16 after TBI. After PFA perfusion, the brains were removed, post-fixed 2-6\u2009h, and placed in 30% sucrose in PBS. The fixed rat brains were embedded in frozen section medium and mounted on a microtome. Coronal sections (50\u2009\u03bcm) were cut on a freezing microtome. The avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Vectastain Elite ABC Kit, Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) method was used to perform NeuN (a marker of mature neurons) immunohistochemistry as described previously.\n7\n\nStereological cell counts\nNeuN-stained cells were counted on a microscope (Nikon E600, Nikon, Tokyo) with a motorized stage (Bioprecision2) controlled using computer software (Stereo Investigator\u2122 8.0) as described previously.\n7\nSerial sections cut at 50\u2009\u03bcm thick were collected from bregma -2.80\u2009mm to approximately bregma -4.16\u2009mm for a total of 30 sections. Every third section was used for NeuN staining for a total of 10 sections per brain. Briefly, the border of CA2/3 of the brain was outlined using a 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009objective. A 100\u2009\u00d7\u2009oil immersion objective (1.4 numerical aperture) with oil condenser was used for cell counting. The NeuN-positive neurons were counted if the soma fell within the counting frame or were on the inclusion line. Estimated numbers of the NeuN-positive neurons in the target brain region were generated by the Stereologer software using the following equation:\nN\nobj\n=\n(\n\u2211\nN\n)\n(1/SSF) (1/ASF)(1/TSF).\n32\nIn this equation\n\u2211\nN\no\nb\nj\nindicates the sum of objects sampled in the sections, SSF indicates the section sampling fraction, ASF indicates the area sampling fraction, and TSF indicates the thickness sampling fraction. Statistical differences were determined using an unpaired t-test."

Standard rat chow food and water were provided\nad libitum\n. Upon arrival, animals were allowed to acclimate to the colony room for 1 week. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care Use Committee of the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC; New Orleans, LA) and were conducted in accordance with the National Institute of Health (NIH) guidelines.\n\nSurgical procedure\nAnimals underwent craniotomy (2\u2009mm posterior to bregma and 3\u2009mm lateral to the midline; corresponding to the somatomotor cortex [SMC] area) before TBI, as previously described.\n35\n,\n36\nSMC was selected because previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that the amygdala is highly sensitive to lesions in this area, resulting in alteration of BLA-related behaviors such as anxiety-like behavior\n21\nand alcohol consumption.\n20\nAlso, prior biochemistry experiments reveal that TBI in SMC increases pGLUR1\nS845\nand pGR\nS232\nlevels in CeA 2 weeks after injury\n21\nand decreases 2AG levels in BLA 1\u2009h after injury.\n24\nAnimals were anesthetized (4% isoflurane in oxygen 2\u2009L/min) for 4\u2009min and then they were placed in a stereotaxic frame (model 900; Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA) with anesthesia (2-3% isoflurane in oxygen 1\u2009L/min) through a nose mask. After the skull was exposed through an incision in the midline, a craniotomy (5\u2009mm in diameter) was performed. A Luer Loc connector was positioned directly over the craniotomy and secured with cyanoacrylate glue. Dental cement (Lang Dental Manufacturing, Wheeling, IL) was applied around the female Luer Loc connector and allowed to harden prior to the Luer being filled with saline and capped. Animals were administered topical bupivacaine on the surgical area. Animals were recovered under temperature-controlled conditions before being returned to their individual home cages.\n\nTraumatic brain injury (lateral fluid percussion)\nLateral fluid percussion injury (LFP) was performed as previously described by our laboratory.\n35\n,\n36\nThis model is one of the most widely used in pre-clinical studies that reproduce the histopathology associated with TBI in humans.\n37\nThree days after craniotomy, animals were randomly assigned to TBI or Sham group. Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (4% induction and 2-3% maintenance) and positioned in a stereotaxic frame, the female Luer Loc was connected to the LFP system (Fluid Percussion Injury, Model 01-B, Custom Design and Fabrication, Virginia Commonwealth University) by pressure tubing. The occurrence of mild, moderate, and severe TBI in rats using lateral fluid percussion has been described as 1.8-2.2 atm (26-32 psi), 2.4-2.8 (35-41 psi), and >2.8 atm (41 psi), respectively.\n38\n,\n39\nAnesthesia was lowered to 1% and after 1\u2009min, a mild fluid percussion (26-32 psi) was delivered. Given that female animals in Study 1 had worse physiological response to TBI, we reduced the range of psi in females for Study 2, (26-28 psi), yet kept it within the range of mild TBI.\n38\n,\n39\nAnimals were then monitored for signs of apnea and respiratory rate (breathing per minute). Sham animals underwent an identical procedure, but no lesion was produced. For Study 1, animals were sacrificed 1\u2009h after TBI, by decapitation under deep isoflurane anesthesia, and brains were excised and frozen in methyl butane on dry ice and stored at -80\u00b0C until further processing. For Study 2, 1\u2009h after TBI, animals were intracardially perfused with an\nN\n-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG) based artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) under deep isoflurane anesthesia prior to brain excision.\n\nStudy 1\nRNAscope assay\nA total of 24 rats were used in this experiment RNAscope\nin situ\nhybridization is a method that allows visualization of single mRNA molecules in the cell through the use of specifically designed probes and a hybridization-based signal amplification system.\n40\nWe used RNAscope markers for vGat and vGlut to \u201cphenotype\u201d the cells in BLA. Transcripts for vesicular glutamate and vesicular GABAergic transporter are reliable markers of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, respectively, and are detectable in the cell body. Rat brain coronal slices 10\u2009\u03bcm thickness were obtained using a cryostat. Sections from 1.56 to 3.36\u2009mm posterior to bregma\n41\nwere collected and mounted onto Super Frost Plus (Fisher Scientific) slides. To ensure that the entire structure was sampled for our quantification, we divided the BLA into three portions, anterior-posterior (AP): anterior (-1,56, -2.04), middle (-2.16, -2.76), and posterior (-2.92, -3.36) using a rat brain atlas.\n41\nOne slide from each depth was taken for quantification. RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Kit\n\u00ae\n(Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Newark, CA) was used according to the user manual for fresh frozen tissue.\nBriefly, brain tissue was fixed in chilled (4\u00b0C) paraformaldehyde in 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Fisher Scientific) for 15\u2009min. Sections were dehydrated in ethanol (50%, 70%, 100%, 100%) for 5\u2009min each. After dry, 2-4 drops of warmed protease 3 solution were placed on each slice for 45\u2009min at room temperature. Slides were washed with agitation in 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009PBS (2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009min) and were covered with 80-100\u2009\u03bcL of the probe for 2\u2009h at 40\u00b0C in a HybEZ oven. Probes used in this experiment were c-fos (C1; Rn-Fos, Cat #403591), a marker of cell activation, vesicular glutamate transporter (vGlut\n;\nC2; Rn-Slc17a7, Cat # 317001), a marker of glutamatergic neurons, and vesicular GABA transporter (vGat; C3; Rn-SLc32a1, Cat # 424541) a marker of GABAergic neurons. Probes were diluted according to manufacturer's instructions. The C2 and C3 probes were mixed 1:50 with the C1 probe. Slides were removed from the oven and incubated in 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009saline-sodium citrate buffer for 15\u2009min; 2-4 drops of amplifier reagents were placed on the tissue followed by washes in wash buffer (2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009min each). Incubation time was 40\u2009min for Amp1, and 20\u2009min for both Amp2 and Amp3.\nThen, sections were incubated (20\u2009min) with fluorescently labeled probes by selecting specific combination of colors associated with each channel green (Alexa 488\u2009nm), orange (Atto 550\u2009nm) and far red (Atto 647\u2009nm). Amp4 Alt A was used to detect triplex c-fos, vGlut and vGat RNAs in green, orange, and far red, respectively. Slides were cover-slipped using a mounting medium containing 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; ProLong Gold, Life Technologies Carlsbad) and left to dry at 4\u00b0C until visualization in the microscope. Negative controls were included and processed identically to ensure that there was no background noise and that the tissue was appropriately prepared. Universal negative control with a probe targeting DapB gene from a soil bacterium (Bacillus subtilis strain SMY) was used (RNAscope 3-plex Negative Control Probe, Cat # 320871).\nImaging processing and cell quantification\nImages were captured with the ZEISS AxioScan.Z1 slide scanner and analyzed with Zeiss Zen Lite software. Negative controls were quantified first. For each cell, we counted the total pixels of the fluorescent signal (fluorescent dots) assuming that each pixel represents a single molecule of mRNA. The mean plus 3 standard deviations was used as threshold. The selection criterion for c-fos, vGlut, and vGat positive cells were \u226514, \u2265 11, and \u226510 positive pixels, respectively, after adjusting the threshold using Zeiss Zen Lite software.\n\nStudy 2\nA total of 25 rats were used in this experiment. Electrophysiology brain slice preparation and recording were performed as previously described.\n24\n,\n42\n,\n43\nBriefly, brains were removed and sliced (Leica VT1200-S vibratome, Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL) in room temperature aCSF containing (in mM): 92 NMDG, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 30 NaHCO\n3\n, 20 HEPES, 25 glucose, 2 thiourea, 5 Na-ascorbate, 3 Na-pyruvate, 0.5 CaCl\n2\n, 10 MgSO\n4\n; pH is titrated to 7.3-7.4 with concentrated hydrochloric acid\n44\nCoronal slices containing BLA were then transferred to a holding chamber (containing the same NMDG solution as slicing) in a water heat bath kept at 37\u00b0C. After 12\u2009min, slices were removed from the holding chamber in the heat bath and allowed to rest at room temperature in a chamber containing holding solution for 45\u2009min before the start of electrophysiological recordings. The holding solution consisted of (in mM): 92 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 30 NaHCO\n3\n, 20 HEPES, 25 glucose, 2 thiourea, 5 Na-ascorbate, 3 Na-pyruvate, 2 CaCl\n2\n, 2 MgSO\n4\n.\nAt the time of recording, slices were transferred to the slice chamber in an electrophysiology rig in a recording aCSF kept at 30-32\u00b0C by an in-line heater. The recording solution consisted of (in mM): 119 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 24 NaHCO\n3\n, 12.5 glucose, 2 CaCl\n2\n, 2 MgSO\n4\n. Whole\u2013cell recordings were performed using borosilicate glass micropipettes (3-7 MOhm) filled with internal solution containing (in mM): 130 K-gluconate, 10 HEPES, 10 Na\n2\n-phosphocreatine, 4 MgCl\n2\n, 4 Na\n2\n-ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP, 3 ascorbic acid, 0.2 EGTA (pH 7.25, 290-295\u2009mOsm). Pyramidal neurons on the side ipsilateral to the injury were identified and targeted for recordings based on cell body size and pyramidal-like somatic morphology.\n45\n,\n46\nRecordings were collected as previously described.\n24\n,\n42\nElectrical signals were amplified and digitized by a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA). Recordings were sampled at 10\u2009kHz and low pass filtered with a cutoff of 4\u2009kHz. Signals were further filtered offline in Matlab with a cutoff of 2\u2009kHz. Recordings were excluded if the series resistance was above 30 MOhm or the spike height, recorded in current clamp mode, was less than 60\u2009mV. Synaptic properties were assessed by quantifying amplitude and rates of spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs and sIPSCs). When whole\u2013cell recording configuration was established, the voltage was clamped at -70\u2009mV (for sEPSCs) or -50\u2009mV (for sIPSCs) and 5\u2009min of spontaneous postsynaptic currents (PSCs) were recorded. Spontaneous postsynaptic events were detected in these recordings by thresholding rapid excursions in inward current (@ -70\u2009mV holding potential) or outward current (@ -50\u2009mV holding potential); the average event amplitude and mean frequency over the 5\u2009min recording period were quantified.\nExcitatory to inhibitory (E/I) amplitude and frequency ratios were calculated as the ratio of mean parameters from neurons in which both recordings were collected. Estimated quantities related to intrinsic excitability included: resting membrane potential (RMP), input resistance, voltage sag, action potential firing in response to depolarization and action potential firing gain. Rebound response to hyperpolarization-activated inward current, known as the voltage sag, was calculated as \u0394V2 / \u0394V1, where \u0394V1 is the difference between pre-step baseline voltage (-70\u2009mV) and the steady-state voltage during step current injection, and \u0394V2 is the difference between current step steady-state voltage and the minimum voltage during current injection. Voltage sag\n47\n,\n48\nis reflective of subthreshold current mediated by hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide\u2013gated channels, also known as\nI\nh\n. Input current steps of varying current amplitudes were delivered and the membrane voltage response to these current step inputs was recorded. Action potentials during each current step were counted and used to construct a firing rate-input (FI) curve. The FI curve gain was quantified by calculating the slope of the curve between 100 and 500 pA.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM). In Study 1, injury pressure and apnea were analyzed with a two-tailed t-test, and respiratory rate with two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), factors (Injury: Sham vs TBI; and Sex: male vs female). In Study 2, injury pressure and apnea were analyzed with a two-tailed t-test, and respiratory rate with two-way ANOVA, factors (Injury: Sham vs. TBI; and Sex: male vs. female). RNAscope data were analyzed with two-way ANOVA. Significant interactions were followed up using\npost hoc\nanalysis with Tukey's multiple comparisons test. Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 7 software (Graphpad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). Electrophysiological data and statistical analysis were performed in Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA). Statistical comparisons of electrophysiological parameters were performed using two-way ANOVA, factors (Injury: Sham vs. TBI; and Sex: male vs. female). In the case of significant ANOVA result for at least one factor or interaction effect,\npost hoc\ncomparisons were performed using Tukey's honest significant difference. For the firing rate input current curves, we performed an additional three-way repeated measures ANOVA where input current was the repeated measures within-subjects factor.\n49\nIn the Sham male group, there are five rats with an average of six neural recordings per rat (\nN\n=\u200930 neurons). In the Sham female group, there are seven rats with an average of 4.7 neural recordings per rat (\nN\n=\u200933 neurons). In the TBI male group there are six rats with an average of 5.2 neural recordings per rat (\nN\n=\u200931 neurons). In the TBI female group there are seven rats with an average of 5.1 neural recordings per group (\nN\n=\u200936 neurons). Statistical analysis performed on electrophysiological data was done considering each recording parameter as an independent measurement (i.e.,\nN\n=\u2009# of neurons). Neural properties exhibit significant heterogeneity, even within cell class and neural property heterogeneities can be important for determining neural circuit function.\n50\n,\n51\nOne concern, however, is that collecting multiple samples from the same animal may result in pseudo-replication under certain conditions\u2014specifically, when the intra-group variance of individual animal averaged parameters (animal means) is large relative to the individual data point variance within an animal there is an increased chance of obtaining type I errors (false positives).\n52\nOne tool to assess this risk is calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), which quantifies the relative mean discrepancy within groups.\n53\nHere, we calculate the ICC for every electrophysiological parameter that we found a significant two-way ANOVA effect."

    "Methods": "Participants\nThe\nT\nransforming\nR\nesearch\na\nnd\nC\nlinical\nK\nnowledge in\nTBI\n(TRACK-TBI) prospective cohort study enrolled 2697 participants with TBI at 18 U.S. level 1 trauma centers between February 26, 2014 and July 3, 2018. Participants were evaluated at 2 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months post-injury. All TBI participants sustained a TBI <24\u2009h before enrollment and received an acute head computed tomography (CT) for clinical care. TRACK-TBI also enrolled 299 OTCs who sustained an orthopedic injury with Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) \u22644 and no alteration of consciousness or post-traumatic amnesia from the same sites between January 26, 2016 and July 27, 2018; 300 FCs, friends or family members of TBI participants with no traumatic injury within the year preceding enrollment, were enrolled from May 26, 2017 to September 25, 2019. The current analysis included participants \u226517 years of age who completed the symptom measure at least one time. Participants too impaired to complete the full TRACK-TBI outcome battery had an abbreviated assessment that did not assess symptoms. For more detailed information about inclusion and exclusion criteria, see McCrea and colleagues.\n28\nThe institutional review boards of each participating site approved this study.\n\nPrimary outcome measure\nThe Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ)\n29\nconsists of 16 symptoms that participants rate to indicate severity of the symptom experienced in the past 7 days compared to before the injury. The instructions for the FCs were modified by removing any reference to TBI or accident, and they were asked to compare their symptoms in the past 7 days to what they had experienced during the equivalent time before the assessment, for example relating back 3 months before the 3-month assessment. The RPQ was administered at each assessment time point. Symptoms were rated as not experienced at all (0), no more of a problem compared to before the injury (1), a mild problem (2), a moderate problem (3), or a severe problem (4). A symptom was considered endorsed if the participant rated it from 2 to 4, (i.e., either new or more of a problem than pre-injury). RPQ scores range from 0 to 64. To calculate the total symptom score, items rated 1 were recoded to 0 before summing across all symptoms.\n\nStatistical analysis\nRPQ total score and number of symptoms endorsed at each time point, endorsement of each symptom, and persistence of each symptom over adjacent assessments are presented descriptively. Percent persistence was defined as the number of participants endorsing a symptom at both times divided by the number who endorsed it at the earlier assessment. We used linear mixed models, including group or TBI subgroup, time (categorical), and their interaction, to formally evaluate the pattern of recovery and its consistency across groups or TBI subgroups. We defined mTBI as Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)\n30\n13\u201315 and msTBI as GCS 3\u201312. If interactions were non-significant, we ran the mixed model with only main effects. To examine whether results were unduly influenced by the skew of the RPQ scores, we performed sensitivity analyses on ranks of the score within the entire sample combined over group and time. Threshold for significance, adjusted for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate for each linear model and rank-based model separately,\n31\nwas\np\n<\u20090.05. Analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 19; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) and SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC)."

    "Methods": "Participants\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of youth between 13 and 20 years old participating in a broader prospective study through the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) Minds Matter Concussion Program from February 2018 to October 2021. Uninjured participants were recruited through the sports teams of a local Philadelphia-area school. They had the opportunity to participate in clinical assessments in association with their sports season. Concussed participants were recruited from the same high school or from the CHOP Minds Matter Concussion Program.\nConcussion diagnosis was determined by a trained sports medicine pediatrician according to the Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sports.\n18\nAll concussed participants\u201d data were collected within 28 days of their concussion. Assent and consent were obtained from participants and guardians, respectively, and the study was approved by the CHOP Institutional Review Board in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\nParticipants were prescreened to ensure normal or corrected to normal binocular and monocular visual acuity using a Snellen visual acuity chart at 10 feet. Fifty-nine participants (20 uninjured, 39 concussed) wore corrective lenses during testing. Age, sex, race, ethnicity, and concussion and migraine history (self and family) were self-reported for uninjured participants and abstracted from the medical record for concussed participants.\n\nData collection sessions\nData were collected at a single recording session from uninjured youth as part of a pre- or post-season sports evaluation and from concussed youth during clinical visits for concussion management. Trained research staff conducted clinical assessments in either the athletic training room at the high school, primarily for uninjured athletes, or the sports medicine office, primarily for concussed participants. In the case where more than one recording session was collected, only the first was used for this analysis.\nSymptom inventory\nOnce before testing, all participants completed the Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI), a scale validated in youth for measuring concussion symptoms.\n9\nThe question on feeling different since the concussion was excluded from the total PCSI score because this question was not applicable to the uninjured group.\nVisio-vestibular assessment\nAll participants underwent visio-vestibular examination (VVE) before assessment of visually evoked effects to assess (1) smooth pursuit for five repetitions, (2) horizontal and vertical saccades for 30 repetitions, (3) horizontal and vertical VOR for 30 repetitions, (4) VMS for five repetitions, and (5) near point convergence, with abnormal defined as a break point where vision becomes double at greater than 6\u2009cm. For all other metrics, abnormality was defined as provocation of symptoms limiting the number of repetitions the participant was able to complete. For more detailed information on the VVE, refer to our previous work, which has shown it to be reliable and specific for concussion across multiple clinical settings.\n7\n,\n19\u201322\nVisually evoked effects\nParticipants viewed a wide field 85% contrast checkerboard with a pattern reversal rate of two reversals per second. Stimuli were presented for five continuous 20\u2009sec blocks. The full description of the visual stimulus conditions can be found in our previous report.\n23\nEye movements were assessed during and after each recording session. While examining eye movements, experimenters also documented the presence or absence of the following physical signs of visual discomfort: eyes watering, eyes reddening, eyes slowing, circular eye movements, or \u201cother signs.\u201d\nAt the end of the recording session, participants were asked if they experienced provocation or worsening of the following symptoms: dizziness, headache, nausea, eye pain, eye fatigue, or other symptoms. No participants displayed circular eye movements, eye slowing, and no \u201cother signs\u201d were reported, so these were not included in data analysis. Other symptoms that were entered via free text included \u201ceyes tired\u201d (4), \u201deyes foggy\u201d (1), \u201ceye strain\u201d (1), \u201cblurry vision,\u201d \u201cblurriness,\u201d or \u201ceye blur\u201d (2), \u201cdouble vision\u201d (1), \u201ceyes dry\u201d (2), \u201cfeeling out of it\u201d (1). Because the \u201cother symptoms\u201d responses were heterogenous and the same symptoms were not reported frequently, these symptoms were excluded from data analysis.\n\nData analysis\nAll analyses were performed using custom written code in Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA).\n24\nDemographic data\nDemographics were compared between the uninjured and concussed groups using a Fisher exact test for percentage data, and Kruskal-Wallis testing for interval data. A\np\nvalue <0.05 was used as the threshold for significance throughout. Concussion history, migraine history, and migraine family history were also compared, because some studies\n25\n,\n26\n(although not all\n27\n) indicate these are predictors for prolonged concussion symptoms. The median was reported for age (in years), days post-injury, and individual and total PCSI scores. All values were reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) derived by bootstrap analysis.\nAnalysis of visually evoked effects\nMultiple correspondence analysis (MCA) was used across all participants to reduce the dimensionality of seven visually evoked effects: dizziness, headache, nausea, eyes watering, eye fatigue, eyes reddening, and eye pain. The MCA reduces the dimensionality of categorical data in Euclidean space,\n28\nwhich is analogous to principal component analysis for quantitative data. Factor loadings represent the geometrical distance between the presence or absence of a visually evoked effect, with 0 being the center point of the variation. The code used to perform MCA was based on the indicator matrix, adapted from publicly available code.\n29\nThe first two dimensions represented (1) the presence or absence of visually evoked effects and (2) whether effects were eye- or brain-predominant. These two primary dimensions were used to separate participants into three visually evoked effects categories: (1) no effects, defined as a dimension 1 factor loading of -1 or less, (2) eye-predominant effects defined as a dimension 1 factor loading of greater than -1 and dimension 2 factor loading of 0.1 or less, and (3) brain-predominant effects defined as a dimension 1 factor loading greater than -1 and a dimension 2 factor loading of greater than 0.1.\nThese cutoffs are based on factor loadings of the individual visually evoked effects (\nSupplementary Table S1\n). The combined absence of all visually evoked effects is equal to a dimension 1 factor loading of -1.5, and the presence of one visually evoked effect could yield a dimension 1 loading as low as -0.7; therefore, a cutoff of -1 separated the no effects from eye- and brain-predominant categories effectively. The score of 0.1 was chosen to separate eye-predominant from brain-predominant effects because \u201ceye pain\u201d had a dimension 2 factor loading slightly above 0.\nThe percentage of participants per visually evoked effects category was compared between uninjured and concussed groups using cross-tabulation with chi-square statistical testing. Because of differences in PCSI and VVE between concussed and uninjured participants based on 95% CIs, statistical analysis for differences between visually evoked effects categories was conducted on the concussed group only. A Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare visually evoked effects categories across PCSI and VVE with H test estimated by chi-square distribution. Multiple comparisons with the Tukey method were used to determine significance between individual visually evoked effects categories."

Forty ipsilateral hippocampi were homogenized for protein extracts for Western blot analysis of cell death signaling targets (\nn\n=\u200910 WT-Sham,\nn\n=\u200910 WT-CCI,\nn\n=\u200910 KO-Sham, and\nn\n=\u200910 KO-CCI). Each group contained five males and five females. A total of 14 ipsilateral cortices were used for RNA extraction to use with the 84 gene RT\n2\nCell Death Profiler Array (\nn\n=\u20097 WT-CCI and\nn\n=\u20097 KO-CCI). To confirm increased ESR1 at the protein level, 20 contralateral hippocampi and 20 contralateral cortices from WT/KO male and female CCI-injured mice were used for protein extracts. A separate cohort of 60 mice were used for histological analysis of hippocampal CA1/CA3 neuronal counts (\nn\n=\u200910 WT-Sham,\nn\n=\u200910 Het-Sham,\nn\n=\u200910 KO-Sham,\nn\n=\u200910 WT-CCI,\nn\n=\u200910 Het-CCI, and\nn\n=\u200910 KO-CCI). Each group contained five males and five females.\n\nWestern blot\nWestern blot was performed using our published methodology.\n14\n,\n15\nBrain tissues were homogenized with a Bead Mill 24 (Fisher Scientific) set to 5.2\u2009m/sec (\u223c 5500\u2009rpm) at two cycles, with a 5\u2009min on-ice interval, to generate equivalent homogenates. Samples (20\u201330\u2009\u03bcg protein/well) were loaded onto 26-well Criterion TGX gels and electrophoresed with a Criterion Cell at 200V (Biorad). Protein was transferred to PVDF membranes with a plate-electrode Criterion Blotter (Biorad) and run 40\u2009min/100\u2009V/4\u00b0C. Membranes were stained with Reversible Swift Membrane Stain (Fisher Scientific) and scanned (600\u2009dpi) for densitometry. Blots were incubated with primary/secondary antibodies and imaged on a 9.1 MP iBright\u2122 CL1500 Imaging System (Fisher Scientific).\n\nHistology\nHistology was assessed as described by our group in the CCI model:\n16\n,\n17\n3\u2009mm coronal brain sections were formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and cut using a microtome (5\u2009\u03bcM sections). Sections were mounted on glass slides and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E; Thermo Scientific \u2013 Shandon; Pittsburgh, PA, USA) or anti-GFAP antibody. Images were captured on a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope (Nikon; Melville, NY, USA). Live cells (CA1 and CA3) in the stratum pyramidale hippocampus were counted, divided by the length of the CA1/CA3, and reported as cells/0.1\u2009mm. Analysis of H&E and neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN) was performed using NIS Elements Software. The technician quantifying CA1/CA3 cell counts was blind to genotype/injury. Whole field analysis of GFAP staining intensity with ImageJ was performed as previously described, with minor modifications.\n8\n\nRNA Isolation\nCortices were homogenized in Trizol\u00ae and incubated 15\u2009min with chloroform (1:5 volume) at room temperature. Samples were centrifugated 15\u2009min/12,000\ng\n. The aqueous phase was isolated and RNA precipitated with 1:1 volume of isopropanol. The RNA pellet was washed, air dried, and re-suspended in nuclease-free water. RNA concentration/purity were validated by Nanodrop (ThermoFisher Scientific). RNA integrity was confirmed by Tape Station\u00ae 4200 (Agilent; Santa Clara, CA, USA). The eRIN was >8.4 for all samples.\n\nReverse transcription (RT)\n2\ncell death profiler PCR array\nRT was performed on 400\u2009ng of gDNA-free, total RNA with the RT2 easy 1st strand kit (Qiagen; Germantown, MD, USA). cDNA was diluted in 1X RT3 SYBR Green buffer + ROX to 3\u2009pg/mL; 10\u2009\u03bcL of mastermix + cDNA solution was added to 384-well assay plates per Format E manufacturer instructions. Each 384 well plate had equal group representation to minimize batch effects. Thermocyling was performed on an AB7900HT standard block with enzyme activation at 95\u00b0C for 10\u2009min followed by 40 cycles of 15\u2009sec at 95\u00b0C and 1\u2009min at 60\u00b0C. Raw Ct values were determined using SDS 2.4 (ThermoFisher) with automatic baseline and manual threshold settings.\n\nStatistical analysis\nDensitometry of (1) total protein stain (TPS)/membrane and (2) targets of interest were measured with UN-SCAN-IT software (Silk Scientific; Orem, UT, USA). Target values were standardized by dividing each data point by the densitometry of the TPS corresponding to the target's lane.\n14\n,\n15\nStandardized densitometic values within each blot were then normalized by setting the highest value in each blot to 100% (i.e., for across blot pooling of data). The 40 hippocampal ipsilateral extracts for cell death signaling analysis were split across two 26-well criterion gels to ensure equal representation of genotype, sex, and injury on each blot. Data were analyzed using a three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's multiple comparison post-hoc test. Data were expressed as the relative difference in target expression. Cell counts were obtained and expressed as cells/0.1\u2009mm. Data were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparison test. Data were significant at\np\n<\u20090.05. Histological data from H&E and NeuN were also analyzed via the Bland\u2013Altman method for estimation of bias. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) data were analyzed in GeneGlobe Data Analysis Center (\nhttps://geneglobe.qiagen.com/us/analyze\n). Expression levels were normalized using the average geometric mean of housekeeping controls Atg12, Atp6v1g2, and Bcl2a1a. Fold regulation was reported based on the \u0394\u0394CT method. Uncorrected\np\nvalues were calculated based on a Student's\nt\ntest of the replicate 2^(-\u0394CT) values for each gene in the control versus the treatment group(s). Gene changes were considered significant if: (1)\np\n<\u20090.05 and (2) fold change was <-2 or 2>."

    "Methods": "Participants and procedure\nFormer collegiate athletes (15-years removed from football participation) were recruited from various different National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) member institutions that had previously participated in an online health survey in 2014 (\u223c 24% response rate).\n22\nPotential participants were screened for eligibility by a research coordinator based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria consisted of at least 1 year of collegiate football participation. Exclusion criteria involved a history of psychotic disorder with active symptoms, as well as contraindications to neuroimaging and to travel for in-person visit. Those who were enrolled completed comprehensive evaluations at the Medical College of Wisconsin or the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Participants were reimbursed for their travel-related expenses. This study was approved by institutional review boards (IRB) and all participants provided written informed consent prior to study activities.\n\nMeasures\nHIEE\nTo estimate RHI, individuals provided information related to each year of football participation, including the average number and length of contact practices per week, primary/secondary position, the number of games that they played, and the percentage of time played from the following choices: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% at each level of play through structured interview.\n16\nBased on this information, the number of contact hours for each individual year of participation was generated and a single estimate of the number of head impacts sustained in the course of those contact hours was derived. Head impact exposure for each year was then estimated and weighted by position and level of play based on previously published Head Impact Telemetry System (HITS) data.\n23\n,\n24\nYears of participation has been utilized most commonly as a proxy measure of RHI in prior studies. As such, sensitivity analyses ensured that results were comparable when measuring RHI using HIEE and years of participation. Consistent with previous studies, years of participation were calculated by querying years in which participants first began and stopped playing football.\n4\n,\n25\n,\n26\nModerating factors\nModerators of interest included two metrics of estimated IQ and education history. The first IQ estimate was based on Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR) performance, a measure of single word reading. WTAR performance strongly correlates (0.70\u20130.80) with full scale intelligence quotient scores on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III and is commonly used as a \u201chold test\u201d of pre-morbid function in those with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and other disease populations.\n27\u201330\nPicture vocabulary from the National Institute of Health Toolbox Cognition Battery, a measure of receptive vocabulary, was used as a secondary IQ estimate. Measures of picture vocabulary have also been observed as effective \u201chold\u201d measures.\n31\nThe current sample consisted of former collegiate football players who had all graduated from their undergraduate institutions, and therefore education was binarized into those with a bachelor's degree and those who had completed graduate education (Master's degree, Juris Doctor, Doctor of Philosophy).\nConcussion History\nThe number of prior concussions sustained during participation in sports and non-sports-related concussions (e.g., from motor vehicle accidents, falls, or violence) were self-reported by participants (not necessarily formally diagnosed). Participants were provided with a standard definition of concussion (Supplementary Methods).\n32\nBased on a previously observed dose response relationship with prior concussion and select outcomes of interest,\n33\n,\n34\ntotal lifetime concussion history was discretized into four categories (0\u20131, 2\u20134, 5\u20137, \u2265 8) and treated as an ordinal variable based on the distribution of the sample (i.e., comparable size of concussion history groups). This approach was selected as the most parsimonious way to test the linear association of cumulative concussion history with volumetric outcomes while trying to balance distribution across the sample.\n\nImaging protocol and processing\nImages were acquired using 32-channel head coils on 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems (UNC Siemens Prisma, MCW GE Discovery MR750). Images used for anatomical volumetric processing included contrast matched T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) and three-dimensional (3D) T2-weighted variable flip angle (Siemens Space, GE Cube) acquisitions with 1\u2009mm isotropic resolution (see Supplementary Methods for full protocols). Based on previous literature suggesting their potential as regions of vulnerability to RHI, the primary structural regions of interest included the bilateral hippocampal and thalamic volume. Other primary outcomes of interest included total gray matter and total subcortical gray matter. Secondary regions of interest included the amygdala, dorsal striatum, globus pallidus, nucleus accumbens, and whole-brain cortical thickness based on their associations with our predictors of interest being less robustly characterized in the literature. Given the multi-site nature of the study, the ComBat harmonization model for imaging (NeuroCombat) was utilized to reduce site and protocol as a source of potential bias (\nFig. 1\n;\nSupplementary Table S1\n).\n35\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSite effects of primary outcomes of interest and corrected volumes based on NeuroCombat harmonization. Significant differences across the three protocols were observed for hippocampal, nucleus accumbens, and total gray matter volume, as well as for total cortical thickness. Following adjustment for site related effects, significant differences across these regions of interest were no longer statistically significant,\np\ns\u2009>\u20090.05.

    "Methods": "Study design and ethics approval\nA multi-center study was performed by the Japan Association of Spine Surgeons with Ambition (JASA) as a retrospective analysis of inpatients aged \u226565 years with cervical spinal cord and/or spine injury at 33 medical centers between 2010 and 2020, with a minimum follow-up period of three months. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the representative facility (No. 3352-1) and each center. A total of 1512 eligible patients were identified, of whom 614 (40.6%) had a diagnosis of CSCI without major bone injury; 591 of these patients were enrolled in the study (\nFig. 1\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG 1.\nFlowchart for analyses of American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS) A, B, and C cases and AIS D cases.\nThe definition of CSCI without major bone injury was SCI with no evidence of spinal fracture or dislocation on plain radiography or computed tomography.\n3\nThe 23 excluded patients had incomplete clinical and functional follow-up data. The following data were obtained: patient background (age, gender, body mass index [BMI]), imaging findings (presence of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament [OPLL]), signal change in the cervical spinal cord on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the time of injury, cause of SCI (low-energy trauma, higher-energy trauma), diagnostic delay (> 24\u2009h after injury), comorbidity (dementia/delirium, diabetes, hypertension), treatment (administration of methylprednisolone, operative or conservative), and post-injury complications (pneumonia, complicated injuries).\nDemographic data of the patients are presented in\nTable 1\n. The mean age of participants was 75.3 years and the male:female ratio was 3:1.

    "Methods": "De-identified data were provided by the National Collegiate Athletic Association Department of Defense Grand Alliance (NCAA-DOD) Concussion Assessment, Research, and Education (CARE) Consortium from 2014-2017. The CARE consortium consists of multi-year, multi-modal assessment of the natural history of concussion described in greater detail elsewhere.23Participants signed a site-specific institutional review board\u2013approved consent form that was also approved by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command Human Research Protection Office.23All participants completed a comprehensive demographics and health history questionnaire including self-reported ADHD or LD diagnoses.\n\nParticipants were categorized according to the self-reported responses of having been diagnosed with ADHD or LD into four groups: 1) Controls; 2) ADHD; 3) LD; and 4) ADHD+LD (athletes responding an affirmative to both ADHD and LD). All athlete demographics and self-reported diagnoses of NDs and history of concussion were taken from evaluation Year 1 only. We chose, any, one, and two or more concussions for analyses due to a small number of athletes with three or more concussions in our groups of interest. Control athletes who reported having no prior diagnoses of NDs but reported having repeated a year of school were excluded from analyses to control for undiagnosed or unreported NDs (n=\u20091,239). Athletes with non-responses to sex also were excluded (n=\u20098;Fig. 1). For categorical contact analyses, we utilized the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) contact categories such as contact, limited-contact, non-contact sports, and non-NCAA athletes (i.e., intramurals and military service academy cadets).24Herein, we acknowledge that concussions occurring prior to CARE enrollment are all self-reported and were included for retrospective analyses. Prospective analyses included athletes incurring a concussion following CARE enrollment and injuries which were identified and verified by team medical personnel using the evidence-based DoD criteria.25\n\nStatistical analysis\nInitially, frequencies were performed to identify athletes with any history of concussion, one prior, and two or more prior concussions among groups and by sex (\nTable 1\n). We used contingency tables (2\u2009\u00d7\u20092) to calculate crude odds and crude relative risk ratios for all analyses. Retrospective odds ratios were then calculated to determine the odds for having a history of single, and multiple concussions for athletes with ADHD, LD, and ADHD+LD, relative to controls (\nTable 2\n). To examine the influence of NDs within sexes, retrospective odds ratios were calculated for single, and multiple concussions for female and male athletes with ADHD, LD, and ADHD+LD, relative to sex-specific controls. To examine the influence of NCAA contact category, retrospective odds ratios were calculated to determine the odds for having history of single, and multiple concussions by NCAA contact category for athletes with ADHD, LD, and ADHD+LD, relative to controls (\nTable 3\n). To examine the influence of NCAA contact categories between sexes, retrospective odds ratios were calculated to determine the odds of concussion history by NCAA contact category for females with ADHD, LD, and ADHD+LD, relative to males with ADHD, LD, and ADHD+LD.\nTable 1.\nSample Characteristics for Concussion History (Hx)\nControls\nADHD\nLD\nADHD+LD\nNo Hx\nHx\nNo Hx\nHx\nNo Hx\nHx\nNo Hx\nHx\nAge\n19.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4\n19.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4\n19.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4\n19.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4\n19.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5\n19.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3\n19.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4\n19.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4\nBMI\n24.0\u2009\u00b1\u20093.5\n24.8\u2009\u00b1\u20093.7\n24.5\u2009\u00b1\u20093.9\n25.1\u2009\u00b1\u20094.0\n24.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.4\n25.3\u2009\u00b1\u20094.5\n25.3\u2009\u00b1\u20094.9\n26.3\u2009\u00b1\u20094.9\nOverall sample\n24,256\n6866\n981\n532\n295\n134\n212\n111\nFemale (\nn\n=\u200912,559)\n9205\n2506\n351\n175\n134\n58\n91\n39\nMale (\nn\n=\u200920,828)\n15,051\n4360\n630\n357\n161\n76\n121\n72\nConcussion history by quantity\nOne prior\n24,256\n5221\n981\n386\n295\n97\n212\n77\nFemale (\nn\n=\u20092036)\n9205\n1841\n351\n129\n134\n40\n91\n26\nMale (\nn\n=\u20093745)\n15,051\n3380\n630\n257\n161\n57\n121\n51\nTwo+ prior\n24,256\n1645\n981\n146\n295\n37\n212\n34\nFemale (\nn\n=\u2009742)\n9205\n665\n351\n46\n134\n18\n91\n13\nMale (\nn\n=\u20091120)\n15,051\n980\n630\n100\n161\n19\n121\n21\nConcussion history by contact category\nContact\n7026\n3204\n386\n304\n118\n75\n94\n73\nFemale (\nn\n=\u20093172)\n1923\n969\n97\n74\n33\n26\n30\n20\nMale (\nn\n=\u20098108)\n5103\n2235\n289\n230\n85\n49\n64\n53\nLimited contact\n5400\n1284\n259\n109\n87\n39\n56\n24\nFemale (\nn\n=\u20093769)\n2834\n662\n122\n46\n46\n19\n26\n14\nMale (\nn\n=\u20093489)\n2566\n622\n137\n63\n41\n20\n30\n10\nNon-contact\n4101\n730\n209\n64\n66\n15\n43\n7\nFemale (\nn\n=\u20093449)\n2664\n531\n114\n45\n48\n12\n30\n5\nMale (\nn\n=\u20091786)\n1437\n199\n95\n19\n18\n3\n13\n2\nNon-NCAA\n7728\n1649\n127\n55\n24\n5\n19\n7\nFemale (\nn\n=\u20092169)\n1784\n344\n18\n10\n7\n1\n5\n0\nMale (\nn\n=\u20097445)\n5944\n1305\n109\n45\n17\n4\n14\n7\nOpen in a separate window\nADHD, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder;

    "Methods": "Study population\nThis national retrospective cohort study used data from the National Health Insurance Service-National Health Information Database (NHIS-NHID) in South Korea.\n10\nAll South Korean citizens are required to enroll in the NHIS and are identified by a 13-digit resident registration number from birth\n10\n,\n11\nthat is used in all South Korean hospitals and clinics to claim their patient's treatment bills from the NHIS.\n10\n,\n12\nTherefore, the probability of overlapping medical records is very small, even if a patient's residence changes.\n10\n,\n11\nAll medical treatments in South Korea are tracked without exception using the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service system.\n10-12\nAdditionally, an administrative entity must be notified of an individual's death before a funeral in South Korea, and medical doctors must record the causes and dates of death on death certificates.\n10\n,\n12\nTherefore, the NHIS database contains the information of patients who have developed TBI as a result of daily life activities.\n9\nThe study population was selected from the NHIS database between 2008 and 2017, and the baseline of this study is 2010. The time between 2008 and 2009 was designated as the wash-out period for TBI. According to the TBI definition by the International Classification of Disease-10 (ICD-10) codes (\nSupplementary Table S1\n),\n13\n2,134,610 patients, who were diagnosed with TBI between January 2008 and December 2017, were included (\nSupplementary Fig. S1\n). A total of 6,898,377 participants who have never been diagnosed with TBI between 2008 and 2017 were randomly selected from other hospital encounters from individuals without TBI. In this population, participants who had no demographic variables at the baseline were excluded (\nn\n=\u2009546,506). The participants who died (\nn\n=\u200936,638) or had a previous TBI (\nn\n=\u2009153,201) or depression diagnosis (\nn\n=\u2009299,385) before the baseline were excluded. Adolescents under 18 years old also were excluded (\nn\n=\u20091,735,576). The participants who had missing variables with residence or income were excluded (\nn\n=\u2009256,795). After these exclusions, 1,141,614 patients with TBI and 4,563,212 controls without TBI were demographically-matched 1:1 on age, sex, income, and region of residence. Finally, 1,141,593 patients with TBI and 1:1 matched controls (\nn\n=\u20091,141,593) were included in this study. Median follow-up time of the participants was 7 years. This study was exempted from ethics approval by the institutional review board of Seoul National University Hospital (IRB No. E-2003-104-1110), because the data in the NHIS were anonymized and de-identified. Accordingly, informed consent was also waived.\n\nVariables\nThe incidence of depression with major depressive disorder (MDD), single episode (F32), recurrent MDD (F33), dysthymic disorder (F34.1), and mixed anxiety and depressive disorder (F41.2) was estimated following the ICD-10 codes.\n14-16\nAll sociodemographic factors were included at the baseline. The age groups were categorized into three classes (younger age group [18-39], middle age group [40-59], and older age group [60+ years]). The insurance premium, reflecting household income levels, was categorized into quartiles.\n11\nThe region of residence was classified into two groups according to administrative districts\n12\n: urban (Seoul, Busan, Daegu, Incheon, Gwangju, Daejeon, and Ulsan) and rural (Gyeonggi, Gangwon, Chungcheongbuk, Chungcheongnam, Jeollabuk, Jeollanam, Gyeongsangbuk, Gyeongsangnam, and Jeju). The psychiatric diseases that occurred within the last 2 years before the baseline were considered as a history of past psychiatric diseases. Dementia (F00\u2012F04, F06, F07), psychotic disorders (F20\u2012F25, F28\u2012F29), affective disorders (F30\u2012F34, F38\u201239), anxiety-related and stress-related disorders (F40\u2012F48), alcohol or drug misuse (F10\u2012F16, F18\u2012F19), and mental retardation (F70\u2012F79) were included as past psychiatric diseases.\n17\n,\n18\nTo assess comorbidities, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) scores were calculated according to ICD-10 codes and categorized into four classes (scores as 0, 1, 2\u20123, \u2265 4).\n19\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe end-point was defined as the incidence of depression, death, or the end of the study period (December 31, 2017), whichever came first. Participants who died before the onset of depression were defined as censored. Adjusted survival curve was adopted to observe overall depression-free survival curves according to TBI occurrence. Time-dependent Cox regression model was used to assess hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). TBI was used as a time-varying exposure,\n20\nsince participants defined as patients with TBI did not have TBI at the baseline but have developed TBI over time. From the patients with TBI, the person-time prior to the occurrence of TBI was considered as unexposed person-time.\n21\nConfounding factors including age, sex, insurance type and premium, region of residence, past psychiatric diseases, and CCI were adjusted in the fully adjusted model. All confounding variables were selected by step-wise selection method with statistical significance (\np\n<\u20090.05).\nSince the occurrence of depression can be affected by sociodemographic status, stratification was conducted according to several sociodemographic confounders. Stratification was performed according to several sociodemographic factors including age, sex, insurance premium, region of residence, and insurance types. Both patients with TBI and controls without TBI were separated by strata according to those factors. Interactions terms were created by introducing variable\u2009\u00d7\u2009variable to find out interactions across different sociodemographic characteristics.\nTo examine the groups of patients with TBI more vulnerable to the risk of depression, subgroup analyses were conducted. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to TBI severity and time since TBI diagnosis. Patients with TBI were divided into subgroups and then compared with controls. TBI severity was classified as mild TBI, moderate-to-severe TBI, and skull fracture. Only concussion (S06.0) was classified as mild TBI, and all other TBIs (S06.1-S06.9) were classified as moderate-to-severe TBI. Skull fracture (S02.0, S02.1, S02.7, S02.8, S02.9) were classified as skull fracture.\n13\nTwo sensitivity analyses were performed in this study. First, we modified the definition of depression by excluding recurrent depressive disorder (F33;\nn\n=\u200915,629). Second, we examined the risk of depression after TBI caused by motor vehicle accidents. Because the NHIS data does not cover patients injured in motor vehicle accidents, we separately obtained a motor vehicle insurance database between 2014 and 2019 from the Korea Health Insurance Review and Assessment (HIRA;\nSupplementary Fig. S2\n). Briefly, 1,397,385 individuals who were injured in motor vehicle accidents in 2014 were included and followed up until the date of their final treatment; those who died before the onset of depression were censored. After 1:1 demographical matching according to age and sex, 134,607 patients with TBI and a corresponding number of controls were analyzed. The median and maximum follow-up times were 12 days and 6 years, respectively.\nAll statistical analyses were performed using SAS statistical software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Adjusted survival curve was created by \u201csurvminer\u201d R packages, using R, version 4.0.3 (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria). All\np\nvalues reported are two-sided;\np\nvalues <0.05 were considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Experimental animals\nA total of 25 adult (12 weeks of age) male and female Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were obtained from Envigo (Hsd:Sprague Dawley\n\u00ae\nSD, Indianapolis, IN) and randomly assigned to 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPCD), CX717, or CX1739 groups. An additional seven adult male and female Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were assigned to the intact group. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Florida (Protocol # 201807438) and are in accordance with National Institutes of Health Guidelines. Animals were housed individually in cages under a 12-h light/dark cycle with\nad libitum\naccess to food and water. Animals were anesthetized with ketamine (90\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection for all surgical procedures.\n\nAssessment of diaphragm muscle activity\nChronic diaphragm muscle EMG activity was assessed in all animals using a pair of inwelling electrodes that were implanted in the mid-costal region of the diaphragm\n15\n,\n16\nand connected to a head stage. Briefly, the thoraco-abdominal and skull region of the rat were shaved with clippers and cleaned with three alternating scrubs of 2% chlorohexidine followed by 70% ethanol. Rats were then placed in a stereotaxic frame over a heating pad and the skull surface was exposed under sterile conditions. Six bone anchor screws were placed in the skull (1 in the left and 1 in the right frontal bone, 2 in the left parietal bone, and 2 in the right parietal bone). A ground wire was wrapped around three head screws before securing the head stage in place with dental cement. The animal was removed from the stereotaxic frame. Subsequently, EMG electrodes connected to the head stage were tunneled subcutaneously to the abdominal region. The diaphragm muscle was exposed following a midline laparotomy. Electrodes made from insulated stainless steel fine wire (AS631, Cooner Wire Inc., Chatsworth, CA) with a \u223c3mm exposed region were placed into each hemi-diaphragm muscle with an inter-electrode distance of \u223c3\u2009mm and secured with a surgical knot. Abdominal muscles and skin (buried suture) were closed with a 4-0 Webcryl suture. Animals received buprenorphine (0.03\u2009mg/kg, b.i.d.), meloxicam (10\u2009mg/kg), Baytril\n\u00ae\n(5\u2009mg/kg, q.d.), and lactated Ringer's solution (10\u2009mL/day, q.d.) for the initial 48\u2009h post-injury. Animals were allowed to recover for 7 days prior to baseline data collection. Animals were excluded from the study if there were malfunctioning EMG electrodes or if they developed an abscess around the electrodes tunneled subcutaneously.\nBaseline diaphragm EMG activity was recorded 2 days prior to SCI, and subsequently at 4 and 14 days post-C2Hx. EMG data was recorded using a differential amplifier (A-M systems 1700), and digitized using a 16-channel data acquisition unit (1401-Power3) and custom Spike2 acquisition software. EMG data were sampled at 5,000\u2009Hz, analog band-pass filtered between 300 and 10,000\u2009Hz, and saved to disk for offline filtering and analysis (\nsee Data analysis\nsection).\n\nSCI\nAll animals in this study received a C2Hx, which has previously been described in detail.\n17\n,\n18\nAnimals were prepped for survival surgical procedure, as described previously for the EMG implant procedure. Before beginning the procedure, depth of anesthesia was checked using a toe pinch resulting in lack of a change in heart rate, whisker twitch, and hindlimb withdrawal. An appropriate level of anesthesia was also continuously verified during the surgical procedure and the animal was re-dosed with a one-quarter dose of the initial ketamine/xylazine dose if needed. Body temperature was maintained with a water recirculating heating pad. Under sterile conditions, a dorsal incision was made from the base of the skull to the \u223c C6 region of the spine. Dorsal paravertebral muscles between C1 and C6 were incised and retracted. The posterior portion of cervical vertebrae was exposed at C2, and a laminectomy was performed at the level, while preserving the facet joints and leaving the dura intact. The left side of the spinal cord was sectioned using a micro-knife (Cat # 10055-12, Fine Science Tools) starting from the midline to the lateral edge of the spinal cord. This process was repeated three times to ensure completeness of hemisection. The overlying muscles were sutured with sterile 4\u20130 Webcryl and the overlaying skin was closed using 9\u2009mm wound clips. Animals were maintained on a heating pad until alert and awake. Animals were monitored on a daily basis for signs of distress, dehydration, and weight loss, with appropriate veterinary care given as needed. Animals received buprenorphine (0.03\u2009mg/kg, b.i.d.), meloxicam (1\u2009mg/kg, q.d.), Baytril (5\u2009mg/kg, q.d.), and lactated Ringer's solution (10\u2009mL/day, q.d.) for the initial 48\u2009h post-injury. In order to verify completeness of C2Hx, absence of ipsilateral diaphragm EMG activity was confirmed under anesthesia at the time of surgery. Animals were maintained on a heating pad until alert and awake. Animals were monitored on a daily basis for signs of distress, dehydration, and weight loss, with appropriate veterinary care given as needed. Animals were excluded from the study if they displayed forelimb autotomy or weight loss >20% of a pre-injury time point.\n\nPlethysmography measurements\nUnrestrained and unanesthetized animals were studied in a flow through whole body plethysmograph to measure ventilation. Expired air outflow from the plethysmograph chamber was split through a CO\n2\nsensor to quantify metabolic activity (VCO\n2\n) based on the Fick's principle. The plethysmograph chamber was modified to include a commutator for connecting cables to the head stage of animals placed in the chamber (\nFig. 1\n). This setup allowed concurrent measurements of ventilation and EMG on the same animal. Awake rats were acclimated to the plexiglas recording chamber 2 days in a row, for 1\u2009h each day. Air flow was maintained at 6\u2009L/min through the plethysmography chamber. On the 3rd day, baseline data were collected for a 40-min period under normoxic air (21% O\n2\n, 79% N\n2\n), followed by a 2-min ampakine or HPCD infusion period and a 30-min post-infusion period. Subsequently, rats were challenged to a 7\u2009min hypoxic (10.5% O\n2\nbal N\n2\n) period, followed by a 45-min post-hypoxia recording period under normoxic air, ending with a 7\u2009min maximal chemoreceptor challenge (10.5% O\n2\n, 7% CO\n2\nbal N\n2\n). For pre-injury baseline data points, an infusion of sterile saline was used in all animals as a control for ampakine or HPCD infusion. Ventilation was measured by monitoring pressure swings within the plexiglas chamber caused by gas expansion and contraction caused by the heating and humidification of air as the animal breathed. Tidal volume was measured using the Drorbaugh and Fenn equations.\n19\nVCO\n2\nwas measured using Fick equation VCO\n2\n=\u2009(FECO\n2\n- FICO\n2\n)\u2009\u00d7\u2009V/[1- (FECO\n2\n\u00d7\u2009(1- (1/RQ)))] with an assumed RQ of 0.85.\n20\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nOverview of experimental design and methods.\n(A)\nSchematic of the recording setup allowing simultaneous collection of whole-body plethysmography data and electromyographic (EMG) activity data from the diaphragm muscle.\n(B)\nExperimental timeline of study. Animals underwent survival surgery for EMG electrode implantation 8 days prior to injury. Acclimation to the plethysmography chamber occurred 3 and 2 days prior to injury, followed by baseline data collection 1 day prior to injury. After C2 spinal hemisection (C2Hx) injury, data were collected at 4 and 14 days post-injury (dpi).\n(C)\nDuring experiments, animals were exposed to normoxic air (21% O\n2\n, balance N\n2\n) for 40\u2009min, followed by infusion of drug or vehicle over 2\u2009min. Post-infusion data were collected under normoxic air for 30\u2009min, followed by an acute hypoxic challenge (10.5% O\n2\nand balance N\n2\n). Post-hypoxia data were collected under normoxic air for 45\u2009min, and the protocol concluded with a brief maximal chemoreceptor (maxchemo) challenge (10.5% O\n2\n, 7% CO\n2\n, balance N\n2\n).\n(D)\nSchematic of bilateral intramuscular EMG electrode placement in the mid-costal region of the diaphragm. Color image is available online.\n\nPharmacological agents\nAmpakine CX717 and CX1739 was provided by RespireRX and was mixed in 10% HPCD solution (Sigma) at soluble concentrations of (5\u2009mg/mL). Aliquots were stored at \u221280\u00b0C for use up to 6 months. Aliquots were thawed to room temperature prior to use on the day of each experiment. On the day of recording, animals were anesthetized under 2% isofluorane, and a 22G catheter was placed on the distal end of the tail vein. The animal was then placed in the plethysmograph chamber, and the i.v. line was externalized through a specially designed port to maintain a pressure seal in the chamber. Based on pilot studies from our laboratory, CX717 and CX1739 were used at low dose concentration of 5\u2009mg/kg. All drugs were administered over the course of 2\u2009min via the tail vein catheter.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nFollowing the 14-day post-C2HX recording, animals were euthanized by exsanguination and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1\u2009M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4). The spinal cord was resected from C1 to C4, post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24\u2009h and transferred to 30% sucrose in 0.1\u2009M PBS (pH 7.4) for 3 days at 4\u00b0C. Spinal cords were subsequently embedded in cryomolds (VWR, Radnor, PA). The spinal cord was cut in five 3-mm segments centered around the injury epicenter. The block was sectioned serially at 20\u2009\u03bcm thickness in the transverse plane into 10 serial sets and frozen on Superfrost Plus slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Sections were then re-hydrated and stained with 0.1% Cresyl violet in glacial acetic acid. After 3\u2009min, slides were rinsed in water and dehydrated through graded alcohol steps, followed by xylene.\n\nData analysis\nEMG activity from the ipsilateral and contralateral diaphragm muscle was recorded throughout the course of the recording paradigm detailed in the plethysmography section. Data for EMG and plethysmography traces were averaged over 5\u2009min of quiet breathing during the baseline period, over 2\u2009min during the infusion period, over 5\u2009min immediately post-infusion and during min 15\u201320 post-infusion. During the hypoxia and max-chemo challenge, data were averaged both minute by minute during min 2\u20137 of the challenge, and during the last 3\u2009min of the challenge, during which the diaphragm muscle is expected to elicit maximal response for that behavior. Post-hypoxia response was averaged over the course of 5\u2009min at three time points post- challenge: 5, 20, and 35\u2009min.\nAssessment of plethysmography traces and EMG activity was conducted using a custom MATLAB software (MathWorks). Plethysmography tidal volume traces were filtered 0.5\u20136\u2009Hz to reduce electrocardiogram (ECG) artifact. The EMG traces were \u201cblanked\u201d using pan_tompkin to detect QRS complex in the EMG signal, then filtered 300\u20131000\u2009Hz to further remove ECG artifacts. The EMG signal was then rectified, moving-median filtered using a 50\u2009ms time constant, and finally smoothed using a 50\u2009ms time constant.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical evaluations were performed using JMP statistical software (version 14.0, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Power calculations for each cohort of animals in the study were determined prior to initiation of study and based on pilot experiments not included in this article. The study statistical design was powered to consider the expected standard deviation in diaphragm EMG activity at 4 days post-C2Hx (21%) and in order to detect a 50% difference at a power of 0.9 and an \u03b1 of 0.05. Using the mixed linear model, statistical significance was established at the 0.05 level and adjusted for any violation of the assumption of sphericity in repeated measures using the Greenhouse\u2013Geisser correction. Treatment (CX717, CX1739, and HPCD) and time point (baseline, infusion, post-infusion and 15\u2009min post-infusion ) or behavior (hypoxia, maxchemo) were included as model variables, using animals as a random effect. When appropriate,\npost-hoc\nanalyses were conducted using Tukey\u2013Kramer honestly significant difference (HSD). Normality of the distribution was assessed using the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test within each animal. Outliers were identified for each animal using an outlier box plot. No data were excluded from the analysis to highlight the responders versus the non-responders in each treatment group."

Scale bar: 20\u2009\u03bcm.\n(E)\nQuantification of axonal survival reveals that delayed ryanodine treatment significantly increased axonal survival compared with vehicle treatment (37.98%, 30.26; median and 25th percentile for vehicle and 49.51%, 42.51 for ryanodine; *\np\n=\u20090.005, Mann-Whitney U test;\nn\n=\u20096-7 animals per group.\nAxonal Ca\n2+\ndynamics\nImageJ line segment tool was used to trace axons along their length and within axonal spheroids over time. The mean fluorescence value of the GCaMP6f signal was recorded after SCI and normalized to the average background signal (noise) of the channel to obtain a true GCaMP6f signal in the axon. Similarly, 20 to 25 axons were measured at baseline minus channel noise, and then averaged to obtain the mean calcium signal in baseline axons. Calcium signal was recorded and expressed as a ratio \u0394F/F\n0\nwhere the change in calcium signal from baseline (\u0394F) over the initial calcium signal at baseline (F\n0\n). A total of\nn\n=\u2009140-195 axons from seven animals per group (\nFig. 3M\n) and\nn\n=\u20091116-1140 spheroids from seven animals per group (\nFig. 3N\n) were assessed and reported as median and 25th percentile.

A sample size of 7 was determined with an expected difference in means of 10.0 and expected standard deviation of 6.0, with a desired power of 0.8, and alpha 0.050. The difference in means between two groups over time was assessed by a one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and all pairwise multiple comparison procedures (Holm-Sidak method). The difference in means between two groups at a single time-point was assessed by a t-test or Mann-Whitney Rank sum test if the data failed normality. A\np\nvalue <0.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "Data collection\nThe TraumaRegister DGU of the German Trauma Society (Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Unfallchirurgie, DGU) was founded in 1993. The aim of this multi-center database is a pseudonymized and standardized documentation of severely injured patients.\nData are collected prospectively in four consecutive time phases from the site of the accident until discharge from hospital: 1) pre-hospital phase; 2) emergency room and initial surgery; 3) intensive care unit; and 4) discharge. The documentation includes detailed information on demographics, injury pattern, comorbidities, pre- and in-hospital management, course on intensive care unit, relevant laboratory findings including data on transfusion, and outcome of each individual. The inclusion criterion is admission to hospital via emergency room with subsequent ICU/intermediate care or reach the hospital with vital signs and die before admission to ICU.\nThe infrastructure for documentation, data management, and data analysis is provided by AUC\u2013Academy for Trauma Surgery (AUC\u2013Akademie der Unfallchirurgie GmbH), a company affiliated to the German Trauma Society. The scientific leadership is provided by the Committee on Emergency Medicine, Intensive Care and Trauma Management (Notfall-, Intensivmedizin und Schwerverletztenversorgung, Sektion NIS) of the German Trauma Society. The participating hospitals submit their data pseudonymized into a central database via a web-based application. Scientific data analysis is approved according to a peer review procedure laid down in the publication guideline of TraumaRegister DGU.\nThe participating hospitals are primarily located in Germany (90%), but a rising number of hospitals of other countries contribute, data as well (at the moment from Austria, Belgium, Finland, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Switzerland, The Netherlands, and the United Arab Emirates). Currently, almost 30,000 cases from more than 650 hospitals are entered into the database per year. For this study, 2507 pediatric cases of severe TBI were analyzed.\nParticipation in TraumaRegister DGU is voluntary. For hospitals associated with TraumaNetzwerk DGU; however, the entry of at least a basic data set is obligatory for reasons of quality assurance.\nPatients aged <18 years from Germany, Austria and Switzerland with Abbreviated Injury Scores (AIS) for the head \u22653 who were admitted between 2010 and 2019 (10 years) were included. Patients transferred to another hospital within the first 48\u2009h after admission were excluded due to missing data on final outcomes. Patients transferred in from another hospital were excluded, as well. Only patients with complete standard documentation including surgical interventions were included.\n\nPredicted mortality, injury severity, and outcome measures\nPredicted mortality was calculated using the Revised Injury Severity Classification, version II (RISC II) score, which was developed and validated by the TR-DGU to predict survival of trauma patients based on 13 predictive pre-clinical factors.\n21\nThe included predictors are the worst and second worst injuries based on the AIS, head injury based on the AIS, age, sex, pre-trauma American Society of Anesthesiologists Score (ASA score), pupil reactivity, pupil size, motor function, injury mechanism, blood pressure, coagulation measured by international normalized ratio, base deficit, hemoglobin concentration, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation performed before hospital admission.\nInjury severity was assessed using the Injury Severity Score (ISS) and AIS for the head and body. Outcome was measured unblinded by the physician in charge at ICU discharge. The TraumaRegister gives concise instructions on how to complete each item in the guide to completion that can be downloaded publicly on their website. Outcome categories were defined as good recovery, moderate disability (handicapped but independent), severe disability (conscious but handicapped and dependent on help), vegetative state (permanent vegetative state) or death. We defined poor outcome as death or vegetative state. Good outcome was defined as severe disability, moderate disability, and good recovery.\n\nGuidelines and ethics approval\nThe present study is in line with the publication guidelines of the TR-DGU and is registered as project ID 2020-033. All methods concur with relevant guidelines and regulations and the study was approved by the ethics committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Duisburg-Essen (21-10116-BO).\n\nStatistical analysis\nQuantitative variables are presented as mean and standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile range (IQR) in case of skewed data. For qualitative factors, absolute and relative frequencies are given. For mortality rates, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for comparison of observed and predicted mortality by the RISC II score.\nAdjusted odds ratios with 95% CIs were calculated using logistic regression models with in-hospital poor outcomes and mortality as dependent variables. Covariates were selected based on previous knowledge on predictors of outcome in trauma patients: Because the RISC II score sums up pre-clinical factors, we included additional, mainly in-hospital, predictive factors in the model. These factors were helicopter transport, blood transfusion in the shock room, computed tomography performed, treatment in a Level 2 or 3 trauma center, placement of cerebrospinal fluid drain or hematoma evacuation, cervical spine injury, cerebral contusion, epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, subarachnoidal hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, brain edema, brain stem injury, skull fractures, and age (stratified into groups from 0-5, 6-11, and 12-17 years). The severity of head injury (assessed by the AIS head) was not entered into the model separately, because it forms part of the RISC II score. Cases with missing data on covariates were excluded from logistic regression.\nStatistical analyses were performed with SPSS Version 26 (IBM Inc., Armonk, NY) and SAS Enterprise Guide 7.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Figures were produced with SAS Enterprise Guide 7.1."

To drive cre expression in adult mice, tamoxifen (Tx) (10\u2009mg/mL in corn oil) was administered via oral gavage once at 330\u2009mg/kg.\nAll animal procedures were approved and conducted according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Virginia Polytechnic and State University and were done in compliance with the National Institute of Health's Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\nAnimal procedures\nAn impact acceleration weight drop TBI model was used to mimic mTBI without focal injury as previously described.\n19\nMice were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane for 5\u2009min and then placed on a foam pad after the analgesic buprenorphine (0.05\u20130.1\u2009mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously. A flat steel disc was placed on the mouse head to diffuse the impact across the cranium. A 100\u2009g weight guided by a Plexiglas tube was dropped from a 50\u2009cm height. For the 10 and 30\u2009min post-injury (mpi) time points, a single injury was performed (1xTBI). For all other time points that occurred days post- injury (dpi), impacts were repeated (3 total) and occurred at a 45-min inter-injury interval (3xTBI). Shams underwent all procedures with exception of the weight drop.\nTo assess BBB leakage, Cadaverine conjugated to Alexa Fluor-555 (ThermoFisher Scientific, A30677) was injected retro-orbitally (0.33\u2009mg/ mouse in 100\u2009\u03bcL saline). 30\u2009min later, mice were transcardially perfused with Phospho-Buffered Saline (PBS) (Fisher Scientific, BP661-10) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 15714-S).\nAdlh-1l1-eGFP//FVB/N mice were used for repeated\nin vivo\ntwo-photon imaging via a thinned-skull cranial window as described previously.\n20\nSingle mTBIs from a 60\u2009cm height (identical to 50\u2009cm in key outcome measures) or repeated TBIs from a 50\u2009cm height were performed.\n19\n\nSerum-free primary astrocyte cultures\nMagnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) was used to isolate astrocytes as detailed in the study by Holt and Olsen\n21\nand according to manufacturer's directions (Miltenyl Biotec, 134-042-401). Microglia and oligodendrocytes were removed first by using cell type-specific microbeads. A second magnetic separation was performed using astrocyte cell-specific antibody-2 (ACSA-2) microbeads.\nPrimary astrocytes were maintained in 1\u2009mL 5X B27 serum-free media, prepared as described in\nTable 1\n. Astrocytes were plated on laminated cover-slips at 200,000 cells per well in 48-well plates, and incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO\n2\nfor 14 days.

All reagents were purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific.\nBlood from adult C57B/6 male mice was withdrawn via cardiac puncture and centrifuged at 14,000\u2009rpm for 5\u2009min at 4\u00b0C to remove erythrocytes and other cells contained in whole blood. The supernatant, containing plasma, was diluted to 10% in 5X B27 serum-free media and added to the cover-slips for 24\u2009h.

A CD31+ blood vessel was outlined in ImageJ, which generated a plot profile that reported the number of pixels that either included or did not include ZO-1. The number of pixels containing ZO-1 was normalized by the total number of pixels contained in the region of interest.

Quantifications of CD45+ cells fall under a Poisson distribution instead of the standard Gaussian distribution because the number of CD45+ cells is reported as discrete data. In order to normalize and stabilize the variance of the data, the square root of the total number of CD45+ cells per brain was calculated followed by a one-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare groups.\nAll other data were tested for Gaussian distribution using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov (KS) normality test. Statistical tests were chosen accordingly and are specified in the\nResults\nsection or figure legends.

    "Methods": "Study design, population, and setting\nThis was a nationwide retrospective cohort study conducted using the Japan Trauma Data Bank (JTDB). We included patients registered in the JTDB from January 2004 to December 2018 and those with TBI who were transported to a JTDB-participating hospital. TBI was defined using the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) code.\n10\nWe classified patients with TBI according to the head AIS code: 3 (serious), 4 (severe), and 5 (critical). The patients were stratified according to the type of transportation from the accident scene to the hospital (HEMS/GEMS). Those transported by physician-operated ambulances were excluded from this study. There is no other mechanism of transport that started to be used in the study period. We excluded patients who were in cardiopulmonary arrest at the scene, received cardiopulmonary resuscitation at the scene (because of severe trauma), required interhospital transport, or were burn victims (because burns differ from other traumas).\n7-9\n,\n11\nPatients with cardiopulmonary arrest were defined as those having a systolic blood pressure of 0\u2009mmHg and/or heart rate of 0\u2009bpm on or before hospital arrival.\n12\nWe excluded patients with missing outcome data or variables required for propensity score (PS) matching.\n\nJapan Trauma Data Bank\nThe JTDB, launched in 2003 by the Japanese Association for the Surgery of Trauma (Trauma Surgery Committee) and Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (Committee for Clinical Care Evaluation), is similar to the trauma databases in North America, Europe, and Oceania.\n12\n,\n13\nIn 2018, 272 major emergency medical institutions across Japan were registered in the JTDB.\n13\nThe included hospitals had service levels similar to those of level I trauma centers in the United States. Data were collected via the internet from the participating institutions. The primary data inputs were from physicians and medical assistants who attended an AIS coding course.\n12\n,\n13\nThe JTDB records trauma patient data, including age, sex, mechanism of injury, AIS code (1998 version), Injury Severity Score (ISS), vital signs at the scene, date and time series from hospital arrival to discharge, medical procedures (interventional radiology, surgery, and computed tomography), complications, and mortality at hospital discharge.\n13\nPatients transported to the JTDB-participating hospitals were treated based on the guidelines for managing severe TBI.\n14\nTo reduce traumatic deaths caused by motor vehicle collisions, the Japanese Road Traffic Act was revised in June 2002, imposing severe fines for traffic offenses; since then, fatal collisions caused by drunk drivers decreased. The law also requires children age <6 years to use child seats.\n14\nThere have been no major breakthroughs in the treatment of severe TBI in the past 15 years.\n14\nThe level of consciousness was evaluated using the Japan Coma Scale (JCS) score, which was recorded at the scene, mainly by EMS personnel, for all patients. The JCS score correlates well with the Glasgow Coma Scale; a neurological dysfunction score of 100 points on the JCS is equivalent to 6\u20139 on the Glasgow Coma Scale.\n8\nPatients were categorized into four groups based on the JCS score: 0 (Grade 0, alert), 1\u20133 (Grade 1, delirium), 10\u201330 (Grade 2, somnolence), and 100\u2013300 (Grade 3, coma).\n\nGround emergency medical services\nGEMS in Japan comprise emergency medical technicians or paramedics trained in advanced life support and pre-hospital trauma life support and firefighters trained in basic life support. The members of the GEMS team are allowed to perform several procedures according to fixed protocols set by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, including venous cannulation, crystalloid infusion, early defibrillation, and endotracheal intubation without muscle relaxants for cardiopulmonary arrest.\n15\nIn addition, for trauma cases, the members of the GEMS team have been permitted to administer intravenous drip injections exclusively for patients in a state of shock from 2014. Moreover, they were allowed to administer oxygen or to perform suctioning, the jaw-thrust maneuver, or manual ventilation using a bag-valve-mask for airway management.\n16\n\nHelicopter emergency medical services\nIn Japan, HEMS were first introduced in 2000 and have since spread across many regions. As of May 2021, 54 HEMS have been deployed in 45 prefectures across Japan.\n9\nIn 2018, 29,055 helicopter transfers were recorded, and the number is gradually increasing annually.\n9\nHEMS operate only during the daytime. The Japanese HEMS are similar to those of European countries and, in most cases, employ a physician-based pre-hospital approach to emergency patients.\n8\n,\n9\nOne or two physicians and a nurse are transported to the scene by a helicopter. Most physicians are board-certified in specific fields (acute care, surgery, anesthesiology, or aeromedical services) and have received advanced trauma life support training.\n8\n,\n9\nNational and prefectural governments pay the operational charges.\n9\nIn the Japanese emergency system, HEMS cannot be requested directly by patients. The fire department dispatch center that receives the 119 calls determines the necessity of dispatching HEMS. HEMS are based at a tertiary-level emergency hospital and are dispatched according to the information provided during the emergency call from the fire department. GEMS can also request HEMS dispatch based on the results of patient assessment at the scene. In such cases, the GEMS team first rescue the injured patient and subsequently transport them to a location where the HEMS can land safely (the \u201crendezvous point\u201d).\n8\n,\n9\nThen, the HEMS team provides emergency care, such as endotracheal intubation, chest tube drainage, emergency tracheotomy, or thoracotomy with aortic clamping in the ambulance using various medications. This system is called the \u201crendezvous system.\u201d After emergency care, the HEMS transport the patient to a tertiary care hospital.\n8\n,\n9\nIn this study, a patient using the rendezvous system was reported to be transported by HEMS only if he/she had arrived at the hospital by helicopter.\n\nStudy outcomes\nThe primary outcome was mortality at hospital discharge. The secondary outcomes included surgery for increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and cognitive dysfunction (diagnosed by an in-hospital medical team). Cognitive dysfunction after TBI is defined in the\nGuidelines for the Management of Severe Head Injury\n(4th edition) as \u201cimpairment in numerous cognitive domains, including executive function, learning and memory, attention and processing speed, among others.\u201d\n14\n\nPropensity score matching\nWe performed a PS-matched analysis because HEMS dispatch was not randomly assigned. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the PS for the prediction of transport using the available variables. Confounders were carefully evaluated based on previous reports,\n7\n,\n8\n,\n17\nand clinically important confounders were included to estimate the PS.\n9\nThe PS (i.e., the probability of receiving HEMS) for each patient was calculated using multi-variable logistic regression analysis based on the following variables: age (continuous), sex (male/female), year of onset (2004\u20132006, 2007\u20132009, 2010\u20132012, 2013\u20132015, or 2016\u20132018), hospital arrival time (daytime (from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.)/nighttime), JCS score at the scene (Grade 0\u20133), heart rate at the scene (continuous), systolic blood pressure at the scene (continuous), type of injury (blunt/non-blunt), cause of trauma (motor vehicle accident/fall/others), other severe extracranial injuries (AIS score \u22653) (no/yes), and ISS (continuous).\nWe performed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to predict HEMS use in patients with TBI. One-to-one pair matching between the helicopter and ground groups was performed using nearest-neighbor matching without replacement and a caliper width of 0.02 as the standard deviation (SD) of the PS. Covariate balances before and after matching were assessed by comparing the standardized mean differences (< 10% was considered a negligible imbalance between the groups). In the PS-matched cohort, univariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the association between HEMS use and mortality.\n\nStatistical analysis\nPatients were divided into two groups (helicopter and ground). Descriptive data are presented as counts and percentages (categorical variables) or means\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (continuous variables for patient background) and medians and interquartile ranges (continuous variables for time). We also assessed the patient background and proportion of surgeries performed for TBI in both groups. The trends across the 3-year periods (2004\u20132006, 2007\u20132009, 2010\u20132012, 2013\u20132015, and 2016\u20132018) were assessed using linear trend tests. Outcomes were evaluated using univariable and multi-variable logistic regression analyses for all cohorts to assess the robustness of the results. Based on these analyses, we calculated the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nIn the multi-variable logistic regression model, we adjusted for the following variables: age (10-year strata), sex (male/female), year of onset (2004\u20132006, 2007\u20132009, 2010\u20132012, 2013\u20132015, or 2016\u20132018), hospital arrival time (daytime/nighttime), JCS score at the scene (Grade 0\u20133), heart rate at the scene (continuous), systolic blood pressure at the scene (continuous), type of injury (blunt/non-blunt), cause of trauma (motor vehicle accident/fall/others), other severe extracranial injuries (AIS score \u22653) (no/yes), and ISS (continuous) used in the PS calculation, based on previous reports.\n7-9\n,\n17\nSubgroup analyses were performed to identify helicopter transport's potential benefits and drawbacks. In each subgroup, multi-variable logistic regression analysis, with adjustment for the aforementioned variables, was performed to assess the independent effect of helicopter use on mortality at hospital discharge. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was employed to compare the time from dispatch to ED arrival and time from ED arrival to computed tomography scan or surgery. Statistical significance was defined by a two-sided\np\nvalue\u2009<\u20090.05 or assessed using a 95% CI in all statistical analyses. All statistical analyses were conducted using STATA (version 16; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).\n\nEthics approval\nThis article was written based on the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement for the reporting of cohort and cross-sectional studies.\n18\nThe study design was approved by the Ethics Committee of Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine (approval number: 16260). The requirement for written informed consent was waived owing to the retrospective nature of the study. Personal identifiers are not included in the JTDB records."

    "Methods": "Study design\nThis is a retrospective observational study from the intensive care unit (ICU) at the Karolinska University Hospital (Stockholm, Sweden). The study protocol was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (#2019-04476).\n\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nWe included patients with blunt TBI (aged \u226515 years) who were admitted to the ICU after TBI during 2005\u20132019, who underwent an MRI-examination within the first 28 days of the trauma, and had an outcome assessment at \u22656 months post-trauma (using the Glasgow Outcome Scale {GOS] assessed at a median of 359 days).\n17\n\nOutcome\nThe GOS, a measure of long-term functional outcome, was assessed at follow-up appointments or by questionnaires. We defined unfavorable outcome as GOS 1\u20133 and favorable outcome as GOS 4\u20135 (dichotomized GOS). Additional outcome measures, such as the extended GOS or neuropsychiatric outcomes, could not be investigated in the present study, because they were not recorded prospectively in our data registries.\n\nImage analysis\nPatients with TBI whose clinical examinations suggest pathology that was not evident on CT scans are referred for MRI at our institution. Study participants were scanned using either a Siemens Avanto (Siemens Healthineers AG, Erlangen, Germany) or a GE Signa (General Electric Company, Boston, MA) scanner at 1.5T. The scanning protocols were similar between the two scanner types but evolved over time to maximize diagnostic accuracy (\nSupplementary Tables S1\n\u2013\nS3\n). Patients who were admitted during the period 2018\u20132019 (\nn\n=\u200924) were scanned using a GE Signa scanner at 3T.\nWe defined TAI as either (1) hypointensities on the T2*-weighted gradient echo (T2*GRE) and SWI sequences, (2) an increase in signal intensity using T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), or (3) restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (\nSupplementary Fig. S1\n\u2013\nS3\n).\n18\nThe T2*GRE was initially the MRI sequence that was used to detect hemorrhage, but it was replaced by SWI in 2010. We therefore combined the results obtained using SWI and T2*GRE, collectively referring to them as the susceptibility-sensitive sequences.\nWe documented the presence of TAI detected using MRI in several anatomical locations (\nSupplementary Table S4\n). We categorized TAI as either present or absent in each of the assessed brain regions. We documented the percentage of unfavorable outcome associated with TAI in each of the investigated anatomical locations, as a proxy for the severity of these lesions. The same protocol was repeated using each of the MRI sequences that were included in this study.\nFor comparative purposes, we assessed the MRI-based TAI grading systems of Adams and associates,\n9\nFirsching and coworkers,\n10\nand Abu Hamdeh and colleagues.\n11\n,\n19\u201322\nWe did not examine the grading system of Mannion and associates,\n23\nbecause the time from ICU admission until the MRI examination was expected to differ substantially between this study and that of Mannion and associates (median 1 day).\n23\nBecause the grading systems of Adams and associates\n9\nand Firsching and coworkers\n10\ndo not state explicitly which MRI pulse sequences are to be used, we used FLAIR, DWI, and the susceptibility-sensitive sequences and followed the same definition of TAI that we used for the current study.\nIn case of disagreement between the different MRI pulse sequences concerning grading, we selected the most severe grade. We used the same protocol when assessing grades I\u2013III of the grading system of Abu Hamdeh and colleagues.\n11\nWhen assessing grade IV using the grading system of Abu Hamdeh and colleagues,\n11\nwe used T2* GRE if SWI was unavailable. Patients who did not meet the criteria for any of the categories described in the grading systems of Adams and associates,\n9\nFirsching and coworkers,\n10\nor Abu Hamdeh and colleagues,\n11\nrespectively, were marked as \u201cgrade 0\u201d for that particular grading system.\nIn addition, we computed the Rotterdam CT score using admission CT scans.\n20\nWe performed all assessments of CT and MRI scans blinded to the patients' mechanism of injury, clinical status, and outcome. Author HN, a neuroradiologist with more than 20 years of experience, was responsible for image analysis.\n\nStatistical analysis\nTo account for possible selection bias, we compared patient characteristics between patients with TBI who have undergone an MRI examination with those who have not done so at our institution. We assessed group differences in continuous and categorical variables using the Mann-Whitney\nU\ntest and the chi-square test, respectively. We assessed group differences in ordinal data using the Cochran-Armitage trend test.\nWe imputed missing data using multi-variate imputation by chained equations (MICE).\n24\nWe split the data into a training dataset (2/3 of the data) and a test dataset (1/3 of the data). These datasets contained information regarding the presence of TAI in several brain regions detected using FLAIR, DWI, or the susceptibility-sensitive sequences, respectively. We used a genetic algorithm (GA) on the training dataset, to examine various configurations of TAI, to identify that which has the best performance in predicting functional outcome. A GA is a search algorithm and an optimization method that is based on the concept of natural selection.\n25\nIn each iteration of the GA, we assessed model performance using a desirability function,\n26\nwhich aimed to maximize discrimination while simultaneously penalizing excessively complex models, thereby limiting the risk of overfitting.\nNext, we used a random forest model to internally validate the utility of the variables that were selected by the GA in the independent test dataset. The random forest model, which was initially trained on the training dataset, included the TAI variables identified by the GA, as well as several known outcome predictors, to assess whether the MRI characteristics selected by the GA are capable of providing prognostic information in excess of established outcome predictors in TBI. The included outcome predictors were age, admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, and pupillary light responsiveness (\u201ccore variables\u201d).\n27\nThe dichotomized GOS was used as the dependent variable.\nWe used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to assess the ability of the random forest model to discriminate between favorable and unfavorable outcomes in the test dataset. The predictive power of the TAI variables that were selected by the GA was assessed by computing the mean decrease in Gini impurity, a measure of variable importance, using the random forest model. For comparative purposes, we created an additional random forest model, including only the core variables.\nFurther details regarding feature selection and machine learning are provided in the supplementary materials (see Supplementary Information).\nWe used a GA to obtain a parsimonious solution to outcome prediction in TBI, based on various configurations of TAI detected using DWI, FLAIR, or the susceptibility-weighted sequences in different brain regions. The result of the GA consisted of a single combination of TAI lesion types, which was found to have the best performance in discriminating between favorable and unfavorable outcomes. The brain regions that were represented among the TAI variables that were selected by the GA constituted the basis for the novel Stockholm MRI grading system. In addition, we used the mean decrease in Gini impurity and the percentage of unfavorable outcomes attributed to each of the selected TAI variables to stratify TAI based on their severity.\nFine-tuning of the Stockholm MRI grading system was ultimately performed using multi-variate logistic regression, to optimize the configuration of TAI in each stratum of the Stockholm MRI grading system. We examined model performance by assessing the discrimination between favorable and unfavorable outcomes (AUC). The version of the Stockholm MRI regarding system that resulted in the best performing multi-variate logistic regression model constituted the final version of the Stockholm MRI grading system.\nWe assessed the performances of the Stockholm MRI grading system and the previously described grading systems of Adams and associates,\n9\nFirsching and coworkers,\n10\nand Abu Hamdeh and colleagues\n11\nusing both univariate and multi-variate logistic regression. We examined the performance of all grading systems in isolation and following the addition of the core variables and the Rotterdam CT score. Other parameters, such as sex or laboratory values, were not included in these regression models, because their prognostic significance is less established.\n20\n,\n27\n,\n28\nWe evaluated all logistic regression models using the Nagelkerke pseudo-R\n2\n, AUC, and the Akaike information criterion (AIC), with dichotomized GOS as the dependent variable. The grading system of Abu Hamdeh and colleaues\n11\nwas used without age group separation, because age was included as a covariate in all multi-variate logistic regression models.\nWe used the likelihood ratio test to examine whether the addition of MRI-based TAI grading systems improved the performance of multi-variate logistic regression models. We used the DeLong test to compare different TAI grading systems with regard to the discrimination between favorable and unfavorable outcomes. We considered\np\nvalues <0.05 to be statistically significant.\nWe used R (version 3.6.0, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) to perform the statistical analysis.\n29"

    "Methods": "Data sources\nThe primary training and internal validation sample used in the present study came from the American Medical Rehabilitation Providers Association's subscription database, eRehabData. This database was created in 2002 as a standardized platform for participating IPR providers to fill out the Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility\u2013Patient Assessment Instrument (IRF-PAI). The database is used for insurance payment reimbursement, inpatient rehabilitation facility-level and national benchmarking, and research among inpatient rehabilitation populations.\nOur analytic sample was restricted to adults 16+ at IPR admission for whom TBI was the primary reason for rehabilitation. Cases of TBI were ascertained by the impairment group code of 2.21 or 2.22, and\nInternational Classification of Diseases\n(ICD) diagnoses codes for TBI from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case definition,\n19\nwhich was the same criteria used by a previous TBI study using the eRehabData database.\n2\nIndividuals who died during IPR were not included because of our primary interest in predicting function.\nAs an external validation sample, we used data from the TBIMS National Database. This multi-center longitudinal prospective cohort study enrolls participants who are 16+ years old at time of injury, received their acute care within 72\u2009h of injury, and received IPR at a designated TBIMS facility. Eligible TBIMS participants sustained a moderate-to-severe TBI defined by post-traumatic amnesia >24\u2009h, intracranial neuroimaging abnormalities on computed tomography, loss of consciousness >30\u2009min, or Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score in the Emergency Department <13.\n\nMeasures\nComorbid conditions\nWe classified the presence of comorbidities using ICD diagnoses codes according to Clinical Classification Software (CCS) produced by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), a federally sponsored program by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.\n20\nThe CCS contains a uniform and standardized categorization schema for mutually exclusive case definitions that may be employed for administrative claims-based research.\n21\nIn the IRF-PAI, providers may list up to 25 ICD diagnoses codes for comorbid conditions present during inpatient rehabilitation.\nOur list of selected comorbidities included 29 conditions included in the ECI\n14\nand an additional 10 conditions we hypothesized\na priori\nwould be relevant to TBI functional outcome based on a review of previous literature.\n22\u201332\nOne condition, \u201cEpilepsy and seizure disorder,\u201d was subsumed in the ECI category \u201cOther neurological disorders\u201d; however, because of its high incidence after TBI,\n30\nwe classified this condition into its own independent category. The full list of 39 conditions we considered and the corresponding ICD codes are provided in\nSupplementary Table S1\n.\nWhen we compared prevalence of each condition in the eRehabData database using ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis codes, we determined there were non-trivial differences in prevalence rates of the same conditions using ICD-9 versus ICD-10 (\nSupplementary Table S2\n), a trend that has been documented previously in the literature.\n33\u201335\nTherefore, we restricted the analysis to only persons with ICD-10 codes (IPR admissions between 2016\u20132020) in the eRehabData database (\nn\n=\u200930,458) and the external TBIMS National Database sample (\nn\n=\u20091925).\nPrimary outcome: functional outcome at inpatient rehabilitation discharge\nOur primary outcome was the Functional Independence Measure\nTM\n(FIM) Motor score at IPR discharge. The FIM Motor subscale measures functional performance on a 1 (total assist) to 7 (complete independence) scale for 13 modalities of motor function, where higher overall scores indicate better outcome. The FIM Motor is both functionally relevant and an important indicator of IPR outcome.\n36\nThe FIM Cognitive subscale is also relevant to long-term functioning\n37\n; however, given the centrality of the skills measured by FIM Motor to independence in activities of daily living (e.g., eating, grooming, toileting) and post-rehabilitation discharge care needs, we focused this initial study on development of comorbidity score anchored to FIM Motor. We used the Rasch-transformed FIM Motor score because of its linear scaling properties.\n38\nCovariates\nDemographic and selected clinical characteristics were available in the eRehabData database as a part of the IRF-PAI and were used to characterize the sample and compare the training and validation samples. Only age (considered continuously) and sex were used as covariates in internal validation models. The TBIMS National Database contains additional data on TBI severity not available in eRehabData, thereby facilitating adjustment for brain injury severity in the external validation. We used the GCS total score\n39\nas an index of brain injury severity.\n\nStatistical analysis\nUsing the eRehabData database, we calculated prevalence rates for all 39 comorbid health conditions. Next, we randomly divided our eRehabData sample into two independent subsamples: training (70%) and internal validation (30%). In the training subsample (\nn\n=\u200921,292), we calibrated comorbidity weights of the Fx-TBI-Health Index. To calibrate the weights, we used a penalized regression methodology, known as least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression.\nThe LASSO regression uses a shrinkage parameter, \u03bb, to select and retain only the most important variables for prediction by minimizing the sum of squared errors with a bound on the sum of the absolute value of beta coefficients.\n40\nThis facilitates the selection of key covariates for retention in the model by identifying and excluding variables that do not contribute to model fit, resulting in parsimonious models. Traditional regression-based models are susceptible to multi-collinearity and to overfitting model parameters narrowly to study data. LASSO regression has been used in a previous study in the general medical population to create a comorbid health index.\n41\nWe performed the LASSO regression in the training sample using the\nglmnet\npackage in R program.\n42\nIn the LASSO model, we included all 39 comorbidities, sex, and age at admission as predictors of Rasch-transformed FIM Motor at discharge. The variables included in the Fx-TBI-CI were selected using LASSO in the training sample, and the Fx-TBI-CI was then validated in independent internal and external validation samples. Because higher FIM Motor scores indicate more favorable outcomes, we multiplied all coefficients by -1, so higher values of our Fx-TBI-Health Index would correspond to poorer FIM Motor scores. We rounded the LASSO parameters to the next highest positive or negative integer for ease of interpretation.\nWe also created a Sum Condition Score, which was an unweighted score based on the same conditions as the Fx-TBI-CI, but instead of weighting the index based on model-based parameters, 1 point was assigned to conditions negatively associated with functional outcome, and -1 points were assigned to conditions positively associated with functional outcome. We created the Sum Condition Score to quantify prognostication of the weighted index versus an unweighted sum.\nIn the validation samples, we directly compared prognostication of the (1) Fx-TBI-CI, (2) Sum Condition Score, and the (3) ECI using incremental variability explained (\u0394R\n2\n) between Model 1 including age and sex only, and Model 1 plus each index added in separately. For the external validation, we also compared the incremental variance of each index added to Model 2, which included age, sex, and GCS. We documented the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), wherein lower values indicated better model fit.\nWe visually inspected the linearity of age and our outcome in both samples, but found no evidence that a non-linear age term was required in the models. To evaluate the performance of newly derived Fx-TBI-CI across different patient populations, we repeated the same validation analyses within sex and age (<65 vs. \u226565 years) subgroups. We chose the age cutoff of 65 because that has been used as a threshold for older adulthood.\n43"

    "Methods": "The study was approved by institutional review boards at all participating institutions. Written informed consent was obtained from parents, and youth provided written consent or assent depending on their age. The study used a prospective longitudinal design. We enrolled 220 children aged 8-15 years consecutively seen at an emergency department (ED) for mTBI and 110 children with mild orthopedic injury (OI) from consecutively treated patients seen at the same ED matched at the group-level by age and sex.\n\nTo ensure that children with \u201ca bump on the head\u201d but with no brain trauma were excluded, the mTBI group included children only if they suffered a closed-head injury that resulted in an observed loss of consciousness, a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)24score of 13 or 14, or at least two symptoms of concussion as noted by the ED medical staff (i.e., persistent post-traumatic amnesia, transient neurological deficits, vomiting, nausea, headache, diplopia, dizziness). Hospitalization did not automatically exclude participation. However, children with delayed neurological deterioration (e.g., GCS <13) were excluded. Children were excluded if their loss of consciousness was greater than 30\u2009min or had a GCS score of less than 13. The GCS was obtained from a review of the electronic medical record.\n\nOther exclusion criteria for the mTBI group included the following: 1) associated injury that is severe documented with the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS)25score greater than 3; 2) associated injury that is likely to interfere with cognitive testing (e.g., injury to dominant upper limb); 3) hypoxia, hypotension, or shock associated with the injury; 4) alcohol, drug ingestion, or child abuse involved with the injury; 5) documented history of previous TBI meeting the above criteria for at least mTBI; 6) pre-injury neurological disorder, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, or intellectual deficiency; 7) any medical contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging; 8) any injury requiring neurosurgical intervention; or 9) illegal immigrant status.\n\nInclusion criteria for children with OI were the presence of upper or lower limb fractures associated with AIS scores of 3 or less. Exclusion criteria included: 1) injury to the head or TBI; and 2) exclusion criteria 1-9 listed for the mTBI group.\n\nThe children's pre-injury function was assessed at baseline (mean\u2009=\u200917.7\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation [SD]\u2009=\u20095.8 days) and post-injury outcome was assessed at 3 months (mean\u2009=\u2009103.1 days\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD\u2009=\u200916.9) post-injury.\n\nAssessment of pre-injury child function\nLifetime pre-injury psychiatric status\nLifetime pre-injury psychiatric disorder was measured with the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Aged Children: Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) interview.\n26\nThe KSADS-PL has high inter-rater reliability and validity.\n26\nThe Neuropsychiatric Rating Schedule (NPRS)\n27\ninterview was administered to detect the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition\n(DSM-IV) diagnosis, Personality change due to TBI.\n28\nThe NPRS reliably and validly identifies symptoms and subtypes of personality change due to TBI.\n6\nThe Teacher's Report Form (TRF)\n29\nwas used to aid the psychiatric interviewer to reach a \u201cbest-estimate\u201d diagnosis.\n30\nThe interviewers discussed their diagnostic impressions by presenting every case to the first author, a board-certified child and adolescent psychiatrist, who was blind to group affiliation.\nPre-injury adaptive behavior function\nThe adaptive behavior composite was assessed using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (Vineland II) interview with the parent.\n31\nPre-injury intellectual and academic function\nThe Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI-II)\n32\nVocabulary and Matrix Reasoning subtests were administered at baseline to obtain an estimate of pre-injury Full Scale IQ standard score. The Wide Range Achievement Test-Fourth Edition (WRAT-4)\n33\nwhich assesses sentence comprehension, word recognition, spelling, and calculation skills, was administered at baseline. Standard scores of sentence comprehension and calculation skills were used in the analyses. Previous research has indicated that these measures of \u201ccrystalized ability\u201d are relatively insensitive to the effects of mTBI when measured shortly after the injury.\n16\n,\n34\n\nAssessment of pre-injury family status\nFamily function\nThe McMaster Structured Interview of Family Functioning (McSIFF)\n35\nwas conducted by trained research assistants with family household members at baseline to retrospectively assess pre-injury family function. The interview is a tool used to derive scores on a rating scale termed the Clinical Rating Scale (CRS).\n35\nUsing the McSIFF, pre-injury family function is a consistent predictor of novel psychiatric disorder after TBI.\n2\nThe global CRS score has been shown to be a valid and reliable method of family assessment.\n35\n,\n36\nThe General Functioning Scale of the McMaster Family Assessment Device (FAD),\n37\nwhich was completed by the primary caretaker of the injured child at baseline, is a reliable and valid 12-item rating scale that provides an overall measure of pre-injury family functioning\n38\nthat was used in the analyses\nFamily psychiatric history\nThe Family History Research Diagnostic Criteria\n39\nmodified to DSM-IV Text Revision criteria is a semi-structured interview with the parent that screens for specific psychiatric diagnoses in first-degree family members. The analyses used the overall family psychiatric history ratings, which are summarized on a 4-point scale: 0\u2009=\u2009no psychiatric disorder; 1\u2009=\u2009at least one family member met criteria for a psychiatric disorder but no treatment was received; 2\u2009=\u2009a family member met criteria for a psychiatric disorder and received outpatient treatment or was arrested for antisocial behavior; 3\u2009=\u2009a family member met criteria for a psychiatric disorder and had inpatient psychiatric treatment or was incarcerated.\n2\nParticipants were categorized as having either low (scores of 0-1) or high (scores of 2-3) intensity family psychiatric history for the analyses\nSocioeconomic status\nSocioeconomic status (SES), expressed as a z-score, was assessed using a composite of maternal education and median income for the census tract of the family's residence. The composite was calculated by averaging the sample z-scores of the two variables. This composite score functions well as a measure of SES in TBI studies.\n40\n\nAssessment of injury severity\nThe Injury Severity Score (ISS) from the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) was recorded from electronic medical record data.\n25\nThe ISS is the sum of the squares of the highest AIS code in each of the three most severely injured ISS body regions.\n\nPost-injury psychiatric outcome\nThe K-SADS-PL, NPRS, and TRF were repeated at 3 months. The interviewer generated \u201cbest-estimate\u201d clinically significant psychiatric diagnoses by integrating the information from these instruments.\n30\nAs in previous work,\n2\n,\n5\nan NPD diagnosis was given in two circumstances: First, this could occur in a participant with no pre-injury lifetime psychiatric disorder who then develops a psychiatric disorder. Second, this could occur in a participant with a pre-injury lifetime psychiatric disorder who develops a different psychiatric disorder (e.g., a participant with a pre-injury lifetime history of major depression who develops attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] following the injury would receive the classification but would not if only a new episode of major depression occurred). Duration criteria for psychiatric disorders except for major depression and bipolar disorder were waived to examine the phenomenology of emerging post-injury disorders. Similarly, as in our previous work, the age of onset criterion for ADHD was waived to study the phenomenology of this particular NPD.\n2\nThe interviewers made every attempt to remain blind to group membership (mTBI vs. OI control), although at baseline, this was often impossible because of physical stigmata of TBI and OI. However, the baseline psychiatric assessment deals only with pre-injury psychiatric status and was not the outcome of interest. Therefore, the study design insured that the interviewer who conducted the baseline assessment for a particular participant did not conduct post-injury psychiatric assessments for that individual. This left the psychiatric interviewer who conducted the 3-month blind to injury group. The interviewers presented every case to the first author who was blind to group affiliation.\nInter-rater reliability for psychiatric diagnoses was conducted based on 12 video-recorded interviews (\nSupplementary Material\n). All research participants and their guardians were asked to consent for video recording of the psychiatric interview process. The \u201cbest-estimate\u201d current and past ratings involved integration by the clinician of the parent's and child's video-recorded interview, teacher's input when available, and clinical judgment of the parent's and child's reliability and mental status. Agreement with respect to psychiatric diagnosis was perfect in 10/12 (83%) cases encompassing agreement for all specific current as well as past diagnoses or absence of a diagnosis in a participant. We conducted a Kappa analysis of inter-rater reliability for these categorical diagnoses. There was agreement between raters in 26/29 specific diagnostic data points and disagreement in 3/29 yielding a Kappa\u2009=\u20090.80 indicating substantial agreement.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe eligible patients with mTBI who presented to the ED but who did not enroll in the study (\nn\n=\u2009741) were compared with the patients with mTBI who did enroll (\nn\n=\u2009220) with respect to sex using Pearson's chi-square test, and with respect to age and GCS score using independent sample t-tests. Fisher's exact test was used instead of Pearson's test when the expected counts were \u22645 in any of the crosstabulation cells. Similarly, we used Pearson's or Fisher's test for categorical variables and independent sample t-test for continuous variables in comparisons of the enrolled mTBI versus OI groups, the participating mTBI versus OI groups at 3 months, and also the entire participating cohort at 3 months versus the enrolled but non-participating cohort at 3 months with respect to age, sex, SES, race (White vs. Minority), ethnicity, pre-injury lifetime psychiatric disorder, pre-injury current disorder, pre-injury adaptive function, family psychiatric history, pre-injury family function, IQ, sentence comprehension, calculation skills, Injury Severity Score, cause of injury, and sports-related injury status.\nTo determine the effect of mTBI on NPD in the first 3 months post-injury (hypothesis 1), the NPD count (total number of diagnoses) for each child was recorded at the 3-month visit and was compared between the mTBI and OI groups using a Poisson log-linear regression model. The potential confounders included demographics: age, sex, race; pre-injury child function: lifetime pre-injury psychiatric disorder, Vineland Adaptive Behavior composite, WASI-II Full Scale IQ, WRAT-4 Sentence Comprehension and Calculation Skills; pre-injury family status: SES, family psychiatric history, family function (CRS and FAD); and injury status (Injury Severity Score). Among these potential confounders, those which were significant at\np\n<\u20090.15 in single-predictor Poisson regression models were included in the starting multi-predictor Poisson regression and subject to backward model selection with a\np\n<\u20090.15 threshold (adjusted analysis). The statistical tests and 95% confidence intervals (CI\n95\n) were based on the likelihood ratio test. Backward model selection with a lax threshold of 0.15-0.20 is recommended in regression models for determining causal effects in the presence of confounding.\n41\nAn overdispersion check was based on the ratio of the residual deviance to the residual degrees of freedom, which was \u22642 in all cases (no overdispersion). The effects of predictors are reported in terms of mean ratio of NPD counts between any two groups under comparison, adjusted for the other predictors in the model.\nTo determine a multi-predictor model for the NPD count at 3 months (hypothesis 2), we similarly fit a multi-predictor Poisson model, where predictors with\np\n<\u20090.15 in single-predictor analyses were included in the starting model and the model was reduced using backward model selection with\np\n<\u20090.15 threshold. This is similar to the analysis determining the effect of mTBI, except that here mTBI exposure was also subject to model selection.\n41"

    "Methods": "The TBI-ADRD committee followed methods deployed in the 2013 ADRD Conference31and 2016 ADRD Summit32as described below.\n\nPre-summit activities\nStarting in late summer 2018, NINDS and National Institute on Aging (NIA) leadership and staff convened with the ADRD Summit 2019 Scientific Chair (JS) to develop an overall strategy. Together, they defined topic areas corresponding to seven summit sessions and selected scientific chairs for each session. The session chair of the TBI-ADRD committee (KDOC), together with National Institutes of Health (NIH) session leads, formed a committee by selecting from a roster of experts with broad expertise in post-traumatic neurodegeneration (DS), TBI and dementia epidemiology (MP), and TBI and dementia biomarkers (HZ). The committee met regularly via teleconference between October 2018 and March 2019 to develop and refine scientific recommendations. Because this was the first time TBI-ADRD was part of the Summit, these committees did not assess progress on the 2016 ADRD research recommendations,\n32\n,\n33\nbut rather reviewed the scientific literature to identify gaps and priorities for formal consideration by the NINDS and National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) Councils.\nA joint NINDS/NIA request for information solicited public input on updating the ADRD research priorities, and NIH staff provided the committee with responses for review. Cross-committee coordination was facilitated by monthly teleconferences of the Summit Organizing Committee which consisted of scientific committee chairs; the Summit Scientific Chair (JS); NIH and other federal officials including NINDS/NIH Summit lead (RC); and the Steering Committee.\n34\nAs an Emerging Topic session, the TBI committee had the option of proposing up to four prioritized recommendations. The committee was asked to provide an estimated timeline for initiation and establishment of fully operational status after work is initiated, which would serve to guide planning and implementation logistics. The ADRD Summit 2019 agenda and draft recommendations were then posted online and distributed to ADRD Summit registrants to gather input from stakeholders.\n\nSummit\nMore than 810 individuals registered for the ADRD Summit 2019: 481 joined in person on March 14-15, 2019, and over 2,000 viewed the Summit online during or after the conference. As with the other six Topic Committees, the TBI-ADRD Chair (KDOC) provided a brief introduction to the topic area and then presented a summary of scientific rationale and draft recommendations for investigating TBI as a risk factor for common dementias. She also provided a summary of the input that was submitted by members of the research community, healthcare providers, and other stakeholders. The primary goal of these presentations was to seek public input on recommendations; thus, attendees were invited to pose questions and engage in real-time discussion after the presentation.\n\nPost-summit follow-up\nFollowing the summit proceedings, NINDS led a closed executive session with session chairs, NIH and other federal officials, Steering Committee members,\n34\nand the Scientific Chair to review the proposed revisions and edit the draft recommendations. Over teleconference, the TBI-ADRD committee met to further refine the content, prioritization, and proposed timelines for research recommendations. The final recommendations were approved and submitted to the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n34"

    "Methods": "All animal procedures were approved by the Rutgers University and Yale University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs) and in accordance with National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines. Female Sprague Dawley rats 1.5 months of age were procured from a commercial vendor (Taconic, USA). One week prior to injury, baseline sensorimotor behavior was assessed and thereafter animals were assigned to sham (n=\u20097) or SCI (n=\u200911) groups at 2 months of age (weight range: 180\u2013200\u2009g) using simple randomization. Food (standard chow) and water were providedad libitumand the rats were maintained in a 12\u2009h light/dark cycle with the start of the light cycle at 7:00 (local time). All behavioral tests were performed between 10:00 and 12:00, 3\u20135\u2009h from the start of the light cycle.\n\nSurgery and SCI induction\nAnimals were anesthetized with Ketamine/Xylazine (100\u2009mg/10\u2009mg/kg, i.p) and laminectomies were performed unilaterally on the left side at the C4-C5 level (\nFig. 1A\n). Using aseptic techniques, a midline incision was made from the base of the skull to the scapula exposing the dorsal elements of the C2-C5 vertebrae. Sharp dissection elevating the three layers of paraspinal musculature on the left side provided the necessary exposure. To obtain a good surgical field for the laminectomy, muscles were retracted with four homemade retractors\n13\nand pulled away using a rongeur. Hemilaminectomies of the left C4 and C5 levels were performed using rongeurs. Subsequently, the animals were mounted on the Infinite Horizon (IH) Impactor device (Precision Systems and Instrumentation LLC, Lexington, KY). The impactor tip (2.5\u2009mm in diameter) was lowered and aimed using the vertical adjustment knob and the two horizontal adjustment knobs on the IH impactor until the center of the impactor tip hovered 1\u2009mm to the left of the apex of the C4-C5 midline spinous processes. The vertical adjustment knob was turned 3.5 turns to raise the tip 7\u2009mm above the dura and a 150 kdyn force setting was utilized to perform a moderate mechanical-impact contusion injury. Sham animals underwent identical hemilaminectomies, including the muscle dissections without the impact injury. Post-injury, muscle layers were sutured using absorbable sutures (5-0) and the skin incisions were closed using wound clips. Animals were provided 2\u2009mL saline i.p to prevent dehydration and buprenorphine SR (0.03\u2009mg/kg, subcutaneous) for analgesia immediately after surgery. Animals were monitored twice a day during the first 48\u2009h after surgery and daily thereafter until 6 weeks. Bladder care was not required as observed by post-operative water consumption behavior and from traces of urination in the home cages and spontaneous urine traces during the cylinder test. All surgeries and the immediate post-operative care, including behavioral testing, was performed at Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences. At the end of 6 weeks, after completion of the behavioral experiments, the animals were transferred to Yale University. After a quarantine of 2 weeks to ascertain the health of the animals after transfer and fulfilling quarantine procedures, MRI experiments were performed 8 weeks after the sham or SCI surgeries. It was not necessary to exclude rats post-SCI, because consistent injury lesions could be achieved across all 11 SCI animals as determined by MRI of the cervical spine, as has been published recently.\n12\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\n(A)\nSchematic of the rat brain and cervical spinal cord showing the hemicontusion injury impact site lateralized to the left side of the spinal cord at the C4-C5 vertebral level.\n(B)\nAxial T1 and T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (1\u2009mm slice thickness; in plane resolution 750\u2009\u00d7\u2009750\u2009\u03bcm) from typical sham and spinal cord injured (SCI) animal showing the rostral and caudal extent of lesions from the injury epicenter. All SCI animal subjects included in the study (\nn\n=\u200911) showed a similar extent of lesions, with no detectable lesions among sham animals (\nn\n=\u20097). SC-intact somatosensory cortex; DC-deafferented somatosensory cortex. Color image is available online.\n\nSensorimotor behavior\nThe forelimb usage test was a modified cylinder test that used a transparent plastic cubical container of 25\u2009cm sides to evaluate spontaneous forelimb usage behavior.\n14\n,\n15\nEach animal was observed for 5\u2009min duration in a test cage to establish a baseline 5 days prior to the index sham or SCI surgeries. Active exploration of the vertical surfaces by rearing up on their hindlimbs and wall surface exploration with their forelimbs were observed and scored. The number of independent wall placements observed for contralateral, ipsilateral, or both forelimbs were scored. The contralateral, ipsilateral, or both-forelimb usage as a percentage of all forelimb usage within the 5\u2009min observation duration was determined.\nThe Hargreaves test (an evaluation of sensation using a heat stimulus), was performed at 5 and 6 weeks after SCI at the same time of the day for all testing sessions with animals randomly altered within and across sessions with modifications from earlier SCI studies in the current rat model.\n16\n,\n17\nRats were habituated for 15\u2009min to restrainers placed on a glass surface (IITC Life Science, Woodland Hills, CA, USA). A radiant heat beam of intensity equivalent to 30% of the maximum intensity of the IITC device was delivered to the plantar paw surface. Paw withdrawal latency was recorded in seconds three times for each forepaw and hindpaw measured randomly, and the means were estimated. A gap of 1\u2009min was provided between each heat stimulus and the cutoff time for observation was set to 20\u2009sec to avoid tissue damage.\n\nMRI\nAt 8 weeks after SCI, MRI and fMRI were performed using a Bruker 9.4T spectrometer and an ellipsoidal surface coil (5\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009cm). Animals were initially anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane in a mixture of O\n2\nand N\n2\nO (30%/70%), and a PE 50 tubing was placed into the intraperitoneal cavity for dexmedetomidine (sedative) infusion. Thereafter animals were maintained under complete anesthesia with 0.3% isoflurane and 250\u2009\u03bcg/kg/h i.p, dexmedetomidine and placed in a custom-built holder where they were freely breathing through a nose cone. Body temperature was maintained at 36\u201337\u00b0C using a heating pad and monitored using an MRI compatible rectal probe throughout the fMRI experiments.\nBrain imaging\nPrior to the fMRI measure, anatomical MRI were acquired over 12 contiguous coronal brain slices (thickness\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm), covering the parenchyma between the olfactory bulb and the cerebellum. Anatomical reference images (repetition time [TR]/echo time [TE]\u2009=\u20094000/30\u2009ms, 2 averages) were acquired in a 128\u2009\u00d7\u200996 matrix, using a T2 weighted turbo rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) sequence providing an in-plane resolution of 250\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u2009250\u2009\u03bcm for a field of view (FOV) of 3.2\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u20092.4\u2009cm. Additionally, a fast three dimensional (3D) anatomical scan (TR/TE\u2009=\u200950\u2009ms/5.6\u2009ms, flip angle [FA]\u2009=\u200920 degrees, 2 averages) was acquired with an isotropic resolution of 250\u2009\u03bcm for image registration purposes. Brain fMRI was performed across the 12 anatomical coronal slice positions using a gradient recalled echo planar imaging (GE-EPI) with TR/TE\u2009=\u20091000\u2009ms/15\u2009ms; 64\u2009\u00d7\u200948 matrix and 500\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u2009500\u2009\u03bcm in-plane resolution. The GE-EPI sequence produced an image contrast sensitive to BOLD changes.\n18\nfMRI was performed under both task and resting state conditions. For the tasks, a non-noxious electrical forepaw stimulation was provided using two subcutaneously placed needle electrodes inserted into the left and right forepaws (between the second and fourth digits). Electrical stimulus presentation was controlled by a \u03bc1401 analog-to-digital converter unit (CED, Cambridge, UK) running a custom-written script.\n19\nThe control settings provided a block design innocuous electrical stimulus of 30\u2009sec duration with a 0.3\u2009ms pulse width monophasic square wave pulses of 2\u2009mA amplitude and 9\u2009Hz frequency by a stimulator/isolator unit (WPI, Sarasota, FL).\n20\nThe main rationale to deliver an innocuous electrical stimulation was to map the supraspinal sensory reorganization. Furthermore, as any noxious stimulus may confound the spontaneous pain measures during the subsequent resting state fMRI measurements, noxious electrical stimulation experiments were avoided. Task fMRI scans lasted 120\u2009sec (120 acquisitions) during which a 30s pre-stimulus baseline was followed by 30\u2009sec electrical stimulation followed by 60\u2009sec post-stimulus baseline. Three task fMRI scans were completed for each forepaw across each animal. Four resting state fMRI scans each lasting 512\u2009sec (512 acquisitions) were obtained across each animal. The order of task and resting state fMRI scans were randomized across animal subjects.\nSpinal imaging\nImmediately following the fMRI experiment, the rats were euthanized with 5% isoflurane until respiration ceased and they were positioned within the radiofrequency (RF) coil with the cervical spine at the isocenter of the RF coil. To minimize motion artifacts and preserve T1 and T2-MRI outcomes similar to those in live animals,\n21\nspinal MRI was started immediately after euthanasia. RARE and fast spin echo (FSE)-RARE (TurboRARE) pulse sequences were used for the acquisition of the T1- and T2-weighted images respectively in the axial plane. RARE T1-weighted sequence parameters, TR/TE\u2009=\u20094000\u2009ms/5.8\u2009ms; image matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, FOV\u2009=\u200928\u2009mm and number of excitations (NEX)\u2009=\u20092. For the T2 TurboRARE, TR/TE\u2009=\u20096000\u2009ms/33\u2009ms; image matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, FOV\u2009=\u200928\u2009mm, number of echoes\u2009=\u20098; and NEX\u2009=\u20092 was used. Twenty-four axial MRI slices, 1\u2009mm thick, from the brainstem rostral to the C1 to the T1 vertebral level were covered by the slices. MRI-based spinal morphometric changes in the same sham and SCI animal subjects used in the current study have been characterized in our recent study.\n12\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll brain image data analyses were performed using custom-written MATLAB codes. Anatomical images were co-registered between rats as follows: using BioImage Suite (Yale School of Medicine, 2015,\nbioimagesuite.yale.edu\n), rats 2-18's brain anatomical images were registered to sham-rat 1's anatomical brain image using a nonlinear registration (50 iterations, normalized mutual information, otherwise default). Average of all 18 registered images was used to create a \u201ctemplate brain\u201d and subsequently brain anatomical images from each animal were registered to the template brain using a non-linear registration (50 iterations, normalized mutual information, and otherwise default). Functional images were co-registered between rats after slice-timing correction followed by motion-correction (to the middle volume rather than the first volume), which were performed in SPM12 (The FIL Methods group, 2015,\nwww.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12\n). Subsequently, the corresponding animal's non-linear transformation to the template brain was applied to the functional images using BioImage Suite (see previous paragraph). To facilitate inter-animal comparisons, data were blurred in every slice using a Gaussian filter (\u03c3\u2009=\u20092 voxels/0.250\u2009mm, size\u2009=\u20098 voxels/mm).\nBOLD-fMRI time series data were linearly de-trended to remove temporal signal drifts for the resting state scans only, and no de-trending was performed on the forepaw activation scans to avoid biasing the BOLD response curve to the task challenge. fMRI activation maps during task conditions were generated using a\nt\ntest between the baseline and activated state image volumes using a threshold of\np\n<\u20090.05 corrected for multiple comparisons. Activation maps were generated by considering each forepaw stimulation trial and performing a voxelwise\nt\ntest for 30\u201360\u2009sec (forepaw stimulation) > 0\u201330\u2009sec (pre-stimulus baseline) (two-sample, one-tailed, equal variance). Spatial extents of T values were saved across every trial. Statistical significance was considered at a threshold of\np\n< 0.05 (corresponding to T\u2009\u2265\u20092) corrected for multiple comparisons using a sequential goodness of fit metatest (SGoF).\n22\nAll activation maps were overlaid on the corresponding anatomical images. Single run data were used to create subject level activation maps (30\u2009sec rest vs. 30\u2009sec stimulation). The subject-level average time course of BOLD signals was generated from the significantly activated voxels.\nFunctional connectivity density (FCD) is a voxel- and degree-based metric, which identifies the number of correlated voxels to a base voxel without identifying the precise location of the correlated voxels. These metrics are degree based, as they are based on the number of voxels that a given voxel is strongly correlated with, or functionally \u2018\u2018connected to.\u2019\u2019\n23\nGlobal FCD determination is a standard graph theory-based analysis determining brain functional connectivity using resting state fMRI and originally demonstrated in the human brain.\n23\nHowever, the global FCD metric can be divided into two subgroups: short-range FCD, when only those voxels are studied that are in the neighborhood of the base voxel (in our study not farther than 3\u2009mm) and long-range FCD, when only those voxels are examined (farther than 3\u2009mm from the base voxel). A correlation threshold \u22650.6 (Pearson's correlation) between the base voxel and any other voxel was considered significantly different. During the FCD calculation we systematically went through all possible correlations between all available voxels, with each of them to be considered as base voxels. This method is sensitive to the number of available voxels in the brain volume, which may differ between animals because of variation in brain volumes, susceptibility artefacts, and shimming differences. For example, the FCD number of the same base voxel can be different if we compare the base voxel with 1000 voxels instead of 1100 voxels. Hence, we normalized the final FCD values with the number of available voxels in each animal and gave the FCD values as a percentage of the available voxels; for example, if one voxel FCD number is 13 (i.e., correlated to 13 other voxels with higher correlation coefficients than the threshold), and the total number of available voxels is 1000, then the given percentage is 13/1000\u2009\u00d7\u2009100\u2009=\u20091.3%. FCD was calculated after the image registration to the template brain and applying spatial Gaussian filtering (full width at half maximum [FWHM]\u2009=\u20091.5\u2009mm). BOLD time series across all voxels were de-trended using a second order fit without altering the mean amplitude. Global signal regression was avoided and only the time series were temporally filtered using a fourth order Butterworth band-pass filter between 0.001 and 0.15\u2009Hz.\nAlthough FCD gives a voxelwise quantification of functional connections, it does not provide the directionality of the functional connectivity, which can be assessed with seed-based correlation analyses. Therefore, FCD was used to identify regions of interest (ROI) hubs that could then be used to select seed regions for subsequent resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) analyses. Seed-based correlations pre-processing procedures were similar to the FCD analyses. Here the mean anatomical template from the 18 animals were registered to the SIGMA rat brain template (\nhttps://www.nitrc.org/projects/sigma_template\n), from which standard anatomical regions of interest (ROIs) were extracted forming the regional masks (\nSupplementary Fig. S1\n). For the seed-based cross-correlation analysis determining RSFC, average BOLD time series were generated for each seed ROI. Seeds from 14 different anatomical ROIs were considered based on the implicated regions from the FCD analysis. The average signal time series from each ROI seed was cross-correlated with the average time series of 13 other selected ROIs to obtain three correlation maps for each of the three resting state scans across each animal. Subsequently, all correlation maps were averaged across scans and animals in the sham and SCI groups after a Fisher's z-transformation converting the correlation coefficients to z-scores.\nSummary statistical analysis on behavioral data was performed using a two-tailed\nt\ntest with\np\n<\u20090.05 required for significance. Association between FCD and behavior was determined by linear regression and correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient \u201cR\u201d), to estimate the association strength and the significance of the correlation tested by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Correlations with significance\np\n<\u20090.05 were deemed significant.\nAfter behavioral assessments, rats were transferred to Yale University for the fMRI experiments in two batches. The first batch contained two sham and six SCI rats, in which pain behavior measurements and forepaw stimulation studies were not performed in the fMRI studies. Hence behavioral results and stimulation-induced fMRI studies are reported from a subset of the sham (\nn\n=\u20095) and SCI (\nn\n=\u20095) animals from the second batch transferred to Yale University."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nAdult male Sprague Dawley (200\u2013400\u2009g) rats were obtained from\nEnvigo (Houston, TX). Upon arrival to the vivarium, animals were dual-housed in\na room with a 12-h light\u2013dark cycle with food and water\nad\nlibitum\n. Animals were acclimated to the room for at least 7 days\nbefore experimentation. Experiments were performed during the light cycle. All\nwork was conducted in accordance with National Institutes of Health (NIH)\nstandards for the care and use of laboratory animals and approved by the\nUniversity Laboratory Animal Care Committee at Texas A&M\nUniversity.\n18\nEvery\neffort was made to minimize suffering and limit the number of animals used.\n\nContusion surgery\nUsing the New York University (NYU) Multicenter Animal Spinal Cord Injury Study\n(MASCIS) device, rats received a contusion at the T11\u2013T12 vertebral\nlevel. For the surgery, animals were anesthetized with a mixture of 5%\nisoflurane and medical oxygen. Concentrations of isoflurane were maintained at\n2\u20133% isoflurane during surgery. An initial incision was made\nthrough the skin centered over the T12 vertebra. Next, two longitudinal\nincisions (3\u2009cm in length) centered over the T12 vertebra were made on\nboth sides of the spinal column. The T12 vertebra was then exposed and a\nlaminectomy was performed. The spinal column was secured in the MASCIS device\nand the impactor centered on the lesion site. A 10\u2009g weight was then\ndropped from a height of 12.5\u2009mm. Rats receiving a sham operation went\nthrough all surgery steps except that the weight was not dropped. After surgery,\nMichel clips were used to close the skin incision. Animals then received an\nintraperitoneal (i.p.) of 100,000\u2009U/kg of penicillin and 3\u2009mL of\nsaline to prevent infections and compensate for fluid loss. Animals were then\nplaced in a temperature-controlled recovery room (25\u00b0C) and allowed to\nrecover overnight (24\u2009h) with food and water\nad libitum\n.\nBladders were voided twice daily and prior to any experimental procedures. After\nexperimentation was finished, animals were euthanized with a lethal dose of\npentobarbital (100\u2009mg/kg; i.p.).\n\nLocomotor performance\nBefore surgery, rats were acclimated on three separate days to a 99.1\n(diameter)\u2009\u00d7\u200920.3 (deep) cm blue wading pool (Target) for\n4\u2009min. Beginning the day after contusion, locomotor performance was\nassessed using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor\nscale.\n19\nTo obtain the\nBBB score, the rat was placed in the observation arena and locomotor performance\nwas assessed for 4\u2009min by two trained observers blinded to\nanimal's treatment condition. BBB scores were re-sampled at later time\npoints during each experiment to examine changes in locomotor performance. For\nlong-term recovery studies, BBB scores were analyzed for the first 7 days, at 10\ndays, and then once a week until day 21. BBB scores were converted using the\nformula described in the study by Ferguson and colleagues,\n20\nwhich improves the metric\nproperties of the scale by avoiding discontinuities and better equating the\nintervals between units.\n\nBlood pressure, heart rate, and blood flow\nBefore surgery, rats were acclimated on three separate days to clear acrylic\ntubes with a black adjustable nose cone atop a far-infrared warming platform\n(Kent Scientific). Testing was done in a warm room (27\u00b0C) with dim\nlighting. Tail temperature was monitored with an infrared thermometer to ensure\nthat temperatures reached and were maintained between 32 and 35\u00b0C.\nAnimals were acclimated to restraint tubes for 5\u2009min before the occlusion\ncuff and volume pressure recording (VPR) sensor were carefully glided up the\ntail and secured at the base of the tail. Animals were then acclimated to the\ncuffs for another 5\u2009min before BP measurements were obtained. BP\nmeasurements, heart rate, and blood flow were obtained using the\nCODA\n\u00ae\nHigh Throughput Noninvasive BP system and data\nacquisition software. The program was set to automatically inflate and deflate\nthe cuffs for 15 consecutive cycles with 5\u2009sec between cycles. The\nmaximum occlusion pressure was set at 250\u2009mm Hg with a deflation time of\n20\u2009sec and a minimum volume of 15\u2009\u03bcL. Acquisition of data\nlasted approximately 10\u2009min. During acquisition, tail and body\ntemperature were regularly monitored. If for any reason the animal did not have\nat least 4 acceptable BP readings and 1 heart rate reading, the animal would\nreceive an additional 5 trials immediately following the last regular trial.\nAfter the assessment of BP, heart rate, and blood flow, the occlusion cuff and\nVPR sensor were taken off the tail and animals were removed from the restraint\ntubes. Finally, animals had their bladders voided before being placed back in\ntheir home cage. MAP was calculated using the following formula:\n[(2\u2009\u00d7\u2009diastolic) + systolic)/3].\n\nDrug preparation and administration\nPrazosin (3\u2009mg/kg) was dissolved in 30% glucose. Because of the low\nsolubility of prazosin, hydrochloric acid was added when dissolving the drug.\nOnce dissolved, the solution was adjusted to pH 7 and brought up to the final\nvolume. Prazosin was delivered by an i.p. injection with a volume of 2\u2009mL\nper 350\u2009g rat.\nNE (0.5\u2009mg/kg) was dissolved in 0.9% saline and adjusted to pH 7.\nNE was injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with a volume of 1\u20132\u2009mL into\nthe rat's lower flank.\nCapsaicin (3%) was dissolved in a solution of 7% Tween-80 and\n93% saline (0.9% NaCl). Because of the low solubility of\ncapsaicin, it had to be slightly heated and vortexed immediately before\nadministration. Capsaicin was administered using an intradermal (ID) injection\ninto the dorsal surface of the paw at a volume of 0.05\u2009mL.\n\nNoxious electrical tail stimulation\nRats were set up for noxious electrical stimulation to the tail as previously\ndescribed in the study by Crown and colleagues.\n21\nIn brief, animals were restrained in opaque\nPlexiglas tubes with their hindlimbs hanging freely in a soundproof box. An\nelectrode was placed \u223c4\u2009cm from the tip of the tail and secured\nwith porous tape. Electrode gel was used to ensure that the tail maintained a\ngood contact with the electrode surface. Electrical stimulation was given in a\nvariable-spaced pattern (80\u2009ms pulse, intertrial interval\n0.2\u20133.8\u2009sec, 60\u2009Hz AC current). Animals received 180\nstimulations at an intensity of 1.5\u2009mA. Unshocked controls were\nrestrained in tubes with the electrode attached for an equivalent duration, but\nno shock was administered.\n\nInstrumental learning\nRats were loosely restrained in opaque Plexiglas tubes, which allowed the legs to\nhang freely. The leg was then set up for instrumental learning as described in\nGrau and colleagues.\n3\nIn brief,\na thin wire electrode was placed into the tibialis anterior muscle 3.2\u2009cm\nabove the ankle. The other lead consisted of a stainless-steel wire looped\nthrough the skin 1.5\u2009cm above the ankle (1.7\u2009cm below the other\nlead). An 8\u2009cm contact electrode was secured with porous tape to the\nplantar side of the paw. To minimize lateral leg movements, a piece of porous\ntape was wrapped around the leg above the ankle and taped to a bar extending\nacross the apparatus directly under the front panel of restraining tube. Once\nthe leg was set up, a small glass dish filled with a salt solution was placed\nunder the animal's leg. To establish the initial resting position of the\nleg, three brief (100\u2009ms) shocks were applied to the tibialis anterior\nmuscle. The underlying salt solution was then adjusted so that the rod was\nsubmerged by 4\u2009mm. The leg used for testing was counterbalanced across\ngroups. To monitor leg position, an electrode was placed in the water. Whenever\nthe contact electrode touched the salt solution, it completed a circuit that was\nmeasured by the computer.\nInstrumental training lasted a total of 30\u2009min. Master and yoked rats were\nalways run in pairs. For animals receiving Master shock, electrical stimulation\nto the tibialis anterior muscle was given whenever the foot touched the\nunderlying salt solution. Because contused animals learn very quickly, salt\nsolution was added to the underlying dish when the master subject learned to\nmaintain its leg above the solution for 2 consecutive min within the first\n10\u2009min of training. Solution was added in increments of 25\u2009mL\n(i.e., 2\u2009mm increase) until the contact electrode touched the underlying\nsolution. For subjects receiving noncontingent shock (yoked), animals received\nshock whenever the master rat's foot touched the underlying solution, and\nsolution level was adjusted at the same time and by the same amount. As a\ncontrol, a group of animals remained unshocked. Unshocked rats had their legs\nset up as outlined; however, after receiving the three shocks used to set the\nwater level, the animal received no other shocks and remained in the tubes for\n30\u2009min. At the end of training, the computer compiled data into\n1\u2009min time bins. Learning was defined as an increase in flexion duration.\nFlexion duration was calculated for each time bin using the following formula:\n(60\u2009sec minus time in solution\ni\n) / (Response\nNumber\ni\n+ 1), where i is the current time bin.\n\nID capsaicin injection\nRats were restrained in opaque Plexiglas tubes with their hindlimbs hanging\nfreely. Capsaicin (3%) was injected ID into the dorsal surface of the\nhindpaw using a 27-gauge needle. Controls received an injection of vehicle\n(7% Tween-80 in 23% saline). The injected paw (right versus left)\nwas counterbalanced across subjects. To maintain consistency across treatment\nconditions and with past studies, capsaicin and vehicle treated animals remained\nin the tubes for 6\u2009min after injection.\n\nHemorrhage analysis\nTissue collection\nAfter a lethal dose of pentobarbital, a 1\u2009cm section of spinal cord\ntissue centered at the lesion site was extracted and flash frozen in liquid\nnitrogen. Samples were stored at -80\u00b0C until processed. Tissue was\nprocessed for protein isolation using QIAzol lysis reagent according to the\nmanufacturer's instructions.\nImmunoblotting\nA Bradford assay was used to quantify protein concentration of each sample.\nSamples were then diluted with 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009Laemeli buffer to a\nfinal concentration of 3\u2009\u03bcg/\u03bcL, except for Experiment\n1, in which the concentration was 2\u2009\u03bcg/\u03bcL. Western\nblots were run on pre-cast 26-well Criterion gels (BIORAD). Briefly, protein\nsamples in 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009Laemeli buffer were heated to\n96\u00b0C for 10\u2009min before 10\u2009\u03bcL of each sample was\nloaded into the wells. Electrophoresis was performed at 180\u2009V for\n\u223c1\u2009h and 15\u2009min. Samples were then transferred to a\npolyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane for 1\u2009h at 100\u2009V.\nMembranes were incubated in blocking solution (milk) for 1\u2009h before\nbeing placed overnight in primary antibody (hemoglobin-\u03b1, 1:1000:ADD\nID) at 4\u00b0C. The next day, membranes underwent three 15-min washes\nwith TBST before incubation for 1\u2009h in secondary antibodies (goat\nanti-rabbit, 1:5000) at room temperature. Finally, blots were incubated in\nEnhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) and imaged with Fluorchem HD2\n(ProteinSimple, Santa Clara, CA, USA). To obtain a measure of net\nhemoglobin-\u03b1 content, binding was summed for the monomer, dimer, and\ntrimer.\nSpectrophotometry\nA 1.5\u2009\u03bcL sample of the protein extract (before it was diluted\nwith Laemeli buffer) was loaded into a spectrophotometer (Thermo) and a full\nspectrum analysis was run. Absorbance was analyzed at 420\u2009nm for\nhemoglobin.\n22\nTo further assess the level of hemorrhage, samples were incubated with\nDrabkin's reagent. The reagent binds and converts free hemoglobin to\nits cyanmethemoglobin derivative, which can then be analyzed at\n540\u2009nm to quantify the total hemoglobin concentration in the protein\nextracts.\n23\nThe\nfollowing equation was derived, using hemoglobin standards, to convert\nabsorbance to hemoglobin concentration:\n\u03bcg/\u03bcL\u2009=\n12\n.\n029\n\u00d7\na\nb\ns\no\nr\nb\na\nn\nc\ne\n\u2212\n0\n.\n0395\nHistology\nAnimals were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital (100\u2009mg/kg, i.p.).\nAfter the heartbeat had terminated, rats received a transcardial perfusion\nwith \u223c300\u2009mL of ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH\n7.3) followed by \u223c400\u2009mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).\nA 1\u2009cm-long segment of the spinal cord, centered at the lesion site,\nwas collected and incubated in 4% PFA for 24\u2009h at 4\u00b0C.\nThe tissue was rinsed with PBS before cryoprotection in a solution of\n30% sucrose in PBS for at least 72\u2009h before being embedded in\nTissue-Tek O.C.T compound for cryosectioning. The tissue was sectioned\ncoronally into 20\u2009\u03bcm-thick sections. Every fifth section was\nmounted on Fisherbrand Superfrost Plus (Fisher Scientific) microscope slides\nfor lesion analysis. All sections were stained with cresyl violet for Nissl\nsubstance and Luxol fast blue for myelin.\n24\nSections were imaged using light\nmicroscopy at 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification and were analyzed by\nblinded observers using ImageJ software. Lesion area and total\ncross-sectional area of the cord were determined as described in the study\nby Grau and colleagues.\n3\nThe lesion size was quantified as a percentage of the total section area\n(% area).\n\nExperimental design\nTwenty-four hours after receiving a moderate spinal cord contusion at\nT10\u2013T11, male Sprague Dawley rats had their locomotor scores evaluated\nusing the BBB locomotor scale, and their baseline (BL) BP measurements taken\nusing a non-invasive BP cuff. Groups were balanced using BL systolic BP and BBB\nscores. Rat were then administered noxious input (i.e., capsaicin or electrical\nstimulation) and/or a drug (i.e, Nor prazosin). BP and locomotor activity were\nthen examined at set time points. After obtaining the last BBB score and/or BP\nmeasurement, rats were euthanized and tissue was collected for hemorrhage\nanalysis.\n\nStatistical analysis\nSPSS and jamovi were used to perform all statistical tests. Significance was set\nat 0.05.\nPost hoc\ncomparisons were conducted using the Duncan\nNew Multiple Range Test. For missing values, an average of the adjacent cells\nwas used to enable statistical analysis. Mediational analyses were performed\nusing the jAMM module within jamovi. Completely standardized effect sizes were\nestimated using the standard (delta) method. Similar results were obtained using\nthe bootstrap (percent) method."

    "Methods": "Animals and unilateral BOP\nMale chinchillas (\nn\n=\u200915) weighing 350\u2013500g (Ryerson Ranch) were used for these experiments. For non-invasive, functional assays, for the intra-animal comparison of pre-BOP versus 1 week post-BOP, 12 animals were included. For non-invasive DTI, for the intra-animal comparison between time points (TPs) (pre-BOP, 1 week post-BOP and 1 month post-BOP), five animals were included. Three control animals were included for histo-morphometric analysis (an inter-animal comparison). All the experiments were performed as per the regulations and guidelines of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University at Buffalo, NY. Chinchillas were unilaterally (ipsilateral \u2013 left side and contralateral \u2013 right side) exposed to a BOP (impulse) with its energy greatest below 10\u2009kHz (see\nFig 1\nThe frequency spectrum of acoustic energy) generated by a custom shock tube (Mark Cauble Precision Inc). As an attempt to mimic the real-world blast exposure, both the ipsilateral and contralateral ears were un-occluded conforming to the standard animal models for blast-induced neurotrauma.\n11\nIn this study, BOP was at \u223c172 dB sound pressure level (SPL) (measured using a B & K Type 4938 microphone) with the pressure chamber at 23 psi with a duration of <2\u2009ms (\nFig. 2\nThe impulse waveform from our setup).

The graph represents the data of DPOAE amplitudes in the ipsilateral (\nA\n) and contralateral (\nB\n) ears at 1 week post-BOP and 1 month post-BOP across various f2 frequencies. *comparison between pre-BOP and 1 month post-BOP; $comparison between pre-BOP and 1 week post-BOP; #comparison between 1 week post-BOP and 1 month post-BOP.

Color image is available online.\n\nAuditory functional assays\nDPOAEs were measured in a sound-attenuating room with insert earphones by playing two tones (at frequencies f1 and f2, f2/f1\u2009=\u20091.2) from 0.5 to 10\u2009kHz into the ear canal of anaesthetized chinchilla. DPOAEs were measured as SPL via an Etym\u014dtic ER- 10B DPOAE probe system at distortion product frequency 2f1\u2013f2. Pre- and 1 week (\nn\n=\u200912) and 1 month (\nn\n=\u20096) post-BOP DPOAE amplitudes were plotted as a function of 2F1\u2013F2 frequencies at iso-intensity of 75 (F2)/65 (F1) dB SPL (\nFig. 2\n). ABR input/output functions were obtained using tone burst frequencies of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8\u2009kHz in random order. Brain electrical activity was amplified 20,000 times (WPI model ISO-80, Sarasota, FL, USA), bandpass filtered from 0.3 to 3\u2009kHz (Krohn-Hite model 3550 filter, Brockton, MA, USA), and digitally sampled (TDT instruments). ABR threshold was estimated using the cross-correlation method at each frequency and confirmed by visual inspection.\n\nMR-DTI\nDTI was acquired on chinchillas (\nn\n=\u20095) with a 200\u2009mm diameter horizontal-bore 9.4 T magnet (Bruker Biospin, Biospec 94/20 USR) and a 440 mT/m (3440 T/m/s) imaging gradient system, which was operated with ParaVision (Bruker Biospin). We employed a cross-coil configuration with a four-channel phased-array receive coil (T10324V3; Bruker Biospin) placed over the head of the anesthetized chinchilla, and an 86\u2009mm transmitter volume coil for excitation. Diffusion-weighted images were acquired using a 2D echo-planar imaging (EPI)-DTI with 30 diffusion directions (b\u2009=\u20091000\u2009s/mm\n2\n) across the full sphere and four unweighted images, echo time 23\u2009ms, repetition time 10\u2009sec with a 0.3\u2009mm gap and a 0.5\u2009mm of slice thickness. A custom, semi-automated DTI processing pipeline was implemented to extract raw diffusion-weighted images and diffusion directions to calculate diffusion tensors in every voxel and convert them into DTI scalar metrics (\nFig. 3\n). Diffusion-weighted images were corrected for eddy-current distortions, and diffusion tensor parameters were calculated on a voxel-by-voxel basis using DSI Studio.\n12\nThe DTI tensor values at CAN ROIs (as outlined in\nFig. 4\n) were analyzed for three TPs: pre-BOP, and 1 week and 1 month after BOP by manually segmenting the ROIs using 3DSlicer. For each TP, a voxelwise\nt\ntest was performed, and the five values (each voxel) from TP1 (pre-blast) are compared with the five values from TP2/TP3. Voxels with\np\n<\u20090.05 were considered significant.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\n(\nA\nand\nB\n) shows the representative unweighted A0 image and major tensor axis direction.

Color image is available online.\n\nHistological measures\nMorphometric quantification of viable/dead neurons was performed in CAN ROIs of chinchillas (\nn\n=\u20093) at the 1-month post-BOP TP. The brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and processed for routine paraffin processing. The sections (10\u2009\u03bcm thick coronal slices of CN, IC and AC) were stained with CFV, H&E, and MT stains (Elsa Anton 1999). The stained sections were observed for morphological changes and photomicrographed under an upright Leica DM6B light microscope (Leica, Germany) at 400\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification. To quantify, the viable and dark stained neurons were observed with CFV stain and the apoptotic cells were identified using MT stain. With CFV (\nFig. 5\n), and H&E (\nFig. 6\n), Nissl-stained dark neurons and the intensely red-stained pyknotic nuclei reflected the cell shrinkage and condensation of both nucleus and cytoplasm.\n13\u201315\nCells that were undergoing apoptosis with apoptotic fragments were detected by differential red stain caused by fuchsin using MT stain (\nFig. 7\n).\n16\nFor cell counting, the differential cell population in the CFV and MT-stained sections were counted manually from the average area (316.82\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u2009237.61\u2009\u03bcm) of the photomicrograph which was considered as the field using \u201cCell counter\u201d plugin in ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health [NIH], USA) in a blinded manner by multiple investigators. For analysis, viable/dark neurons and apoptotic cells were plotted in the ipsilateral and contralateral side for ROIs (CN, IC, and AC) based on features from CFV (rounded neurons/dark stained pyknotic neurons) and MT (dark red stained neurons) stains, respectively.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 5.\nThe images show representative images of the cresyl fast violet (CFV) stained brain sections at the level of the\n(A)\ncochlear nucleus (CN),\n(B)\ninferior colliculus (IC), and\n(C)\nauditory cortex (AC).

    "Methods": "Participants\nTRACK-TBI is an 18-site observational study aimed at improving phenotypic accuracy and outcome precision for patients with TBI. Subjects at participating sites are enrolled within 24\u2009h of injury and followed up to 12 months if they meet the following criteria: documented TBI, computed tomography (CT) scan, and no significant polytrauma that would interfere with follow-up assessment (for full inclusion criteria, see the TRACK-TBI website).\n26\nThe Institutional Review Board of each site approved the study protocol, and all subjects or surrogates provided written informed consent to participate.\nAcute hospitalization data elements, including GCS scores obtained in the field, ED, ICU, and on the hospital ward, were abstracted from medical records by research staff and documented in an electronic database. The GCS scores were available for the first five days of hospitalization and for the entire duration that intracranial pressure was monitored.\nOf the 2552 subjects (\u226517 years old) enrolled in TRACK-TBI from 2014\u20132018, we excluded (1) subjects with no GCS scores (\nn\n=\u200928); (2) subjects for whom all GCS scores were confounded by periorbital swelling, intubation, and/or paralysis (\nn\n=\u200968); and (3) subjects for whom data errors (e.g., GCS date preceded injury date) could not be resolved (\nn\n=\u20091). The final sample included 2455 subjects with at least one unconfounded GCS score (\nSupplementary Fig. S1\n).\nCollectively, these subjects were assessed with the GCS 69,487 times. Periorbital swelling, intubation, and/or paralysis were documented in 30,139 of the 69,487 GCS scores, leaving 39,348 unconfounded GCS scores for the primary analysis. Intubation was the most common confounding factor and was documented in 28,902 GCS scores. To reduce the potential for bias related to interpreting the verbal subscale in intubated patients, we excluded GCS scores confounded by intubation from the primary analysis. In a separate, secondary analysis, we analyzed scores confounded by intubation by imputing the verbal subscale score based on the Rutledge model, Equation 1.\n27\n\nGCS combinations and associated level of consciousness\nWe identified the 120 possible GCS subscale score combinations (4 eye-opening\n\u00d7\n5 verbal\n\u00d7\n6 motor scores) by combining each subscale score with every other possible subscale score. Next, we assigned a diagnosis of coma, VS/UWS, MCS-, MCS+, PTCS, or recovery from PTCS (rPTCS) to each behavior of each GCS subscale. We made these diagnostic determinations\na priori\nbased on: (1) the PTCS case definition,\n25\n(2) published criteria for coma,\n28\n,\n29\nVS/UWS, MCS-, and MCS+,\n19\n,\n20\nand (3) the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R)\n30\ndiagnostic distinctions between VS/UWS, MCS, and PTCS.\nWe started by selecting the highest-level behavior assessed by the GCS, \u201coriented\u201d (verbal\u2009=\u20095), and assigning all GCS combinations with a verbal subscale score of 5 to the rPTCS group. Next, we assigned all GCS scores with the subsequent highest-level behavior assessed by the GCS (i.e., \u201cconfused,\u201d verbal\u2009=\u20094) to the \u201cPTCS\u201d group. We continued along this line of stepwise reasoning by identifying the subsequent highest-level GCS behavior\n31\nand assigning all GCS combinations with that behavior the corresponding DoC diagnostic group (see\nFig. 1\n, Panel B for a flow-diagram illustrating this procedure).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nDecision tree associating individual Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) subscale behaviors with disorder of consciousness (DoC) diagnoses. (\nA\n) The GCS subscales and behaviors, as described on the official GCS website.\n31\n(\nB\n) The flow diagram illustrates our approach to assigning a DoC diagnosis to GCS behaviors. We started by selecting the highest-level behavior on the GCS, \u201coriented\u201d (verbal\u2009=\u20095), and assigning all GCS combinations with a verbal subscale score of 5 to a recovered from post-traumatic confusional state (rPTCS) diagnostic group. Next, we assigned all GCS scores with the subsequent highest-level behavior on the GCS (i.e., \u201cconfused,\u201d verbal\u2009=\u20094) a diagnosis of PTCS. We continued along this stepwise line of reasoning by identifying the subsequent highest-level GCS behavior and assigning the corresponding DoC diagnosis to all GCS combinations with that behavior, until the only behaviors remaining were flexion and extension on the motor scale, reflective of coma. Because the GCS does not include all behaviors associated with DoC diagnoses, this decision tree is not meant to provide a clinical diagnosis. For example, patients with GCS behaviors consistent with vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS) were not assessed for minimally conscious state (MCS) behaviors such as visual pursuit and automatic motor responses, which would have indicated a MCS. The color-coding in the DoC diagnostic categories in (B) aligns with the color-coding of the behaviors in (A). For example, a GCS-based diagnosis of recovered from posttraumatic confusional state (rPTCS) (shaded green in [B]) is obtained by demonstrating orientation (GCS verbal\u2009=\u20095, shaded green in [A]). rPTCS, recovered from PTCS (best GCS subscale score is GCS verbal\u2009=\u20095); PTCS, post-traumatic confusional state (best GCS subscale score is GCS verbal\u2009=\u20094); MCS+, minimally conscious state with evidence of language function (best GCS subscale score is GCS verbal\u2009=\u20093 or GCS motor\u2009=\u20096); MCS-, MCS without evidence of language function GCS (best GCS subscale score is GCS motor\u2009=\u20095); VS/UWS, vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (best GCS subscale score is GCS eye opening >1 or verbal\u2009=\u20092). Color image is available online.\nWe calculated the number of times each GCS subscale score combination was observed in the 39,348 unconfounded GCS scores and, separately, the 28,902 GCS total scores with documented intubation. Because the first GCS score is often used to determine eligibility for clinical trials, we repeated this analysis using each subject's first GCS score, rather than all available GCS scores. Finally, we selected four subjects from the TRACK-TBI dataset to illustrate the challenges that arise when relying on GCS total scores for clinical management or research.\n\nData analysis\nFor each GCS total score, we calculated: (1) the proportion of GCS subscale score combinations that could result in each DoC diagnosis; (2) the proportion of all GCS total scores that are associated with each DoC diagnostic category in the TRACK-TBI dataset; and (3) the proportion of TRACK-TBI subjects whose first valid GCS total score is associated with each DoC diagnostic category. Data summaries and descriptive statistics were compiled in Microsoft Access.

    "Methods": "Participants\nParticipants were identified and enrolled in the prospective TRACK-TBI study in accordance with previously published methods.\n27\u201329\nPatients with TBI or orthopedic injury who presented to 1 of 18 participating level 1 United States trauma centers were enrolled from February 26, 2014, to June 15, 2018, and written consent was obtained from all patients or their legal representatives prior to enrollment. Eligible patients for the TBI group were those who presented to the emergency department (ED) within 24\u2009h of head trauma warranting clinical evaluation with a non-contrast head computed tomography (CT) under American College of Emergency Medicine/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria\n30\nand who demonstrated signs of altered mental status. Patients with TBI were excluded if they had significant polytrauma. Patients with isolated orthopedic trauma were enrolled using the same process as that for patients with TBI. Eligible patients for inclusion were those who presented with isolated trauma to their limbs, pelvis, or ribs, and had an Abbreviated Injury Scale score of <4 for those body regions. Patients were excluded from being OTC if they had clinical findings suggestive of a brain injury such as loss of consciousness, disturbance of consciousness, seizure, post-traumatic amnesia, or retrograde amnesia. Healthy FC were adults who identified as being a family member of a study TBI participant or having been that person's friend for at least 1 year. FCs were excluded if they had a history of TBI, concussion, orthopedic injury, or significant polytrauma in the 12 months before enrollment in the study. Injured patients and FCs were excluded from all three groups if they were prisoners, pregnant, on a psychiatric hold, participating in an interventional trial, non-English or non-Spanish speaking, or had low likelihood of follow-up, major debilitating mental health disorders, neurological diseases, or significant pre-existing conditions that would interfere with follow-up. For the current analysis, we included subjects of all TBI severities, OTC subjects, and FCs with at least 1 QoL outcome.\nThis study received approval from the institutional review board of record at the lead site (University of California, San Francisco) and each participating institution. Reporting adhered to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement.\n\nPrimary outcome measures\nPatients were assessed at 2 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months post-injury with a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment battery comprising measures of QoL, symptoms, cognitive performance, and functional limitations. FCs were assessed four times at intervals comparable to those when injured participants were assessed. Assessments were completed in person at 2 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months, and via phone at 3 months or when otherwise necessary to avoid missing data. The primary outcomes of interest for the current study were the SWLS and the QOLIBRI-OS.\n6\n,\n31\nThe SWLS measures general life satisfaction\n32\n,\n33\nand consists of five questions rated on a seven-point Likert scale, from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7). The scores are summed to produce a total score ranging from 5 to 35. The six-item QOLIBRI-OS is a parallel version of the 37-item QOLIBRI scale, intended to assess QoL in domains of functioning relevant to TBI populations (e.g., cognitive, emotional, and physical function). The QOLIBRI has been validated in large international TBI populations and demonstrates good psychometric properties.\n21\n,\n34\u201339\nQOLIBRI-OS items are rated on a five-point scale from \u201cnot at all satisfied\u201d (1) to \u201cvery satisfied\u201d (5); the total score represents the mean item-level score. The mean item-level scores are then converted to a percentage score (0\u2013100).\n40\nHigher scores on both SWLS and QOLIBRI-OS reflect better satisfaction with/quality of life.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using R version 3.6.2 (\nhttp://www.r-project.org\n). Demographic and baseline characteristics were summarized by group (TBI, OTC, FC). Sample characteristics were compared for each pair of groups using Fisher's exact tests (categorical variables) and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests (continuous variables). The degree of association between primary outcomes (QOLIBRI-OS and SWLS total score) was computed using Pearson's correlation. SWLS and QOLIBRI-OS scores were standardized before entering the models, using their 2-week mean and standard deviation within the FC group, to allow for a common basis when comparing the two instruments. A linear mixed-effects model was conducted with standardized SWLS and QOLIBRI-OS scores at each follow-up as the outcome. The model included a random intercept; independent variables of group, time (treated as categorical), and instrument (SWLS vs. QOLIBRI-OS); all two-way interactions; the three-way interaction of instrument\u2009\u00d7\u2009group\u2009\u00d7\u2009time; and age, gender, and years of education as fixed effects. Model-estimated comparisons were reported with mean (standard error [SE]) for group differences at each time point and change over time for each group comparing SWLS and QOLIBRI-OS.\nP\nvalues for pairwise comparisons were adjusted using Tukey's method."

    "Methods": "Further description of methods can be found inSupplementary Information S1.\n\nAnimals\nWe used 64 male 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice from Jackson Laboratories, fed\nad libitum\napart from touchscreen testing and housed in a reverse dark/light cycle such that all behavioral testing was conducted during the dark cycle to optimize performance. Mice that underwent the Touchscreen behavioral task (total of 24 animals) were food restricted only for the duration of that task. Food was administered and logged every day of the behavioral test. Bodyweights were tracked and kept in a special care notebook in the housing facility. Any mouse that lost 20% of its bodyweight was removed from the study. No mice had to be removed from the study due to weight loss. Water was provided freely to all animals throughout the experiments. All experiments were approved by the Boston Children's Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and complied with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Timeline of experiments is shown in\nFigure 1\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExperiment timeline. Two separate cohorts of animals underwent repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI) or sham injury, behavioral testing, and sacrifice at the times outlined above.\n\nRepetitive mild TBI\nMice were divided into two groups and subsequently randomized to undergo closed-head, repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI) or sham injury. Group 1 (rmTBI,\nn\n=\u200911; sham\nn\n=\u200910) was injured at 8 weeks and Group 2 (rmTBI,\nn\n=\u200913; sham,\nn\n=\u200911) was injured when mice had passed initial touchscreen training as described below, which was between 12-14 weeks of age. Mice underwent rmTBI as previously reported.\n28\u201335\nIn brief, mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane in oxygen for 45\u2009sec until the toe-pinch response was absent. Anesthetized mice were placed on a delicate tissue (Kimwipe, Irving, TX) that was grasped on both sides to create tensions without breaking the Kimwipe before the injury. The head was placed directly under a copper guide tube centered over the bregma. Mice were held by the tail as the impact was delivered to the dorsal skull. A 54\u2009g metal bolt (12.75\u2009mm diameter) was dropped through the guide tube from a 107\u2009cm height, resulting in a rotational acceleration of the head through the Kimwipe. Mice received one injury per day for 5 consecutive days. Sham animals received exposure to the isoflurane only. All animals recovered in room air post-injury and were monitored for signs of distress before being returned to their cage. Loss of consciousness was recorded for each animal as the time from removal of anesthesia until they righted themselves.\n\nClassic behavioral tests: Group 1\nLocomotor activity and elevated plus maze (EPM) was measured at 4 weeks, 16 weeks, and 28 weeks post-injury. Prior research has demonstrated behavioral deficits from this injury model at these specific time-points and extending up to a year after injury.\n28\n,\n30\n,\n34\nLocomotor boxes tracked total movement (rmTBI and sham,\nn\n=\u20098) and was run to establish exploratory behavior within sham and rmTBI mice, as lack of exploratory behavior would confound elevated plus maze results. The elevated plus maze is an established metric for impulsive behavior, with interventions that increase impulsivity leading to more time spent in the open arms and decision zone, and less time in the closed arms of the maze. Percent time in closed arms, open arms, and decision zone was calculated.\nThe rotarod is an established behavioral test for assessing gross locomotor and vestibular function that is known to be disrupted following TBI, with injured animals demonstrating decreased latency to fall.\n34\u201337\nRotarod consisted of a habituation day and 2 testing days of four trials per day averaged for one result per day. Latency to fall was recorded.\nGroup 1 performed the MWM at 28 weeks post-injury (rmTBI and sham\nn\n=\u20098). We chose not to repeat the MWM at different time-points using the same mice in order to avoid pre-training prior to the final evaluation. A white, opaque, circular tub (60\u2009cm depth\u2009\u00d7\u200983\u2009cm diameter) was filled with water to a depth of 29\u2009cm at approximately 25\u00b0C. Four visible, distinct shapes were placed in each of the four quadrant inner walls of the tub to distinguish the quadrants. A white platform (10\u2009cm diameter) was placed in one quadrant, 1\u2009cm below the water. Two hidden sub-trials per day were run with the platform just out of sight on Days 1-4 of MWM testing for a total of eight sub-trials. Mice were started from a randomly generated quadrant for each sub-trial and sub-trials were spaced at minimum 20\u2009min apart. The two sub-trials of each day were averaged together and the average was reported, with a possible maximum of 90\u2009sec. Two probe trials were run where the platform was removed and mice were allowed 60\u2009sec within the pool, probe 1 on Day 4 following the hidden trials and probe 2 on Day 5 prior to the visible trials. Software (Noldus Ethovision 11.5) was used to track the path of each mouse. A peri-platform area was drawn around the platform during probe trials set to 20% of the total area of the maze. This was done because the platform is close to the center of the pool and thus traditional quadrants would hemi-sect the area searched by a mouse that remembered the platform location.\n38\nVisible trials were run on the last day and involved placement of a prominent red and white circular reflector, 8.26\u2009cm in diameter, on the platform above the water level, highlighting the location of the platform. Latency to the platform was timed and Ethovision was used to track the total distance traveled to the platform.\n\nOptomotor visual acuity task: Group 1\nThe optomotor visual acuity task (OPT) allows rapid testing of sub-cortical visual acuity and was used to assess behavioral threshold visual acuity in Group 1 at 28 weeks post injury (PI) (CerebralMechanics Inc.).\n36\nVertical sine wave gratings were projected around a testing arena (OptoMotry; CerebralMechanics). If the mouse's head tracked the cylinder rotation it was judged that the animal could see the grating. The OPT value is reported as the highest spatial frequency which elicited head tracking of the waves. Higher values correspond to tighter gratings, indicating better visual acuity. Experimenters were blinded to the injury status.\n\nElectroretinogram (ERG) with visual evoked potential (VEP) test: Group 1\nPhysiological measurements from ERG and paired VEP were used to assess the activity of retinal neurons and cortical response to a visual stimulus, respectively, in a subset of animals from Group 1 (seven rmTBI, six sham) at 28 weeks post-injury. At the time of testing, mice were anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine mixture and placed on the instrument's monitored heating pad for the duration of the procedure, as is standard practice to ensure stability of electrodes during monitoring.\n22-24\n,\n39-41\nThe eyes were moistened with eye lubricant and for the ERG, a LED light stimulator/electrode was placed against the cornea of the eye. For the VEP, a set of electrodes were placed subcutaneously, one under the scalp in correspondence of the occipital region (V1) of the brain, one in the snout as a reference, and the third placed at the base of the tail to serve as the ground electrode. A protocol of three different tests were run; a dark-adapted protocol that elicited and measured an a-wave, b-wave, oscillatory potentials (OPs), and VEP with stimulus of 1 cd sec/m\n2\n, a dark-adapted protocol that elicited an a-wave, b-wave, and c-wave stimulus of 150 cd sec/m\n2\n, and a light-adapted white stimulus of 20 cd sec/m\n2\non top of 40 cd sec/m\n2\nof green background to elicit an a-wave, b-wave, and photopic negative response (PhNR;\nTable 1\n).\nTable 1.\nERG Components and VEP and their Respective Cell Populations\nTest\nMeasured output\nCell populations/pathways\nPotential causes of measured disruption (if applicable)\nERG\na-wave (amplitude, latency)\nPhotoreceptors (rods, cones)\nDamage to rods/cones; phototoxicity\n58\nb-wave (amplitude, latency)\nMuller cells\nON-Bipolar cells\nIschemia\nIntracellular signaling within retina\n41\n,\n49\u201353\nc-wave (amplitude, latency)\nPigmented epithelium function\nRetinal glial cells\nRetinal inflammation, oxidative stress\n54\n,\n55\nOscillatory potentials (1, 2, 3)\nAmacrine cells\nGlutamate toxicity\n56\n,\n57\nPhotopic negative response (PhNR)\nRetinal ganglion cells\nOptic nerve atrophy, lens damage\n21\n,\n26\n,\n27\n,\n46-48\nVEP\nCalculated as N1-P2\nEntire visual pathway from retina to visual cortex\nImpaired signal transmission distal to retina\n21\u201325\n,\n42\n,\n43\nOpen in a separate window\nMeasured outputs from the ERG and paired VEP with contributing cell populations and known causes of alterations. VEP recorded from the occipital region of the brain corresponding to V1 allowed us to determine whether visual inputs were able to travel from the retina to the lateral geniculate, arrive to V1, and elicit neuronal activity intracortically. Disruptions anywhere along this pathway would lead to a decreased recorded VEP signal.\nERG, electroretinogram; VEP, visual-evoked potential; ON, optic nerve.\n\nBehavioral tests: Group 2\nGroup 2 underwent an iteration of the MWM consisting only of visible trials, where the platform was marked with the large red circular reflector, 3.4\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u20093.4\u2009cm protruding 4\u2009cm above the platform, for each of the trials. There were two sub-trials per trial over 4 days for a total of eight sub-trials and four trials. Trials were run in the manner described above. Latency to the platform was timed. (rmTBI,\nn\n=\u200913; sham,\nn\n=\u200911).\nThe forced swim test (FST) was used to test ability and motivation to swim 16-weeks post-injury in Group 2 (rmTBI,\nn\n=\u20095; sham,\nn\n=\u20094) as the final behavioral task. Total distance, speed, time mobile, and time immobile were recoded for each time bin. The immobility was determined as lack of detectable movement.\n\nTouchscreen conditional learning task\nThe Bussey-Saksida touchscreen system (Lafayette Instrument, Lafayette, IN) was used to conduct the touchscreen task which evaluated learning and memory before and after rmTBI in Group 2. The test consisted of a learning period and then a testing window. Mice were food restricted throughout this task.\nThe system consists of a chamber with a screen containing two target touchspots and a reward delivery system. A light was illuminated on the screen and the mouse was rewarded if the correct touchspot was chosen within the allotted time. Failure to touch any point on the screen within the allotted time was defined as an omitted trial. The system recorded the number of correct, incorrect, and omitted trials.\nThe pre-injury training phase began when Group 2 mice were 8 weeks of age, and consisted of gradually decreasing allotments of time (response window [RW], 30, 10, 4, and 2\u2009sec) for which the mouse was shown the light stimulus and was required to select the correct touchspot. Mice had to respond correctly 80% of the 60-trial session for 2 consecutive days to progress to the next phase. After achieving this on the 2-sec training phase, the variable window task, comprised of 60 runs per day for 4 consecutive days, with RW randomly alternating between 2\u2009sec, 1\u2009sec, 0.5\u2009sec, and 0.2\u2009sec, was run. The number of correct, incorrect, and omitted responses was recorded for each trial.\nAfter injury or sham injury, mice entered into post-injury training, identical to the pre-injury training. Mice unable to achieve the 80% needed to progress past each training phase after 10 days (600 trials) were labeled as \u201cFailed.\u201d Mice were again given the variable window task after either failing or completing the 2-sec phase.\n\nEuthanasia and optic nerve collection\nAll mice in the study were euthanized via cardiac perfusion. Both brain and optic nerve were removed. Additional mice underwent the same injury paradigm and optic nerves were harvested for total Sham\nn\n=\u200920, rmTBI\u2009=\u200920. Optic nerves were examined under a microscope following 24 hours in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Diameters from proximal and distal optic nerves from both eyes were measured and averaged for each mouse.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analysis was performed using STATA. Differences between two groups were analyzed using unpaired two-tailed\nt\n-tests. Differences between more than two groups were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni correction. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) significance was explored with\npost hoc\none-way ANOVA. Simple regression was used when correlating variables. Statistical sentences are reported as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD; behavioral data are graphed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean. A value of\np\n<\u20090.05 after Bonferroni correction was used to determine significance."

The welfare and privacy of human subjects were protected. Participants voluntarily provided verbal and written informed consent prior to study activities.\n\nParticipants\nData were collected as part of the Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium (CENC) Study.\n34\nEligibility criteria were at least one combat deployment in support of the wars in Iraq and/or Afghanistan, combat exposure, English speaking, 18 years of age or older, and able to provide informed consent. Exclusion criteria were as follows: history of moderate or severe TBI; TBI history outside of deployment involving loss of consciousness; neurological disorder; severe mental illness (e.g., schizophrenia or bipolar disorder); current substance use disorder; current psychotic symptoms; or contraindication for neuroimaging. Following the screening visit, participants were also excluded if they failed symptom validity testing (Structured Inventory of Malingered Symptoms)\n47\nor performance validity testing (Medical Symptom Validity Test\n48\n; b test\n49\n). MEG data for 16 participants were reported previously.\n25\nOf the 201 participants who completed neuroimaging, usable data for both MEG and MRI were acquired for 181 (did not provide MRI,\nn\n=\u20096; did not provide MEG,\nn\n=\u20097; data quality issues such as excessive motion, artifacts,\nn\n=\u20097). The final sample size for analyses was\nN\n=\u2009181.\n\nMeasures\nThe Clinician Administered PTSD Scale 5\n50\ndetermined presence or absence of lifetime and current PTSD. The Mid-Atlantic Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center Assessment of Traumatic Brain Injury\n51\nidentified history of deployment-acquired TBI, as well as further characterizing injuries as blast-related or not. The Salisbury Blast Interview\n9\ncharacterized blast events across the lifespan. Because no widely accepted definition of blast exposure exists, the frequency (number of blasts involving a pressure gradient) and severity (highest pressure gradient reported) of blast events were utilized for analyses. The Test of Premorbid Function\n52\nestimated demographically-adjusted pre-morbid intelligence quotient (IQ). Patient characteristics and demographics were obtained using a structured interview.\n\nMagnetoencephalography recordings\nData were acquired using a whole\u2013head CTF Systems Inc. MEG 2005 neuromagnetometer system equipped with 275 first-order axial gradiometer coils. Head localization was achieved using a conventional three-point fiducial system. Resting-state recording was conducted with the participant seated upright, sitting quietly, with eyes open for 5\u2009min. Data were sampled at 1200\u2009Hz over a DC-300\u2009Hz bandwidth and pre-processed using synthetic third order gradient balancing, whole\u2013trial DC offsetting, and band pass filtering from DC-80\u2009Hz with a 60\u2009Hz notch filter. Data were visually inspected for obvious muscle artifact, and such epochs were discarded from further analyses. Following MEG recording, a T1 weighted MRI scan was obtained for each participant for co-registration and source localization.\n\nConnectomes\nData processing has been described previously.\n24\n,\n25\nAs illustrated in\nFigure 1\n, connectomes were created by identifying areas of brain activity, then quantifying communication among those areas. Graph theory was applied to resulting adjacency matrices producing metrics describing characteristics of the functional connectome.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nData processing. Data acquisition\n(A)\nis followed by source reconstruction\n(B).\nNext, functional connectivity is calculated among source series\n(C)\nresulting in weighted adjacency matrices\n(D).\nFollowing thresholding, adjacency matrices represent individual connectomes\n(E)\nfor which network metrics describing the function and topology can be calculated. Color image is available online.\nNode identification\nNodes (areas of significant brain activity) were identified by applying a well-validated beamformer, synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM\n53\n,\n54\n; voxel size of 5\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009mm, lead fields for equivalent current dipoles, maximizing noise-normalized power) using a three-spherical shell, multiple local spheres head model\n55\nbased on each participant's MRI in the following frequency ranges: delta (1-4\u2009Hz), theta (4-8\u2009Hz), alpha (8-13\u2009Hz), beta (13-30\u2009Hz), gamma (30-80\u2009Hz), and 1-80\u2009Hz. Nodes were combined across frequency ranges to create a single connectome for each participant. Using signal power (SAM) to identify nodes and then estimating connectivity utilizing a phase-based metric helps avoid issues of circularity in analyses.\nEstimating functional connectivity between nodes\nSource-series were calculated for each node representing the unique weighted sum of the output across all MEG sensors for a specific location in the brain across the 5-min scan.\n53\n,\n54\nThe weighted phase lag index (wPLI)\n16\nwas calculated between all pairs of source-series from 1-80\u2009Hz. A surrogate distribution of connectivity data was created for each participant using 5000 pairs of phase-randomized source-series calculated from that participant's data.\n56\nFor each node pair, connectivity was operationalized at the frequency with the greatest difference (using standard deviations [SDs]) in wPLI between the real and surrogate data. To ensure connectivity exceeded that expected in noise, node pairs with real-surrogate connection differences <2.5 SD were labeled as unconnected. The resulting connectomes were then binarized and thresholded to achieve appropriate levels of sparsity by satisfying the equation S\u2009=\u2009log(N)/log(K), where N represents the number of nodes in the network and K the average degree using S\u2009=\u20092.5.\n57\nMetrics\nClustering Coefficient\n58\nindicates how likely the neighbors of a node are to also be connected with one another.\nGlobal Efficiency\nindicates the efficiency of information transfer within the connectome.\nModularity\n59\nindicates how many cohesive subnetworks can be identified within the larger network. Following the recommendations of the Brain Connectivity Toolbox,\n60\nthe analysis was conducted 500 times, using the average Q\n(Modularity)\nand average number of modules\n(Number Modules)\nas outcome variables.\nK-core Degree\nand\nK-core Nodes\nwere calculated at the maximum\nK-core Value\n61\nof the network. The Rich Club is a subset of highly connected and interconnected nodes forming the basis of the broader network. Rich Club metrics were calculated\n62\nusing 500 independently generated random networks. The number of nodes\n(Rich Club Nodes)\nwithin the Rich Club, the minimum degree of those nodes\n(Rich Club Degree),\nand interconnectivity among those nodes\n(Rich Club Coefficient)\nwere used as outcome variables. The number of connections falling within canonical frequency bands was calculated\n(Delta Connections, Theta Connections, Alpha Connections, Beta Connections, Gamma Connections).\nOther metrics included the average strength of connections within the network\n(Connection Strength),\naverage frequency at which connections occur\n(Average Frequency),\nmode frequency at which connections occur\n(Mode Frequency),\nnumber of nodes within the network\n(Nodes),\nand the minimum threshold level across connections\n(Minimum Threshold).\nConnectome metrics have been shown to have test\u2013retest reliability in the good to excellent range depending on variables such as the inter-scan interval, the duration of scan, the functional connectivity metric, and the frequency band examined.\n63\u201366\n\nMaterials\nBeamforming and source series construction were completed using software provided by CTF MEG International Services LP (Coquitlam, BC, Canada). Further analyses of source series data were conducted using Matlab 2016a (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA). Metrics were calculated using the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010). Statistical analyses were conducted in SAS Enterprise Guide version 7.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).\n\nStatistical analysis\nLinear regression evaluated the associations between PTSD, deployment-acquired mild TBI, blast frequency and pressure, and connectome topology. Correlations among connectome metrics, demographic characteristics, and other potential variables of interest were examined to identify appropriate covariates. Age, sex, minority status, and time since the most recent deployment-acquired mild TBI were identified as relevant covariates. Time since most recent deployment-acquired mild TBI was imputed with the time since most recent deployment for individuals without a history of deployment-acquired mild TBI (\nn\n=\u2009107). Results using this variable were drastically different than using time since most recent deployment for all participants. Prior work has demonstrated that the number of nodes within a network can influence metrics describing the topology.\n67\nTo address this issue the current analysis included the number of nodes within each connectome as a covariate (except for the model predicting the number of nodes).\nCategorical variables indicating the presence or absence of current PTSD, blast-related deployment-acquired mild TBI, non-blast-related deployment-acquired mild TBI, and the interaction between PTSD and the mild TBI variables were included in the models after covariates (\nTable 3\n). To further explore the role of blast two additional models were evaluated (\nTables 4\nand\n\u200b\nand5).\n5\n). Both models included categorical variables indicating the presence or absence of current PTSD and deployment-acquired mild TBI as well as their interaction in addition to covariates. The first model included the frequency of blasts during which a pressure gradient was experienced and the second included the maximum pressure gradient reported across all blast events. The interaction between deployment-acquired mild TBI and each respective blast variable was also included. An alternate model classified participants as current PTSD, lifetime PTSD (no longer meeting diagnostic criteria), and never diagnosed. Two indicator variables described the presence or absence of current and lifetime PTSD. False discovery rate\n68\nwas applied at the model level (number of tests\u2009=\u200920) to correct for multiple comparisons.\nTable 3.\nParameter Estimates for Connectome Metrics Significantly Predicted by the Model including Blast and Non-Blast Deployment TBI\nPTSD\nBlast deployment TBI\nPTSD- blast TBI interaction\nNon-blast deployment TBI\nPTSD- non-blast TBI interaction\nTime since injury (days)\nNodes\n9.52\n*\n-0.56\n-12.47\n*\n-6.68\n-18.03\n*\n0.002\n*\nAverage degree\n-0.02\n-0.02\n0.054\n*\n-0.02\n-0.04\n0.000\nConnection Strength\n-0.01\n-0.028\n*\n0.048\n*\n0.01\n-0.02\n0.000\nMinimum Threshold\n-0.15\n-0.25\n*\n0.42\n-0.06\n-0.04\n0.000\nK-Core Degree\n-0.19\n-0.59\n0.77\n-0.54\n0.44\n0.0002\n*\nK-Core Nodes\n-1.54\n1.55\n-3.72\n5.53\n-4.04\n-0.0014\n*\nAlpha Connections\n60.69\n-41.31\n-36.33\n34.85\n-128.50\n-0.035\n*\nGamma Connections\n-95.84\n-8.25\n54.53\n3.03\n104.12\n0.034\n*\nOpen in a separate window\nN\n=\u2009181.\n*\nParameter estimate significant at p\u2009<\u20090.05.\nParameter estimates are not standardized.

    "Methods": "Animals\nMice were maintained in a 12-h light-12-h dark cycle with food and water\nad libitum\n. Wild-type C57BL/6J and transgenic Thy1:CFP mice (\nB6.Cg-Tg(Thy1-CFP)23Jrs/J\n), expressing cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) under the Thy1 promoter,\n27\nwere bred in our animal facilities from stock obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine). Thy1:CFP mice were bred as heterozygotes, and offspring were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction. Thy1:CFP mice were used in experiments where retinal ganglion cells were counted.\nAll experiments using animals were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and under approval of Emory University's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Ketamine/xylazine (87\u2009mg/kg/13\u2009mg/kg) solution was administered\nip\nto anesthetize the mice during experimental procedures, where indicated. Mice were euthanized by overdose of ketamine/xylazine or by asphyxiation with carbon dioxide.\n\nBlast injury procedure\nOcular blast injury was induced as described,\n28\n,\n29\nusing an air gun. The mouse eye was positioned behind a 5\u2009mm hole in a clear polyvinyl chloride pipe (3\u2009mm thickness), and the head was supported with padding. The output pressure of the air gun was calibrated to approximately 48 psi using a Honeywell Sensotec sensor Model STJE (0\u2013100 psi) with the probe inserted into the mouse holding pipe directly against the hole, which was positioned directly against the barrel opening of the air gun. The pressure 6\u2009mm from the barrel opening, the approximate position of the mouse eye during the blast procedure,\n29\nwas 20 psi.\nBlast was delivered to the right eye of anesthetized mice. At the calibrated output pressure of \u223c48 psi, there were no instances of ocular rupture. After the blast procedure, the mice were kept on a heating pad until recovered from anesthesia. Mice received an oral analgesic (acetaminophen; 32\u2009mg/mL) before blast exposure and for the next two days. Mice were returned to their cages after they were awake. Sham-treated mice were treated identically, but not exposed to the blast.\n\nHIOC preparation\nThe HIOC was synthesized as described previously\n30\nand stored at -20\u00b0C under argon. Stock solutions were prepared in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted with sterile H\n2\nO; the final DMSO concentration was 10%. The HIOC and vehicle control solutions were administered by\nip\ninjection.\n\nOptomotor response (OMR) testing\nContrast and spatial frequency thresholds were determined as measures of contrast sensitivity and visual acuity (OptoMotry: CerebralMechanics. Inc., Lethbridge, Alberta. Canada).\n31\n,\n32\nBriefly, the mouse was placed on a central elevated platform in the OptoMotry chamber surrounded by four monitors that project a virtual rotating cylinder with sinusoidal gratings of vertical light and dark bars. An infrared camera located on the top of the chamber tracks the behavior of the mouse, which reflexively follows the moving gratings by turning its head.\nWe examined contrast thresholds at multiple spatial frequencies in sham and blast mice (\nFig. 1\n); in most experiments, they were measured at a spatial frequency of 0.064 cycles/degree (c/d), the peak of contrast sensitivity,\n32\nand the spatial frequency where blast had its largest effect (\nFig. 1\n). Contrast sensitivity data are expressed as the inverse of the contrast thresholds. Contrast sensitivity is regulated in a circadian manner\n33\n,\n34\n; therefore, all measurements were made in the middle of the day, 4\u20138\u2009h after light onset.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nEffect of ocular blast injury on contrast sensitivity functions. Contrast sensitivity functions were measured in sham mice and mice exposed to blast in the right eye by measuring the optomotor respose, as descried in Methods. Measurements in all animals began eight days after blast injury and were completed by 14 days after blast.\nn\n=\u20098/group. Blast significantly reduced contrast sensitivity at spatial frequencies of 0.064, 0.092, and 0.103 cycles/degree (c/d) (**p\u2009<\u20090.01).\n\nElectroretinography\nDark-adapted ERG recordings were obtained from anesthitized mice as described previously.\n35\nBriefly, mice were dark-adapted overnight. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (70/10\u2009mg/kg). Topical 0.5% proparacaine HCL eye drops were applied, pupils were dilated with 1% tropicamide ophthalmic solution, and carboxymethylcellulose sodium eye drops were applied to keep the cornea moist. Body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C with a heating pad. Reference and ground electrodes were place in the cheek and tail. Dawson-Trick-Litzow (DTL) fiber recording electrodes were placed on the cornea.\nStimulus flashes were presented in a UTAS Big Shot Ganzfeld (LKC Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). The flash duration was 20\u2009\u03bcsec, and stimuli were presented in order of increasing intensity. As flash intensity increased, the interstimulus interval was progressively increased to maintain dark-adaptation.\n\nRetinal histology\nAfter mice were euthanized, superior was marked on the cornea using a cautery tool. Whole eyes were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M cacodylate buffer for five days at 4\u00b0C, then washed twice with 0.1M cacodylate buffer. Cornea, lens, and iris were removed by dissection leaving a cornea flap on the superior side for orientation. The remaining posterior eye cups were stained with osmium tetroxide and embedded in plastic resin. They were sectioned at a thickness of 1\u2009\u03bcm and stained with toluidine blue. Photomicrographs were generated in an area of superior retina centered at 800\u2009\u03bcm above the optic nerve.\n\nConfocal microscopy\nRetinal flat mounts were imaged using a Nikon Eclipse C1 inverted confocal imaging system (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) to count putative RGCs in the Thy1-CFP reporter line. Samples were coded, and the microscopist was masked to the treatment.\n\nSpectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT):\nMice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine. The SD-OCT imaging was performed on retinas of both eyes of mice using Phoenix Micron IV spectral-domain ophthalmic imaging system (Phoenix Research Labs, Pleasanton, CA). Proparacaine hydrochloride (0.5%) and topical tropicamide (1%; Akorn Inc.; Lake Forest, IL) were used to anesthetize the cornea and dilate the pupils, respectively. Corneal desiccation was prevented by applying topical GenTeal Lubricant Eye Gel (Novartis, East Hanover, NJ) during the procedure.\nMice were secured and scanned with the use of the animal imaging mount and rodent alignment stage. Fundus images were obtained with the StreamPix software. The SD-OCT images were taken with Micron OCT, restricted to retinal regions corresponding to a circle with a diameter of 0.57\u2009mm centered on the optic nerve head (ONH) and full line scan of 1.8\u2009mm. Retinal layer measurements were performed on the average of 50 scans of each retina using Adobe Photoshop CS6.\n\nStatistics\nData are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean, and were analyzed by Student\nt\ntest for two groups and by one, two, or three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with a\npost hoc\nmultiple comparison test (Student-Newman-Keuls or Holm-Sidak) where appropriate. All the statistical analyses were performed using SigmaPlot (Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA)."

All gave written informed consent. The local ethics committee approved the study (EKV-2017-055). Compression-affected participants were recruited by the University Hospital database. All participants underwent a clinical 1.5T MR scan (Philips-Achieva; Philips, Best, The Netherlands; Supplementary Materials S1.1.1) and the results were specialist screened for signs of CSC compression (Supplementary Materials S1.1.2)\n2\nand myelopathy.\nSubjects without compression, cervical cord intensity changes on T\n1\n- and T\n2\n-weighted images, or any neurological symptoms or other illnesses were classified as HCs. Healthy persons were recruited to frequency match the age and sex of participants with compression. Expert neurological examination focused on clinical symptoms and signs of symptomatic myelopathy (Supplementary Materials S1.2). Participants with CSC compression were classified as non-myelopathic (NMDC) or exhibiting at least one clinical symptom and/or sign of myelopathy corresponding with a clinical diagnosis of DCM (\nSupplementary Table S1\n). Degree of disability and functional impairment was scored on the modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) scale (3\u201318 points).\n19\nFurther, to detect functional abnormalities, electrophysiological measurements (\nSupplementary Materials S1.3\n) were taken of all participants with compression.

Metabolite spectra were summed in blocks of 8 (32\u2009\u00d7\u20098 per subject), corrected for frequency and phase drifts and the residual effects of eddy currents, and summed to obtain spectrum for single-subject analysis. MR spectra from each subject were pooled and summed to obtain one group-averaged spectrum with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for each of the cohorts. Spectral SNR and linewidths were provided by LCmodel based on metabolite spectra analysis.\nSingle-subject and group-averaged spectra were analyzed in LCmodel v6.3-0G\n29\nutilizing a basis set, which included a measured spectrum of macromolecules (Mac)\n30\nand simulated spectra of 18 metabolites.\n31\nMetabolites were quantified as ratios to tNAA.

Spearman's correlations assessed relationships between selected continuous variables.\nGeneral linear models corrected for the effects of age and height, with\npost hoc\ntests, were used for between-group comparison of single-subject metabolite ratios and CSC volumes. The Bonferroni correction was applied to correct type 1 errors in\npost hoc\ngroup comparisons. Uncertainty intervals of metabolite ratios obtained from the quantification of group-averaged MR spectra were propagated from the CRLB of each metabolite as fractional uncertainties.

    "Methods": "The VA Portland Healthcare System institutional review board approved this study (IRB #3988) and participants were provided written informed consent prior to participation. Participants (n=\u2009214) were enrolled between June 2018 and February 2020 from flyers placed on site at the VA, via clinical referral from the VA Sleep Disorders Clinic (M.M.L.), an outpatient clinic population with high rates of TBI, or via word of mouth. Participants were excluded (n=\u200914) if they were not Veterans, or if they had eye disease (absence of eye disease is necessary to undergo photosensitivity testing, which is not discussed here). The remaining 200 participants were included in the current analyses.\n\nTBI evaluation and diagnostic groups\nThree TBI evaluative methods were performed. (1) Self-report; a single yes/no question asking, \u201cHave you ever had a concussion or traumatic brain injury?\u201d (2) Electronic medical record review (EMR) searching the terms:\nTBI\n,\nhead injury\n,\nbrain injury\n,\nhead trauma\n,\nbrain trauma\n,\nconcussion\n,\nconcussive\n,\namnesia\n,\nloss of consciousness\n, and\nblast\n. Participants were determined to have had a TBI if at least one EMR note with those keywords described a TBI. They were considered negative for TBI if there was a documented instance when TBI assessment was performed and the result was negative, or if there was no evidence of TBI assessment. (3) A structured clinical interview, using the Head Trauma Events Characteristics (HTEC) form, conducted in person or over the phone.\n23\nThe HTEC follows a similar format to that of other structured clinical interviews (e.g., Ohio State University \u2013 OSU TBI ID\n24\n), which begins with a standard screening question followed by branching logic questions addressing injury type, location, intracranial injury/skull fracture, duration of loss of consciousness (LOC), and anterograde or retrograde post-traumatic amnesia (PTA). A diagnosis of no, mild, moderate, or severe TBI was made by a licensed neuropsychologist (M.L.C.).\nParticipants were grouped according to the outcomes of these three methods. If outcomes were negative across all three measures, participants were determined to be negative for TBI (no TBI). If they were positive for TBI in any one measure, they were determined to have had a history of TBI based on that evaluative method. To consider overlap in positivity across measures, participants were categorized based on the number of positive measures: positive in any one diagnostic method (TBI-1dx), positive in any two methods (TBI-2dx), or positive in all three methods (TBI-3dx).\n\nMedical and military history\nMedical and military/service histories were obtained via self-report. Medical history included cancer, cardiovascular health, autonomic management, pain syndromes, trauma history, cognitive complaints, and current medication usage for sleep, pain, or depression. Service history included duration of service, exposure to combat, percent service connection (i.e., disability related to military service), branch of service, and total number of deployments. Specific information pertaining to TBI (recency/age, number, type, location, and estimated LOC/PTA) was collected using the HTEC.\n\nSelf-report questionnaires\nPost-concussive symptom severity\nThe Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI) (22 items; range\u2009=\u20090\u201388) was used to assess post-concussive symptoms over the prior 2 weeks.\n25\u201327\nThe Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist for the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition\n(DSM-5) (PCL-5) (20 items; range\u2009=\u20090\u201380) was used to assess PTSD symptom severity over the prior 30 days.\n28\nThe Visual Light Sensitivity Questionnaire (VSLQ) (7 items; range\u2009=\u20091\u201333) was used to assess photosensitivity, a common post-concussive symptom.\n29\nCurrent and chronic pain\nThe Defense Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS) (5 items; range\u2009=\u20090\u201350) evaluated the biopsychosocial impact of pain over the prior 24\u2009h, and the Symptom Impact Questionnaire-Revised (SIQR) (21 items; range\u2009=\u20090\u2013100) addressed the impact of current pain over the previous 7 days on activities of daily living. The Michigan Body Map was used identify the presence of pain over 35 different locations persisting for >3 months (score\u2009=\u2009number of locations).\nSleep quality\nThe Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (7 items; range\u2009=\u20090\u201328) was used to assess difficulty initiating/maintaining sleep,\n30\n,\n31\nand the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire-10 (FOSQ-10) (10 items; range\u2009=\u20095\u201320) to assess impact of sleep disturbances on daily life.\n32\nQuality of life\nOutcomes included (1) the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHO-DAS 2.0) (12 items; range\u2009=\u20090\u2013100%), (2) the Neuro-QoL Satisfaction and Participation scales (each 8 items; range\u2009=\u20098\u201340), and (3) the National Institutes of Health Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (NIH PROMIS) Cognitive Function short-form 4a (4 items; range\u2009=\u20094\u201320). The WHO-DAS 2.0 assesses general health and disability in major life domains over the past 30 days. The Neuro-QoL Satisfaction and Participation questionnaires target their respective areas of quality of life. The NIH PROMIS Cognitive Function survey assesses self-perceived thinking and memory problems.\nSymptom burden\nScores for each questionnaire were normalized to a 0\u2013100% scale (based on the total possible score) and if necessary, the directionality corrected such that higher percentages indicate worse outcomes, described here as \u201csymptom burden.\u201d The symptom burden was averaged for each domain: (1) post-concussive symptom severity, (2) current and chronic pain, (3) sleep quality, and (4) quality of life, and these four values were averaged for an overall weighted symptom burden.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAnalyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 8.4.3 and R version 3.3.2. Significance was defined\na priori\nas\np\n<\u20090.05. Data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation, or as a percent of the total sample size, unless otherwise noted. Numerical data were assessed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's post-hoc test or with unpaired\nt\ntest. Categorical data were assessed using a \u03c7\n2\ntest with Bonferroni post-hoc test (\nTables 1\u20135\nand\nFig. 2\n). Numerical data in\nFigure 3\nwere analyzed via an unpaired Student's\nt\ntest (e.g., self-report positive vs. self-report negative), and across evaluative methods (e.g., self-report positive, EMR positive, HTEC positive) via Cohen's\nd\nwith 95% confidence intervals. Differences in effect sizes across evaluative methods were based on non-overlapping confidence intervals.\nTable 1.\nDemographic Information across all Participants and TBI Diagnostic Groups\nWhole group\nn\n=\u2009200\nNo TBI\nn\n=\u200943 (21%)\nTBI-1dx\nn\n=\u200953 (26%)\nTBI-2dx\nn\n=\u200945 (22%)\nTBI-3dx\nn\n=\u200959 (29%)\nGender\nMale\n164 (82.0%)\n35 (81.4%)\n43 (81.1%)\n39 (86.7%)\n47 (79.7%)\nFemale\n35 (17.5%)\n8 (18.6%)\n10 (18.9%)\n6 (13.3%)\n11 (18.6%)\nNon-binary\n1 (0.5%)\n0\n0\n0\n1 (1.7%)\nAge, years\n54.9\u2009\u00b1\u200914.5\n57.7\u2009\u00b1\u200917.8\n55.3\u2009\u00b1\u200913.1\n55.2\u2009\u00b1\u200912.5\n52.4\u2009\u00b1\u200913.7\nRace\nAmerican Indian/Alaska Native\n6 (3.0%)\n1 (2.3%)\n2 (3.8%)\n1 (2.2%)\n2 (3.4%)\nAsian\n5 (2.5%)\n1 (2.3%)\n2 (3.8%)\n0\n2 (3.4%)\nBlack or African American\n9 (4.5%)\n0\n3 (5.7%)\n3 (6.7%)\n3 (5.1%)\nWhite\n159 (79.5%)\n36 (83.7%)\n39 (73.6%)\n37 (82.2%)\n47 (79.7%)\nMixed\n16 (8.0%)\n4 (9.3%)\n5 (9.4%)\n3 (6.7%)\n4 (6.8%)\nOther/Not Reported\n5 (2.5%)\n1 (2.3%)\n2 (3.7%)\n1 (2.2%)\n1 (1.7%)\nEducation, \u2265some college\n174 (87.0%)\n36 (83.7%)\n46 (86.8%)\n41 (91.1%)\n51 (86.4%)\nExercise, \u226590\u2009min/week\n63 (31.5%)\n9 (20.1%)\n19 (35.8%)\n16 (35.5%)\n19 (32.2%)\nOpen in a separate window\nData are presented as\nn\n(% total) or mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation.

    "Methods": "Animals\nThe APP/PS1 Tg mice (Tg[APPswe,PSEN1dE9]85Dbo; Stock No. 34829-JAX) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory on a C57BL/6;C3H genetic background. All studies involving animals were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research/Naval Medical Research Center and the James J. Peters VA Medical Center. Studies were conducted in compliance with the Public Health Service policy on the humane care and use of laboratory animals, the National Institutes of Health\nGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals,\nand all applicable Federal regulations governing the protection of animals in research.\n\nBlast overpressure exposure\nMice were exposed to overpressure injury using a shock tube, which simulates the effects of air blast exposure under experimental conditions.\n32\nThe shock tube has a 12-inch circular diameter and is a 19.5 ft-long steel tube divided into a 2.5 ft compression chamber that is separated from a 17 ft expansion chamber. The compression and expansion chambers are separated by polyethylene Mylar\nTM\nsheets (Du Pont, Wilmington, DE) that control the peak pressure generated. The peak pressure at the end of the expansion chamber was determined by piezoresistive gauges specifically designed for pressure-time (impulse) measurements (Model 102M152, PCB, Piezotronics, Depew, NY).\nIndividual mice were anesthetized using an isoflurane gas anesthesia system consisting of a vaporizer, gas lines, and valves and an activated charcoal scavenging system adapted for use with rodents. Mice were placed into a polycarbonate induction chamber, which was closed and immediately flushed with 5% isoflurane in air mixture for 2\u2009min.\nTo eliminate rotational/accelerational injury during exposure to blast, mice were placed side-by-side along the center (horizontal) axis of the circular (10-inch diameter) rodent constraint device. The rodents were held in place between two layers of fabric that were secured in place between the two rings of the device by four clasps, one at each corner. The constraint device was then secured in place with the animals on their stomachs and facing into the shock tube 10 inches from the end of the shock tube.\nEach subject to receive blast exposure was exposed to one 34.5-kPa exposure a day for three days in a row, followed by four days of no exposure, for a total of eight weeks. Sham animals received isoflurane and were placed in the device and the shock tube for the same amount of time as the blast-exposed animals but were not exposed to blast.\nWithin 10 days after the last blast or sham exposure, animals were transported in a climate-controlled van to the James J. Peters VA Medical Center (Bronx, NY). Animals were shipped in the morning from the Naval Medical Research Center and arrived in the afternoon of the same day at the James J. Peters VA Medical Center, where all other procedures were performed.\n\nAnimal housing\nAnimals were housed at a constant 70\u201372\no\nF temperature with rooms on a 12:12\u2009h light cycle with lights on at 7\nam\n. All subjects were individually housed in standard clear plastic cages equipped with Bed-O'Cobs laboratory animal bedding (The Andersons, Maumee, Ohio) and EnviroDri nesting paper (Sheppard Specialty Papers, Milford, NJ). Access to food and water was\nad libitum.\nSubjects were housed on racks in random order to prevent rack position effects. Cages were coded to allow maintenance of blinding to groups during behavioral testing.\n\nBehavioral testing\nElevated zero maze\nThe apparatus consisted of a circular black Plexiglas\u2122 runway 61\u2009cm in diameter and raised 61\u2009cm off the floor (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA). The textured runway itself was 5.0\u2009cm across and divided equally into alternating quadrants of open runway enclosed only by a 0.80-cm lip and closed runway with smooth 15.5-cm walls. All subjects received a 5-min trial beginning in a closed arc of the runway. During each trial, subjects were allowed to move freely around the runway, with all movement tracked automatically by a video camera placed on the ceiling directly above the maze.\nData were analyzed by ANYMAZE (San Diego Instruments) yielding measures of total movement time and distance for the entire maze, as well as time spent and distance traveled in each of the individual quadrants. From the quadrant data, measures of total open and closed arc times, latency to enter an open arc, total open arm entries and latency to completely cross an open arc between two closed arcs were calculated. Subject position was determined by centroid location.\nLight/dark (L/D) emergence\nA L/D emergence task was run in Versamax activity cages with opaque black Plexiglas boxes enclosing the left half of the interiors so that only the right sides were illuminated. Animals began in the dark side and were allowed to freely explore for 10\u2009min with access to the right (light) side through an open doorway located in the center of the monitor. Subject side preference and emergence latencies were tracked by centroid location with all movement automatically tracked and quantified. Light-side emergence latency, time to reach the center of the lighted side (light-side center latency), and percent total light-side duration were calculated from beam breaks. All equipment was wiped clean between tests.\nNovel object recognition (NOR)\nMice were habituated to the circular arena (30\u2009cm length\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u2009cm width\u2009\u00d7\u200940\u2009cm height) for 10\u2009min, 24\u2009h before training. On the training day, two identical objects were placed on opposite ends of the empty arena, and the mouse was allowed to explore the objects freely for 7\u2009min. After 1\u2009h, during which the mouse was held in its home cage, one of the two familiar objects (FOs) was replaced with a novel object (NO), and the mouse was allowed to explore the FO and NO freely for 5\u2009min to assess short-term memory (STM).\nAfter 24\u2009h, during which the mouse was held in its home cage, one of the two FOs was replaced with a NO different from the one used during the STM test. The mouse was allowed to explore the FO and NO freely for 5\u2009min to assess long-term memory (LTM). Raw exploration times for each object were expressed in seconds. Object exploration was defined as sniffing or touching the object with the vibrissae or when the animal's head was oriented toward the object with the nose placed at a distance of <2\u2009cm from the object. All sessions were recorded by video camera (Sentech, Carrollton, TX) and analyzed with ANYMAZE software (San Diego Instruments). In addition, offline analysis by an investigator blind to the treatment status of the animals was performed.\nObjects to be discriminated were of different size, shape, and color and were made of Lego plastic material. All objects were wiped with 70% ethanol between trials. A discrimination index (DI) was calculated with the formula: time exploring the NO minus time exploring the FO/total exploration time\n\u00d7\n100.\nNO localization (NOL)\nNOL was assessed using methods described previously.\n33\nAt 24\u2009h before training, mice were habituated for 20\u2009min to the same empty arena used for the NOR task. The arena was situated in a well-lit room allowing the animals to see distal visual cues. On the training day, two identical objects were placed in specific locations, and the mouse was allowed to explore the objects freely for 7\u2009min. The test trial was performed after a 1-h delay during which one object was moved to a different location in the arena and the mouse was allowed to explore for 5\u2009min. Time spent investigating the objects in their original or novel locations was recorded. The arena and objects were cleaned before and between trials with 70% ethanol.\nBarnes maze\nThe Barnes maze test was performed using a standard apparatus. The testing was conducted in two phases: training (day 1 to 4) and testing (day 5). Before starting each experiment, mice were acclimated to the testing room for 1\u2009h. Mice were transported from their cage to the center of the platform within a closed starting chamber where they remained for 10\u2009sec before exploring the maze. Mice failing to enter the escape box within 4\u2009min on trials 1\u20134 were guided to the escape box by the experimenter, and the latency was recorded as 240\u2009sec. Trial 5 was treated as a test trial, and mice were given up to 180\u2009sec to enter the escape box. The platform and the escape box were wiped with 70% ethanol after each trial. Trials were recorded by video camera and analyzed with ANYMAZE software.\nContextual and cued fear conditioning\nSound-attenuated isolation cubicles (Coulbourn Instruments, Holliston, MA) were utilized. Each cubicle was equipped with a grid floor for delivery of the unconditioned stimulus (US) and overhead cameras. All aspects of the test were controlled and monitored by the Freeze Frame conditioning and video tracking system (Actimetrics, Coulbourn Instruments). During training; the chambers were scented with almond extract, lined with white paper towels, had background noise generated by a small fan; chambers were cleaned before and between trials with 70% ethanol.\nEach subject was placed inside the conditioning chamber for 2\u2009min before the onset of a conditioned stimulus (CS; an 80 dB, 2\u2009kHz tone), which lasted for 20\u2009sec with a coterminating 2-sec footshock (0.7\u2009mA; US). Three tone/shock pairings were administered with the first/second and second/third separated by 1\u2009min. Each mouse remained in the chamber for an additional 40\u2009sec after the third CS-US pairing before being returned to its home cage.\nFreezing was defined as a lack of movement (except for respiration) in each 10-sec interval. Minutes 0\u20132 during the training session were used to measure baseline freezing. Contextual fear memory testing was performed 24\u2009h after the training session by measuring freezing behavior during a 4-min test in the conditioning chamber under conditions identical to those of the training session with the exception that no footshock or tone (CS or US) was presented. Animals were returned to their home cage for another 24\u2009h at which time cued conditioning was tested.\nTo create a new context with different properties, the chambers were free of background noise (fan turned off), lined with blue paper towels, scented with lemon extract, and cleaned before and during all trials with isopropanol. Each subject was placed in this novel context for 2\u2009min, and baseline freezing was measured, followed by exposure to the CS (20-sec tone) at 120 and 290\u2009sec.\nSocial preference test\nA three-chamber social preference test was used to assess preference for social versus non-social stimuli. The test was modeled after other published protocols.\n34\n,\n35\nThe apparatus consisted of a gray opaque polycarbonate rectangle (64\n\u00d7\n41\n\u00d7\n25\u2009cm) that was divided into three chambers using removable partitions. Each divider (41\n\u00d7\n21\u2009cm) had a sliding door of \u22485\n\u00d7\n5\u2009cm to allow free movement of the animal between chambers.\nThe central chamber served as the starting area while the lateral chambers were used to hold a stimulus. The mouse stimulus was placed in a metallic cage/jail of height 15\u2009cm having a diameter of 7\u2009cm that allowed interactions between the test subject and mouse stimulus but limited aggressive interactions. The protocol comprised three phases that were completed over three days.\nOn day 1 the test subject was first habituated to the apparatus containing two empty metal cups in the side chambers. The test subject was allowed to explore the three chambers freely for 10\u2009min, and basal activity was recorded. In the pre-test phase on day 2, the subject was allowed to interact with two non-Tg mice of the same age as the test subject (one in each metal cup) for 5\u2009min. During the test phase on the day 3, the test subject was given the choice of interacting with a new mouse (unfamiliar non-Tg) contained in one cup or a novel non-social stimulus (an object) contained in the other cup for 5\u2009min. Movement of the test subject was tracked by ANYMAZE software recording the time in motion, distance moved, entries and exits from the chambers as well as time interacting/sniffing the object or the jailed mouse.\n\nLaboratory evaluations\nA\u03b2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\nAnimals were euthanized by CO\n2\nnarcosis, and the brains were quickly removed, frozen, and stored at -80\u00b0C until use. The Tris-buffered saline (TBS), Triton X-100, and formic acid fractions from one hemisphere were prepared using a protocol adapted from that described in Kawarabayashi and associates\n36\nand described in more detail by Steele and colleagues.\n37\nThe tissues were homogenized with a hand-held homogenizer in 50\u2009mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 150\u2009mM NaCl (TBS) with a protease/phosphatase inhibitors cocktail (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) (200\u2009mg tissue/mL), and 0.25\u2009mL were centrifuged at 100,000\ng\nfor 1\u2009h at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was saved (TBS fraction), and the pellet homogenized with 1% Triton X-100 in TBS supplemented with protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (ThermoFisher). The supernatant was saved (Triton fraction) and the pellet extracted with ice-cold 70% formic acid and centrifuged as above. The supernatant was saved (formic acid fraction). The A\u03b2 42 levels in every fraction were determined by ELISA using a commercially available kit that detects human A\u03b242 (Wako, Richmond, VA). Data are expressed as pg/mg fresh tissue.\nOligomeric A\u03b242 dot blot analysis\nOligomeric A\u03b242 was determined by dot blot analysis. Protein concentration was determined with the BCA reagent (ThermoFisher). An aliquot containing 2.5\u2009\u03bcg protein was spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and the membrane was air-dried, washed in TBS with 0.1% Tween (TBST), and blocked for 1\u2009h in TBST/5% non-fat dry milk. The membrane was then incubated for 1\u2009h with anti-oligomer antibody A11 (1:1500, #AHB0052, ThermoFisher), washed in TBST, and incubated for 1\u2009h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:10,000, #NA-934, Cytiva Lifesciences, Marlborough, MA) diluted in blocking solution.\nThe immunoreactive signal was visualized with ECL Prime reagent (Cytiva Lifesciences), imaged with an Amersham Image Quant 1200 imaging station, and quantitated by ImageQuantTL software (Cytiva Lifesciences). Data were normalized to sham samples.\nImmunohistochemistry\nMice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and the brains dissected and post-fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were sectioned into 40\u2009\u03bcm-thick coronal sections with a Vibratome (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). For stereologic analyses, sections that contained the entire hippocampus were selected every 300\u2009\u03bcm (interaural 0.72-1.44\u2009mm) from six control and six blast-exposed APP/PS1 Tg animals. Amyloid plaques were identified by immunohistochemical staining with the mouse monoclonal antibody 6E10 (1:1,000, LSBio #LS-C821449, Seattle, WA), which recognizes an epitope in the N-terminal region of both A\u03b240 and A\u03b242.\nSections were blocked with TBS/0.3% Triton X-100, 5% normal goat serum for 1\u2009h and stained overnight with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution. The sections were washed in PBS and incubated for 2\u2009h with the appropriate Alexa-fluor-conjugated secondary antibody (1:300, ThermoFisher) in blocking solution. After washing with PBS, the sections were mounted in FluoroGel mounting medium (EMS Science, Hatfield, PA). Total plaque number in the hippocampal region in each section was determined using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope at 40X magnification under ultraviolet illumination.\nThioflavin S staining\nSections were incubated in 1% aqueous Thioflavin S (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 8\u2009min at room temperature in the dark. Sections were washed twice for 3\u2009min in 80% ethanol, 3\u2009min with 95% ethanol, rinsed three times with distilled water, and mounted with Fluorogel. Sections were sampled as above, and the total number of Thioflavin S positive plaques in the hippocampal areas was determined.\n\nStatistical analysis\nValues are expressed as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009the standard error of the mean (SEM). The groups and group sizes are indicated in\nTable 1\n. Data sets were tested for normality using the D'Agostino-Pearson normality test.

    "Methods": "Study population\nThe\nT\nransforming\nR\nesearch\na\nnd\nC\nlinical\nK\nnowledge in\nT\nraumatic\nB\nrain\nI\nnjury (TRACK-TBI) study is a prospective, longitudinal, observational study of acute TBI. The inclusion criterion was presentation to a participating level 1 trauma center within 24\u2009h of injury with clinical indication for head computed tomography (CT) under American College of Emergency Medicine/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria. Participating centers included Ben Taub General Hospital (Houston, TX), Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA), Zuckerberg San Francisco General (San Francisco, CA), University of Cincinnati Medical Center (Cincinnati, OH), R. Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center (Baltimore, MD), Ryder Trauma Center (Miami, FL), University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (Pittsburgh, PA), Seton Medical Center (Austin, TX), Parkland Memorial Hospital (Dallas, TX), Harborview Medical Center (Seattle, WA), and Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center (Richmond, VA).\nExclusion criteria included pregnancy, incarceration, non-survivable physical trauma, and pre-existing medical/neuropsychiatric conditions that could interfere with outcome assessments. Patients or their legal representatives gave written informed consent. Participating centers' institutional review boards approved all study protocols. The present study is limited to the 517 TRACK-TBI patients 18\u201365 years of age at time of enrollment (February 26, 2014 to May 4, 2016), with GCS 13\u201315 upon ED arrival and who completed 2-week brain MRI.\n\nBrain magnetic resonance imaging and interpretation by three US board-certified neuroradiologists\nBrain MRI, including T1, T2, T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and T2*-weighted series, was performed at 7\u201318 days post-injury. All sites used a standardized MRI protocol\n14\nacross General Electric (General Electric Healthcare, Waukesha, WI), Siemens (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany), and Phillips (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands) MRI platforms. MRI exams were deidentified and uploaded to a central repository.\nThree neuroradiologists with American Board of Radiology certification and Certificate of Added Qualification in Neuroradiology independently reviewed each MRI exam. They had 17, 16, and 10 years of attending neuroradiologist experience and had completed neuroradiology fellowship training at different institutions (Massachusetts General Hospital [Boston, MA]; University of California, San Francisco [San Francisco, CA]; and Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University [St. Louis, MO]).\nEach neuroradiologist reviewed the NIH-NINDS TBI Imaging CDE definitions before the study.\n9\n,\n10\nReaders used FDA-cleared OsiriX software (Pixmeo, Geneva, Switzerland) to view MRI exams on an iMac with Retina display (Apple, Cupertino, CA). Readers were asked to annotate each lesion on at least one image by drawing an arrow pointing to the lesion or by encircling the lesion with a circle/oval. Readers were asked to annotate all brain contusions, though it was decided that enumeration of contusions would not be emphasized in this study; this was felt by all readers to be ambiguous, given that nearly contiguous contusions could be labeled as a single lesion or multiple lesions.\nFor traumatic axonal injury (TAI)/diffuse axonal injury (DAI), readers annotated as many lesions as possible, up to (when present) at least four lesions and including (when present) lesions in at least two lobes of the brain. Readers were free to choose any series or plane on which to annotate a lesion, but generally did so on an image of a series on which they felt the lesion was clearly demonstrated. For each annotated lesion, the reader entered CDE information using a pop-up dialog box created using an OsiriX TBI Imaging CDE plug-in module. Each neuroradiologist evaluated all 517 MRI exams without feedback regarding agreement with other readers. Readers had no access to clinical information except age/sex, and no access to previous head CT or other imaging exams.\n\nBrain contusion\nIn the NIH-NINDS TBI Imaging CDEs, brain contusion is defined as \u201ca focal area of brain parenchymal disruption due to acute mechanical deformation. Contusions typically occur in the cortex and may extend into subcortical region\u2026 [F]or purposes of categorization, contusions are differentiated from \u2018intracerebral hematomas' by containing a\nmixture\nof hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic tissue, or by having no grossly visible hemorrhage (\u2018bland contusion\u2019), while an \u2018intracerebral hematoma\u2019 is predominantly a uniform collection of blood alone. The term \u2018contusion\u2019 should not be used for hemorrhagic lesions which fit better in other categories, such as small hemorrhages associated with the pattern of diffuse axonal injury, lesions which in context are more likely to represent infarction or other primary vascular lesion, or isolated subarachnoid hemorrhage.\u201d\n10\n\nTraumatic axonal injury and diffuse axonal injury\nIn the NIH-NINDS TBI Imaging CDEs, TAI and DAI are defined as \u201ca pattern consistent with scattered, small hemorrhagic and/or non-hemorrhagic lesions which have been shown historically to correlate with pathologic findings of relatively widespread injury to white matter axons, typically due to mechanical strain related to rotational acceleration/deceleration forces.\u201d The definition further states that \u201c\u2018diffuse axonal injury\u2019 refers to a widespread distribution of lesions, including the subcortical white matter in more than one lobe or hemisphere, along with lesions in the corpus callosum, and may include the dorsomedial midbrain and other brainstem and cerebellar regions. \u2018Traumatic axonal injury\u2019 refers to similar multiple, scattered, small hemorrhagic and/or non-hemorrhagic lesions in a more confined white matter distribution\u2026 DAI includes more than three separate foci of signal abnormality, and TAI is 1-3 foci of signal abnormality.\u201d\n10\n\nStatistical analysis\nInterrater agreement for each CDE, brain contusion, and TAI/DAI was determined using Cohen's kappa (with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for each pair of neuroradiologists. Interrater agreement for each CDE was determined at a per-exam (i.e., per-patient) level, not at the individual lesion level. CDEs such as extra-axial collections present on initial CT, but that had often resolved or were barely perceptible by the time of 2-week MRI, were not analyzed. We also calculated prevalence- and bias-adjusted kappa values (PABAK; with 95% CIs) to account for low prevalence of CDE lesions in our mTBI population. Finally, to address previously raised limitations of Cohen's kappa,\n15\nwe determined overall percent agreement (OPA), positive percent agreement (PPA), and negative percent agreement (NPA) for brain contusion and for DAI, including 95% CIs using a bootstrap procedure (1000 resampled sets, each with 517 randomly selected datapoints from the original list of 517 data points, performed separately for each pair-wise OPA, PPA, and NPA).\n\nConsensus review\nAfter readers had interpreted all 517 cases, they performed a consensus review to better understand sources of discrepancies. Readers discussed their own and others' annotations and, by majority vote, formed a final decision regarding the presence of at least one brain contusion on each exam and presence of TAI or DAI on each exam. Exams for which the initial interpretation for presence of a CDE was not unanimous, but were ultimately determined\nnot to contain\nthe CDE after a majority vote, were attributed to a discordance in the interpretation of perceived finding(s). Exams for which the initial interpretation for the presence of a CDE was not unanimous, but were determined\nto contain\nthe CDE after a majority vote, could have been attributable to a discordance in the interpretation of perceived finding(s) and/or initial failure to perceive (detect) an abnormality (\u201cI didn't see it\u201d). For TAI, a consensus decision on the number of lesions was also recorded."

    "Methods": "This observational cohort study used data from the VHA to identify persons with epilepsy and mTBI, and controls for subsequent survey administration. Study approval and waiver of informed consent were provided by the University of Utah, the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, the VA Bedford Healthcare System, and the Department of Defense (DoD) Human Research Protection Office.\n\nDevelopment of survey denominator using Veterans Health Administration health system data\nThis study examines TBI and epilepsy in a VHA cohort of post-9/11 veterans previously deployed in support of Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, and New Dawn. We included those who entered VHA care between October 1, 2001 and September 30, 2014 (fiscal year [FY]02 to FY14) and who received \u22652 years of VHA care (inpatient, outpatient, or pharmacy) before September 30, 2015.\nData sources included: 1) TBI severity identified from the Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium (CENC) epidemiology study\n31\n,\n32\n; 2) in- and outpatient data from the VHA data repository in Austin, Texas; 3) pharmacy benefits management outpatient data set; and 4) mortality data from the VHA vital status files. We merged these data sources to create a longitudinal record, identified epilepsy and TBI status using data from FY02 to FY15, and identified other diagnosed health conditions using data through FY18.\n\nDefinition of study groups for survey sample\nThe survey included persons with no TBI or mTBI classification based on definitions from the CENC Epidemiology study.\n9\nPersons without evidence of TBI in the DoD Trauma Registry (DoDTR), VHA inpatient/outpatient data, VA Comprehensive TBI Evaluation (CTBIE), or TBI screening data were defined as no TBI. Per past work,\n9\n,\n30\nmTBI was identified if there was: 1) documented TBI and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13\u201315 (DoDTR); 2) self-reported duration of loss of consciousness <30\u2009min (CTBIE); 3) alteration of consciousness/post-traumatic amnesia for <24\u2009h (CTBIE);\nor\n4) an International Classifcation of Diseases, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis code in VHA data indicative of mTBI (Armed Forces Health Surveillance System algorithm).\n33\n,\n34\nNeuroimaging data were not available.\nThe epilepsy identification algorithm was validated for use in VHA data in earlier studies.\n2\n,\n35\n,\n36\nBriefly, the algorithm requires: 1) ICD-9-CM diagnosis code(s) indicative of epilepsy (345) or convulsion (780.39) and (2) subsequent/concomitant use of antiseizure medication (ASM). We included persons whose only ASM was gabapentin/pregabalin only if they had a 345 (epilepsy specific) diagnosis. This algorithm previously achieved a positive predictive value of 0.92\u20130.96.\n2\n,\n11\n,\n36\n,\n37\nA research scientist experienced in medical chart abstraction (author: K.K.M.) conducted medical chart abstraction to validate epilepsy status and exclude definite/probable psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, seizures associated with drug/alcohol exposure, and unspecified convulsions. Cases were discussed with the PI (author: M.J.P.) and an epileptologist (author: S.G.). Only persons treated with ASMs for epilepsy based on documentation (as assessed January 2017 to August 2017) were included in the Validated Active Epilepsy (VAE) Cohort.\nUsing the TBI and epilepsy defintions above, we identified four study groups for survey administration: 1) control (no TBI/no epilepsy); 2) epilepsy (no TBI/+epilepsy); 3) mTBI (+mTBI/no epilepsy); and 4) +mTBI/+epilepsy.\n\nSurvey sample characteristics\nSociodemographic data from VHA inpatient/outpatient records were used to describe the characteristics of survey responders and non-responders: age, sex, race/ethnicity (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, Native American/Pacific Islander), marital status (married vs. not married) service component (Active, National Guard/Reserve), employment (employed, unemployed), and education (college degree or higher vs. <college degree) at military discharge.\nWe also identified clinical conditions common in post-9/11 veterans, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, substance use disorder, bipolar disorder, back pain, neck pain, headache, tinnitus, homelessness, and suicidal ideation/attempt,\n31\n,\n32\nusing ICD-9-CM/International Classifcation of Diseases, Tenth Edition, Clinical Modification algorithms in VHA data through FY18 (see\nSupplementary Table S1\nfor definitions).\n\nSurvey development and administration\nThe survey was developed for paper and Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) deployment with input from veteran stakeholders (\nn\n=\u20095). After applying exclusions (\nFig. 1\n), we identified a stratified random sample from each study group to receive mailed invitation packets based on a calculation of 80% power at\np\n<\u20090.05 and an assumption of a 22\u201326% response rate.\n20\n,\n38\n,\n39\nWe oversampled women; because of the small number of women with epilepsy, all women with VAE received study invitations.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nThe MINUTE survey cohort.

A follow-up invitation was mailed with a business reply envelope to non-respondents at 4 weeks; a final follow-up reminder with a link to the online survey was mailed at 8 weeks. Survey responders received a $50 gift card.\n\nSurvey measures\nMeasures were selected primarily from National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Common Data Elements.\n35\nThe self-administered Ohio State TBI Identification measure (OSU-TBI)\n40\nwas used to identify the most severe lifetime TBI.\nTable 1\ndescribes the OSU-TBI and functional outcome measures: mental/physical (MCS/PCS) component scores of the Veterans RAND-12\n41\n,\n42\n; Quality of Life after Brain Injury Overall Scale (QOLIBRI-OS)\n43\u201345\n; and Quality-of-Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QoLIE)-10.\n46\nTable 1.\nSurvey Self-Report Measures\nConstruct\nMeasure\nDescription and psychometrics\nScore interpretation\nSelf-reported lifetime TBI history (SRLH)\nOhio State University TBI identification (OSU-TBI), online version\n40\nThe OSU TBI-ID is a screening tool based on Centers for Disease Control recommendations for the detection of history of exposure to TBI.\n40\nIt identifies TBI exposure, loss of consciousness (LOC) duration, presence of alteration of consciousness (AOC), and post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) with high reliabilities (\nr\n>\u20090.9).\n52\nThe self-administered version of the measure found that the most severe TBI was significantly associated with the Rivermead Postconcussion Symptoms Questionnaire, suggesting validity for measuring the most severe TBI, which is the measure we used in this study.\n40\nSeverity was classified by duration of LOC for those reporting a TBI:\nMild: 0\u2013<30\u2009min\nModerate/severe: \u226530\u2009min\nUnclassified: TBI with AOC or PTA (unspecified duration in this measure)\nFunctional outcomes\nVeterans RAND 12 (VR-12)\nThe VR-12 was developed from the RAND 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36) and examines physical and emotional health status.\n41\n,\n42\nPast work has shown that differences on SF-36 scores distinguish patients with and without epilepsy.\n18\n,\n19\nVR-12 responses are summarized into mental component scores (MCS) and physical component scores (PCS; each with \u03bc\u2009=\u200950, \u03c3\u2009=\u200910).\nVariation by 1\u20132 points is considered clinically/socially significant.\n41\n,\n42\nTraumatic brain injury quality of life\nQuality of Life after Brain Injury (QOLIBRI-OS) Overall Scale\nThe QOLIBRI Overall Scale is a six-item ordinal measure that assesses satisfaction with cognition, self, autonomy, social relationships, emotions, and physical health problems after TBI and creates an overall health-related quality of life score.\n44\u201346\nScores of the six items are standardized with a range of 0\u2013100 (0\u2009=\u2009worst possible quality of life; 100\u2009=\u2009best possible quality of life).\n44\n,\n47\nImpaired quality of life has been defined as a score <52 for persons with TBI.\n45\nEpilepsy quality of life\nPatient-Weighted Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QoLIE-10P)\n10-item quality-of-life measure designed for persons with epilepsy by measuring medication effects, mental health, role functioning, and seizure worry.

Characteristics of responders and non-responders were compared using the chi-square statistic (\np\n<\u20090.05), using a family-wise Bonferroni correction. Differences in VAE status across SRLH TBI severity groups were assessed using\nz\n-tests of difference in sample proportions. Outcomes across SRLH groups (TBI severity and epilepsy status) were tested using a Kruskal-Wallis H-test (omnibus), followed by an exploration of specific differences in QoL scores across pairs using Welch's\nt\n-test for unequal-size samples under the assumption of unequal variances.

    "Methods": "Regulatory approval and animal care\nThe Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pittsburgh approved this study in accordance with the guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health in the\nGuide for the Care and Use of laboratory Animals.\nAdult (12\u201315-week-old), male C57BL/6J mice (\nn\n=\u200945) (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were given standard chow and water\nad libitum\nand were group housed until injury, and single housed thereafter (12-h day-night cycles). Animal health and welfare were assessed at least daily by laboratory personnel and veterinary staff, and after injury animals were assessed daily by the surgeon to ensure that the animals regained catheterized limb function and did not have ischemic complications of catheterization.\n\nControlled Cortical Impact (CCI) and HS\nMice underwent our previously described murine model of CCI and severe HS (\nFig. 1\n).\n14\u201316\nThis model simulates the clinically relevant scenario of moderate-severe TBI and comorbid HS seen in patients with polytrauma. It consists of CCI followed by an initial \u201cshock\u201d phase, a prolonged \u201cpre-hospital\u201d resuscitation, and a definitive-care \u201chospital\u201d phase, outlined in greater detail in subsequent sections.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExperimental protocol. Intervals between black dots represent 5-min epochs from time of controlled cortical impact (CCI). Red dots represent times at which arterial blood gases and chemistries were withdrawn. Vertical dashed lines represent horizontal separation between protocol phases. After a pressure controlled (25\u201327\u2009mm Hg) hemorrhagic shock, mice were first bolused with 20\u2009mL/kg of either autologous whole blood (WB) or lactated Ringer's (LR). They were subsequently bolused with an additional 10\u2009mL/kg of LR for mean arterial pressures (MAPs) below randomized target (60 or 70\u2009mm Hg). Remaining shed blood from shock was reinfused in all animals after the pre-hospital phase.\n\nMonitoring and initial injury\nMice were randomized to five groups (\nn\n=\u20098/group) before catheter insertion: initial LR resuscitation with MAP target 60\u2009mm Hg (LR\n60\n), initial LR resuscitation with MAP target 70\u2009mm Hg (LR\n70\n), initial WB resuscitation with MAP target 60\u2009mm Hg (WB\n60\n), initial WB resuscitation with MAP target 70\u2009mm Hg (WB\n70\n), or sham. Anesthesia was induced with 4% isoflurane in a gas mixture of 2:1\u2009N\n2\nO:O\n2\n(FiO\n2\n=\u20090.33) and maintained with 1.5% isoflurane in that gas mixture for catheter insertion.\nAfter inguinal cutdown and administration of local anesthesia (1% lidocaine hydrochloride, 0.1\u2009mL), femoral venous and arterial catheters (modified PE-50 tubing) were inserted under sterile conditions. Mice were placed in a stereotactic frame (Kopf, Tujunga, CA), and a left scalp incision was made. A dental drill was used to make a 5-mm craniotomy over the left parietal cortex, and the bone flap was removed. A temperature probe (1-cm length, 0.33-mm diameter [Physitemp, Clifton, NJ]) was inserted in the left temporalis muscle to approximate brain temperature, which was maintained at 37.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u00b0C using a heat lamp. A rectal probe recorded body temperature. Isoflurane was reduced to 1% after catheter placement, and FiO\n2\nwas reduced to 0.21 for 10\u2009min before CCI.\nSham mice had catheters inserted, were anesthetized and monitored as above, but did not undergo craniotomy, CCI, or HS. Mice were enrolled in the protocol until\nn\n=\u20098/group completed behavioral testing.\nThe CCI was performed with a pneumatic impactor (Bimba, Monee, IL) with a flat 3-mm tipped impounder on the left parietal cortex (velocity of 5\u2009m/sec; depth of 1.2\u2009mm). After CCI, the bone flap was replaced, and the skin was sutured closed with local analgesia provided at the time of skin closure (0.25% Sensorcaine/bupivacaine, 0.1\u2009mL). At 5\u2009min after CCI, mice began the \u201cshock\u201d phase of our model. Blood (12\u2009mL/kg of body weight) was removed manually over 5\u2009min via venous canula into a tuberculin syringe containing 0.07\u2009mL of citrate anticoagulant (Cardian BCT, Lakewood, CO). An additional 12\u2009mL/kg of venous blood was removed over 5\u201315\u2009min into the same syringe, for a total blood loss of \u223c30% of mouse blood volume.\nThe MAP was maintained at 25\u201327\u2009mm Hg for the 35\u2009min \u201cshock\u201d phase, initiated at the start of blood removal, by continued removal and/or reinfusion of 0.05\u2009mL aliquots between the citrated syringe and the venous catheter. Blood was kept at room temperature between removal and reinfusion in either the pre-hospital or hospital phase. During shock, anesthetic was decreased from 1% isoflurane in room air to 0.5% isoflurane in room air.\n\nPre-hospital and hospital resuscitation\nAfter shock, mice received an initial 20\u2009mL/kg bolus of autologous WB or LR depending on randomized treatment. The surgeon could not be blinded to treatment given the immediate difference in MAP response between LR and WB resuscitation. All mice received 10\u2009mL/kg boluses of LR every 5\u2009min for MAP below target, for up to 170\u2009mL/kg of additional LR. After the 90\u2009min pre-hospital phase, mice entered a 15\u2009min hospital phase where remaining shed blood was reinfused and anesthetic was increased to 1% isoflurane in 100% oxygen to mimic the resuscitation of a severe TBI victim with polytrauma and HS.\n\nPhysiological outcomes\nThe MAP was recorded every 5\u2009min throughout the experiment. Arterial blood gases and chemistries were measured pre-injury and after each of the three injury phases. Total LR volume administered subsequent to the initial bolus was tabulated.\n\nMorris Water Maze (MWM) testing\nWe used the MWM hidden platform task on post-injury days 14\u201318 to assess spatial learning, followed by probe trial as described previously.\n16\nPerformance in the MWM was quantified by daily latency to locate a hidden platform, and the probe trial was quantified as percent time in the target quadrant. Visible platform testing on days 19\u201320 after TBI confirmed that latencies were not confounded by visual impairments. All behavioral testing was performed by research technicians blind to treatment and injury status.\n\nVolumetrical analyses\nIsoflurane anesthetized mice were euthanized 21 days after injury by thoracotomy, left ventricular cannulation, and heparinized saline/10% buffered formalin solution perfusion until atrial outflow cleared, followed by decapitation. Brains were extracted, the cerebellum and brainstem were removed, and 10-mm coronal frozen sections were cut on a cryostat at 0.5-mm intervals. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and per slice contusion area and ipsilateral and contralateral hemisphere areas were quantified using MCID Elite Software (MCID Imaging Research, St. Catharines, ON) by technicians blind to experimental group status.\nPer previously published methods, slice volumes were calculated by multiplying per slice area by slice interval thickness.\n14\nSlice volumes were summed to calculate contusion volume and right and left hemisphere volumes. Hemisphere volumes were summed to obtain remaining brain volume.\n\nStatistical analysis\nBased on previous experiments, we expected cumulative MWM latency to increase from approximately 100\u2009sec in the sham group to 200\u2009sec in the LR\n70\ngroup, with a standard deviation (SD) of approximately 10\u2009sec.\n14\nBecause our previous report suggested that WB\n60\nresuscitated mice had the lowest brain edema, lowest fluid requirements, and double the PbO\n2\nas LR\n70\n,\n13\nwe hypothesized that this group would likely have the best performance in MWM, with intermediate latencies for WB\n70\nand LR\n60\nbased on LR requirements and PbO\n2\n. Assuming that WB\n60\ncould reduce the latency deficit by 75\u2009sec (75%), then\nn\n=\u20098 mice/group would give 80% power to detect a statistically significant (a\u2009=\u20090.05) marginal difference between LR\n70\nand WB\n60\nmice in\npost hoc\ntesting.\nBody weight, mean MAP, LR volume post-initial bolus, and blood chemistries data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. Other parameters were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with\npost hoc\ncomparisons performed with two-tailed Student\nt\ntest. Between-group differences in MAP throughout the pre-hospital period were assessed by random coefficient linear mixed models (LMM). The LMM results are presented as b coefficients. The MWM data were assessed by repeated measures ANOVA and presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean.\nSham mice were excluded from ANOVA comparisons of average MAP per period, but were included in the LMM of MAP over time. Volumetric data were not normally distributed and are presented as median and interquartile range. The Tukey test was used for\npost hoc\ncomparisons. All\np\nvalues are adjusted, and a\u2009=\u20090.05. Analysis was performed using Stata 16.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX)."

    "Methods": "Study design\nWe performed a prospective breath-hold fMRI study on a cohort of patients with chronic mTBI and age-matched controls without a history of brain injuries. All the experimental procedures were explained to the subjects. Signed informed consent was obtained before participating in the study. All procedures were performed in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Human Research Committee.\n\nParticipants\nPatients with a diagnosis of mTBI for at least three months since the head impact were recruited at the MGH Neurology Clinic. The patients did not have a loss of consciousness or had a loss of consciousness of <30\u2009min duration, and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was \u226513.\n25\n,\n26\nNo abnormality was reported in the structural brain images. Control subjects without a history of brain injuries were also recruited.\n\nMRI acquisition\nThree-dimensional T1-MEMPRAGE (TR/TE1/TE2/TE3/TE4\u2009=\u20092530/1.64/3.5/5.36/7.22\u2009msec, matrix\u2009=\u2009256\n\u00d7\n256\u2009\u00d7\u2009176, resolution\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091mm\n3\n) and T2-SPACE FLAIR (TR/TE/TI\u2009=\u20095000/355/1800\u2009msec, matrix\u2009=\u2009192\u2009\u00d7\u2009192\u2009\u00d7\u2009176, resolution\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm\n3\n) images were acquired on a 3-Tesla scanner (Siemens Medical, Erlangen, Germany). The BOLD-fMRI images were acquired with gradient-echo EPI sequence (TR/TE\u2009=\u20091450/30\u2009msec, matrix\u2009=\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200964, resolution\u2009=\u20093.4\u2009\u00d7\u20093.4\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009mm\n3\n), while the subject was performing the breath-hold task.\nThe timing of the breath-hold task was presented visually to the subject by a computer using the software Eprime Professional 2.0 (Psychology Software Tools, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA) (\nFig. 1\n). A breath-hold rehearsal was given before fMRI. No special instruction on the breath holding after inhalation or exhalation was delivered to the subjects because BOLD signal amplitude has been suggested to depend on the depth of inspiration immediately preceding the breath-hold period,\n27\nand end-expiration breath hold may induce significant head motion.\n28\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nThe paradigm of breath-hold challenge. Subjects were instructed via visual cues to perform six epochs of 30-sec breath hold interleaved with 60\u201390\u2009sec of free breathing. They were asked to have free breathing when white crosshair was projected on the screen with a black background and hold their breaths when the white crosshair changed to red. Yellow shades represent the breath-hold epochs.\nThe partial pressure of O\n2\n(PO\n2\n) and CO\n2\n(PCO\n2\n) and respiration were measured simultaneously with MRI acquisition. A small nasal tubing was placed at the subject's nostril to sample PCO\n2\nand PO\n2\nvia gas analyzers (Capstar-100, Oxystar-100, CWE, Inc., Ardmore, PA) after calibrating to the barometric pressure immediately before the scan and correcting for vapor pressure. Respiration was measured using a respiratory bellow connected to a spirometer (FE141, ADInstruments, Inc., Colorado Springs, CO). All the physiological measurements were synchronized using trigger signals from the MRI scanner.\n\nPhysiological data processing\nThe physiological data were analyzed using Matlab R2014a (Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA). Technical delay of PCO\n2\nand PO\n2\nwas corrected by cross-correlating the time series of PCO\n2\nand PO\n2\nwith respiratory phases determined from the respiratory bellow. End-inspiration (I) and end-expiration (E) were defined on the time series of PO\n2\nand PCO\n2\n, and were verified by the inspiratory and expiratory phases on the respiration time series. Changes in the gas parameters in the breath-hold periods were interpolated by the values measured immediately before and after the breath-hold periods.\nThe bER, the ratio of the change in PO\n2\n(\u0394PO\n2\n=\u2009inspired PO\n2\n\u2013expired PO\n2\n) to the change in PCO\n2\n(\u0394PCO\n2\n=\u2009expired PCO\n2\n\u2013inspired PCO\n2\n), is measured between end-inspiration and end-expiration in each respiratory cycle. The bER, \u0394PO\n2\nand \u0394PCO\n2\nmeasured in the baseline periods\u2014i.e., the period before the first breath-hold epoch\u2014were calculated. Because the breath-hold duration might vary from one epoch to another, the changes of bER, \u0394PO\n2\n, and \u0394PCO\n2\nin each breath-hold epoch were normalized to a 30-sec breath-hold epoch by dividing the changes to the actual breath-hold duration in seconds and multiplying by 30.\n21\nThe normalized changes of each parameter over the six breath-hold epochs were then averaged.\n\nImage processing\nAll the BOLD-fMRI data were analyzed using software AFNI.\n29\nThe first 12 volumes of each functional dataset collected before equilibrium magnetization was reached were discarded. Each functional dataset was corrected for slice timing, motion-corrected, and coregistered to the first image of the functional dataset. The time series of each voxel was detrended with the fifth order of polynomials to remove the low drift frequency, and the components of motion were removed using orthogonal projection.\nHead motions were quantified and compared between patients and controls (\nSupplementary Fig. S1\n). The clean time series was then normalized to its mean intensity value. Voxels located within the ventricles and outside the brain were excluded from the following analyses of functional images. Individual subject brain volumes with time series of percent BOLD signal changes (\u0394BOLD) were derived.\nHilbert Transform analysis\n30\nwas used to measure the cross-correlation between the \u0394BOLD and the reference time series of RGE metrics (bER, \u0394PO\n2\n, and \u0394PCO\n2\n) in each voxel. Fisher Z-transformation was used to convert the cross-correlation coefficients in the individual subject maps to Fisher's z scores. Individual subject brain volumes with Fisher's z scores were then registered onto the subjects' anatomical scans and transformed to the standardized space of Talairach and Tournoux\n31\nfor group analysis.\nWavelet Transform coherence\n32\nwas used to measure the dynamic changes in coupling between the time series of RGE metrics and \u0394BOLD extracted from brain regions in the time-frequency domain. The analysis procedures were the same as those described in our other breath-hold study.\n18\nThe brain regions in gray and white matter were segmented using the software FreeSurfer.\n33\n,\n34\nAn example of squared wavelet coherence between bER and \u0394BOLD in gray matter from a representative patient under breath-hold challenge is shown in\nSupplementary Fig. S2\n. The percentage of significant coherence (sCoh%) defined as the percentage of time during which the magnitude of wavelet transform coherence was significantly different from the red noise outside the cone of influence was used to quantify the dynamic coupling between the time series of each RGE metric and \u0394BOLD (\nSupplementary Fig. 2C\n).\n\nStatistical analysis\nContinuous variables (i.e., age and RGE metrics) were summarized as median and interquartile range (IQR), and group (mTBI and control) differences were assessed using the Kruskal-Wallis tests. Categorical variable (i.e., gender) was summarized as frequencies; group difference was assessed using the Chi-square test. Spearman correlation analyses were used to correlate in pairs the RPQ scores, time after injury, age, and breath-hold duration, and normalized changes in RGE metrics (bER, \u0394PO\n2\nand \u0394PCO\n2\n) averaged over the six breath-hold epochs. Significant differences or correlations were considered at\np\n<\u20090.05.\nUnpaired\nt\ntests (3dttest++) in AFNI were used to compare the cerebrovascular responses to breath-hold challenge (i.e., Fisher's z scores from Hilbert Transform analysis) between patients and controls. Multiple comparisons were corrected using the equitable thresholding and clustering (ETAC) method.\n35\nThe group results were painted onto the averaged brain surfaces reconstructed by FreeSurfer.\n33\n,\n34\nThe sCoh% at the phase lags of 0\u00b1\u03c0/2 and \u00b1\u03c0/2 from the individual subject wavelet transform analysis were separately plotted for mTBI and control groups to explore the Fourier periods/frequency bandwidths that oscillations of \u0394BOLD in gray and white matter were in synchrony with each physiological time series of bER, \u0394PO\n2\n, and \u0394PCO\n2\nwhen the subjects were performing breath-hold tasks.\nThe sCoh% of RGE metrics with \u0394BOLD in the six frequency bandwidths (0.008\u20130.015\u2009Hz, 0.016\u20130.03\u2009Hz, 0.031\u20130.062\u2009Hz, 0.063\u20130.124\u2009Hz, 0.125\u20130.249\u2009Hz, and 0.25\u20130.5\u2009Hz) extracted in the brain regions showing significant differences in Fisher's z scores between mTBI and control groups was calculated for each subject. The distribution of sCoh% in these brain regions of the mTBI and control groups was then compared using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Significant differences in the distribution of the sCoh% were considered at\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Rigor\nAnimal studies were conducted in accordance with the guidelines established by the internal Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. The ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting\nIn Vivo\nExperiments) guidelines were followed while conducting and reporting this study.\n46\nSurgeries were performed on a total of 18 pregnant dams. A total of 4 pregnant dams died from the injury. No animals were excluded from this study for technical failures (e.g., dura damage during surgery, loose hubs, etc.) or for falling outside of the pre-determined brain-injury inclusion criteria (righting reflex times, 4\u20138\u2009min). One TBI and 1 sham dam did not give birth to full litters or experienced a spontaneous abortion. A total of 12 moms gave birth naturally, and a total of 80 mixed-sex offspring were weaned and used for the study. Of these, 72 were used for behavior and 8 were used for cortical mapping.\nAll mice had repeated blood draws using the submandibular vein within 15\u2009min of forced swim and tail suspension testing. A subset of 40 mice were used to measure corticosterone levels after the behavioral stressors. Mice were injected (intraperitoneally; i.p.) with 1\u2009mg/kg of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 24\u2009h before euthanasia. Flow cytometry outcomes were analyzed from 35 mice. Gut histology was analyzed from 14 male mice. Last, at time of euthanasia, all mice were euthanized with Euthasol\n\u00ae\n(0.002\u2009mL/g; 07-805-9296; Patterson Veterinary, Greeley, CO).\n\nAnimals\nDams were ordered from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) at 5 d.p.c., gravida 1, and acclimated for a week before any procedures took place. All pregnant mice were housed individually in a 14-h light/10-h red light (Light Gard Light Tubes; Solar Graphics, Clearwater, FL) cycle at a constant temperature (23\u00b0C\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00b0C) and humidity (50%\u2009\u00b1\u200910%). White-light intensity at cage level was 48 lumens, and red-light intensity was 4 lumens. Food (Teklad 2919 irradiated; Envigo, Placentia, CA) and water (Innovive pre-filled acidified water; Innovive, San Diego, CA) were available\nad libitum\n. All cages contained a single water bottle, feed hopper, corncob bedding, and a nesting square, in accordance with standard procedures for the vivarium. Surgeries and injuries were performed at 12 d.p.c. for all dams. All mice that received surgeries and injuries received a welfare examination for the first 3 days after surgery. At birth, offspring were counted and sexed at weaning on post-natal day (PND) 21. Offspring were weaned into new cages with a maximum of 5 same-sex animals in one cage with no animals singly housed.\n\nMaternal gravida midline fluid percussion injury\nBecause of the potential effect of anesthesia on fetal development, all dams were subjected to the minimum amount of inhaled isoflurane to permit midline fluid percussion injury (mFPI) consistent with methods previously described.\n27\n,\n47\nBriefly, the dam was anesthetized using 5% isoflurane in 100% oxygen for 2\u2009min. The dam was then placed in a stereotaxic frame with continuously delivered isoflurane at 2.5% by a nose cone. Body temperature was maintained using a Deltaphase isothermal heating pad (Braintree Scientific Inc., Braintree, MA). A midline incision was made exposing the skull, and a 3-mm midline craniectomy was performed between the bregma and lambda using a trephining tool. A modified Luer lock hub was glued directly over the exposed intact dura and reinforced with cyanoacrylate gel and methylmethacrylate (Hygenic Corp., Akron, OH). The hub was filled with saline to ensure a complete seal. A cap made from a modified syringe tip was placed in the hub to prevent debris and air exposure. All surgeries were completed within 8\u2009min. Animals were placed in a heated recovery cage and monitored until ambulatory before they were returned to their individual home cage (\u223c10\u2009min).\nAfter 2\u2009h, dams were reanesthetized with 5% isoflurane delivered for 2\u2009min to prepare for TBI induction. The cap was removed, and the hub was visually inspected for debris and intact sinus and dura. The hub was then refilled with normal saline to create a single continuous line of fluid from the injury device to the intact dura. The dam was attached to the fluid percussion device (Custom Design and Fabrication; Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA) using extension tubing (#2C5643; Baxter, Deerfield, IL). Mice were positioned under the device, and a toe-pinch response was observed before the pendulum on the injury device was dropped from a pre-determined height. A fluid pressure pulse was delivered directly onto the dura to induce a diffuse brain injury. Hubs were removed immediately, and mice were placed on their side on a heating pad. Apnea and seizure-like activity were recorded. The brain was inspected for uniform herniation, bleeding, formation of hematoma, and dura damage. Animals were monitored for righting reflex recovery times as a metric of injury severity.\n27\n,\n47\nRighting reflex time was defined as the total time from the initial impact until the animal spontaneously righted itself from a lateral position.\nTBI mice in this study had a suppression of righting reflex time of 4\u20138\u2009min; sham mice were treated in the same manner without delivery of the injury. Suppression of the righting reflex in this time frame is associated with significant increases in central and peripheral inflammation, peripheral pathologies (e.g., lungs), and changes in acute sleep behavior and cognitive behavior.\n27\n,\n48\n,\n49\nSham animals spontaneously righted within 20\u2009sec; no shams were excluded for not righting within this time.\n\nWhole-cell patch clamp recording and laser scanning photostimulation cortical circuit mapping\nTo investigate the effects of gTBI on pre-frontal cortical neurons,\nex vivo\nsagittal brain slices were prepared from offspring as previously described\n50\u201352\nto quantify synaptic function and circuit connectivity. Mixed-sex mice were killed under isoflurane anesthesia. Brains were collected and sectioned in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing (in mM): 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 26 NaHCO\n3\n, 2 CaCl\n2\n, 1 MgCl\n2\n, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, and 10 glucose and saturated with 95% O\n2\nand 5% CO\n2\n. Slices were incubated at 32\u00b0C in aCSF for 30\u2009min, then kept at room temperature. Slices were transferred to a recording chamber and perfused with room temperature aCSF with 0.2\u2009mM of MNI-Caged glutamate (Tocris-Cookson, Bristol, UK). Neurons were visualized with a 60\u2009\u00d7\u2009water immersion objective (numerical aperture [NA], 0.9; Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and targeted for whole-cell patch clamp recordings. The glass patch electrode contained an internal solution (in mM): 130 K-gluconate, 4 KCl, 2 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 4 ATP-Mg, 0.3 GTP-Na, 1 ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, and 14 phosphocreatine (pH 7.2, 295\u2009mOsm). Upon obtaining whole-cell configuration, neurons were voltage clamped at \u221270\u2009mV.\nLaser scanning photostimulation (LSPS) mapping combined with glutamate uncaging was performed with a 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009objective lens (NA 0.16; Olympus) and 20-mW, 1-ms UV laser (355\u2009nm; DPSS Lasers, Santa Clara, CA) pulses. UV laser pulses were delivered onto slices in a 16\u2009\u00d7\u200916 stimulation grid with 100-\u03bcm spacing. The stimulation grid was aligned with the pial surface. Laser timing and power were controlled by an optic shutter (model 3050; Conoptics, Danbury, CT), a mechanical shutter (Unibliz\n\u00ae\nVCM-D1; Vincent Associates, Rochester, NY), and a neutral density filter (Edmund Optics, Barrington, NJ). Digital images were acquired using a charged-coupled device camera (Retiga 2000DC; Teledyne QImaging, Surrey, BC, Canada). Electrophysiological signals were amplified with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and acquired with 6259 data acquisition boards (National Instruments, Austin, TX) under control of open-source Ephus software. Signals were filtered at 2\u20134 KHz and digitized at 10\u2009kHz. Neuronal responses to laser uncaging were analyzed offline with MATLAB scripts (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA). For analysis,\nn\n=\u20092\u20135 cells per animal were used.\n\nBehavior assessment in offspring\nOpen field\nThe open field (OF) consisted of a square arena (70\u2009\u00d7\u200970\u2009cm) enclosed by white walls measuring 46\u2009cm in height. On the day of OF testing, mice were transported to the testing room and placed in individual cages to acclimate to the room. After 1\u2009h of acclimation, mice were placed in the OF and allowed to explore freely for 5\u2009min. Their movement was tracked by an overhead camera, and distance traveled, time spent in the center, and frequency were automatically calculated using EthoVision XT 10 Software (Noldus Information Technology, Leesburg, VA). One female control offspring, 1 male control offspring, and 1 female gTBI offspring were excluded for improper handling (unexpected challenges in handling juvenile mice) that were then associated with significant outliers in testing.\nNovel object recognition\nCognitive impairment was tested using the novel object recognition (NOR) task. The test consisted of three phases: habituation, training, and testing. On training day, mice were habituated to the OF, as described above, which also served as a measure of anxiety and locomotion. After OF, mice were removed from the arena, and two identical objects were placed equidistant from two corners diagonal to each other in the individual testing cages. Mice were then placed in the testing cages and allowed to explore the objects for 5\u2009min. After 5\u2009min, mice were removed from the arena and returned to their home cage for 3\u2009min while the objects were thoroughly cleaned using quatricide\n\u00ae\n. During this time, one object from the previous trial was replaced with a novel object of similar size, but distinctly different in color and shape. Then, mice were reintroduced to the testing cage and were allowed to explore the objects for 5\u2009min.\nFor the training and testing trials, time spent exploring each object was quantified, with exploration consisting of mice sniffing, touching, or directing their head toward the objects. During training and testing trials, mice were required to spend a minimum of 10\u2009sec of exploring both objects combined; if this time was not met, the mouse was excluded from analysis. Animals excluded for analysis at PND28 NOR testing are as follows: 2 female control offspring, 1 male control offspring, 3 female gTBI offspring, and 1 male gTBI offspring. Animals excluded for analysis at PND53 NOR testing are as follows: 1 female control offspring, 2 male control offspring. Time spent exploring the objects was calculated by detecting the nose of the animal in the defined sniffing zones adjacent to the objects using EthoVision XT 10 Software (Noldus Information Technology). Discrimination index bounded between 1 and \u22121 was calculated as follows:\nElevated plus maze\nThe elevated plus maze (EPM) consisted of four elevated (50\u2009cm) perpendicular arms (50\u2009cm long, 10\u2009cm wide) with two opposing arms containing 30-cm-high opaque walls. EPM testing occurred in the same room as OF and NOR. Two EPMs were spaced 30\u2009cm apart and positioned so that the open arms of one EPM faced the closed arms of the other EPM, so that mice tested concurrently were not visible to each other. On the days of EPM testing, mice were transported on a cart from the housing room and set outside of the testing room until 15\u2009min before they were tested. Mice were brought into the testing room one cage at a time. Each mouse was placed in a closed arm, facing the center of the platform, and given 5\u2009min to explore the EPM. After 5\u2009min elapsed, mice were returned to their home cage. The EPM was cleaned thoroughly between each mouse with quatricide to eliminate odors. EPM performance was recorded and scored using EthoVision XT Software (Noldus Information Technology). One female control offspring, 1 male control offspring, and 1 female gTBI offspring were excluded for improper handling that were then associated with significant outliers in testing at both time points. Additionally, 1 male gTBI offspring was excluded from EPM analysis at PND54.\nTail suspension test\nAll offspring mice were tested on the tail suspension test (TST) between PND41 and PND42 to assess depressive-like behavior. The tail of an individual mouse was affixed with laboratory tape to a horizontal beam suspended 20\u2009cm from the surface of a table. The beam was divided at 15-cm intervals with a large black Plexiglas divider to block the sight of other mice. Once a mouse was affixed to the beam, video recording was started, and behavior was recorded for 5\u2009min. The amount of time spent immobile was scored by two independent experimenters blind to the treatment conditions. The first minute was excluded from all analyses as an acclimation phase.\nForced swim test\nThe forced swim test (FST) procedure for the mice was similar to that previously described.\n53\n,\n54\nMice were placed in one of four cylindrical tanks (3000-mL beakers, 30\u2009\u00d7\u200920\u2009cm) filled with room-temperature (23\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C) water at a depth of 15\u2009cm. The water was deep enough so that a mouse could not touch the bottom of the container with either its hindlimbs or tail. Four mice were tested simultaneously, and the four cylindrical tanks were separated by opaque dividers, which made mice not visible to each other. One swim session was conducted for each mouse between PND55 and PND56. A mouse was placed in the water for 5\u2009min and recorded using EthoVision XT Software (Noldus Information Technology). Videos were scored for the time spent swimming and time spent immobile by two independent experimenters who were blinded to treatment conditions.\n\nBlood collection and corticosterone levels\nAll blood was collected by submandibular vein in BD Microtainer\n\u00ae\nMAP Microtubes coated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Blood draws occurred within 15\u2009min of TST and FST. Collected blood was separated to have 50\u201375\u2009\u03bcL for plasma corticosterone levels and 100\u2009\u03bcL for flow cytometry. Blood was spun at 2400\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C to separate plasma. Plasma corticosterone levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; ADI-900-097; Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY) in triplicate. Plasma samples were warmed to room temperature (23\u00b0C) for 30\u2009min and diluted 1:40 with ELISA buffer. Plates were read at a 405-nm wavelength on a plate reader (EPOCH Microplate Spectrophotometer with Gen5 software; Biotek Instruments, Winooski, VT). Mean optical density of blank wells from the plate was subtracted from all readings and averaged between triplicate values. This average level for each animal was used for analysis. Insufficient plasma was collected from 1 female control and therefore excluded from corticosterone measurement.\n\nFlow cytometry\nFor flow cytometry, 100\u2009\u03bcL of fresh, whole blood was immediately blocked with Fc block (1:500) for 10\u2009min and then incubated in the following antibodies: cluster of differentiation 45 (CD45; code, 103112; 1:200; BioLegend, San Diego, CA); cluster of differentiation 11b (CD11b; code, 101208; 1:200; BioLegend); lysine 6C (Ly6C; code, 128033; 1:100; BioLegend); and lysine 6G (Ly6G; code, 127624; 1:200; BioLegend). Blood was then lysed and washed with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009Hanks balanced buffer solution treated with 0.5\u2009g of bovine serum albumin, 25\u2009mM of HEPES, and 0.05% sodium azide). 7-Aminoactinomycin D was used as a viability dye. At tissue harvest, spleens were processed through a 70-\u03bcm filter with 10\u2009mL of FACS buffer; 100\u2009\u03bcL was then collected, blocked, stained, and lysed as described for whole blood. All samples were run immediately after processing to insure a cell viability rate of >90%.\nBD FACSCanto II (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) was used to run and analyze all blood and spleen samples. Examples of the gating strategy for blood are shown in\nFigures 5I\nand\n\u200b\nand6E\n6E\nand spleen in\nFigure 7A\n. Briefly, 80,000 CD45\n+\nevents were collected, and all dead cells were gated out. Then, CD45\n+\nevents were gated on CD11b\n+\nevents as innate immune cells. Cells were gated on Ly6C and Ly6G to identify monocyte and neutrophil populations, respectively. Events of interest are reported as percent of the population for each cell type. One female control offspring was excluded from terminal spleen and blood analysis as a technical failure.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 5.\nDepressive-like behaviors, immune responses (blood immune cells), and physiological stress (plasma corticosterone) were measured at post-natal day (PND) 42 and PND58. For the tail suspension test (TST) at PND42, (\nA\n) immobility during minute 2 and (\nB\n) total inactivity showed no effects of gTBI or sex (\nn\n=\u200919 for male control,\nn\n=\u200917 for male gTBI,\nn\n=\u200919 for female control, and\nn\n=\u200917 for female gTBI). For the forced swim test (FST) at PND58, (\nC\n) immobility during minute 2 and (\nD\n) total immobility time were recorded (\nn\n=\u200919 for male control,\nn\n=\u200917 for male gTBI,\nn\n=\u200919 for female control, and\nn\n=\u200917 female gTBI). To evaluate the physiological immune response to depressive-like behavior testing, flow cytometry was used to quantify blood monocytes and neutrophils as shown in the (\nE\n) gating strategy measured by flow.

Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathology. Mucosal and muscle thickness were measured (\u03bcm) using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Images were acquired on a Zeiss AXIOImager M2 epifluorescent microscope in bright field (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Thornwood, NY).\n\nStatistical analysis\nA priori\npower analysis indicated that a sample size of\nn\n=\u200912 per group (sham offspring, gTBI offpsring) was required for a statistical power of 80% for behavioral outcomes. And yet, these power estimation analyses were based on unknown effect sizes for gTBI offspring, which led to an approach to include all mice born to 12 dams. Results from analyses using GraphPad Prism software (version 6; GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA) are shown as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean, with statistical significance assigned at the 95% confidence level (\u03b1 < 0.05). Litter sizes and cell outputs for LSPS were analyzed using a two-tailed unpaired\nt\n-test. Gut histology and LSPS with glutamate uncaging input were analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Sidak's multiple comparison to compare muscle and mucosal layers and cortical bin depths (1\u201316), respectively. Sex differences in weaning weight, behavior, and flow cytometry analysis were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's multiple-comparisons test. Resulting test values are included in the\nResults\nsection, where main effects of TBI and sex and interaction are reported. Between-group significant differences (\np\n<\u20090.05) after\npost hoc\ntesting (adjusted\np\nvalue,\nq\n<\u20090.05) are indicated by an asterisk between groups.\nSignificant main effects are distinguished by asterisks above gTBI groups (for a main effect of gTBI) and male/female groups (for a main effect of sex) when\npost hoc\ntests between individual groups were not significant. Significant interactions with no significant main effects of sex or gTBI are indicated with a plus sign (+) in the figures. Grubb's test with alpha\u2009=\u20090.05 was used to determine outliers, and significant outliers were excluded as follows: 1 female control offspring was excluded from OF at PND28 in the latency and total entries analyses; 1 male gTBI offspring, 1 female control offspring, and 1 female gTBI offspring were excluded from post-LPS OF in the latency analysis.\n\nData availability statement\nData can be provided upon reasonable request to the corresponding author."

    "Methods": "Study design and participants\nIn this retrospective observational study, all patients presenting to a single level 1 trauma center from October 2015 through September 2020 were screened for incident SDH presentations using discharge diagnosis codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (S06.5, I62.0). These codes have been previously validated and reliably identify patients with SDHs of all radiological acuities.\n17\nFrom these incident SDH cases, we identified all cases that met the following inclusion criteria: 1) age >18 and 2) availability of MRI data within 2 weeks of SDH symptom onset. Patients who experienced acute symptomatic expansion of a previously diagnosed SDH were also included. Patients were enrolled based upon clinical time of symptom onset irrespective of radiological SDH characteristics. Patients with potential neoplasms, infections, post-operative subdural collections, or hemorrhages from arteriovenous malformations/aneurysms were excluded. Patients who underwent surgery with any significant manipulation of the cortex (e.g., clot extractions) were also excluded. Surgical decision making and medical management were at the discretion of the treating neurosurgeon.\nAll MRIs were obtained for clinical purposes at the discretion of the treating physician; at our institution, MRIs are typically obtained for the purpose of prognostication or evaluation of focal neurological deficits. This study was approved by the local institutional review board at the University of Cincinnati (Cincinnati, OH) with a waiver from informed consent.\n\nData abstraction\nFor all identified patients, an electronic standardized case report form was used to collect clinical data, including demographics, labs, medical history, initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores, neurological examination findings, surgical management/timing, and hospital complications including seizures. Data were abstracted by a single reviewer (D.R.), and 10% of data were double-abstracted by a second reviewer to confirm accuracy of the process. Initial computed tomography (CT) imaging was reviewed for all patients in order to calculate SDH volume\n18\nand assess the radiological characteristics of the SDHs in a standardized fashion as acute (homogeneous and hyperdense on the initial CT) versus all other SDHs (including subacute, mixed density, or chronic radiological characteristics). Basal cisterns were graded as either effaced (including both complete and partial effacement) or not effaced. Midline shift was assessed at the level of the septum pellucidum. Data from clinically obtained CT angiograms within 4 weeks on incident SDH were abstracted where available. For patients without dedicated vascular imaging, MRI T2 flow voids were examined to rule out significant proximal vasospasm. Modified Rankin scales at 3 months were determined by chart review and were available for all but 1 patient.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging data\nAll MRIs were performed on 1.5 Tesla systems (GE Optima MR450W, GE Signa Explorer, or GE Signa HDxt; GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL). All images were initially reviewed by a neuroradiologist. Imaging reports were reviewed for all patients and marked for any occurrence of the following phrases: \u201crestricted diffusion\u201d; \u201cacute ischemia\u201d; or \u201chyperintense signal on diffusion-weighted imaging.\u201d Images for all MRIs that were identified by the above method were then directly reviewed by a board-certified neurologist (D.R.) to further adjudicate and characterize the cytotoxic edema. Equivocal cases were reviewed by a second neurologist (B.F.), and disagreements were resolved by discussion. The following sequences were reviewed for all patients: T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (T2 FLAIR); diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI); apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC); and either gradient echo (GRE) or susceptibility-weighted angiography (SWAN). Cytotoxic edema was defined as brain parenchyma that was bright on DWI and dark on ADC.\n15\nFLAIR and GRE/SWAN sequences were used to evaluate for vasogenic edema and hemorrhage, respectively.\nTo be considered SDH-related cytotoxic edema, patients could not have an alternative explanation for the identified cytotoxic edema (e.g., stroke from cardioembolism, blunt cerebrovascular injury, or large-vessel vasospasm, based on chart review). We also excluded patients with extensive intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the region of the cytotoxic edema that could confound interpretation.\n19\nFinally, we excluded any patients with cytotoxic edema in a pattern consistent with diffuse axonal injury (i.e., punctate lesions at the gray-white border or multi-focal lesions in the deep white matter with associated hemorrhage).\n20\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics are provided using median (interquartile range; IQR) for all continuous variables (and GCS), whereas categorical data are presented as number (percentage). Continuous variables were compared using Wilcoxon's rank-sum test, and Fisher's exact test was used for categorical data considering the small sample size. All statistical analyses were conducted in R (version 4.0.2; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). A\np\nvalue of 0.05 was used as the threshold for significance."

    "Methods": "Participants\nWe performed secondary data analyses of participants with moderate-to-severe TBI who were enrolled in the randomized clinical trial of magnesium sulfate performed at Harborview Medical Center (Seattle, WA) between August 1998 and October 2004. This secondary analysis project was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Medical College of Wisconsin. The trial (N\u2009=\u2009499) showed no positive effect of the magnesium sulfate intervention on outcomes, but the authors found a negative effect of treatment in the lower-dosage group.\n16\nFor this original study, participants were required to meet one or more of the following inclusion criteria: post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)\n16\nscore of 3\u201312; if intubated, a GCS motor score of 1\u20135 without pharmacological paralysis; intracranial surgery within 8\u2009h of injury. Participants who were less than 14 years old, unable to receive the study drug within 8\u2009h of injury, who had serum creatinine concentrations greater than 177\u2009\u03bcmol/L (i.e., 2\u2009mg/dL), were pregnant, a prisoner, or who were living overseas were excluded from the study.\nGiven the focus of the present study on six-month functional limitations/disability, we analyzed data from the subset of individuals (\nn\n=\u2009357) who were living and had data on the GOSE and/or the FSE at this time point. Of these 357 individuals with some outcome data, 355 had six-month GOSE scores and 342 subjects had one or more FSE interviews (42 self-reported FSEs only, 68 other-reported FSEs, and 232 with both self- and significant other-reported FSEs). The total sample size was 357 because two individuals completed the FSE but not the GOSE.\n\nOutcome assessment\nAs described in other reports from this clinical trial,\n12\n,\n16\n,\n17\nparticipants completed the GOSE using the recommended interview guidelines at this time.\n2\nIn particular, questions about independence in and outside the home, work/school functioning, social functioning, psychological and relationship functioning, and other functional limitations were included, and the interview terminated if subjects reported impairment that rendered follow-up questions unable to affect the overall score rating (which is customarily assigned to reflect the highest level of impairment across life domains). The use of these hierarchical skip-out rules in the interview precluded consideration of question-level data for the present study.\nParticipants were rated on an 8-point ordinal scale: 1\u2009=\u2009Death, 2\u2009=\u2009Vegetative State, 3\u2009=\u2009Lower Severe Disability, 4\u2009=\u2009Upper Severe Disability, 5\u2009=\u2009Lower Moderate Disability, 6\u2009=\u2009Upper Moderate Disability, 7\u2009=\u2009Lower Good Recovery, and 8\u2009=\u2009Upper Good Recovery. The present study focused on outcome data collected at six months post-injury, because this aligned with the primary time point of FSE collection.\nThe FSE structured interview was conducted with patient participants and/or their significant others at six months post-injury. Significant others (close family members or friends) were interviewed separately from patients. The clinical trial used the original version of the FSE interview, which contained 10 subsections: Personal Care, Mobility/Ambulation, Mobility/Travel, Primary Activity (among work and school), Home Management, Leisure and Recreation, Social Integration, Cognitive & Behavioral Competency, Standard of Living, and Financial Independence. Because the latter three domains were not retained in revisions of the instrument by its author, these domains were not included in the present analysis.\n18\nEach subsection is rated on a 4-point scale from 0 (same level of participation as before injury) to 3 (complete or nearly complete reliance on others to participate, or inability to participant in the activity); these scores are summed to produce a total score reflecting the degree of injury-related functional impairment (range 0\u201321). (Deaths were coded as 22 in the clinical trial but not included in the current article given our focus on disability.) Both the FSE and GOSE ratings included in the present analysis included injury-related functional limitations irrespective of whether their cause was TBI or other concurrent injuries.\n\nData analyses\nWe performed preliminary analyses using Mplus version 8.5 to confirm the data met assumptions of the IRT model. In particular, factor analyses (described further in the Results) were used to confirm that the combined set of FSE items and the GOSE overall score could be interpreted as measuring a shared construct of functional limitations and that the item set was sufficiently unidimensional to meet assumptions of a unidimensional IRT model. Exploratory (EFA) and conformational factor analyses (CFA) were performed, treating the data as ordinal using diagonally weighted least squares estimation (WLSMV).\nNext, we conducted the primary IRT analyses using IRTPRO version 4.2. Using all available outcome data (even in cases with one of two measures missing) was considered optimal because the modeling approach accommodates missing data using full-information maximum likelihood estimation, which is robust to missing-at-random data and therefore superior to listwise deletion. IRT modeling allows one to use responses on a test (or interview, in this case) to model an unobserved (latent) continuum (i.e., functional limitations) and then estimate the relationship between individual test responses and the latent continuum. The model produces parameter estimates for each item that characterize the level of functional limitations (i.e., item difficulty; called\nb\n) assessed by the item and how strongly the item is associated with functional limitations at that level of severity (item discrimination; called\na\n).\nEach item produced multiple difficulty estimates (thresholds), one for each step up from one response option to the next (e.g., three thresholds for FSE items, corresponding to the step up from 0 to 1, 1 to 2, and 2 to 3). For the current article, we were interested in combining these parameters into a measure of test information, which reflects the degree to which the FSE and GOSE measure individual differences in functional limitations as detailed further in the Results.\nIn summary, we fit a unidimensional graded response IRT model (N\u2009=\u2009357) to the combined set of the seven FSE items and the GOSE ordinal overall score. Given our interest in modeling injury-related disability, all individuals included in analyses had a GOSE score of 2 or higher. For subjects with more than one FSE at six months post-injury, we used the self-reported version (274 of 342 FSEs), whereas we included the significant other report when patient report was unavailable (68 of 342 FSEs). The GOSE interviews were conducted only once; similar to the FSE, about 79% of GOSE interviews included the patient.\nSecond, we performed DIF analysis on the FSE data to determine whether there are differences in the functioning (IRT parameters of difficulty and discrimination) between self-report and significant other-reported FSEs. For this analysis, we fit a new unidimensional IRT model using only the seven FSE items alongside a group variable that specified the interviewee (patient or significant other). Because self-report is only possible for individuals with GOSE 3\u20138, DIF analyses were necessarily restricted to individuals in this score range (\nn\n=\u2009332). To meet assumptions of independent cases for the group variable, in cases with both a patient and other-reported FSE, we randomly selected one to include in analysis.\nWald tests were conducted to test each item for DIF, treating all other items as anchor items presumed to be DIF-free. An omnibus Wald test evaluated the item for both difficulty and discrimination DIF in a single step; a nonsignificant Wald chi-square test indicates that there is no DIF by respondent."

    "Methods": "Participants\nParticipants were a subset of enrollees in the Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems (TBIMS), a multi-center, longitudinal cohort of individuals who receive inpatient rehabilitation for TBI.\n28\nInclusion criteria for enrollment in TBIMS are age 16 or older, acute care in a TBIMS-affiliated trauma center within 72\u2009h of injury, and transfer to an inpatient TBIMS rehabilitation unit within 72\u2009h of discharge from acute care. Enrollees have a penetrating or non-penetrating TBI with at least one of the following characteristics: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score <13 on emergency admission (not due to intubation, sedation or intoxication); loss of consciousness (LOC) >30\u2009min; post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) >24\u2009h; or trauma related intracranial abnormality on neuroimaging. Research assessments are conducted at enrollment and at Years 1, 2, and 5, and every 5 years post-TBI thereafter. Each site maintains institutional review board approval.\nParticipants were included in the analyses if they had completed a follow-up interview at either the Year 2 or 10 follow-up interval within the 10 years spanning from March 2009 to September 2019. This range was chosen so that each participant would contribute follow-up data for either the Year 2 or 10 interval, but not both. Hence, we arrived at a sample that represented two levels of injury chronicity, with participants belonging to either the Year 2 or 10 cohort. The flow diagram for the analytic cohort is provided in\nFigure 1\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nFlow diagram of analytic cohort.\n\nProcedures\nInformed consent was provided by either the participant or a legally authorized representative. Demographic and social history data were gathered from interviews conducted during the inpatient rehabilitation stay with the participant or a relative. Outcome data were gathered primarily via telephone interview at 1 year \u00b12 months, 2 years \u00b13 months, and 10 years \u00b16 months post-injury, following a standardized protocol.\n\nMeasures\nDemographic data included age, gender, race/ethnicity, employment, and education. Primary payor of rehabilitation services was recorded as a marker of socioeconomic status. Injury characteristics were abstracted from medical records. Duration of PTA, a sensitive index of the severity of neurologic injury, was calculated as the number of days between the TBI and the first of two occasions within 72\u2009h that the participant was fully oriented. Orientation was defined as a score above 75 on the Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test,\n29\na score above 24 on the Orientation Log,\n30\nor documentation in the acute medical record of consistent orientation over a 72-h period. For patients who were discharged from inpatient rehabilitation while still in PTA, the exact duration of PTA was unavailable and therefore was estimated by adding 1 day to the interval between injury and rehabilitation discharge. An additional index of injury severity, Time to Follow Commands, was defined as the number of days from injury to the ability to follow simple commands on two consecutive occasions within 24\u2009h.\nOutcome measures included the Functional Independence Measure (FIM),\n31\nDisability Rating Scale (DRS),\n32\nand the PART-O.\n33\nThe FIM is an 18-item measure of independence in self-care, mobility, communication, and cognition with Motor and Cognitive subscales.\n34\nWe used the Rasch-transformed FIM Motor and Cognitive subscales for the primary analyses because of their linear properties. The DRS is a TBI-specific rating scale of global outcome ranging from vegetative state\u2009=\u200929 to complete independence in the home setting and full employability in the community\u2009=\u20090. The FIM and DRS have been validated extensively in TBI and are endorsed as Common Data Elements for measuring TBI outcome.\n35\nThe PART-O was examined as a measure of community participation. PART-O was developed by TBIMS collaborators, initially validated on a sample of 400 persons with TBI\n33\nand has been further explored in both disabled and nondisabled samples.\n8\n,\n36\nPART-O scoring is based on the mean item scores in each of three domains\u2014productivity, community activity (\u201cout and about\u201d), and social relations. The present study used PART-O Average Total Score, which is calculated as the mean of the three domain scores.\n\nStatistical analysis\nWe compared demographic, injury, and clinical characteristics between Years 2 and 10 follow-up groups. We considered standardized differences greater than 0.10 to be meaningful, and performed exact 1:1 matching without replacement on five variables within a range of specified values: age (\u00b1 1 year); education (greater than high school [HS]/less than HS); GCS total at admission (\u00b1 1); FIM Motor at rehabilitation discharge (\u00b1 12); and DRS at year 1 (\u00b1 4). Although the standardized difference for age at follow-up was less than 0.10, we included it as a matching factor given the centrality of age at follow-up to our research question. Standardized differences were calculated post-matching to ensure balance between Years 2 and 10 groups on potential confounding variables.\n37\nWe plotted age by the four outcome measures by Years 2 and 10 follow-up groups (\nFig. 2A\n-D) and observed that at approximately age 75 there was a decline in the magnitude of association between age and outcome. Based on this, we created a categorical variable for age, less than 75 years versus 75 years and older, which we formally tested in an interaction term with follow-up group. We used a series of linear mixed-effects models for each of the four outcome measures, while considering matched pairs as a random effect to minimize confounding due to imbalance between groups. This model included a fixed effect for the age group, follow-up group, and the interaction between the two measures. It was further adjusted for sex. Differences and standard errors (SEs) for each of the follow-up groups (e.g., Year 2 and Year 10) and age groups were reported separately for each level of the age groups and follow-up groups, respectively.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nAge at 2- and 10-year follow-up and global, cognitive, motor, and community participation outcomes."

    "Methods": "Mice\nThe University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved the experiments. One hundred forty-two adult (12- to 15-week-old) male and female mice with global\nAbcc8\nknocked out on a C57/BL6J background were used with heterozygote and wild-type littermates.\n33\nMice were given food and water\nad libitum\n, group housed (12-h day-night cycles) until injury, and single housed thereafter.\n\nInjury\nMice underwent a controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of moderate-severe TBI.\n2\nBriefly, mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane in a 2:1\u2009N\n2\nO/O\n2\ngas mixture and placed in a stereotactic frame (Kopf, Tujunga, CA). A left scalp incision was made. A dental drill was used to make a 5-mm craniotomy over the left parietal cortex, and the bone flap was removed. CCI was performed with a pneumatic impactor (Bimba, Monee, IL) with a flat 3-mm tipped impounder on the left parietal cortex (5\u2009m/s, depth\u2009=\u20091.2\u2009mm, dwell time\u2009=\u200950\u201360\u2009ms). Mice recovered in a temperature-controlled chamber before returning to their cage. Na\u00efve mice were euthanized at 12\u201315 weeks without injury.\n\nHistological volumetric analyses\nContusion volume (CV) and brain hemisphere (right hemisphere volume [RHV] and left hemisphere volume [LHV]) volumes were measured as previously described (\nSupplementary Methods\n).\n34\nTotal brain volume (TBV) was also calculated (RHV + LHV). Normalized values for each parameter in injured mice were calculated as a percentage of the corresponding mean hemisphere or mean total brain volume for sex- and genotype-matched na\u00efve mice (e.g., normalized CV\nmale,KO\n[nCV\nmale,KO\n]\u2009=\u2009CV\ninjured,male,KO\n/LHV\nnaive,male,KO\n). We normalized to na\u00efve volumes, rather than right (contralateral) hemisphere volume of the same mouse, because right hemisphere atrophy after injury was disproportionate across genotype and sex (\nTable 1\n).

Transfections were performed by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), unless otherwise indicated. Colonies that survived in a medium containing 0.2\u2009mg/mL of hygromycin B were selected, and SRY expression was confirmed by immunoblot analysis.\n\nLuciferase promotor assay\nSRY-stimulated activity of the promotor region of\nAbcc8\nwas determined using luciferase reporter plasmids (\nSupplementary Methods\n).\n36\nCOS-7 cells were transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids containing rat\nAbcc8\nor\nFra1\npromoter, and expression was compared with cells transfected with chicken \u03b2-actin promoter-driven luciferase. Photinus luciferase reporter plasmids (pGL3-basic; Promega, Madison, WI), containing the rat\nAbcc8\npromoter (\u2212578 to +80) or rat FOS-like antigen 1 (\nFra1\n) promotor (\u2212878 to +61), were transfected into COS-7 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).\nFra1\nwas used as a positive control for SRY-driven expression.\n37\nCotransfection of pRL-CMV, Renilla luciferase expression plasmid was a control for transfection efficiency. After transfection, cells were maintained in basal conditions for 24\u2009h, then transfected with either rat SRY, human SRY, or empty vector. Photinus and Renilla luciferases activity in extracts of transfected cells were measured using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Values of luciferase activity with SRY were divided by those from empty vector transfection to obtain fold-induction.\n38\n\nElectrophoretic mobility shift assay\nWe measured the effect of SRY on the K\nd\nvalue of binding of Sp1 to the 22-bp-long cis-regulatory element by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA;\nSupplementary Methods\n).\n32\nTo measure DNA binding activity of Sp1 to the putative binding sites in the\nAbcc8\npromoter region, we used a biotinylated double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide probe containing the Sp1 binding sites (5\u2019-GTGGGGGCGGGGCGGGGCGGGCCT-3\u2019). Lysates from COS-7 cells transfected with two expression vectors driving expression of SRY and Sp1 or Sp1 and control empty vector were incubated with the biotinylated DNA fragments for 20\u2009min at 25\u00b0C. To examine the DNA binding activity of Sp1 in high salt concentration, additional sodium chloride was added to the reaction mixture as indicated. Biotinylated DNA oligonucleotides on the membrane were detected by a chemiluminescent nucleic acid detection module kit (ThermoFisherScientific, Waltham, MA), and the images were processed by using commercial imaging software (FUJIFILM Life Science, Cambridge, MA.\n\nRNA isolation and real-time polymerase chain reaction\nDetermination of the relative abundance of\nAbcc8\nmessenger RNA (mRNA) in bEnd.3 cells transfected with either empty vector or SRY was performed as previously described (\nSupplementary Methods\n).\n31\nTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was further purified with Amplification Grade DNase I (Invitrogen). Complementary DNA was synthesized from 1\u2009\u03bcg of total RNA of each sample using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Abundance of\nAbcc8\nmRNA in samples was determined by real-time PCR (ABI PRISM 7300; Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) and normalized to\nS18\n.\nFra1\nand vascular endothelial growth factor (\nVegf\n) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively, of SRY-driven expression.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThis study was powered (0.8) to detect a difference in CV between wild-type and knockout mice in analyses stratified by sex with\nn\n=\u200912 mice per group for each sex and genotype (\nSupplementary Methods\n). An additional 12 heterozygous mice were used for secondary analyses of how the number of alleles knocked out affects outcome. An equal number of na\u00efve mice of the same sex and genotypes and similar age (12\u201315 weeks) were tested. Data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD). Associations between sex, genotype, and histological lesions were assessed with multi-variable linear regression models (\nSupplementary Methods\n). Primary models included two-level genotypes (wild-type and knockout), sex, and injury status (for LHV, RHV, and TBV) or only injured mice (for CV). Secondary analyses for the association between number of alleles knocked out and histological outcome (including heterozygous mice) were performed using a Wilcoxon-type non-parametric test of trend across genotypes.\n39\nUse of regression models was\na priori\nselected over multiple independent\nt\n-tests. Our large sample size of 142 mice allowed for the use of regression models including sex and genotype as covariates to address the research questions of interest without model overfitting. Alpha was set at 0.05 for initial regression Wald tests for genotype, 0.025 for\npost hoc\nanalyses stratified by sex, and 0.0125 for\npost hoc\nanalyses stratified by both sex and injury (Bonferroni). All analysis was performed with Stata software (version 16.1; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX)."

    "Methods": "Study population\nWe studied 33 hospitalized adults with TBI who presented to Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, the level 1 trauma center of the University of Pennsylvania, within 24\u2009h of injury and were able to undergo 3 Tesla (T) MRI scanning at \u223c2 weeks post-injury. TBI participants were included if they sustained a non-penetrating traumatic impact to the head, presented with symptoms consistent with TBI as defined by the Department of Defense,\n24\nand required hospitalization. All participants had GCS scores between 13 and 15, but required hospitalization because of their TBI. Accordingly, >80% of TBI participants had findings on head computed tomography (CT). Participants were excluded if they had a history of pre-existing serious neurological or psychiatric disease, comorbid disabling condition limiting outcome assessment, current pregnancy, or were incarcerated. For participants unable to provide informed consent, consent was obtained from a legally authorized representative. Healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled if they had no history of TBI, pre-existing disabling neurological or psychiatric disorders, or current pregnancy. The protocol was approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board.\nOf 33 acute TBI participants, 19 had clinical outcome data collected in the chronic phase (6 months post-injury), including 13 who underwent a second scan in the chronic phase. Additionally, 3 participants were scanned only in the chronic phase, of which 2 were identified to meet study inclusion criteria during clinical visits and 1 was unable to complete their acute scan. We included 18 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers as an HC group.\n\nClinical data collection\nDemographic information, medical history, admission injury characteristics, and other clinical information were collected from hospital chart review and personal interview, when needed, for all participants. Outcome measures, including Glasgow Outcome Score-Extended (GOSE)\n25\nand Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire (RPQ)\n26\nscore, were collected 6 months post-injury using in-person, structured interviews. GOSE was measured based on disability attributable to TBI.\n\nImage acquisition\nParticipants underwent brain MRI on a 3T scanner (Siemens Prisma; Siemens, Elangen, Germany) in the acute (2 weeks post-injury) and/or chronic (6 months post-injury) phase of injury. MRI included the following structural sequences: high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and susceptibility-weighted imaging. Background-suppressed ASL was acquired using a pseudo-continuous labeling scheme along with a 3D spiral readout with the following sequence parameters: repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u20094.2\u2009sec, echo time\u2009=\u200910.03\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200990 degrees, resolution\u2009=\u20093.75\u2009mm\n3\nisotropic, field of view\u2009=\u2009240\u2009\u00d7\u2009240\u2009mm, matrix\u2009=\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200964, bandwidth\u2009=\u2009400\u2009Hz/px, labeling time (\u03c4) 1.8\u2009sec, post-label delay 1.8\u2009sec, and 18 label-control pairs. The labeling plane was placed perpendicular to the straight segments of the cervical carotid and vertebral arteries based on time-of-flight angiography. Two unlabeled M0 images with TR\u2009=\u20096\u2009sec and without background suppression were acquired and averaged for use in CBF quantification. All MRI examinations received clinical interpretation by a board-certified subspecialist neuroradiologist, who identified the presence and location of any focal anatomical TBI-related abnormalities.\n\nImage processing\nASL data were post-processed using the BASIL\n27\ntoolbox in FSL,\n28\nwhich included motion correction of the raw label-control images, pair-wise label-control subtraction, division of each subtraction image by the mean M0 image, and application of the recommended model\n29\n(Eq. 1) to create a CBF time series using the following parameters: labeling efficiency (\u03b1) 85%; T1\nblood\n1.65\u2009sec; and brain/blood partition coefficient (\u03bb) 0.9\u2009mL/g. A final denoised absolute CBF map was obtained by excluding degraded CBF time points using the structural correlation outlier rejection method and averaging across retained CBF time points.\n31\nThe final CBF maps were visually reviewed by a neuroradiologist to ensure data quality and assess for transit time artifact. Five subjects (2 acute, 1 chronic, and 2 controls) had scans with poor data quality, were excluded from analysis, and are not included in data reported here.\nStructural images were used to create a population-specific anatomical template using the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs),\n30\nwhich was downsampled to a resolution of 2\u2009mm\n3\nto better match the resolution of ASL data, thereby reducing multiple comparisons in subsequent voxel-based CBF analysis and reducing the magnitude of CBF data interpolation during coregistration. The FSL boundary-based registration tool was used to compute a linear registration between each participant's structural image and the mean of the ASL time series, and structural images were normalized to the template using the ANTs symmetrical diffeomorphic registration tool (SyN) with B-spline interpolation.\n31\nFor tissue-level analysis, global (whole brain), gray matter, and white matter CBF were extracted in structural image space using masks created from the ANTs structural image segmentation, and tissue-based masks were visually reviewed for adequate gray matter/white matter classification. For voxel-based analysis, relative CBF (rCBF) maps were created for each participant by normalizing to the mean gray matter CBF. Each subject's rCBF map was registered to the 2-mm\n3\ntemplate using a single subject-specific transformation obtained from concatenating the ASL-to-T1 registration matrix with the T1-to-template warp field.\nz\n-score maps for each TBI participant were created in template space relative to the voxel-based mean and standard deviation of the pooled rCBF data from all controls.\nz\n-score maps for each control participant were created using the leave-one-out approach,\n32\nexcluding that participant's data from the pooled rCBF data. Voxels with\nz\n-score \u22652.5 were identified as abnormally hyperperfused, whereas voxels with\nz\n-score \u2264\u20132.5 were identified as abnormally hypoperfused. The\nz\n-score threshold of \u00b12.5 was chosen based on maximization of the observed effect size (Cohen's\nd\n) in discriminating TBI participants from controls\n33\n(\nd\n=\u20093.0 for hypoperfusion,\nd\n=\u2009\u22122.9 for hyperperfusion). A cluster size threshold of five contiguous voxels (40\u2009mm\n3\n) was also imposed to reduce spurious extrema.\nTotal number and volume of abnormally hypo- and hyperperfused clusters were extracted using FSL and used in subsequent analysis. In TBI participants scanned longitudinally, mean rCBF within hypo- and hyperperfused clusters, based on the acute scan, was calculated. The same regions were identified in the chronic scan in order to assess change in mean rCBF within these clusters from the acute to chronic phase of injury.\n\nStatistical analysis\nGlobal, gray matter, and white matter mean CBF were compared between acute and chronic TBI participants and HCs. Number and volume of hypo- and hyperperfused clusters were also compared between acute and chronic TBI participants and HCs. In TBI participants scanned longitudinally, tissue- and voxel-based measures of CBF were compared between the 2-week and 6-month time points. Group-level comparisons were performed using Mann-Whitney U tests, and longitudinal comparisons were performed using mixed-effects linear modeling, covaried for age and years of education. In the models, time was treated as a continuous variable, and all models included a random intercept. Model fit was assessed using Q-Q and residual plots. Associations between CBF measures and clinical outcomes were assessed using unpaired\nt\n-tests, comparing participants with complete (GOSE-TBI\u2009=\u20098) and incomplete (GOSE-TBI <8) recovery and comparing participants with total RPQ score above and below the median. Clinical outcomes data were dichotomized because of small sample size and variability in measurements. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad (Mann-Whitney U tests; GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA) and R software (the\nlme4\npackage was used for mixed-effects linear modeling; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)."

    "Methods": "Animals and surgical procedures\nStudies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Pittsburgh. Adult male C57BL6/J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME), single housed with access to standard rodent chow (Prolab Isopro RMH 3000, LabDiet, St. Louis, MO) and autoclaved water\nad libitum\nfor at least 1 week prior to experimental protocol.\nTBI was induced using the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model as previously described.\n14\n,\n15\nBriefly, mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane followed by continuous administration of 2% isoflurane in N\n2\nO/O\n2\n(2:1) via nosecone and placed in a modified stereotaxic frame with ear bars to stabilize the head. A craniotomy was performed in the left parietal bone and the bone flap removed. CCI was performed with a 3-mm impactor tip fired at velocity 6\u2009m/sec, depth 2\u2009mm, dwell 50\u2009msec. The skull was replaced and secured with dental cement (Koldmount, Vernon-Benshoff, Albany, NY), the scalp closed, 10% povidone iodine solution (McKesson, Irving, TX) topical applied to the scalp, and mice recovered in a temperature-controlled chamber. No systemic antibiotics were administered in the performance of the CCI model.\n\nExperimental rigor\nMice were ordered to arrive to the housing facility at 11 weeks of age and were mixed prior to the start of the experiment. After at least 1 week, mice were moved to individual housing to prevent coprophagic effects and, in the behavioral outcome study, to prevent benefit of social enrichment. Prior to the outcomes study, mice were randomized to experimental groups and assigned a study identification number. Cages were labeled only with the mouse identification number and technicians performing the surgery, behavioral outcomes assessment, histologic analysis, SCFA analysis, and fecal collection were blinded to experimental groups. Diet and food autoclaving procedures were standardized. Addition of SCFAs to drinking water did not change the clarity of the water; however, an odor is present in SCFA supplemented water if investigators were very close to the cage.\n\nSCFA supplementation in drinking water\nMice were randomized to receive SCFA-supplemented or standard drinking water 2 weeks prior to CCI and continued until sacrifice. For SCFA treatment, 67.5\u2009mM sodium acetate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 25.9\u2009mM propionate (Sigma-Aldrich), and 40\u2009mM butyrate (Sigma-Aldrich) were added as previously described.\n16\n,\n17\nWater solutions were prepared and changed three times per week.\n\nDNA extraction and analysis of 16S rRNA genes\nStool was collected from mice (\nn\n=\u200910) at baseline, 3\u2009h, 24\u2009h, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, and 28 days after CCI. Mice were placed in a sterile chamber and fresh fecal pellets collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0C prior to batch analysis. The MO BIO PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA) was used to extract microbial DNA according to manufacturer instructions. 16S rRNA gene amplicons were produced by polymerase chain reaction amplification of V4 amplicon using 515F and 806R primers. Samples were forward and reverse sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform (San Diego, CA). QIIME2 was used to demultiplex raw sequence read pairs, trim reads, and the DADA2 algorithm implemented within QIIME was used to denoise reads and generate a table of operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Taxa were assigned to predicted OTUs with feature classifier plugin trained on the greengenes reference database (v13.8). Alpha and beta-diversity were calculated using Phyloseq and analysis of differentially enriched or depleted OTUs was performed with LEfSe\n18\nwith correction for multiple comparisons.\n\nSCFA quantification\nSample preparation\nStool samples were homogenized with 50% aqueous acetonitrile containing 10\u03bcg/mL internal standard (butyrate-d\n5\n) at a ratio of 100\u2009mg stool to 1\u2009mL of solution followed by vortex mixing and centrifugation at 16,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 10\u2009min at 10\u00b0C; 60\u03bcL cleared supernatants were transferred to a clean tube and derivatized with 30\u2009\u03bcL of 200\u2009mM 3-nitrophenylhydrazinein 50% aqueous acetonitrile and 30\u2009\u03bcL of 120\u2009mM N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N0-ethylcarbodiimide -6% pyridine solution in 50% aqueous acetonitrile. The mixture was reacted at 60\u00b0C for 30\u2009min and the reaction was stopped with 0.45\u2009mL of 50% acetonitrile.\nLiquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry analysis\nDerivatized samples were injected (5\u2009\u03bcL) into a Thermo Vanquish UHPLC at a flow rate of 0.25\u2009mL/min using a binary solvent system. Solvent A consisted of water and 0.1% formic acid and solvent B consisted of acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. Short-chain fatty acids were separated using binary solvent elution gradient at 15% B for 2\u2009min, 15\u201355% B in 9\u2009min, and then held at 100% B for 1\u2009min. The column was equilibrated for 3\u2009min at 15% B between injections. SCFA were separated on a Phenomenex Kinetex C18 (2\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u2009mm, 1.7\u2009\u03bc) column at 40\u00b0C. SCFA were analyzed using a Thermo Q-Exactive mass spectrometer at 60,000 resolution in negative ion mode, using a data-dependent Top-5 ms2 method. The duration between collection and SCFA analysis was standardized across fecal samples.\n\nFunctional outcome\nMice (\nn\n=\u200910/group: na\u00efve, na\u00efve+SCFA, CCI, CCI+SCFA) were assessed for spatial learning and memory acquisition using the Morris water maze (MWM) as previously described.\n19\n,\n20\nNa\u00efve mice were not subjected to anesthesia or sham surgery. MWM employs a 90-cm diameter pool with a 10-cm platform placed 1\u2009cm below the water's surface to assess the mouse's ability to learn spatial relations between distal cues and escape to the platform. On Days 14\u201318 after CCI, the average of four trials taken from set starting positions in the pool was recorded for each mouse. On Day 19, mice were assessed for their ability to escape to a visible platform and probe trial was performed where the platform was removed and mice swimming behavior assessed for 30\u2009sec.\n\nLesion volume\nOn Day 28 after CCI, mice (\nn\n=\u200910/group) were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane and sacrificed via transcardial perfusion with heparinized saline followed by 2% paraformaldehyde. The brain was dissected, cryopreserved in sucrose solution, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Coronal 10-\u03bcm frozen sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and lesion volume quantified using image analysis software (MCID; Imaging Research, Saint Catherine's, Ontario, Canada) by an evaluator blinded to the treatment groups (OMO).\n19\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using Prism 8 (Graphpad, La Jolla, CA). SCFA concentrations were compared by repeated measures (RM)-analysis of variance (ANOVA). When the overall ANOVA revealed a significant effect, the data were further analyzed to determine specific group differences with Dunnett's test corrected for multiple comparisons. MWM hidden platform data were analyzed by two-way RM-ANOVA. All other data were analyzed by Mann-Whitney test. All data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean. A\np\nvalue <0 .05 was considered significant."

Inclusion criteria were age between 18 and 64 years and a diagnosis of non-penetrating moderate-to-severe TBI, as defined by at least one of the following: 1) Glasgow Coma Scale score <13 in the emergency department; 2) loss of consciousness \u226512 h; or 3) prospectively documented post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) \u226524 h. To ensure that TBI was predominantly diffuse, participants were excluded if the total estimated volume of focal intraparenchymal lesions on acute MRI or CT exceeded 5\u2009cm\n3\nfor subcortical lesions and 50\u2009cm\n3\nfor cortical lesions. One patient underwent a craniotomy and was excluded from the study. Patients with hypoxic injury were also excluded. Additionally, 7 patients were excluded after data quality-control (QC) procedures, because of low MR image quality from excessive motion and/or flow artifacts during scanning. As a result, the final analysis included data from 34 TBI patients at 3 months; 28 and 27 of these also had QC-approved data at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Thirty-five healthy controls matched for age, years of education, and sex with good general health and no known neurocognitive disorders were also recruited. Informed consent was obtained from all participants or their legally authorized representative.\n\nClinical measures\nClinical measures were collected from medical records or measured prospectively during hospitalization. Duration of PTA was calculated as the number of days between TBI and the first of two occasions within 72\u2009h that the participant was fully oriented. Full orientation was defined as a score above 25 on the Orientation Log\n24\nor documentation of consistent orientation for 72\u2009h in the acute medical record (i.e., before rehabilitation admission). PTA was selected as the injury severity measure because PTA has been shown to be a superior predictor of TBI outcome.\n25\nFunctional outcomes were determined 3, 6, and 12 months after injury using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE),\n24\na measure that is commonly used as a global assessment of functional abilities in multiple domains after a TBI\n26\nNeuropsychological tests were performed 3, 6, and 12 months after injury across three domains: mental processing speed (PS) as indexed by the Processing Speed Index from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV\n27\n; verbal learning (VL) administered by Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT)\n28\n; and executive functioning (EF) as indexed by a composite measure consisting of an average across T-scores of the following five tests\n29\n: the Trail Making Test-Part B\n30\n; the Color Word section of the Color Word Interference Test\n31\n; the Controlled Oral Word Association Test\n32\n; the Letter-Number Sequencing subtest; and the Digits Backward section of the Digit Span subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale IV.\n33\n\nImage acquisition\nBoth patients and healthy controls underwent brain MRI on a Siemens 3T Tim Trio scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), with patients scanned at 3, 6, and 12 months post-injury. The DTI protocol included two identical acquisitions of 30 gradient directions at a b-value of 1000\u2009s/mm\n2\n, with seven b0 images spaced throughout the acquisition (voxel size\u2009=\u20092.18\u2009\u00d7\u20092.18\u2009\u00d7\u20092.20\u2009mm, echo time [TE]\u2009=\u200984\u2009ms, repetition time [TR]\u2009=\u20096500\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200990 degrees). A structural magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo sequence was also acquired (voxel size\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm, TE\u2009=\u20093.08\u2009sec, TR\u2009=\u20091620\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200915 degrees).\n\nImage processing\nAll T1 and DTI data were manually inspected for artifacts before pre-processing. T1-weighted images were bias corrected using the N4BiasCorrection tool from ANTs,\n34\nfollowed by brain extraction using a multi-atlas segmentation tool, MUSE.\n35\nDTIs were concatenated and pre-processed in three steps: 1) Local-PCA Denoising\n36\nimplemented in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA); 2) motion and distortion correction through \u201ceddy\u201d from the FMRIB Software Library\n37\n; and 3) bias field correction using N4BiasCorrection. A tensor model was fit to the data\n38\nin DIPY,\n39\nand standard fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were derived.\nWe used FERNET (Freewater EstimatoR using iNtErpolated iniTialization),\n19\na recent method for FW correction in clinically acquired DTI data, to estimate the FW-VF and FW-corrected FA (fernet-fit FA or ff-FA). The code used to apply FERNET on DTI data is available online.\n40\nUsing the deformable SyN registration algorithm of ANTs,\n41\nthe data were registered to the JHU-MNI-ss (Eve) template.\n42\nMedian values of each scalar were calculated in 90 regions of the Eve WM parcellation. Cerebellum was excluded from analysis because the acquisition did not include it in all scans. Fornix and tapetum regions were also excluded because of their small size and proximity to the ventricles.\n\nPatient-specific summary score of free water volume fraction and other diffusion measures\nWe utilized Mahalanobis distance (M), a multi-variate generalization of the z-score which incorporates the covariance between the variables, as a summary measure of DTI measures.\n23\nM was calculated for each of the four DTI scalars (denoted M\nVF\n, M\nff-FA\n, M\nstd-FA\n, and M\nstd-MD\nhenceforth), using the following formula:\nwhere s\u2009=\u2009[X\nr\n1\n, X\nr\n2\n\u2026 X\nr\n90\n] is the vector of DTI measures in each WM region in a single participant, where X\nr\ni\nrepresents the residuals of age-regressed-out DTI measures (VF, ff-FA, std-FA, or std-MD) in region\ni\nfor a participant; \u03bc is the vector of mean X\nr\nof each WM region in a healthy control population; and C is the covariance matrix between WM regions across the control population. To compute the covariance, 25 controls were randomly selected and permuted 1000 times. M of patients was calculated individually relative to each of the 1000 control distributions, for each DTI measure, and the median values are reported.\n\nStatistical analysis\nTo test the primary hypothesis that FW-VF would be elevated in patients, we performed ordinary least squares (OLS) regression on the average FW-VF for 90 ROIs with terms for group, age, and sex. Group differences were assessed as\nt\n-statistics and associated\np\nvalues of the regression. Results were corrected for multiple comparisons at the\np\n<\u20090.05 level using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.\n43\nThe same regression was used to assess group differences in ff-FA, std-FA, and std-MD between patients and healthy controls.\nTo test the second hypothesis that M\nVF\ncould predict functional and cognitive outcomes at 12 months post-injury and its association with injury severity, OLS regression was used with terms for M\nVF\n, age, and sex. Dependent variables were PTA, GOSE, and cognitive scores (EF, VL, and PS). Significance for these comparisons was set at\np\n=\u20090.01 (0.05/5) after Bonferroni correction for five comparisons.\nFor the exploratory analyses, we compared M\nff-FA\n, M\nstd-FA\n, and M\nstd-MD\nin predicting functional and cognitive outcomes at 12 months post-injury and their associations with injury severity, using the same regression adjusted for age and sex. Longitudinal variations in M\nVF\n, M\nff-FA\n, M\nstd-FA\n, and M\nstd-MD\nfrom 3, 6, and 12 months were assessed using a linear mixed-effects regression model controlling for age and sex. Group effects in demographics and neuropsychological functions were tested using an independent-sample\nt-\ntest. These tests were assessed at the uncorrected\np\n<\u20090.05 level.\nLinear mixed-effects models were fitted using the R package, lme4 1.1-26, in R 1.3.1093 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). OLS analyses were performed with statsmodels 0.9.0 in python 3.6.8.\n44"

    "Methods": "Experimental animals and diet\nAll experiments were conducted according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guidelines for the Health and Care of Animals (LMS-HK-13). Pregnant C57BL6/NCr mice at 13 days of gestation (G13) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) and randomly placed on either the n-3 PUFA adequate or n-3 PUFA deficient diet from G14. Pups were weaned on the same diet as the dams. The diets were purchased from Dyets, Inc. (Bethlehem, PA) and were isocaloric, but contained a different composition of the n-3 PUFA, alpha linolenic acid (ALA), which was 3.4% in the n-3 PUFA adequate diet and 0.05% in the n-3 PUFA deficient diet (\nTable 1\n). In addition to ALA, there are small but significant differences in myristic (16.02\u2009\u00b1\u20090.41 vs. 17.14\u2009\u00b1\u20090.16) and oleic acid content (5.27\u2009\u00b1\u20090.20 vs. 4.55\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04) in the adequate versus deficient diet.

The RBC pellet was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), before lipid extraction. Lipids were extracted from RBCs or cortical tissues according to the method of Bligh and Dyer,\n22\nand the fatty acid profile was determined by gas chromatography after transmethylation as described previously.\n23\nTransmethylated samples were injected onto an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector by a 15-m DB-FFAP capillary column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Individual fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were identified by comparing with retention times of known FAME standard GLC-411 (Nu-Chek Prep, Elysian, MN), and the percentage of each FAME relative to total was determined based on peak areas.\n\nRepeated mild traumatic brain injury and experimental timeline\nThe CHIMERA model was used for TBIs as described previously.\n8\nThe CHIMERA apparatus consists of a small, hinged platform to support the animal's body and a head plate to support the head. The head plate is provided with a small aperture through which a 50-g, free-floating piston is forced up by controlled air pressure such that it strikes the head.\n8\nThree-month-old mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and mounted in a supine position on the CHIMERA apparatus such that the piston struck the unconstrained head at 0.55\u2009J of energy. After the injury, mice were returned to the cage and allowed to recover. One injury was given each day for 3 consecutive days with 24\u2009h between injuries. The day after the last injury was considered as the first day after injury. Control groups (sham) were treated identically to the experimental injury groups without impact. Brain samples were collected at 2 months after injury after functional tests according to the following timeline: day 0, third injury; days 51\u201355, water maze; days 58\u201360, visual evoked potential (VEP)/electroretinogram (ERG); day 60, immunohistochemistry.\n\nImmunofluorescence and silver staining\nMice were perfused with chilled PBS and fixed in fresh 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Mouse brains were carefully removed and fixed in 4% PFA solution overnight and transferred into 30% sucrose solution until sinking to the bottom of the tube at 4\u00b0C, then embedded with OCT compound medium (Tissue-Tek, 4583; VWR International, Radnor, PA), frozen on dry ice, and stored at \u221280\n0\nC in a freezer. Coronal sections (25\u2009\u03bcm) were sliced by Leica Cryostat (Leica Biosystems Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL) and stored in cryoprotectant solution at \u221220\u00b0C. Three sections from approximately the same position (\u22121.68\u2009mm bregma) from each mouse brain were selected for ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and silver staining by an investigator blind to the experimental groups (4 mice per group). Sections were incubated with Iba-1 and GFAP antibodies at 4\n0\nC overnight and Alexa Fluor-488\u2013conjugated F (ab\u2019)2 fragment goat antirabbit immunoglobulin G (111-546-003; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) at room temperature for 1\u2009h. After washing, sections were mounted on slides and covered with mounting medium containing 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (H-1500; Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Immunofluorescence images were captured by an Olympus 1X81 microscope (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) for Iba-1 and GFAP in the optic tract (OT), corpus callosum (CC), and hippocampus (HP). GFAP and Iba-1 protein expression in the regions of interest (ROIs) was quantified by measuring the fluorescence intensity per \u03bcm\n2\nafter subtracting the background intensity using Metamorph software (Molecular Devices Inc., Sunnyvale, CA).\nFor silver staining, sections from 3 mice per group were placed in 4% PFA solution for at least 7 days at 4\u00b0C before processing with NeuroSilver kit II, according to the manufacturer's protocol (PK301A; FD NeuroTechnologies, Inc., Columbia MD). Images of the OT were acquired in bright field by an Olympus 1X81 microscope system. Staining intensity of images was quantified using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD).\n\nVisual evoked potential and electroretinogram\nMouse flash VEP and ERG were recorded with an Espion Visual Electrophysiology System from Diagnosys LLC (Lowell, MA) to assess visual functions at 2 months after injury. To prevent bias, experimental groups were coded such that the investigator was not aware of codes. The total animal number used was 36 (9 mice per group, 5 males and 4 females per group).\nAll procedures were performed in the room under dim red light after mice were acclimated in the room for at least 1\u2009h. Mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine solution. Each pupil of the mouse was dilated with a drop of 2.5% phenylephrine hydrochloride solution before being placed on a heated platform of color-dome. A needle electrode placed in the lower lip of the mouse was used as a reference while a needle electrode placed in the tail served as the ground. For ERG recordings, a drop of topical petrolatum ophthalmic ointment was applied to the corneal surface of one eye, and a gold-wire active electrode was placed with the other eye covered. A light-adapted (photopic) protocol was used as previously reported.\n24\nFor VEP recordings, the active electrode was subcutaneously inserted in the middle of two ears. Both eyes were stimulated by the white flashlights with a constant intensity of 3.0 cd s/m\n2\n, 100 trials three times. After testing, mice were transferred to the home cage and placed on a heating pad until having recovered. The data of three times per mouse were averaged and analyzed.\n\nMorris water maze test\nThe Morris water maze test was performed over a period of 5 days by the investigator blinded to the identity of individual mice, with the first 4 days consisting of learning trials followed by a probe trial on the fifth day. Mice were gently released into a pool 120\u2009cm in diameter filled with water and mixed with white non-toxic tempera paint. The trial ended when the mouse managed to locate the submerged platform. In case the mouse did not find the platform within 90\u2009sec, it was gently guided to the platform. Four trials were given daily for 4 days for learning. On the fifth day, the platform was removed, and mice were allowed to swim for 60\u2009sec. The total number of mice used for this experiment was 51; 10\u201315 mice per group with approximately half male and female per group.\n\nStatistical analyses\nAll data are represented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software (version 8.01; GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). A\np\nvalue set to <0.05 was considered significant. Statistical significance was determined by an unpaired Student\nt\ntest or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey's test for multiple comparisons. Repeated-measures two-way ANOVA was used for analysis of data obtained for the learning trials of the Morris water maze test."

    "Methods": "Recruitment\nAll research procedures were approved by the Wake Forest University School of Medicine and University of Texas-Southwestern School of Medicine Institutional Review Board committees. This study was Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant, and written informed parental consent and assent from participants was obtained. Male, youth American football players were recruited from 16 teams in Winston-Salem, NC. All football players were observed for the season immediately after recruitment, with some subjects reenrolling in the study in subsequent seasons.\nIn addition, male noncollision sport athlete controls from Winston-Salem, NC were recruited into the study. Noncollision sports were defined as those in which routine, purposeful, body-to-body collisions do not occur as an allowed or expected part of the sport.\n17\nSubjects were excluded from analysis if medical histories revealed any neurological or psychological disorders, if subjects received a diagnosis of concussion during the season or within nine months before pre-season imaging, or if pre-season or post-season imaging was either not acquired or unusable because of artifact. As an extreme outlier, one football subject with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 40 was excluded from the analysis.\n\nImage acquisition\nBaseline and follow-up imaging was acquired on a 3T Skyra (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner with a 32-channel head coil. Diffusion imaging and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) were acquired under two protocols. Diffusion protocol 1 (D-1) parameters included a 10,500\u2009msec/99\u2009msec repetition time/echo time (TR/TE), 90-degree flip angle, and 2.2\u2009mm\n\u00d7\n2.2\u2009mm\n\u00d7\n3.0\u2009mm voxel resolution. Diffusion protocol 2 (D-2) parameters included a 12,600\u2009msec/100\u2009msec TR/TE, 90-degree flip angle, a 2.0\u2009mm\n3\nisotropic voxel resolution. Both diffusion protocols included b-values of 0, 1,000, and 2,000\u2009sec/mm\n2\nwith 15 diffusion gradient directions for each of the latter two b-values.\nThe first SWI protocol parameters included 27\u2009msec/20\u2009msec TR/TE, 15-degree flip angle, 232\n\u00d7\n256 field of view (FOV), and 0.86\u2009mm\n\u00d7\n0.86\u2009mm\n\u00d7\n1.5\u2009mm voxel resolution. The second SWI protocol parameters included 51\u2009msec/9.75\u2009msec TR/TE, 20-degree flip angle, 324\n\u00d7\n416 FOV, and 0.58\u2009mm\n\u00d7\n0.58\u2009mm\n\u00d7\n2.0\u2009mm voxel resolution. Anatomical T1-weighted imaging was acquired with 2,300\u2009msec/2.98\u2009msec TR/TE, 90-degree flip angle, and 1.0\u2009mm\n\u00d7\n1.0\u2009mm\n\u00d7\n1.0\u2009mm voxel resolution.\nAll football players were imaged pre- and post-season. Controls were either training or involved in competitive play between baseline and follow-up scans.\n\nImage processing\nAll diffusion data were eddy current corrected using the FMRIB Software Library.\n18\u201322\nEstimates of FA, mean diffusion (MD), linear anisotropy coefficient (CL), spherical anisotropy coefficient (CS), and planar anisotropy coefficient (CP) were generated using the diffusion tensor imaging toolkit.\n23\n,\n24\nSubsequently, the multi-parametric diffusion-estimated images were coregistered and normalized to the IXI template using volume-based morphometry 8 and Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 (SPM8) toolboxes (Institute of Neurology at University College London, United Kingdom, 2015). All normalized diffusion-estimated images were smoothed using an 8\u2009mm gaussian filter, and percent change diffusion images were generated from each baseline and follow-up pair in MATLAB R2015a (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, 2015). All imaging was visually inspected to ensure the integrity at each pre-processing step.\n\nHead acceleration data\nFootball participants were fit with Riddell Revolution Speed football helmets that incorporated the Head Impact Telemetry System (HITS) (Simbex, Lebanon, NH) to capture head acceleration data from all football-related head impacts. Acceleration events were verified with video recordings of all games and practices. Any head acceleration data that were not a result of play were excluded from analysis.\nUsing a validated voxel-based FE model,\n25\nthe following strain-based metrics were calculated: 95th percentile first principal strain (\u025b\n1,\u200995\n), which measures the degree of tensile brain deformation, SR (\n\u025b\n\u02d9\n1,\u200995\n), which measures the rate of brain deformation, and the product of strain and SR (\u025b\n1,\u200995\n*\n\u025b\n\u02d9\n1,\u200995\n). The \u025b\n1,\u200995\n*\n\u025b\n\u02d9\n1,\u200995\nfor each impact was then summed across each subject's total head impacts to obtain the cumulative maximum principal strain 1 x SR (CMPS1\n\u00d7\nSR), quantifying the combined burden of impacts experienced by each subject during one football season.\n\nBrain injury history\nThe Sport Concussion Assessment Tool was deployed at all football games and practices to assist a certified athletic trainer in evaluating concussion symptoms.\n26\nSubjects who were suspected of concussion were referred to a sports medicine physician for further evaluation and final diagnosis. Concussion history before study enrollment was reported in medical history surveys completed by the research subject and their legal guardian(s). The SWI for each subject was reviewed to identify hypointense lesions. Focal SWI lesions were confirmed as microhemorrhages by reviewing the corresponding phase imaging.\n\nVoxelwise analyses\nTo determine any positive or inverse regional relationships between CMPS1\n\u00d7\nSR and percent change in white matter FA (%\u0394FA), two multi-variate linear regressions were performed in SPM8. Covariates of age, BMI, time between scans (TBS), imaging protocol (IP), prior attention disorder diagnosis (PADD), and history of prior brain injury (PBI) were included as covariates in each regression. Attention disorders included attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The PBIs included previous microhemorrhages or previous concussion diagnosis. The International Consortium of Brain Mapping (ICBM) white matter atlas was used as a region of interest in the analyses. False discovery rate correction was used for all SPM analyses with Bonferroni-corrected alphas of 0.025 and voxel thresholds of zero."

    "Methods": "Study design and procedure\nThis study drew on data from a larger parent project, the Mild Injury Outcomes Study (MIOS), which involved a prospective cohort design with longitudinal follow-up. Participants were 8:0- to 16:11-year-old children with either mild TBI or OI not involving the head who were recruited during ED visits within 24\u2009h post-injury at two large children's hospitals in the midwestern United States: Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio and Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio. Children with OI were included because they are comparable to children with mild TBI both demographically and in terms of risk factors that predispose to injury; their inclusion also helps to control for the general effects of trauma. Recruitment occurred over a period of 46 months, from March 2014 to December 2017.\nThe study was conducted in compliance with institutional review board standards for ethical clinical research at each location. Informed parental consent and child assent were obtained in writing before participation. Injury information was collected in the ED at the time of recruitment. At that time, parents also provided retrospective ratings of their child's pre-injury functioning. Children completed computerized neuropsychological testing using the NIHTB-CB at a post-acute assessment between 3 and 18 days post-injury (mean [\nM\n]\u2009=\u200910.31 days; standard deviation [\nSD\n]\u2009=\u20092.84) and again at follow-up assessments 3 and 6 months post-injury.\n\nParticipants\nChildren with mild TBI were included if they experienced a blunt TBI resulting in at least one of the following: 1) an observed loss of consciousness no longer than 30\u2009min; 2) Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13 or 14; or 3) at least two acute symptoms of concussion as documented by ED medical personnel (e.g., post-traumatic amnesia, vomiting, nausea, headache, diplopia, dizziness, disorientation to time, place, or person, or any other indications of mental status changes). Exclusion criteria for the mild TBI group included any GCS score below 13, delayed neurological deterioration, or any medical contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Children were not excluded if they were hospitalized or demonstrated intracranial lesions or skull fractures on acute computed tomography, which was completed only if deemed clinically indicated by ED physicians. Thus, the mild TBI group included injuries often described as complicated (e.g., those with intracranial abnormalities), but excluded injuries that would typically be defined as moderate in severity. However, only 6 children in the mild TBI group demonstrated trauma-related abnormalities on MRI completed at the post-acute visit.\n27\nThus, the large majority of children in the mild TBI group had what would be diagnosed as a concussion.\nChildren with OI were eligible if they sustained upper- or lower-extremity factures associated with an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score of \u22644. The AIS is a widely used scoring system that assesses severity of injuries to specific anatomical regions on a scale of 1\u20136.\n28\nChildren were excluded from the OI group if they displayed any evidence of TBI or symptoms of concussion. Children with mild TBI were eligible to participate if they had a co-occurring OI.\nBoth groups were subject to multiple exclusion criteria: any injury that occurred >24\u2009h before admission to the ED; neurosurgical or surgical intervention; any associated injury with an AIS score of >4; any associated injury that interfered with neuropsychological testing; hypoxia, hypotension, or shock; ethanol, drug, or sedative medication ingestion involved with the injury; any previous TBI requiring medical treatment; pre-morbid neurological disorder or intellectual disability, per parent report; any injury resulting from child abuse or assault; pre-morbid severe psychiatric disorder requiring hospitalization; and inability to speak proficient English. Children were not excluded for pre-morbid learning difficulties or attention problems. The mild TBI and OI groups did not differ in the proportion of children whose parents reported a history of learning disability or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder diagnoses.\nA total of 588 (mild TBI\u2009=\u2009307; OI\u2009=\u2009281) eligible children were approached in the ED about participating in the study. Of those children, 315 (mild TBI\u2009=\u2009195; OI\u2009=\u2009120) provided consent and completed an initial assessment in the ED. Children who consented did not differ from those who did not consent in sex (\u03c7\n2\n(1)\n=\u20090.182;\np\n=\u20090.669) or age (\nt\n(581)\n=\u20090.119;\np\n=\u20090.905). A higher proportion of participants consented in the mild TBI group (63.5%) than in the OI group (42.7%; \u03c7\n2\n(1)\n=\u200925.552;\np\n<\u20090.001). Additionally, consent rates were higher among Black (60.9%) and multi-racial (76.3%) children than white (45.3%) children (\u03c7\n2\n(3)\n=\u200921.261;\np\n<\u20090.001). Those who consented also lived in census tracts with significantly lower median family incomes and a higher percentage of residents living below the poverty line than those who refused (\np\n=\u20090.019 and\np\n=\u20090.030 [Mann-Whitney U tests], respectively). Consent was not related to percent of minorities in children's census tracts (\np\n=\u20090.216).\nAmong the 315 children who consented, 217 returned for the post-acute assessment (mild TBI\u2009=\u2009143; OI\u2009=\u200974), with 18% of those visits completed within 7 days after injury and 93.5% completed within 14 days after injury. Children who were only seen in the ED did not differ from those who returned for the post-acute assessment in sex (\u03c7\n2\n(1)\n=\u20090.078;\np\n=\u20090.781) or age (\nt\n(313)\n=\u2009\u22120.245;\np\n=\u20090.807). More participants in the mild TBI group (73.3%) returned for the post-acute visit than participants in the OI group (61.7%; \u03c7\n2\n(1)\n=\u20094.718;\np\n=\u20090.030). Participants who were multi-racial (96.6%) or white (79.8%) were more likely to return for the post-acute visit than those who were Black (54.3%; \u03c7\n2\n(3)\n=\u200932.579;\np\n<\u20090.001). Children who returned for the post-acute assessment also resided in census tracts with higher median family incomes and a lower percentage of minorities and residents living below the poverty line than those who were seen only in the ED (\np\n=\u20090.003,\np\n<\u20090.001, and\np\n=\u20090.028 [Mann-Whitney U tests], respectively).\nThe final sample for this analysis included the 143 children with mild TBI and 74 children with OI who participated in the post-acute assessment. Participants who attended the post-acute visit did not differ significantly from the combined group of children who did not consent to participate in the study or were seen only in the ED in age (\nt\n(581)\n=\u2009\u22120.011;\np\n=\u20090.991) or sex (\u03c7\n2\n(1)\n=\u20090.248;\np\n=\u2009.618), or on census tract measures of median family income and percentage of minorities and residents living below the poverty line (all\np\n>\u20090.451, Mann-Whitney U tests). They did differ in race (\u03c7\n2\n(3)\n=\u200923.594;\np\n<\u20090.001), largely because multi-racial children were more likely to attend the post-acute visit (73.7%) than white (36.1%) or Black (33.1%) children.\nParticipant demographic and clinical characteristics at the time of study entry are presented in\nTable 1\n. The mild TBI and OI groups did not differ in sex (\u03c7\n2\n(1)\n=\u20090.053;\np\n=\u20090.817) or age (\nt\n(215)\n=\u20090.565;\np\n=\u20090.573). The mild TBI group had a higher proportion of white participants (52.4%) and lower proportions of multi-racial (9.8%) participants than the OI group (37.8% and 18.9%, respectively; \u03c7\n2\n(3)\n=\u20098.297;\np\n=\u20090.040). Additionally, the mild TBI group had higher SES than the OI group (\nt\n(215)\n=\u20092.794;\np\n=\u20090.006), as measured by a z-score composite of standardized measures of total years of maternal education, median family income for the family census tract, and occupational status.\n28\nOf the 217 children completing the post-acute visit, 159 completed the 3-month assessment (mild TBI\u2009=\u2009102 [71% of those completing the post-acute visit]; OI\u2009=\u200957 [77%]), and 143 completed the 6-month assessment (mild TBI\u2009=\u200997 [68%]; OI\u2009=\u200946 [62%]). The mild TBI and OI groups did not differ in attrition rates at 3 or 6 months. Children who returned for follow-up assessments were similar to those who did not return for follow-up in terms of injury group, sex, race, age at injury, and median household income.\nTable 1.\nSample Demographics and Clinical Characteristics at Study Entry\nMild TBI\nOI\nSignificance test\nn\n=\u2009143\nn\n=\u200974\nt\n/\u03c7\n2\np\nvalue\nAge at injury\n0.565\n0.573\nM\n(\nSD\n)\n12.56 (2.61)\n12.35 (2.37)\nRange\n8.04\u201316.95\n8.17\u201316.93\nSex\n0.053\n0.817\n% Male\n66.4\n64.9\nRace\n8.297\n*\n0.040\n% White\n52.4\n37.8\n% Black\n35.0\n43.2\n% Multi-racial\n9.8\n18.9\n% Other\n2.8\n0.0\nMedian household\n1.844\n0.067\nincome\n1\nM (SD)\n63K\u2009\u00b1\u200934K\n54K\u2009\u00b1\u200933K\nRange\n7K\u2013244K\n11K\u2013177K\nYears of maternal education\n2.354\n*\n0.020\nM\n(\nSD\n)\n13.97 (2.37)\n13.19 (2.21)\nRange\n9\u201318\n9\u201318\nDays post-injury baseline follow-up\n\u20131.372\n0.172\nM\n(\nSD\n)\n10.12 (2.79)\n10.68 (2.91)\nRange\n3\u201315\n4\u201318\n3-month follow-up\n\u20131.440\n0.152\nM\n(\nSD\n)\n98.59 (12.66)\n101.58 (12.36)\nRange\n76\u2013132\n79\u2013131\n6-month follow-up\n1.575\n0.117\nM\n(\nSD\n)\n191.56 (13.20)\n188.04 (10.70)\nRange\n167\u2013229\n171\u2013215\nInjury setting\n0.149\n0.699\n% Sport-related\n78.6\n80.9\nInjury mechanism\n8.941\n*\n0.030\n% Fall\n33.3\n43.8\n% Struck object\n26.2\n24.7\n% Struck person\n25.5\n9.6\n% Other\n14.9\n21.9\nInjury Characteristics\n2b\n% experienced LOC\n27.1%\n% experienced PTA\n38.8%\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n% GCS <15\n11.7%\nOpen in a separate window\na\nBased on 2010 Census tract.\nb\nMild TBI group only.\n*\nGroup difference significant,\np\n<\u20090.05.\nM, mean; SD, standard deviation; LOC, loss of consciousness; PTA, post-traumatic amnesia.\n\nMeasures\nNational Institutes of Health Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioural Function\nThe NIHTB-CB consists of seven subtests to assess language, reading, episodic memory, processing speed, working memory, attention, and executive function that provide age-corrected standard scores, as well as Fluid Cognition and Crystallized Cognition composite scores.\n15\nTable 2\nprovides a list of each subtest and the corresponding cognitive domains and composite.\nTable 2.\nNIH Toolbox Subtests and Corresponding Cognitive Domains\nNIH Toolbox subtest\nCognitive domain\nComposite\nFlanker Inhibitory Control & Attention\nExecutive Function & Attention\nFluid\nDimensional Change Card Sort\nExecutive Function\nFluid\nPicture Sequence Memory\nEpisodic Memory\nFluid\nList Sorting Working Memory\nWorking Memory\nFluid\nPattern Comparison Processing Speed\nProcessing Speed\nFluid\nOral Reading Recognition\nLanguage\nCrystallized\nPicture Vocabulary\nLanguage\nCrystallized\nOpen in a separate window\nNIH, National Institutes of Health.\nMedical Symptom Validity Test\nChildren's response validity was measured using the MSVT, which is a computerized, forced-choice test designed to detect invalid performance.\n29\nThe MSVT presents 10 word pairs twice on the computer screen. Children are asked to choose the correct word from pairs consisting of a target and foil, both immediately and after a delay. Children are also asked to recall the words during paired-associate and free recall conditions. Children \u22658 years of age are able to perform at very high levels of recognition accuracy, commensurate with adults.\n29\nPerformance on the MSVT accounts for substantial variance in cognitive test performance among children with mild TBI.\n30\n,\n31\nThe traditional MSVT cutoff was used to classify performance as invalid (i.e., a score of \u226485% on all three easy subtests). Of the cases meeting that criteria, some displayed a pattern of substantially worse performance on the difficult subtests than on the easy ones (difference of >20%), suggestive of cognitive impairment or memory deficit rather than performance invalidity.\n29\n\nStatistical analysis\nStudy data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at Nationwide Children's Hospital.\n32\n,\n33\nLinear mixed-model analyses were conducted using SAS Version 9.4\n34\nto examine group and time post-injury as predictors of age-adjusted standard scores on the Fluid Cognition and Crystallized Cognition composite scores and on each of the seven subtests of the NIHTB-CB; time post-injury was centered so that the model intercept was at 10 days post-injury. Mixed models are advantageous with longitudinal data because they use all available data for estimation, so that all participants who completed at least one administration of the NIHTB-CB were included in analyses. Before analysis, Little's Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) test was completed using the IBM SPSS\n35\nMissing Value Analysis procedure and was not significant (\n\u03c7\n2\n(54)\n=\u200963.357;\np\n=\u20090.180), indicating that the pattern of missing data in the final sample did not differ significantly from data missing completely at random. SES and sex were included as covariates in analyses. Significant group differences at the intercept or group by time interactions were followed by tests of group differences at each occasion post-injury.\nWe derived effect sizes (\nd\n) using model estimates of group means and pooled standard deviations at each time. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by repeating analyses after excluding children who demonstrated invalid performance on the MSVT. One analysis omitted only those children who failed the traditional MSVT cutoff on any of the three assessments but did not display a profile suggestive of cognitive or memory deficit, and the second omitted all children who failed the traditional MSVT cutoff on any of the three assessments. A total of 10 children were omitted from the first analysis (9 mild TBI, 1 OI), and an additional 9 were omitted from the second analysis (7 mild TBI, 2 OI)."

    "Methods": "Study design and data source\nTo determine the natural progression of serological markers following spinal cord injury, we performed an observational study of prospectively collected data. Therefore, we analyzed two different data sources, one each from the United States of America and Germany. The first data source was a prospective phase III, placebo-controlled, multi-center study assessing the efficacy of gangliosidosis-1 (GM-1) ganglioside therapy in acute traumatic spinal cord injury.\n6\n,\n7\nRunning from 1992 to 1998, the Sygen trial failed to demonstrate a superior treatment effect of GM-1 over placebo treatment. Full design, recruitment, and enrollment details of the Sygen trial have been described previously.\n8\nA total of 797 patients across the United States were included in the randomization. Within the framework of this United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulated trial, detailed information concerning neurological scores and blood chemistry were meticulously collected. The second data source was an observational cohort study conducted at the over-regional level-I trauma center in Murnau, Germany (hereafter referred to as the Murnau study). Between 2004 and 2017, 363 patients were enrolled and followed up for 1-year post-injury. All patients enrolled in the Murnau study received standard rehabilitation care.\n\nEthics approval\nThe study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Approval for the secondary analysis of the Sygen trial was received by an institutional ethical standards committee on human experimentation at the University of British Columbia. The original Sygen clinical trial (results published elsewhere) also received ethical approval, but was conducted before clinical trials were required to be registered.\n7\u20139\nThe data received from the original clinical trial were de-identified. The Murnau study was approved by the Bavarian Medical Chamber (#2018-077).\n\nCohort definition: Inclusion and exclusion criteria\nTo be included in our study, patients needed to have blood values at three different time points as well as information on sex, age, and injury characteristics (i.e., injury severity, injury level, and baseline motor and sensory scores). Baseline was defined as the first 72\u2009h after injury for the Sygen trial and the first 2 weeks post-injury for the Murnau study. Patients were excluded if any of these data were missing or if they had sustained a non-traumatic injury (e.g., a tumor), or had decided to withdraw their data over the course of the study.\n\nOutcome, predictor, and confounding variables\nThe primary outcomes were serological markers with data available for at least 50 patients at each time point. This threshold was chosen to ensure that the model output was interpretable, statistically powerful enough to make inferences, and clinically relevant. Independent variables were time points post-injury at which serological markers were collected. As an FDA requirement for the Sygen trial, detailed information regarding routine blood chemistry was collected at admission to the trauma center (hereinafter referred to as week 0), and at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 52 weeks post-injury. The laboratory analyses were all performed by SmithKline Beecham between February 1997 and April 1993 using the available clinical machines in this time period (\nTable S1\n). In the Murnau study, information on serological markers was collected upon the request of the attending physicians (i.e., not at standardized time points). As a consequence, different numbers of blood draws were collected for each patient on different days post-injury. All laboratory analyses were performed in-house at the BGU (Berufsgenossenschaftliche Unfallklinik) Murnau. Normal ranges for the serological markers were provided by the manufacturer of the analytic devices (\nTable S1\n). Normal ranges derived from the Murnau study were also applied to the analysis of the Sygen study. The rationale for that stems from the fact that the original upper and lower bound values in Sygen are not available anymore. Potential confounders included age, sex, injury completeness (at time of injury) according to the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS),\n10\nlevel of injury (at/above T6 vs below T6), and presence or absence of polytrauma. Polytrauma was defined as significant injuries of three or more points in two or more different anatomic regions in addition to the spinal cord injury.\n11\nIn the Sygen trial, the injury severity was assessed using the Frankel Scale, whereas in the Murnau study the AIS grading scale was employed. In order to facilitate a comparison between the two data sources, we recalculated the AIS grades for all patients enrolled in the Sygen trial using the European Multicenter Study on Human Spinal Cord Injury (EMSCI) International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) calculator (\nhttps://ais.emsci.org/\n).\n\nStatistical analyses\nTwo-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and mixed-effects regression models were chosen for the primary analyses. These models were naturally suited to account for the longitudinal nature of the data as well as to adjust for potential confounders. Dependent variables were all serological markers that met our inclusion criteria. In the Murnau study, blood values were averaged per week, from week 0 to week 7 post-injury. In both studies, if, for a certain marker, patient, and time point, no data were available, the time point for this patient's marker was excluded. For analyses comparing both studies, we examined the percentage of deviation from the mean of the normal range, collected from the Murnau study. The rationale for this normalizing procedure was to make the data of the two cohorts comparable despite having different units. Independent variables were time post-injury, AIS grade, or level of injury, when examining data from the individual studies. When comparing the serological markers from both studies, we added the data sources as an independent variable. For mixed-effects regression models, pairwise comparisons of the different levels of the independent variable of interest were performed. Hence, significance levels were adjusted for multiple comparisons using Tukey's test, and\np\n<\u20090.05 after adjustment, was regarded as statistical significance. For one-study two-way ANOVA tests, we applied Bonferroni correction for testing for six independent variables together. Thus, we adjusted\np\nvalues, and\np\n<\u20090.05 was regarded as statistical significance. In the same way, when comparing the two studies, no correction was applied, as only the data source was considered to be an independent variable. Thus,\np\n<\u20090.05 was regarded as statistical significance. For all analyses, R Statistical Software, version 3.6.3 (running under: macOS Mojave 10.13.6), was used.\n\nData visualization\nUsing the R package\nShiny\nand\nShinyDashboard\n, we created an online interface to visualize the results of the current study and to interactively explore the data used for this study.\n\nData and code availability statement\nAnonymized data used in this study will be made available upon request to the corresponding author and in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR). The code describing the analysis can be accessed on our GitHub repository (\nhttps://github.com/jutzca/Systemic-effects-of-Spinal-Cord-Injury\n)."

    "Methods": "Participants\nFrom November 2011 to May 2016, children and adolescents ages 8-15 experiencing TBI or EI were recruited from the ED at Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital, a Level I pediatric trauma center, in Houston, Texas, as part of a larger study examining traumatic stress after pediatric injury. Subjects were eligible if their injuries were due to a vehicular collision (VC) causing acceleration-deceleration or blunt impact injuries (passenger in auto, auto and pedestrian, auto and bicycle, all-terrain vehicle, or golf cart accidents). Spanish-speaking families were included if the child spoke English, even if the parents did not. Exclusion criteria were as follows: families residing outside a 125-mile catchment area; history of child protective services intervention; gestational age less than 30 weeks; medical history of major developmental, psychiatric, neurological, or metabolic disorders; history of hospitalization for previous TBI; pregnancy; and habitual use of steroids, tobacco, or alcohol. Institutional Review Board approval was received from UTHealth. Informed parental consent and child assent were obtained for all participants.\n\nDefinitions\nThe classification of TBI severity was based on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of each subject at presentation to the ED. The GCS assesses motor, verbal, and eye-opening responses upon stimulation. TBI severity was classified using the GCS score as follows: mild TBI (mTBI)\u2009=\u200913-15; moderate TBI (modTBI)\u2009=\u20099-12; severe TBI (sTBI)\u2009=\u20098 or less.\n30\nmTBI is further classified as a complicated-mild TBI (cmTBI) if the patient has intracranial bleeding on computed tomography imaging.\n31\nSeverity of head and body injuries was assessed using the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS), which assigns a severity score ranging from minor to life-threatening (1-6, respectively) to different body regions.\n32\nAIS scores were obtained from the trauma registrar. The Injury Severity Score (ISS) provides an overall severity score based on AIS of the three most severely injured body regions; the Modified Injury Severity Score (MISS) excludes injuries to the head.\n32\nEligibility for the EI group was as follows: hospitalization for a skeletal or body injury due to a VC, an AIS score of 2-4, and a GCS score of 15 with no head or facial injuries to rule out concurrent TBI. The mTBI group had skeletal or body AIS scores of less than 3 with no surgical intervention; the modTBI group had AIS scores of less than 4.\n32\n\nProcedure\nOnce deemed eligible, families were contacted for participation by trained research staff at the hospital or following discharge. Of the 533 subjects screened (TBI\u2009=\u2009241, EI\u2009=\u2009292), 220 were eligible for the study (TBI\u2009=\u2009144, EI\u2009=\u200976), and 129 subjects completed all assessment measures at seven weeks after injury (TBI\u2009=\u200989, EI\u2009=\u200940). All data and measures from participants and their parents were collected at the 7-week visit. Parents self-reported their education and the child's ethnicity and provided retrospective ratings of their child's pre-injury functioning. Children completed self-reported measures of current PCS and PTSS.\n\nMeasures\nSelf-report\nThe Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory-Self Report (PCSI-SR) was administered to evaluate total PCS and somatic, cognitive, emotional, and fatigue factor scores in children ages 8-15.\n5\nParticipants used one of two forms of the 20-item test based on their age at injury (PCSI-SR8 for children ages 8-12, and PCSI-SR13 for children ages 13 and older). The test has a high internal consistency (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.94). Higher scores indicate more PCS.\nThe Child Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Symptom Scale (CPSS) evaluated total PTSS and re-experiencing, active avoidance, emotional numbing, and hyperarousal factor scores.\n33\nThe first 17 items of the test were used to determine total CPSS and the factor scores. The CPSS is a validated measure of PTSS, with high internal consistency (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.89) and test-retest reliability (\nr\n=\u20090.84). Higher scores indicate more PTSS.\nParent report\nPCSI-Parent Report assessed children's pre-injury PCS symptoms. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) internalizing and externalizing subscale T-scores normalized for age- and sex-assessed participants' pre-injury psychological adjustment.\n34\nThe CBCL has excellent internal consistency (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.90-0.94) and test\u2013retest reliability (\nr\n=\u20090.7-0.8). Higher scores indicate more symptoms.\nThe Psychosocial Adversity Index (PAI) assesses exposure to key adverse childhood events: severe marital discord, low socioeconomic status, large family size, investigation by a protective service agency, parental criminal conviction, and the treatment of parental mental health problems.\n35\nIndicators were summed; higher scores indicate greater adversity.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll participants with parent ratings of pre-injury functioning and self-reported symptoms 7-weeks post-injury were included. Demographic variables were analyzed for each TBI group (mTBI, cm/modTBI, sTBI) and the EI group using three-way analysis of variance, chi-square, or Kruskall-Wallace statistics depending on the distribution of scores. Spearman bivariate correlations were used to analyze the strength of relationship between post-injury PCSI-SR and CPSS for each injury group. Generalized linear models with a negative binomial distribution and log link function were utilized to evaluate the main effects of age at injury (continuous variable), sex, and injury group, and their interactions for total and factor scores for the PCSI-SR and CPSS. CBCL internalizing and externalizing symptoms and PAI were evaluated as potential covariates and retained in models if\np\n<\u20090.10. Nonsignificant interactions and covariates were trimmed. The PCSI-SR models controlled for pre-injury parent PCSI ratings and the PCSI-SR form type (ages 8-12, ages 13-15). Due to extreme outliers, the PCSI-SR and pre-injury parent report data were winsorized at 2.5 standard deviations away from the mean for 23 data points for 11 participants. Injury group comparisons were adjusted using Bonferroni statistics. A two-tailed significance of \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05 was used in all analyses."

    "Methods": "Practical approaches to phenotyping broadly divide into three areas: 1) model-based approaches such as latent class analysis (LCA), which constructs a model that assigns each case to its most representative phenotype using maximum likelihoods; 2) supervised machine-learning methods, which identify phenotypes associated with labeled data (e.g., by constructing decision tree ensembles); and 3) unsupervised machine-learning methods (typically non-parametric clustering) that search for inherent patterns and similarities between observations without the need for labels (e.g., without needing to know clinical outcomes).\n\nModel-based approaches like LCA can uncover multiple distinct latent classes within TBI observations.9In LCA, each case is assigned to any one of a set of pre-defined classes, according to its position on latent variable scale(s) derived from multi-variate data. To do this, LCA finds a set of model parameters estimated by the maximum likelihood method that optimally fits the case data. LCA is controllable and intuitive, although there is empirical evidence that rudimentary machine-learning methods can outperform LCA for medical phenotyping.10\n\nSupervised learning methods, such as binomial regression, can also be used to infer predictors of TBI subtypes.11,12Decision trees and random forests are also popular examples of supervised learning for TBI classification.7Whereas supervised approaches predict states from a set of labeled observations, unsupervised methods\u2014like principal component analysis (PCA) and topological data analysis13\u2014allow us to probe natural patterns within data.2\n\nMore-recent unsupervised methods,14such as hierarchical density-based scanning (HDBSCAN),15can improve noise tolerance beyond traditional methods likek-means clustering, while also allowing for the separation of arbitrary cluster shapes (e.g., non-normal cluster presentations). Novel dimensionality reduction techniques, such as uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP),16can complement clustering and phenotyping in high dimensions, because they can preserve the distances between high-dimensional observations in a more easily visualized, low-dimensional representation, while also maintaining a degree of global stability. However, more-sophisticated unsupervised methods, such as UMAP and HDBSCAN, have yet to be applied to TBI phenotyping."

The control group was found to be comparable to the mTBI group on a broad range of personal factors.\n40\nThe study was approved by the regional committee for research ethics (REK 2013/754), and participants and parents of participants younger than 18 years gave informed consent.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging\nPatients with mTBI underwent MRI on a 3T Siemens Skyra system (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) with a 32-channel head coil, the majority (91%) within 72\u2009h after injury (mean 52\u2009h\u2009\u00b1\u200919\u2009h, range 5-130\u2009h). A radiologist and a resident in radiology reported the following MRI sequences: 1) three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE); 2) two-dimensional diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI); 3) 3D T2 space; 4) 3D T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery; and 5) 3D T2-weighted susceptibility-weighted imaging, previously reported in detail.\n37\nPatients with visible traumatic intracranial lesions had complicated mTBI, while those without had uncomplicated mTBI.\nThe DTI/DKI sequence was a single-shot balanced-echo EPI sequence acquired in 30 non-collinear directions with 3 b-values (b\u2009=\u20090, b\u2009=\u20091000 and, b\u2009=\u20092,000\u2009sec/mm\n2\n). The following parameters were used: repetition time 8800\u2009msec, echo time 95\u2009msec, field of view 240\u2009\u00d7\u2009240\u2009mm, slice thickness 2.5\u2009mm, acquisition matrix 96\u2009\u00d7\u200996. Sixty transversal slices with no gaps were acquired, giving full brain coverage. Five images without diffusion weighting were acquired to increase signal-to-noise ratio. To correct for image distortion, two additional b0 images were acquired with opposite phase encoding polarity.\n41\nDetails on DTI and DKI data processing are described in the\nSupplementary Material\n.\n\nPersistent post-concussion symptoms\nPPCS were assessed at 3 months after injury with the British Columbia Postconcussion Symptom Inventory (BC-PSI).\n42\nBC-PSI consists of 13 core symptoms distributed over four symptom categories (i.e., somatic, emotional, cognitive, and sleep disturbance), and three life problems, distributed over two additional symptom categories (i.e., reduced tolerance to alcohol; preoccupation with the symptoms and fear of permanent brain damage). The respondents rate the frequency and severity of each symptom during the past 2 weeks. These scores are combined into a single score representing the frequency and severity of each symptom (range 0-4). The sum of the 13 core symptoms constitutes the total score. PPCS was defined as having \u22653 core symptoms rated at least moderate (score \u22653), or a total score of 13\u201352 (i.e., 52 is the highest possible score).\n40\n\nEstimated pre-injury intelligence and cognitive reserve\nThe Vocabulary subtest from the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence,\n43\n,\n44\nwas used as an estimate of pre-injury intelligence and a proxy of cognitive reserve\n45\nand was administered 2 weeks after the injury. The task entails explaining the meaning of 42 words; 2 points are given for a correctly explained word and 1 point for a partly correct explanation. The Vocabulary subtest is considered an estimate of general mental ability\n46\nand test performance has been shown to be unaffected by cognitive impairment following mTBI.\n47\n,\n48\n\nStatistical analysis\nDemographic variables were examined with t-tests, Mann-Whitney U-tests, and chi-squared tests. Voxel-wise statistical analysis of the diffusion data was performed using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS).\n49\nDifferences in diffusion metrics between patients with PPCS, patients without PPCS, and the control group (i.e., three comparisons) were analyzed with the Randomize tool in fMRIB Software Library, a non-parametric, permutation-based method using threshold-free cluster enhancement with correction for multiple comparisons (family-wise error rate).\n50\nA\np\nvalue of <0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons, was considered statistically significant. Age, age\n2\n, sex, and scanner upgrade (due to scanner upgrade from version D13 to E11 during the inclusion period) were controlled for in all analyses. Because diffusion metrics show a non-linear association with age through adulthood (e.g., FA peaks around the age of 30), both age and age\n2\nwere included in all models.\n51\nThe lowest corrected\np\nvalue and the number of significant voxels in each contrast were extracted. Eight diffusion metrics were examined: fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), kurtosis fractional anisotropy (KFA), mean kurtosis (Kmean), axial kurtosis (Kax), and radial kurtosis (Krad).\nAll analyses were performed with the patients with complicated mTBI both included (the total sample) and excluded (the uncomplicated sample). Analyses also were performed with vocabulary scores included as an additional covariate, to investigate whether differences in cognitive reserve between groups affected the results."

    "Methods": "Study participants\nData were collected from 125 individuals (\nn\n=\u200960 patients with subacute TBI,\nn\n=\u200932 patients with chronic TBI, and\nn\n=\u200933 CTRLs). All participants were 18\u201355 years old and reported English as their primary language. The subacute TBI sample patients were recruited through the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center (UNM-HSC)'s Department of Emergency Medicine after having arrived at the hospital because of a self-reported loss of consciousness (LOC) event of \u226430\u2009min, and had a Glasgow Coma Scale score between 13 and 15. These inclusion criteria exceed the minimum requirement for diagnosing mTBI as outlined by most published recommendations.\n25\nSubacute patients were excluded from participating if they had a history of seizures or previous head injury.\nPatients with chronic TBI were also referred by UNM-HSC's Emergency Department or from other Emergency Departments and clinics, from patient recruitment services, or through advertisements in the community. The chronic TBI sample comprised both mild and moderate injuries, and therefore eligibility allowed for LOC up to 24\u2009h, required for head injury to have occurred 3 months to 15 years before testing, and participant must have reported at least one current cognitive symptom on the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory.\n26\nThe majority of the chronic TBI group (20/26 of the final chronic TBI sample) had a single mild TBI, whereas a small subset experienced either multiple injuries or a moderate TBI. This variation in TBI history and severity was also taken into consideration (see\nsection Control models\n).\nA group of nonbrain-injured control participants was recruited from the community, and participants were required to self-report 0 traumatic events with LOC during a phone screen to be eligible for the study.\nParticipants in all three groups did not have a current or recent history of substance abuse, did not have a history of other neurological or major psychiatric disorder, and did not have any contraindications to MRI. Twenty-seven participants were excluded because of excessive head motion during MRI (n\u2009=\u20093 CTRL,\nn\n=\u20092 subacute TBI, and\nn\n=\u20092 chronic TBI; see section Image pre-processing), incomplete MRI or Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe) data (\nn\n=\u20092 CTRL,\nn\n=\u200911 subacute TBI, and\nn\n=\u20095 chronic TBI), or not meeting LOC inclusion criteria (\nn\n=\u20092 subacute TBI). This left a final sample of N\u2009=\u200998 participants (\nn\n=\u200944 patients with subacute TBI,\nn\n=\u200926 patients with chronic TBI, and\nn\n=\u200928 CTRL participants;\nTable 1\n).\nTable 1.\nParticipant Demographic Information\nVariable\nCTRL\nTBI-Subacute\nTBI-Chronic\nN\n28\n44\n26\nProp.

Therefore, years of education was considered as a potential covariate (see\nsection Control Models\n).\n\nNeuropsychological assessment\nApathy\nThe FrSBe was used to obtain self-reported apathy symptoms for all participants.\n27\nFeatured in the FrSBe are 46 total items with the apathy subscale comprising 14 items (e.g., \u201csit around doing nothing,\u201d \u201cget involved with activities spontaneously,\u201d and \u201cdo things without being requested to do so\u201d). Items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale (almost never, seldom, sometimes, frequently, and almost always). The raw apathy scores were the sum of 10 normally scored items and four reverse-scored items. The raw scores were converted to T-scores according to the FrSBe Professional Manual.\n27\nClinically significant apathy on the FrSBe is defined as a T-score of \u226565 (grey line in\nFig. 1\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSelf-reported apathy as a function of group, which was significantly higher in the subacute and chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI) groups relative to control (CTRL; all\np\nHOLM\n\u2264 0.04). Gray line indicates clinically significant apathy. FrSBe, Frontal Systems Behavior Scale.\nDemographics and other symptoms questionnaires\nAll participants completed a demographic questionnaire, and the patients provided additional information regarding the nature of their TBI (of particular importance: severity and time since injury). Participants also completed the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System\n28\nbattery, which provided patient-reported levels of depression, anxiety, and fatigability that were particularly important to take into account given their potential to share overlapping variance with patient apathy.\n\nImage acquisition, processing, and analysis\nImage acquisition\nAll MRI scans were acquired on a 3T Siemens Tim Trio system with a 32-channel phased-array head coil. The T1-weighted (T1w) structural MRI was acquired via a multi-echo MPRAGE sequence (5-echo; voxel size\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm iso), and rsfMRI data were acquired with a single-shot, gradient-echo echoplanar pulse sequence using simultaneous multi-slice technology (repetition time\u2009=\u2009460\u2009msec; multi-band factor\n=\n8; 3.02\u2009\u00d7\u20093.02\u2009\u00d7\u20093.00\u2009mm voxels). Acquired images off the scanner were converted from DICOM to Brain Imaging Data Structure format\n29\nusing Heudiconv v.0.5.4.\n30\nImage preprocessing\nResults included in this article come from pre-processing performed using fMRIprep v.1.5.0\n31\n,\n32\n(RRID:SCR_016216), which is based on Nipype v.1.2.2\n33\n,\n34\n(RRID:SCR_002502).\nAnatomical data preprocessing\nThe T1w image was corrected for intensity nonuniformity (INU) with N4BiasFieldCorrection,\n35\ndistributed with ANTs v.2.2.0\n36\n(RRID:SCR_004757), and used as T1w-reference throughout the workflow. The T1w-reference was then skull-stripped with a Nipype implementation of the\nantsBrainExtraction.sh\nworkflow (from ANTs), using OASIS30ANTs as target template. Brain tissue segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white matter (WM), and gray matter (GM) was performed on the brain-extracted T1w using FAST (FSL v.5.0.9\n37\n; RRID:SCR_002823). Brain surfaces were reconstructed using recon-all (FreeSurfer v.6.0.1; RRID:SCR_001847\n38\n), and the brain mask estimated previously was refined with a custom variation of the method to reconcile ANTs-derived and FreeSurfer-derived segmentations of the cortical GM of Mindboggle (RRID:SCR_002438\n39\n).\nVolume-based spatial normalization to one standard space (MNI152NLin2009cAsym) was performed through nonlinear registration with antsRegistration (ANTS v.2.2.0), using brain-extracted versions of both T1w reference and the T1w template. The following template was selected for spatial normalization: ICBM 152 Nonlinear Asymmetrical template version 2009c\n40\n(RRID:SCR_008796; TemplateFlow ID: MNI152NLin2009cAsym).\nFunctional data pre-processing\nFor the BOLD run, the following pre-processing was performed. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of fMRIprep. A deformation field to correct for susceptibility distortions was estimated based on fMRIPrep's fieldmap-less approach. The deformation field is that resulting from coregistering the BOLD reference to the same-subject T1w-reference with its intensity inverted.\n41\n,\n42\nRegistration is performed with antsRegistration (ANTs v.2.2.0) and the process regularized by constraining deformation to be nonzero only along the phase-encoding direction, and modulated with an average fieldmap template.\n43\nBased on the estimated susceptibility distortion, an unwarped BOLD reference was calculated for a more accurate coregistration with the anatomical reference. The BOLD reference was then coregistered to the T1w reference using bbregister (FreeSurfer), which implements boundary-based registration.\n44\nCoregistration was configured with six degrees of freedom. Head-motion parameters with respect to the BOLD reference (transformation matrices and six corresponding rotation and translation parameters) are estimated before any spatiotemporal filtering using MCFLIRT (FSL v.5.0.9\n45\n).\nBOLD runs were slice-time corrected using 3dTshift from AFNI 20160207\n46\n(RRID:SCR_005927). The BOLD time-series were resampled to surfaces on the following spaces: fsaverage5. The BOLD time-series (including slice-timing correction when applied) were resampled onto their original, native space by applying a single, composite transform to correct for head-motion and susceptibility distortions. These resampled BOLD time-series will be referred to as pre-processed BOLD in original space, or just pre-processed BOLD.\nThe BOLD time-series were resampled into standard space, generating a pre-processed BOLD run in MNI152NLin2009cAsym space. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of fMRIprep. Several confounding time-series were calculated based on the pre-processed BOLD: framewise displacement (FD), DVARS, and three region-wise global signals. The FD and DVARS are calculated for each functional run, both using their implementations in Nipype (following the definitions by Power and associates\n47\n). The three global signals are extracted within the CSF, the WM, and the whole-brain masks.\nIn addition, a set of physiological regressors were extracted to allow for component-based noise correction (CompCor\n48\n). Principal components are estimated after high-pass filtering the pre-processed BOLD time-series (using a discrete cosine filter with 128\u2009sec cutoff) for the two CompCor variants: temporal (tCompCor) and anatomical (aCompCor). The tCompCor components are then calculated from the top 5% variable voxels within a mask covering the subcortical regions. This subcortical mask is obtained by heavily eroding the brain mask, which ensures it does not include cortical GM regions. For aCompCor, components are calculated within the intersection of the aforementioned mask and the union of CSF and WM masks calculated in T1w space, after their projection to the native space of each functional run (using the inverse BOLD-to-T1w transformation).\nComponents are also calculated separately within the WM and CSF masks. For each CompCor decomposition, the k components with the largest singular values are retained, such that the retained components' time-series are sufficient to explain 50% of variance across the nuisance mask (CSF, WM, combined, or temporal). The remaining components are dropped from consideration. The head-motion estimates calculated in the correction step were also placed within the corresponding confounds file. The confound time-series derived from head motion estimates and global signals were expanded with the inclusion of temporal derivatives and quadratic terms for each.\n49\nFrames that exceeded a threshold of 0.5\u2009mm FD or 1.5 standardized DVARS were annotated as motion outliers.\nAll resamplings can be performed with a single interpolation step by composing all the pertinent transformations (i.e., head-motion transform matrices, susceptibility distortion correction when available, and coregistrations to anatomical and output spaces). Gridded (volumetric) resamplings were performed using antsApplyTransforms (ANTs), configured with Lanczos interpolation to minimize the smoothing effects of other kernels.\n50\nNongridded (surface) resamplings were performed using mri_vol2surf (FreeSurfer). Many internal operations of fMRIprep use Nilearn v.0.5.2\n51\n(RRID:SCR_001362), mostly within the functional processing workflow.\n2\nFC analysis\nSeed-to-voxel FC maps were estimated in the CONN Toolbox v.19b\n52\n(RRID:SCR_009550), using a vmPFC seed from a previous publication on apathy and reward-guided decision-making in an independent chronic TBI cohort (\nFig. 2A\n8\n). Data input to CONN had completed pre-processing via fMRIprep, and FC was modeled using a bivariate correlation-based weighted generalized linear model. Notably, motion outliers defined via fMRIprep were excluded in first-level FC models, and we removed any participants who exceeded this scrubbing threshold on \u226550% of timepoints.\n53\u201355\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\n(\nA\n)\nA priori\nventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) region of interest (ROI) from lesion-symptom mapping study on apathy and reward valuation impairments in an independent cohort of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI).\n8\n(\nB\n) vmPFC ROI demonstrated positive functional connectivity (FC) to the canonical default mode network and negative FC to several task-positive functional networks across the sample. (\nC\n) Decreased vmPFC FC to dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) was present in the TBI subgroup with clinical apathy symptoms, but was not present in TBI patients with low apathy scores. (\nD,E\n) vmPFC-dACC FC was negatively associated with apathy in patients with TBI, but not CTRL participants. (\nF\n) This pattern did not vary across subacute and chronic patients with TBI. Note: fMRI surfaces in panel (B) wholebrain corrected at\np\nFWE\n< 0.05, panel (C) height thresholded at\np\n<\u20090.001 for display purposes. Gray line on E,F indicates clinically significant apathy scores.\nIn addition, in line with the standard CONN Toolbox recommendations, aCompCor component-based denoising from fMRIprep was adopted, but not tCompCor.\n56\n,\n57\nTo briefly restate, the aCompCor procedure run within fMRIprep extracts signal components in regions of interest (ROIs) where signal fluctuations are unlikely to reflect neuronal activity (i.e., WM and CSF), and uses those components to reduce the influence of physiological artifacts in GM.\n48\nSecond-level FC models were height thresholded at\np\n<\u20090.001, and cluster corrected using a conservative whole brain familywise error correction (\np\nFWE\n<0.05).\nIn our first step, we ran a one-sample\nt\ntest to determine the wholebrain FC pattern of our vmPFC ROI, which was followed by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on vmPFC-wholebrain connectivity with group (i.e., subacute TBI, chronic TBI, and CTRL) as a factor. Next, we ran regression models examining the extent to which vmPFC-wholebrain FC was related to apathy, including both a constant and a demeaned apathy term as regressors in the model. We ran these FC regressions separately within CTRLs and TBI patients, given the significant differences in apathy across groups (\nsee Results\n).\nIn addition, given the hypothesized association between ventral striatum-dACC connectivity and apathy in neurological disorders,\n58\nthe TBI FC regression was also run with nucleus accumbens as the seed ROI (run separately by hemisphere; accumbens masks via the Harvard-Oxford Probabilistic Subcortical Atlas).\nTo provide further support that any observed effects in the TBI regression models were related to apathy\nper se\n, we ran a control model including covariates for head motion (FD), time since injury (log[days]), injury severity (given some chronic patients had a moderate TBI), the two other FrSBe subscores (disinhibition and executive dysfunctioning), as well as other affective and somatic constructs that share overlapping variance with apathy (namely: anxiety, depression, and fatigability).\nYet, statistically controlling for these variables as model covariates has limited utility,\n59\nand to further validate our TBI apathy regression model, we also put it through a repeated k-fold cross-validation using the caret package in R v.3.5.0\n60\n,\n61\n(RRID:SCR_001905). Briefly, this procedure involved dividing the dataset into k\u2009=\u200910 nonoverlapping folds, with each fold given the opportunity to be used as a test dataset to verify the model fit while all other folds are used as training datasets. This k-fold procedure was repeated 10 times to provide maximally reliable parameter estimates. In addition, given that the subacute group had stricter requirements for TBI verification than the chronic group, we repeated this k-fold cross-validation focusing specifically on the subacute group to confirm that any observed effects were driven by TBI-related apathy\nper se\n(see\nsection Control models\n).\nLast, to determine the direction of any observed apathy-related vmPFC FC effects in the TBI regression (i.e., whether they might be related to pathological changes in vmPFC FC and in patients with high apathy scores, or compensatory changes in FC that may promote resilience to apathy development after a TBI), we ran group-wise one-way ANOVAs on any significant FC effects observed in our regression contrasting CTRL, TBI patients with clinically significant apathy (TBI\napathy\n:\nT\n\u2265\u200965;\nn\n=\u200931), and TBI patients with apathy scores below clinical threshold (TBI\nlow_apathy\n:\nT\n<\u200965;\nn\n=\u200939)."

    "Methods": "Participants\nTRACK-TBI is a prospective, observational study that enrolled 2698 TBI patients across the life span (ages 0\u201399 years) and spectrum of injury from severe to mild (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score 3\u201315), from February 26, 2014 through July 27, 2018. English- or Spanish-speaking participants were enrolled within 24\u2009h of injury at 18 U.S. Level I trauma centers. All participants had a head computed tomography scan ordered as part of their clinical care. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found on the TRACK-TBI Web page.\n20\nParticipants were followed at 2 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months post-injury. Surviving participants \u226517 years of age with TBI were included in this analysis if at least one of the four GOSE follow-up assessments was completed and the participant had not withdrawn consent. We divided the analysis into two time periods. From February 2014 to May 2016, TBI cases were recruited from the first 11 U.S. Level 1 trauma centers that participated in the study. These participants comprise cohort 1 (\nn\n=\u20091261). Beginning in June 2016, seven more centers were added to the study and participants were enrolled across the 18 sites between then and July 27, 2018 (cohort 2;\nn\n=\u20091130).\nFollowing the study objectives, cohort 1 enrolled TBI participants across three care pathways: roughly one third who were discharged directly from the emergency department (ED); one third who were admitted to the hospital but not the ICU; and one third who were admitted to the ICU. This distribution of cases resulted in a sample with mostly milder brain injuries. For cohort 2, the study objectives shifted to preferentially enroll those with more-severe injuries. All sites continued enrollment of patients admitted to the ICU or hospital. Only 7 of the 18 sites which were participating in a magnetic resonance imaging substudy continued enrollment of participants discharged from the ED. The study was approved by the institutional review board at each site, and all participants either consented for themselves or were consented by a legally authorized representative.\n\nAssessments\nGlasgow Outcome Scale-Extended\nThe GOSE is an 8-point scale representing levels of functioning ranging from death (1) to upper good recovery (8). The assessment is based on change from the pre-injury level of functioning and is administered using a semistructured interview format.\n2\nThe GOSE interview consists of standard questions covering eight areas of function; however, the interviewer is expected to ask additional questions to glean the information required to assess limitations within a specific section. The eight sections are: 1) level of consciousness; 2) assistance within the home; 3) independence outside the home for shopping; 4) independence outside the home for travel; 5) return to work or school; 6) social and leisure participation; 7) close relationships; and 8) return to normal life, as relates to symptoms. The assessor uses the responses to assign a functional level rating of vegetative state (rating of 2), lower or upper severe disability (rating of 3 or 4), lower or upper moderate disability (rating of 5 or 6), or lower or upper good recovery (rating of 7 or 8).\nThe overall GOSE rating is determined according to the lowest (worst) rating assigned in any section for which the response signifies a change in function from pre-injury status. All sections of the GOSE were administered, irrespective of answers provided on earlier sections, unless the participant was deceased or in a vegetative state. Participants with disturbance in consciousness were evaluated using the Coma Recovery Scaled-Revised\n21\nto determine whether they were in a vegetative state.\nAs discussed by Wilson and colleagues (1998),\n2\nthe GOSE can be administered either to include effects of peripheral injuries and other consequences of the injury in addition to the effects of the TBI (referred to here as GOSE-All) or by parsing the effects of the TBI only (GOSE-TBI).\n22\nIn either case, the rating reflects change from pre-injury status. Initially, TRACK-TBI considered only the effects of the TBI in the GOSE ratings. Approximately 9 months into data collection, the protocol was changed and both ratings\u2014GOSE-All and GOSE-TBI\u2014were obtained at each assessment. In each section, except for that assessing level of consciousness, the assessor first queried the level of functional limitation associated with the overall injury and then asked the interviewee to assess the functional limitations attributed to just the TBI. This was referred to by the TRACK-TBI study, and hereafter in this article, as the \u201cGOSE 2-ways interview.\u201d The lowest (worst) rating in any section that indicated a change from pre-injury function determined the overall GOSE-All rating. The overall GOSE\u2013TBI rating was based on the lowest (worst) rating in any section attributed to only the TBI. The decision to obtain the two GOSE scores was made to allow comparison of the TRACK-TBI results with those from the longitudinal, observational CENTER-TBI study,\n23\nwhich acquired only GOSE-All ratings.\nPatient/Surrogate interviews\nAn interview completed at the time of enrollment, by the participant or their surrogate, collected pre-injury information, including work and school status and living situation.\nAt each follow-up period, participants, or a close family member in the case of the more severely injured, completed a post-injury follow-up interview. This interview documented current status and the reason for any change from the pre-injury situation. Both interviews were created by the TRACK-TBI outcome core leadership team guided by NINDS TBI Common Data Elements.\n\nAssessor training\nBefore opening enrollment, outcome assessors from the first 11 sites received instruction in the administration of the GOSE and other outcome measures at a 2-day in-person training session convened by TRACK-TBI's outcome core leadership and conducted by appointed team members. Nine months into data collection, training was conducted by telephone to introduce the GOSE 2-ways assessment. When the seven new sites were added, another in-person training session was held for assessors from all 18 sites. The second session was designed to address problem areas in administering and scoring the GOSE that had been identified by the TRACK-TBI Outcomes Core leadership team. The Standard Operating Procedures for Outcome Assessment Manual (SOP),\n24\nwith specific guidance for the administration of the GOSE based on material codified in the Wilson and colleagues Manual published concurrently,\n14\nwas posted to the TRACK-TBI Web site and provided to assessors.\nAll assessors joining the study at any time were required to practice administering the GOSE with mock participants. TRACK-TBI outcome assessors ranged in level of education from a bachelor's degree to PhD or MD, with a BA or MA being the most common. Many outcome assessors had previous outcome evaluation experience as well as experience in the field of TBI. Assessors submitted a video demonstration of their mock administration, which was reviewed by a central review team member (S.T., K.B.) who confirmed their competence to administer the GOSE. Thereafter, source documents (paper copies) of two cases from each assessor were reviewed, and the data, as entered into the electronic database, were double checked. Assessors were instructed to record significant information influencing the determination of a section rating on the source document. In addition to this, a text field was added to the GOSE in the data capture system, allowing this pertinent information to be available for review and remain as part of the permanent record.\nRandom checks of \u223c10% of all GOSEs administered per site were conducted by reviewing the database for logical consistency among items on the GOSE and comparing GOSE responses with the pre-injury interview and the post-injury follow-up interview(s). For example, a participant coded as currently living alone on the Patient/Surrogate interview but coded as dependent within the home on the GOSE would result in a query. The results of this database review, intended as another training opportunity, were sent to site assessors, noting any discrepancies, scoring inconsistencies, missing data, or data entry errors. Site assessors were asked to review their data, resolve the inconsistencies or errors, and make any necessary corrections. Monthly conference calls for site outcome assessors with the TRACK-TBI Outcomes Core leadership team provided continued training, with discussion of ambiguous situations and cases as well as review of training scenarios and SOPs.\n\nCuration procedure\nFigure 1\nshows the curation process used to review GOSEs.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nCuration procedure diagram. GOSE, Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended.\nCuration of all GOSEs began \u223c2 years into the study. An audit log was created within the electronic database. Beginning with the first participant and working through the data set, each GOSE assessment for every participant was reviewed. Central reviewers (K.B., J.M., and G.S.) examined the pre-injury and post-injury follow-up interviews and the GOSE for consistency in the information recorded (\nFig. 1\n). Any apparent inconsistencies, missing data points, or unusual combinations of responses were documented within the audit log. If there were no issues, the audit log was closed. Otherwise, queries were sent to the appropriate site for assessor review. The site assessor was asked to review source documents (paper copies) for relevant notes and confirm that data entry was correct. The assessor indicated within the audit log what action had been taken after this review. The options included: 1) correction made; 2) no changes needed, correct as is; or 3) no changes, insufficient information on the source documents to make a correction.\nTwo types of corrections could be made to the GOSE. The first was a correction to the rating in a specific section of the GOSE, for example, reduced work capacity (score\u2009=\u20096) changed to unable to work (score\u2009=\u20095). Such a change did not necessarily affect the overall rating, given that the overall rating may have been determined by another section within the GOSE that received a lower score. Changes to ratings in a specific section were tallied because the section ratings themselves have been used as outcomes.\n25\nThe second type of correction was to the overall GOSE rating(s) (GOSE-All, GOSE-TBI, or both). The final determination as to whether a correction was warranted rested with the site assessors, not the central reviewers. Review of GOSEs ranged from 6 months to 3 years after administration for cohort 1. Cohort 2 reviews occurred from days to a few months after administration and completion of data entry.\nBecause the review process was not conducted immediately after the assessment, corrections to rating changes requiring judgment or subjective information relied on notes written contemporaneously with the evaluation by the assessor. In the case of those without documentation to justify a change in rating, the GOSE was not changed. It is important to note that all articles published by TRACK-TBI using GOSE data were submitted after the vast majority of the curation process had been completed.\nCommon scenarios in the query process to confirm consistency in data collection across the GOSE and the interviews are presented in Boxes 1 and 2 and\nSupplementary Box S1\n.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe analyses were largely descriptive. Weighted and unweighted kappa statistics were calculated to evaluate the degree of agreement between the original and post-curation scores. These analyses were performed using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc., Cary NC)"

    "Methods": "Design\nThis study formed part of a larger prospective, longitudinal study (Take CARe Biomarkers\u2014Concussion Assessment and Recovery research)\n23\nconducted at The Royal Children's Hospital (RCH), a tertiary level pediatric hospital in Melbourne, Australia. The study recruited and assessed children presenting with concussion to the hospital emergency department (ED), and performed follow-up in person assessments at 1-4 days, 2 weeks, 1 month (if symptomatic), and 3 months post-injury. Multiple domains were assessed at each time-point (concussive symptoms, neurocognition, behavior, quality of life, fatigue, etc.), with neuroimaging acquisition occurring at the 2-week assessment.

For children 12 years and younger, written informed consent was obtained from the parent/guardian and verbal assent from the child. Ethics approval for this study was given by The RCH Human Research Ethics Committee.\nOne participant was excluded from the sample due to poor-quality image acquisition caused by their orthodontic braces and another participant was excluded due to MRI acquisition error; these participants were excluded listwise. One participant was excluded pairwise from the SWI analysis due to poor quality image acquisition and two participants did not complete the rs-fMRI protocol.

If a patient met the inclusion criteria and their treating physician confirmed their eligibility, families were approached to participate in the study.\nOnce consent was granted, pre-injury and demographic information were obtained from parents in the ED and parent and the child completed the PCSI. Injury-related information was obtained from the treating clinician. Participants were then followed up, either by attending a concussion clinic in person or by responding to questionnaires online, at the 1-4 day, 2-week, 1-month (if symptomatic), and 3-month time-points. For those attending the concussion clinic in person, neuroimaging was acquired at the 2-week time-point for all participants (range\u2009=\u20099-24 days post-injury). Participants were classified as normally recovering (\nn\n=\u200927) or delayed recovering (\nn\n=\u200914) at the 2-week time-point. Children were classified as having a delayed recovery if, at the 2-week period, parent responses on the PCSI showed that two or more of the child's symptoms showed increased severity when compared with reported pre-injury levels, in accordance with the criteria set out in Hearps and colleagues.\n9\n\nStatistical analysis\nSWI analysis\nSWI lesions were identified using a publicly available semi-automated SWI lesion detection tool (CMBdetection-LupoLab) created by the Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging at the University of California San Francisco.\n28\nTraining data provided with the SWI lesion detection toolkit were created on adult brain tumor patients with radiological evidence of cerebral microbleeds following radiation therapy, and as such it was deemed necessary to create training data based on the current dataset to ensure the detection tool was properly calibrated. Lesion count and size were compared between the normally recovering children and the children with delayed recovery.\nRs-fMRI analysis\nResting state fMRI images were preprocessed using FSL MELODIC independent component analysis (ICA): motion correction was applied using MCFLIRT, followed by 5\u2009mm full width half maximum spatial smoothing, and high-pass temporal filtering.\n29\n,\n30\nSingle session ICAs were conducted on each participant with variance-normalized time-courses and unconstrained automatic dimensionality estimation. Component maps were thresholded at 0.5. The component maps for all subjects were visually inspected with noise artifacts removed from the data using FSL_regfit. The images were then registered in one step from subject space to MNI standard space using FSL packages FLIRT, FNIRT, and applywarp.\n30\nThe cleaned subject data was then combined to generate a group average ICA for all 127 remaining components using FSL's MELODIC before being prepared for group level analysis using dual regression (FSL's dual_regression). FSL's permutation testing tool Randomize\n31\nwas used using default parameters to assess whether there was a difference in the resting state networks between normally recovering children and children with delayed recovery as a part of the dual_regression package.\nFigure 1\ndisplays the rs-fMRI analysis pipeline as a flow diagram.\nOpen in a separate window\nFig. 1.\nFlow diagram of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging analysis pipeline."

    "Methods": "Participants\nStudy participants were persons 10 years post-TBI who were enrolled in the TBIMS database at six centers and their proxy respondents, when appropriate. TBIMS National Database eligibility criteria include: age at injury \u226516 years; moderate-severe TBI (defined as post-traumatic amnesia [PTA] >24\u2009h, trauma-related intracranial neuroimaging abnormalities, loss of consciousness exceeding 30\u2009min, or Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] in the emergency department of <13); and acute-care hospitalization received within 72\u2009h, followed by inpatient rehabilitation in designated TBIMS facilities. TBIMS database participants at the six sites who were eligible for their 10-year follow-up window between July 1, 2013 and September 30, 2017 were consecutively recruited to form a cohort for this and earlier studies.\n19\n,\n26\nFor the current study, participants were additionally required to have completed year 5 and 10 interviews with complete FIM and DCI data. At each follow-up, information was collected primarily over the telephone from the participant with TBI unless the participant was unable to respond because of severe impairment or was unreachable; in these cases, information was obtained from a proxy, typically a family member or caregiver.\n\nMeasures and variables\nThe FIM\n27\nis an 18-item scale that assesses functional independence in Motor (13 items) and Cognition (five items), with each item scored 1 (complete dependence) through 7 (complete independence). For purposes of this study, the FIM Motor subscale was subdivided into FIM Self-Care (sum of the items for feeding, grooming, bathing, dressing upper body, dressing lower body, toileting, bladder management, and bowel management) and FIM Mobility (the sum of items for bed transfer, toilet transfer, tub transfer, locomotion, and stairs). FIM was administered by structured phone interview.\nDomain change indices\nDCIs were created to measure the respondent's overall perception of change from 5 to 10 years post-injury in four functional areas. Three of these scales were created to correspond to the subscales of the FIM: Personal Care (taking care of basic needs at home, corresponding to the Self-Care subscale); Physical Function (moving and getting around, corresponding to the Mobility subscale); and Mental Function (memory, communication, and social interaction, corresponding to the Cognitive FIM). A fourth DCI, querying changes in Emotional Function (mood and stress), was of interest for the current study but did not have parallel items on the FIM. For each DCI scale, participants or their proxy were asked: \u201cIn the area of _____, are you/ the patient doing better, worse, or about the same compared to 5 years ago?\u201d The DCI domain, interview questions, and corresponding FIM subscale are outlined in\nTable 1\n. DCI ratings were obtained during the 10-year post-injury interview.\nTable 1.\nDomain Change Indices (DCIs) and Corresponding Functional Independence Measure (FIM\nTM\n) Subscale and Items\nDCI domain\nDCI interview question\nCorresponding FIM subscale\nCorresponding FIM items\nPersonal Care (taking care of basic needs at home)\n\u201cIn the area of taking care of yourself and your basic needs at home, like eating, getting bathed and dressed and ready for the day and using the bathroom, are you/ the patient doing better, worse, or about the same compared to 5 years ago?\u201d\nFIM Self-Care\nFeeding\nGrooming\nBathing\nDressing upper body\nDressing lower body\nToileting\nBladder management\nBowel management\nPhysical Function (moving and getting around)\n\u201cIn the area of physical function, like moving around and getting around either on foot or in a wheelchair, getting up and down stairs, and getting in and out of bed, are you/ the patient doing better, worse, or about the same compared to 5 years ago?\u201d\nFIM Mobility\nBed transfer\nToilet transfer\nTub transfer\nLocomotion\nStairs\nMental Function (memory, communication, and social interaction)\n\u201cIn the area of mental function, like remembering things communicating and getting along with others, and solving everyday problems, are you/ the patient doing better, worse, or about the same compared to 5 years ago?\u201d\nFIM Cognitive\nComprehension\nExpression\nSocial interaction\nProblem solving\nMemory\nEmotional Function (mood and stress)\n\u201cIn the area of emotional function, like managing your moods and dealing with everyday stress, are you/ the patient doing better, worse, or about the same compared to 5 years ago?\u201d\nNo FIM parallel\nNo FIM parallel\nOpen in a separate window\nPsychosocial and injury-related variables\nRelevant demographic and injury characteristics were selected based on evidence in the earlier literature of their potential relationship with functional change from years 5 to 10. Age at injury, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, or other), GCS, GCS-Motor subscale, and PTA duration were collected during hospitalization. Marital status (married, not married), education level (high school diploma or less, greater than a high school diploma), FIM (Cognitive, Self-Care, and Mobility), brief measures of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire; PHQ-9) and anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder; GAD-7), and problematic substance use (Yes, No) were collected at follow-up year 5.\nPTA duration was calculated as the number of days between the TBI and the first of two occasions within a 72-h period in which the participant was fully oriented. Orientation was defined by a score >76 on the Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test,\n28\n>25 on the Orientation Log,\n29\nor documentation of 2 days with consistent orientation within a 3-day period in the acute medical record with no intervening days at less than full orientation. For those remaining in PTA at hospital discharge, duration of PTA was designated as the sum of acute care and rehabilitation length of stay plus 1 day. PTA was categorized based on the Mississippi PTA Intervals: 0\u201314, 15\u201328, 29\u201370, and >70 days.\n30\nPre-injury problematic substance use was deemed present if self-report or proxy report was positive for illicit drug use during the year before injury or alcohol consumption was heavy (>14 drinks per week for men and more than seven for women) or binge drinking (four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men within 2\u2009h) in the month preceding injury.\n31\n,\n32\nAlcohol use was assessed using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System\n31\nbased on guidelines for healthy use by sex.\n33\nEmotional function was assessed using the PHQ-9\n34\nand GAD-7.\n35\nThe PHQ-9 is a nine-item diagnostic tool for identifying the presence and severity of depression with scores ranging from 0 to 27, where higher scores indicate more-severe depression. The GAD-7 is a seven-item tool used for determining anxiety and ranges from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicative of worse anxiety. Assessment of depression and anxiety was limited to respondents with TBI; proxies were not administered these scales.\n\nProcedures\nInstitutional review board approval for human subject research was received at each center participating in this study. During their 10-year post-injury follow-up telephone interview, participants or their proxies were asked the DCI questions. Similarly, the FIM was obtained from the best source per TBIMS follow-up interview procedures. The same person provided both the FIM and the DCI data in a given interview.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe eligible sample included 404 participants. Of those, 32 were excluded because of incomplete FIM data at year 5 (\nn\n=\u200921, 66%) or year 10 (\nn\n=\u20095, 16%), or incomplete DCI data at year 10 (\nn\n=\u20096, 19%), for a final sample of 372 participants. Demographic and injury characteristics of the analytical sample and the excluded sample were summarized using means and standard deviations (SDs) or medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) for continuous variables and frequency counts and percentages for categorical variables. Two-sample\nt\n-tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, and chi-square tests were used to compare characteristics between the analytical sample and the excluded sample to assess for potential bias.\nPrimary analyses assessed the entire sample, including responses from both participants and proxies (\nn\n=\u2009372). Analyses were also conducted within subgroups of participant-only responses (\nn\n=\u2009294) and proxy responses (\nn\n=\u200974).\nThe relationship between the FIM change variables and their corresponding DCI ratings was tested for agreement and symmetry. Agreement was calculated using a weighted Cohen's kappa, and symmetry was tested using Bowker's test.\nChanges in FIM subscale scores from year 5 to 10 were calculated, and participants were categorized as \u201cDecline,\u201d \u201cNo Change,\u201d or \u201cImprove\u201d using the reliable change index (RCI).\n36\nThe RCI is calculated at a 5% level of significance as\nR\nC\nI\n=\n1\n.\n96\n\u00d7\nS\nD\n2\n1\n\u2212\nr\n, where SD is the standard deviation for the FIM variables at 5 years in the analytical sample and\nr\nis the test-retest intraclass correlation coefficient for that variable. Estimates of the intraclass correlation coefficients were taken from a test-retest reliability analyses for the FIM subscales (Cognitive\nr\n=\u20090.946, Self-Care\nr\n=\u20090.945, and Mobility\nr\n=\u20090.955).\n37\nTo be classified as changed (\u201cDecline\u201d or \u201cImprove\u201d) from year 5 to 10, the FIM had to increase or decrease at least by the amount of the RCI (or 0.5 SD) for the subscale. Distributions of DCI change (Worse, About the Same, and Better) reported at year 10 (relative to year 5) were summarized using frequency counts and percentages. In addition, improvements and declines across all FIM and DCI domains were evaluated.\nFinally, bivariate analyses were run between patient characteristics and FIM change (Cognitive, Self-Care, and Mobility) and DCI ratings (Mental Function, Personal Care, Physical Function, and Emotional Function) to assess which variables were associated with change in outcomes. Associations were tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests for continuous and categorical variables, respectively."

    "Methods": "Trial design\nThis was a phase 1, prospective, open-label, unblinded, non-randomized, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2013approved clinical trial (NCT02354625) designed to evaluate the safety of transplantation of ahSC in participants with chronic SCI. The trial was specifically designed to test the ahSC transplants in progressively more incomplete neurologic injuries (American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale [AIS] A to C), progressing from cavities in the thoracic to the cervical spinal cord\u2014escalating the risk and potential benefit in a step-wise fashion. Thus, each successive participant's transplant was based on the observation of a short-term safety readout from preceding SCI participants within the trial. Written informed consent was obtained in a two-step process ahead of screening and again before transplant from all study participants according to the protocol approved by the Human Subjects Research Office at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine (eProst #20140846).\nPotential participants underwent a screening process to determine eligibility. Following acceptance to the trial, participants were engaged in on-site study activities for 10 consecutive months (\nFig. 1\n) and have continued to be monitored for 5 years post-transplant. A week of baseline assessments (Baseline 1, Week 1) preceded any study interventions. A sural nerve harvest procedure was then performed (Week 2). Participants then engaged in fitness and rehabilitation training for 12 weeks (Weeks 3-14) at the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis. Baseline assessments were repeated (Baseline 2) to capture any changes resulting from participation in the fitness program. Transplantation of ahSC was performed at the University of Miami Hospital, and participants spent an average of 3-4 inpatient days in a step-down unit. Participants recuperated for 3-4 weeks following surgery, then resumed participation in the fitness and rehabilitation program with the principal investigator's approval. Assessments were repeated at 2 and 6 months post-ahSC transplantation. Participants were then enrolled in a separate, long-term follow-up protocol for 5 years post-transplant (eProst #20160034).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nStudy design and timeline of interventions.\nAt screening and regularly throughout the trial, all participants met with a neuropsychologist with SCI specialization who engaged them in a continuous informed consent framework that has been recommended when engaging vulnerable populations in research. In addition, the neuropsychologist provided additional education to the participant and their families specific to the trial and evaluated each person's capacity to provide informed consent, including a deep understanding that the primary objectives of the study were safety. Also important were the sense that the participants were engaged in the trial to advance the science and gaining an understanding of other reasons motivating participation. The neuropsychologist directly evaluated whether therapeutic misconception\n39\nwas occurring throughout the trial. In addition, potential psychological barriers to participation were assessed. As will be further elucidated upon in a subsequent manuscript, there was no evidence that therapeutic misconception was present in this sample of chronically injured individuals either at baseline or at the 6-month follow up assessment.\n\nInclusion/exclusion criteria\nIndividuals between the ages of 18 and 65 with traumatic SCI that occurred a minimum of 12 months prior to enrollment were considered for eligibility. NLI was between cervical-level 5 (C5) and thoracic-level 12 (T12), as defined by the International Standards for the Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI), with AIS grade A, B, or C at the time of enrollment. Lesion length was \u22643\u2009cm and lesion volume \u22642 cc, as approximated by MRI. Individuals with penetrating injuries and those who could not safely undergo MRI were excluded from the study. Additional details on eligibility criteria are available in the\nSupplementary Material\n.\n\nSural nerve harvest (Week 2)\nIn the operating room, after a careful sterile prep and drape, the lateral calf above the lateral malleolus was infiltrated with local anesthetic with 1% epinephrine after positioning the participant in the \u00be prone position. The sural nerve was identified, and an approximately 15cm segment was harvested for ahSC preparation by sharp dissection. The harvested sural nerve was transported in Belzer's transport media (Static Preservation Solution (SPS-1), Organ Recovery Systems, Inc., Chicago IL) at 2-8\u00b0C to Cell Processing Facility for further culture and expansion procedures.\nThe sural nerve was then processed to grow a purified population of SCs. Cell purity and concentration were estimated prior to transplantation. The cell processing protocol was published in a previous publication,\n26\nbut a few steps were distinct in this study. After ahSCs were purified and expanded to P1, the cells were cryopreserved. The cell manufacturing process for the cryopreserved cells resumed at 3-5 weeks prior to transplantation. The detailed cell processing protocol is available in the\nSupplementary Material\n.\n\nFitness and rehabilitation protocol\nA detailed description of the fitness and multi-modal rehabilitation protocol is presented in the\nSupplementary Material\n. In brief, for conditioning of lower extremities, participants underwent functional electrical stimulation cycle training on a cycle ergometer (Restorative Therapies RT300; RTI, Inc., Baltimore, MD) twice a week.\n37\nParticipants also underwent bi-weekly body-weight\u2013supported locomotor training. Participants with SCI classified as AIS A or B used a treadmill-based robotic gait orthosis (Lokomat, Hocoma Inc, Zurich, or ReoAmbulator, Motorika Medical, Ltd., Caesarea, Israel). Participants with SCI classified as AIS C underwent overground locomotor skill training to focus on walking-related and functional tasks. Upper extremity circuit resistance training sessions\n38\nwere performed in the participants' home three times a week on non-consecutive days.\n\nSchwann cell transplantation\nUnique to this study, the volume of the intramedullary cavity at the level of injury was calculated for all participants based on the pre-operative screening MRI and used to estimate the volume of cell product to be transplanted. The maximum volume that we proposed to deliver was 2\u2009mL (i.e., 200 million cells). The first two participants transplanted in cohort 1 received a maximum of 500\u2009\u03bcL (50 million cells) as mandated by the FDA as an initial safety step. For all other participants, we injected each cavity until it was filled with cell suspension.\nParticipants underwent the spinal surgical procedure in the prone position under general anesthesia, with monitoring of sensory and motor evoked potentials. The intramedullary cyst was visualized prior to opening the dura using intra-operative ultrasound imaging (Hitachi HI Vision Ascendus, Hitachi Medical Systems Europe Holding AG, Switzerland/12\u2009MHz linear array transducer on an IU22 scanner (Hitachi Aloka Medical America, Inc, Wallingford, CT). The extent of dural opening was determined based on intraoperative ultrasound and pre-operative MRI findings. The dorsal surface of the injured spinal cord was exposed after the dura was opened and tacked up. In distinction from the prior ahSC study, there was no need for apnea during injection using this method.\nA number 11 blade was used to make a small incision (1-2\u2009mm) parallel to the long axis of the spinal cord. Using a combination of scalpel tip and a blunt probe, a tract was gently defined, which entered the cystic cavity. Soft medical grade tubing (ID 0.31\u2009mm, OD 0.62\u2009mm) was inserted through the myelotomy into the cavity (\nFig. 2\n). The tubing, pre-filled with cells, was connected to an insulin syringe loaded with ahSC at 100,000 cells/\u03bcL. Initially, the injection proceeded at less than 50\u2009\u03bcL/min until there was visible egress of the cell suspension from the myelotomy, as visualized at high magnification under the surgical microscope. The egress was collected onto cotton surgical patties that encircled the myelotomy site to preclude distribution in the subarachnoid space. This injection continued until further egress occurred, and then a 2-min waiting period was observed. When the injection was complete, a pial purse-string suture was tightened around the delivery catheter as it was removed. When the catheter was outside of the spinal cord, a 9-0 pial purse string was placed and tightened and tied down to prevent cell egress from the myelotomy. Up to three injection attempts were made to fill compartmentalized cavities. The total volume delivered was recorded. The cord surface was observed for 5\u2009min for any evidence of cell leakage. The ultrasound probe was introduced to determine if the injectate was distributed throughout the cavity. The dura was then closed in a watertight fashion with 5-0 prolene sutures and covered with Duragen Plus (Integra, Plainsboro, NJ).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nIllustration\n(A-E)\nshowing pial opening (blue arrow), placement of tubing into injured cavity, injection of autologous human Schwann cells (ahSC; green) and closure of pial opening. Intraoperative view (right) with the surgical microscope showing insertion of tubing (black arrow) into the chronic cyst cavity for injection of ahSC.\n\nOutcome measures\nOutcomes in this study were classified as primary and secondary outcome measures for safety and trend toward efficacy. The primary outcome measures for safety included protocol compliance, feasibility, stability of neurological function, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes for safety included lack of emergence of sustained clinically significant neuropathic pain or spasticity, and the absence of a detectable mass lesion or cavity enlargement on MRI at 6 months follow-up. Basic blood chemistry for liver and kidney function also was monitored and will be reported in a separate article.\nPrimary outcome measures for trend-toward efficacy included neurological status assessed using the ISNCSCI exam, along with functional assessments of the upper and lower extremities, and measures of functional independence. Secondary outcome measures for trend-toward efficacy included assessment of bowel and bladder function, along with other parameters of autonomic function, fitness measures, spasticity measures, pain history, and pain-related sensory function, and self-reported function.\n\nPrimary outcomes related to safety\nCompliance with protocol-specified procedures was monitored, and deviations from the protocol were documented. Due to the lengthy and complex nature of this study, which involved an extensive screening process, rehabilitation interventions over 10 months, two elective surgical procedures, and multiple assessment periods, it was important to assess the feasibility of carrying out this type of study in individuals with chronic SCI. Adverse events and serious adverse events were monitored and documented, and relatedness to study associated procedures was determined. An independent data safety committee reviewed study protocols and progress, including all adverse events at regular intervals.\n\nSecondary outcomes related to safety\nParticipants were interviewed regarding their pain using the International SCI Pain Basic Dataset,\n40\nwhich contains basic questions for the worst, second-worst, and third-worst pain problems experienced. No changes to the participant's pre-trial pain medications were made after enrollment. They were also interviewed regarding the severity of neuropathic pain symptoms using the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI), which has recently been shown to be a valid and reliable measure for the SCI chronic pain population.\n41\nThe quantitative sensory testing (QST) assesses dorsal column-medial lemniscus (DCML; mechanical stimuli) and anterolateral spinothalamic (STT: noxious and thermal stimuli) mediated function/dysfunction and has been shown to be a valid and reliable measure in the SCI chronic pain population. Consistent with our previous protocols,\n42\nsensory thresholds were measured in painful and non-painful areas in dermatomes both at- and below-level of injury (L4) and were converted to Z-scores relative to a normative pain-free sample. Dynamic mechanical allodynia, thermal allodynia, directional cutaneous kinesthesia, and graphesthesia were evaluated if present. Tests for graphesthesia and directional cutaneous kinesthesia have recently been found to be reliable and valid assessments of DCML function in people with SCI.\n42\nThe Spinal Cord Assessment Tool for Spastic Reflexes was used to measure clonus, flexor, and extensor spastic reflex activity.\n43\nA composite score was calculated by summing up the bilateral scores (range, 0-18).\n44\nThe modified Ashworth Scale was used to measure stretch reflex responses of the hamstring and quadriceps muscles, and composite scores were calculated by summing up the bilateral scores.\n45\nThe pendulum test was used to measure spastic activity in the quadriceps muscles, and a 60\u2009Hz, 8-camera, three-dimensional motion capture system (Peak Motus\n\u00ae\nSoftware, Peak Performance, Centennial, CO) was used to capture kinematic data as published previously.\n46\nThe average of three trials was used to calculate the first swing excursion of the more spastic leg.\n\nImaging\nIn addition to the screening MRI, participants underwent MRI (1.5T magnet using metal artifact reduction sequences with and without contrast) of the spine before transplantation (if requested by the investigator), 1 day after transplantation, and at 2 months, 6 months, 2 years, and 5 years after transplantation to assess for unexpected changes in spinal cord structure or potential tumorigenesis. Following transplantation, the presence of edema, hemorrhage, and contrast-enhancement was determined. Lesion volume was determined by using the calibrated freehand measurement tool on serial axial images to calculate the area of signal abnormality multiplied by the cut thickness.\n\nPrimary outcomes for trend toward efficacy\nFor evaluation of neurological function, the ISNCSCI exam was performed by trained examiners at each assessment time point and used to determine AIS grade.\n47\nTesting of non-key muscles for hip extension, hip abduction, and knee flexion, along with wrist flexion, thumb flexion, and thumb extension, were also included. Pre-transplant ISNCSCI-related outcomes were averaged (Baseline 1 and Baseline 2) to account for variability.\nFunctional mobility and independence were assessed using The Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) Version III.\n48\nA substantial improvement was predefined as an improvement of 10 points, with an improvement of 4 points representing a \u201csmall significant improvement.\u201d\n49\nThe spinal cord injury-functional index (SCI-FI) computer adaptive test (CAT) (basic mobility, self-care, fine motor function, wheelchair mobility, and ambulation domains), the International Spinal Cord Injury (ISCI) Quality of Life (QOL) Basic Dataset, and Guy Farrar 7 Subject Global Impression of Change (SGIC) were used to document any changes perceived by the participant.\n50\n,\n51\n\nSecondary outcomes for trend toward efficacy\nBladder and bowel functions were assessed using the ISCI Lower Urinary Tract Function Basic Dataset\n52\nand the ISCI Bowel Function Basic Dataset, respectively.\n53\nThe ISCI Male or Female Sexual Function Basic Dataset monitored for changes in sexual function. Orthostatic changes in blood pressure (BP) as an index of autonomic dysfunction were assessed during a progressive head-up tilt challenge (10\u2009min at 0\u00b0, 5\u2009min at 20\u00b0, 5\u2009min at 40\u00b0, 10\u2009min at 60\u00b0). Heart rate was recorded continuously, and BP documented during the last 2\u2009min at each position. The physical conditioning state was tested at four study time points: Baseline 1 (BL1; pre-biopsy \u00b17 days), Baseline 2 (BL2; post\u201312-week conditioning \u00b17 days), Month 2 (M2; post-transplant \u00b17 days), and Month 6 (M6; 6 months post-transplant \u00b17 days). Fitness markers included cardiorespiratory endurance testing by monitoring cardiorespiratory measures during a graded exercise test on an arm ergometer and one-repetition maximum isoinertial strength testing during upper extremity maneuvers. The testing for fitness markers is detailed in the\nSupplementary Material\n.\n\nNeurophysiological testing\nBuilding upon our prior experience, we developed a rigorous neurophysiological protocol to detect changes in conduction, including those below the clinical detection threshold, as previously demonstrated. At the baseline time-point and then following the exercise training prior to transplantation, and then at 2 and 6 months, we assessed for transcranial MEPs, somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEPs), and the presence of a sympathetic skin reflex (SSR). Intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring during ahSC transplant surgery, including SSEPs and MEPs, was also performed.\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics were used for the analysis of safety data across time and focused on within-participant differences. The primary end-point was set at 6 months post-transplantation. To test the core hypothesis and secondary outcome measures, the analysis for efficacy trends was conducted on the 2- and 6-month data for all participants enrolled. As this is an open-label safety study without a control group, no formal power calculation was performed. We considered the stability of the ISNCSCI examination to be the primary indicator of safety with the assumption of test\u2013retest stability in these chronically injured individuals, thus serving as their own controls. Given that the test-retest properties of the motor score are well established,\n54\n,\n55\nwe therefore, conducted a within-participants repeated measures paired t-test between the baseline and 6-month post-transplant assessments for the total motor scores with the null hypothesis that the observed differences would not exceed the published test\u2013retest variance."

    "Methods": "Animals\nThe use of young male Wistar rats (2\u20133 months, Charles River, Wilmington, MA) in this study was approved by the Henry Ford Health System Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The rigorous clinical trial design (randomization, placebo controlled, and blinding) to pre-clinical TBI with a clinically relevant treatment scheme has been employed.\n30\n,\n31\nThe persons who performed the experiments, collected data, and assessed outcome were blinded during the experiments (see\nSupplementary Data\nfor details).\n\nGeneration and characterization of engineered exosomes carrying the elevated miR-17-92 cluster\nHuman MSCs (hMSCs) were expanded (Theradigm, Bethesda, MD). The method is essentially as described.\n32\nBriefly, hMSCs at passage 5 were plated and cultured in \u03b1-Minimum Essential Media (\u03b1-MEM, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).\n33\nTo generate tailored exosomes with elevated miR-17-92 cluster, hMSCs were transfected with a miR-17-92 cluster plasmid (pCAG-GFP-miR-17-92) or an empty vector according to our published protocol.\n28\n,\n34\nThe following primers were used for amplification: forward, 5\u2032-CGGAATTCGTCAGGATAATGTCAAAGTGCTTACA; and reverse, CGGGTACCACCAAACTCAACAGGCCG, with EcoRI and KpnI at 5\u2032 ends. A pCAG-green fluorescent protein (GFP)-miR-17-92 cluster vector was constructed by cloning the primary miR-17\u201392 cluster fragment into the EcoRI and KpnI sites in the pCAG-GFP vector (Addgene plasmid 11150).\n35\nThe pCAG-GFP-miR-17-92 vector (2\u2009\u03bcg) was introduced into cultured hMSCs by electroporation using a Nucleofector kit (Mirus). An empty pCAG-GFP vector was used as a negative control.\nFor the exosome isolation, when the cells reached 60\u201380% confluence, conventional culture medium was replaced with an exosome-depleted fetal bovine serum-contained medium (EXO-FBS-250\u2009A-1, System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA), and the hMSCs were cultured for an additional 48\u2009h.\n19\nThe supernatant of cultured hMSCs was collected and passed through a 0.22\u2009\u03bcm filter (Millipore, Temecula, CA) to remove dead cells and large growth debris. The filtered supernatant was run at 10,000\u2009\u00d7\ng\nfor 30\u2009min. The supernatant was collected and run at 100,000\u2009\u00d7\ng\nfor 3\u2009h to collect the exosomes, as described in our previous study.\n28\nThe supernatant was then collected as a negative control. The pellet was diluted with sterilized phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for further characterization and experimental treatments.\nNanoparticle tracking analysis with the NanoSight instrument was used to measure numbers and sizes of particles in the exosome-enriched pellets according to the manufacturer's instructions (Merkel Technologies, Yehud, Israel). The size of exosomes was further verified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Philips EM208) image, as described in our previous study.\n14\nIsolated exosomes were identified using Western blot analysis of exosomal markers (Alix and Hsp70). The exosomal protein concentration was measured with the micro Bicinchoninic Acid protocol (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Please\nsee Methods\nin the\nSupplementary Data\nfor details (\nSupplementary Fig. S1\n).\n\nTBI model\nA controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of TBI was employed in the present study.\n36\nThe CCI-TBI model is described in our previous study.\n37\nIn brief, rats were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (100/10\u2009mg/kg) intraperitoneally (\nip\n) and placed in a stereotactic frame. A 10-mm-diameter craniotomy was performed over the parietal cortex, and the dura mater was kept. THE CCI was delivered with a pneumatic piston (6-mm tip in diameter, 4\u2009m/sec velocity, and 2.5\u2009mm depth).\n19\n,\n37\nThis moderate TBI causes consistent cortical tissue loss (lesion cavity) and significant neuronal damage in the ipsilateral hippocampus with sensorimotor and cognitive deficits manifested.\n2\n,\n37\n\nAnimal groups\nTo determine the effect of exosomes enriched with the miR-17-92 cluster on TBI rats, we randomly divided TBI rats into one of the three groups: (1) TBI + Vehicle (PBS,\nn\n=\u20098), (2) TBI + Exo-empty (exosomes derived from human MSCs transfected with an empty vector,\nn\n=\u20098), and (3) TBI + Exo-17-92 (exosomes from human MSCs with enriched miR-17-92 cluster,\nn\n=\u20098). Exosomes (100\u2009\u03bcg proteins, approximately 3.75\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n11\nparticles, 0.5\u2009mL in PBS/rat,\nn\n=\u20098) were administered via tail vein to rats starting at 24\u2009h after TBI. Rats treated with Vehicle (0.5\u2009mL PBS) were used as a treatment control (Vehicle group). Rats with sham surgery without TBI/treatment were used as a TBI control (Sham group).\nThe administration dose and time were chosen based on our previous dose-response and window study of exosomes in TBI rats.\n37\n5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU, 100\u2009mg/kg) was injected\nip\ninto rats starting one day after TBI, once daily for seven days, to label proliferating cells in the brain.\n37\n\nBehavioral tests\nPrimary end-points included the Morris water maze (MWM) test performed at 31\u201335 days after TBI, and a battery of sensorimotor tests including modified neurological severity score (mNSS), footfault, and adhesive removal performed at one day and then weekly up to 35 days after TBI. These neurological outcome measurements were performed based on our published protocol.\n19\n,\n37\nWe employed a modified MWM test that uses the concept of probe trial because the hidden platform locations in the correct quadrant change for each trial.\n38\nFor details, please\nsee Methods\nin the\nSupplementary Data\n.\n\nHistology and immunostaining\nAnesthetized animals were sacrificed for collecting of brains 35 days after TBI. Secondary end-points included neuronal cell loss, lesion volume, angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and neuroinflammation. In brief, brains after transcardial perfusion and fixation in paraformaldehyde were embedded in paraffin and a series of 6-\u03bcm-thick slides were prepared. The cortical lesion volume was measured according to our published protocol.\n37\nIn brief, lesion volume (mm\n3\n) was calculated by measuring the area of the lesion (mm\n2\n) and then by multiplying the sum of the lesioned areas obtained from each section by the distance between sections (mm) identified by comparing each hematoxylin and eosin section with the\nRat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates\nby Paximos and Watson, and expressed as a percent of the contralateral (noninjured) hemisphere.\n37\nGlial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, marker for astrocytes), CD 68- (marker for microglia/macrophages), and neuronal nuclei (NeuN, for neurons)-immunostainings were performed and counted according to our published methods\n32\n,\n37\nand described in the\nSupplementary Data\n.\n\nImmunofluorescent staining\nNewly generated endothelial cells and newborn mature neurons 35 days after TBI were identified by double labeling for BrdU with endothelial barrier antigen (EBA) or neuronal nuclei (NeuN), respectively.\n19\n,\n37\nThe EBA+ endothelial cells, CD68+ microglia/macrophages, GFAP+ astrocytes, EBA+/BrdU+ cells were counted in the dentate gyrus (DG) and lesion boundary zone (LBZ).\n19\nThe LBZ is defined as the region of cortical tissue between the lesion cavity and the intact tissue.\n37\nThe NeuN/BrdU-colabeled cells in the subgranular zone and granular cell layer of the DG were counted for analysis of neurogenesis.\nThe images in the regions of interest were acquired at a magnification of either 200 or 400 under the microscope (Nikon, Eclipse 80i) using CoolSNAP color camera (Photometrics) and analyzed with MetaMorph image analysis system (Molecular Devices). In brief, five fields of view in the LBZ from the epicenter of the injury cavity (bregma \u22123.3\u2009mm), and nine fields of view in the ipsilateral DG were counted in each section according to our published method.\n37\nA Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal laser scanning microscope connected to a personal computer running the Zeiss LSM Image Software was employed to verify colocalization of BrdU with NeuN in the DG. For details, please see the\nSupplementary Data\n(\nSupplementary Fig. S2\n).\n\nCell counting and quantitation\nIn the present study, we did not use stereological quantification methods because immunoreactive positive cells in the present study are not homogenously distributed and the data of interest are relative difference and not absolute value. All counting was performed on a computer monitor to improve visualization and in one focal plane to avoid oversampling. The methods employed to count cells have been utilized in our previous studies.\n37\nPlease see detailed description of cell counting and quantitation in the\nSupplementary Data\n.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData presented as the means with standard deviations were tested for normality. Ranked data or a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to analyze data if they were not normally distributed. Data on repeated measurements of spatial performance and sensorimotor function were analyzed with analysis of variance (ANOVA). One-way ANOVA followed by\npost hoc\nTukey tests was used to compare the differences in cell counting between the exosome-treated, Vehicle-treated and Sham groups. A\np\nvalue <0.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "Recruitment at baseline\nThe TBI group consisted of individuals recruited from 1992 to 1994 as children and adolescents ages 6 to 14 years consecutively hospitalized for mild to severe TBI at an academic medical center and three regional hospitals. Additional eligibility criteria included having completed a head computed tomography (CT) scan during initial hospitalization and English as a primary language. Exclusion criteria included penetrating TBI, loss of consciousness greater than 3 months, prior TBI requiring hospitalization, history of child abuse, history of intellectual disability, or history of another neurologic or serious medical illness. The study was approved by the University of Iowa and University of California, San Diego institutional review boards. Written informed consent was obtained from parents, and youth provided written assent when able to demonstrate decision-making capacity to do so.\nDuring the course of the recruitment period, 87 patients met eligibility criteria, and 50 participants enrolled in the study. Participating and non-participating youth did not differ in terms of age, sex, race, SES, pre-injury psychiatric disorder or treatment, but did differ in terms of TBI severity, with participants being more likely to have severe TBI compared with non-participants. Over-representation of severe TBI in study participants was likely related to individuals and families affected by milder injuries feeling that study participation was unnecessary due to the youth having returned to baseline, and also to the main study site being a tertiary care hospital with a large catchment area.\n13\n\nAssessments at baseline\nYouth with pediatric TBI were initially evaluated between 1992 and 1994. Comprehensive neurologic, psychiatric, family and adaptive functioning assessments were conducted (mean\u2009=\u200914 days post-injury; standard deviation [SD]\u2009=\u200913 days) to assess severity of injury and several domains of pre-injury functioning. Fourteen variables, which are described below and also listed in\nFigure 1\n, were measured and used to predict NPD following pediatric TBI.\nThree of the variables were related to severity of injury, including: 1) lowest post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score; 2) Traumatic Coma Data Bank (TCDB) categorization; and 3) normal or abnormal day-of-injury CT scan. The GCS is a standard measure of acute brain injury severity, and scores range from 3 (unresponsive) to 15 (normal).\n31\nLowest post-resuscitation score for each participant was obtained from the medical record. A board-certified radiologist classified the initial day-of-injury CT scans as either showing an intracranial traumatic lesion or not. The radiologist additionally classified the CT scans according to the TCDB categorization, which incorporates the degree of brain edema and focal lesions into a single severity rating on a scale from 1 to 6.\n32\nFor descriptive purposes, severe injury was defined by a lowest post-resuscitation GCS score <8, moderate injury by a lowest post-resuscitation GCS score of 9 to 12, or a score of 13 to 15 with an intracranial lesion or depressed skull fracture on initial CT scan. Mild injury was defined by a lowest post-resuscitation GCS score of 13 to 15, regardless of associated linear skull fracture.\nThe \u201clifetime psychiatric disorder\u201d variable refers to any psychiatric disorder present prior to TBI. Baseline psychiatric assessments were completed using a standardized, semi-structured psychiatric interview, the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Epidemiologic Version (K-SADS-E),\n33\nsupplemented by a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) module. Psychiatric diagnoses were based on American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition (DSM-III-R) criteria.\n34\nThe Neuropsychiatric Rating Schedule (NPRS) was also administered at baseline. The NPRS is a measure designed specifically to identify symptoms and subtypes of personality change following TBI.\n35\nAll assessments were conducted by author JEM, a board-certified adult and child and adolescent psychiatrist.\nPre-injury adaptive and behavioral function were assessed using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS) interview,\n36\nand the parent-completed Pediatric Behavior Scale (PBS), a behavioral rating scale designed specifically for use with pediatric neurological and other medical disorders.\n37\nFamily psychiatric history was assessed using the Family History Research Diagnostic Criteria interview,\n38\n,\n39\nwith parents acting as the informants. We summarized family ratings for first-degree relatives only, and for a combined grouping of first- and second-degree relatives, on a 4-point scale with higher scores indicating worse family psychiatric history.\n40\nFamily functioning was assessed using the McMaster Structured Interview of Family Functioning.\n41\nThe interviewer used the Clinical Rating Scale (CRS) to rate each of six domains and global family functioning on a 7-point Likert scale, where higher scores indicated better functioning. Global family function was the predictive variable used for analyses. The Family Assessment Device (FAD) questionnaire also was completed by family members at least 12 years of age,\n41\nand scores were used to calculate a mean global functioning dimension score for each family. Higher scores indicated greater dysfunction.\nSocioeconomic class was assessed using the Four Factor Index.\n42\nMeasures used to assess intellectual function included teacher-report of pre-injury intellectual ability and academic achievement on the PBS, along with pre-injury national percentile rank (NPR) for vocabulary on the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS), the latter of which is highly correlated with verbal intelligence quotient (IQ).\n43\n\nAssessments at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post-injury\nTBI participants completed repeat psychiatric evaluations at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post-injury. Instruments administered included the K-SADS-P,\n44\nsupplemented by the attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), alcohol and substance abuse modules of the K-SADS-E,\n33\na PTSD module, and the NPRS.\n35\nPsychiatric diagnoses were based on DSM-III-R criteria. At each follow-up assessment, NPD was the outcome variable of interest, and a designation of NPD was applied in one of two conditions. First, this could occur in a participant with no lifetime psychiatric disorders at the baseline assessment who later manifested a psychiatric disorder following injury. Second, this could occur in the case of a participant with a lifetime psychiatric disorder at baseline, but who manifested a new-onset psychiatric disorder that was not present before the TBI (e.g., a participant with a lifetime history of ODD who developed generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) post-injury). Results from assessments in the first 2 years following TBI have been published elsewhere.\n12\u201315\n\nRecruitment at 24 years post-injury\nPediatric TBI participants who completed at least the baseline psychiatric assessment from 1992 to 1994 (\nn\n=\u200950) and/or a first-degree relative were invited from 2016 to 2018 to participate in a 24-year post-injury psychiatric assessment. At this long-term follow-up, we studied 86% of TBI participants in person (\nn\n=\u200943), as well as the sibling of an original participant who died approximately 3 years prior to this phase of the study, and the parent of another participant who did not respond to our invitation to participate (\nn\n=\u200945). Significant others (e.g., parent, partner, friend) also were recruited for participants with TBI because of the possibility that awareness of deficits may be compromised after TBI.\n45\nA total of 31 significant others participated. The interval from injury to long-term assessment was 23.92\u2009\u00b1\u20092.17 years (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD).\nExcluded participants included one subject who remained in a persistent vegetative state, and was therefore not eligible to participate. Two of the 45 TBI participants were siblings and therefore one sibling was dropped only from the pre-injury predictive analyses because some variables could not be considered independent for the sibling pair. Four remaining originally enrolled participants (two male, two female) declined participation in the 24-year follow-up, and characteristics of these individuals are as follows. One participant had a severe TBI, no pre-injury psychiatric disorder, and developed secondary mania, which has been described previously.\n46\nThis individual initially agreed to participate and volunteered that he was divorced with children, and that he owned a small business; however, he did not attend his study assessment. Another non-participant at the long-term follow-up had a severe TBI, along with pre-injury agoraphobia, overanxious disorder, and major depressive disorder (MDD) with psychotic features, which evolved after the TBI into schizo-affective disorder with further evolution to a residual state. He also developed NPDs of personality change due to TBI, and ADHD during the 2-year follow-up. Family shared that he was employed but had ongoing unspecified problems, and would not wish to participate due to not wanting to be reminded of his injury.\nThe last two non-participants both had mild TBI, no pre-injury psychiatric disorders, and neither had participated beyond their baseline assessments. The third individual had not participated in the first 2 years post-injury due to avoiding memories of a sibling who was deceased at the time of her injury. At long-term follow-up recruitment, she volunteered that she was married, employed, and felt unaffected by the TBI; she declined to participate further due to being too busy. The fourth non-participant volunteered that she also felt unaffected by her TBI. She initially agreed to participate, but later declined.\nBetween 2017 and 2018, a control group of adults without history of neurological disorders\u2014including no meningitis, encephalitis, brain tumors, or TBI\u2014was recruited from the same geographic area. The Ohio State University TBI Identification Method was used to exclude potential controls with a history of TBI.\n47\nFor each TBI group participant, attempts were made to enroll a control participant of the same biologic sex and race, within 3 years of age, and within 1 point on the 5-point scale measure of SES.\n42\nThis method was used so that the TBI and control group characteristics would be similar, but we did not assume there would be an individually matched sample with the corresponding need for pair-wise statistical analyses. More specifically, we kept the original SES rating of the family of the child with TBI if the current SES rating of the adult proband with TBI was at the same level or worse. If the SES of the adult proband was better than their family of origin, we used the current rating for matching purposes. The rationale was to avoid missing real proband\u2013control cognitive and possibly psychiatric differences in those with psychosocial drift,\n48\nand to avoid finding spurious proband\u2013control differences in those probands whose SES improved compared with their family of origin.\n\nAssessments at 24 years post-injury\nAt the long-term follow-up assessment, all participants completed a questionnaire regarding demographic and medical information. We collected participants age, sex, marital status, education, socio-economic status, employment level, school attendance, living situation, primary source of income, and previous and intermittent medical history including a list of regular medications.\nPsychiatric assessments were completed by author JEM using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview,\n49\nand psychiatric diagnoses were made based on American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria.\n50\nThe NPRS was used to diagnose personality change due to TBI.\n35\nIn cases where individuals with TBI and a significant other participated, \u201cbest estimate\u201d diagnoses were assigned based on integration of self-report and significant other report.\n51\nDetailed inquiry was made in the interview assessments to document ages of onset and offset of every psychiatric diagnosis recorded. An inter-rater reliability study was conducted by a board-certified psychiatrist (EAT), which relied on ratings of videotaped interviews of TBI and control group participants. EAT was blind to group status and rated the videotaped interviews of every seventh TBI (\nn\n=\u20097) and control (\nn\n=\u20097) subject. Inter-rater reliability for diagnoses was excellent (\u0138\u2009=\u20090.962). There was perfect agreement on diagnoses in 12/14 (86%) cases, as well as agreement on 54/56 (96%) specific diagnoses.\nWe defined baseline as time of injury for the TBI group. For consistency with the TBI group, in the control group we regarded baseline as the mean age of injury of the TBI group (10.3 years). The determination of Any NPD (NPD-A) and Current NPD (NPD-C) at this most recent assessment wave of the study is defined according to psychiatric diagnoses assessed to have manifested during the interval \u201cbaseline plus 2 years\u201d through the present assessment for participants in either group. With regard to assignment of the above NPD classifiers, consider the following examples. If an individual met criteria for only ADHD at the baseline and also at 24-year follow-up assessments, ADHD is coded as a lifetime psychiatric disorder because it was present prior to injury (TBI group) or prior to baseline (age 10.3 years) in the Control group. If at the 24-year follow-up evaluation, the same individual describes meeting criteria for MDD at some point since \u201cbaseline plus 2 years,\u201d but which is currently in remission, along with GAD that is still interfering with functioning, then MDD is coded as an NPD-A, while GAD is coded as both an NPD-A and NPD-C.\nOutcome measures of interest included: 1) NPD-C in each group (TBI and Controls); 2) NPD-A in each group; and 3) Post-Injury NPD exposure defined as the total number of years each participant manifested at least one NPD in the interval \u201cbaseline plus 2 years\u201d through the present assessment for each group; and 4) Time-to-Event for onset of an NPD-A.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe prevalence of NPD during follow-up was compared between the TBI and control groups (hypotheses one and two) using Pearson's\n\u03c7\n2\ntest. Additionally, the mean number of years of NPD exposure was compared between the groups using an independent samples t\u2013test.\nThe association between the injury and pre-injury variables and NPD-C at 24-year follow-up was assessed using single- and multi-predictor logistic regression. The multi-predictor model was built using backward model selection with elimination threshold of\np\nvalue <0.20.\n52\nThe starting multi-predictor model included all variables with single-predictor analysis\np\nvalue <0.20. NPD-C was the primary outcome, rather than NPD-A, because during the 22-year follow-up interval other variables (e.g., life events) could transiently influence presentation of psychiatric disorders and mask findings related to more sustained problems. For completeness and relevance to the NPD-A outcome variable in our previous publications,\n12\u201315\nsimilar analyses were performed with NPD-A at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 288 months post-baseline. In the NPD-A analyses, backward model selection failed due to separation in the starting model (due to cells generated by the combination of covariates in the model with 0% or 100% outcomes), and forward model selection was used instead.\nThe distribution of the time from \u201cbaseline plus 2 years\u201d to development of NPD-A was estimated separately for the TBI and control groups using the Kaplan-Meier method, and compared between groups using the log-rank test. The hazard ratio of NPD-A between the TBI and control groups, unadjusted and adjusted for baseline factors, was computed (together with 95% confidence intervals) using the Cox proportional hazards model. The adjusted analyses used a similar backward model selection method as described above. In all analyses of the time to NPD-A, time was measured from \u201cbaseline plus 2 years.\u201d We used SPSS (Version 25) for the statistical analyses."

    "Methods": "A homogenous cohort of patients with ATCCS caused by spinal stenosis was admitted to the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center over a 19-year period and was selected to define the effect of timing of decompression (Specific Aim # 1) on long-term neurological outcome. The study was approved by the Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) of the University of Maryland School of Medicine (IRB HP-00078395).\n\nDesign\nThis study was designed as a retrospective cohort study.\n\nPrimary outcome measure\nThe primary outcome measure was the ASIA motor score at least 6 months following traumatic cervical SCI (tCSCI).\n\nSecondary outcome measure\nThere was no secondary outcome measure.\n\nCohort\nFrom 2000 to 2018, 2372 tCSCI patients were admitted to The R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center, of whom 2061 patients had sustained fracture dislocations and were excluded from the study. From the cohort, 311 patients had the clinical picture of ATCCS and were without mechanical instability on imaging studies (computed tomography [CT] and MRI).\nInclusion criteria were\n1.\nBlunt tCSCI\n2.\nPresented as ATCCS\n3.\nASIA motor score (AMS) \u226495\n4.\nAIS grades C and D\n5.\nNo mechanical instability on CT scan\n6.\nPresence of high intensity signal change on T2 weighted image (WI) or short T1 inversion recovery (STIR) images indicating evidence of tCSCI\n7.\nPresence of spinal stenosis/disc osteophyte complex\n8.\nNo evidence of discoligamentous injury on MRI except for minor extension distraction\n9.\nUnderwent surgery for spinal cord decompression\n10.\nPost-operative MRI indicated presence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) interface between spinal cord and dura indicating complete decompression\n11.\nFollowed for at least 6 months after acute care discharge, in order to determine long-term AMS\nExclusion criteria were\n1.\nAMS 96\u2013100 (16 patients)\n2.\nInadequate follow-up: no follow-up (46 patients); follow-ups <6 months (103 patients)\n3.\nInadequate decompression on postoperative MRI (24 patients)\n4.\nNo postoperative MRI (12 patients)\n5.\nDeath during their acute care in the hospital (6 patients)\n6.\nNo medical records (3 patients)\n\nSample size\nThis investigation was a retrospective cohort study and all the eligible 101 patients were included in the investigation.\n\nPrimary and secondary survey, resuscitation, and clinical examination\nPatients were transferred to The R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center by emergency medical technicians (EMTs)\n61\nsupine on a rigid backboard with the head and neck secured by a hard collar and chin strap. Primary and secondary examinations were performed by trauma surgeons upon arrival. Once the patients were deemed medically stable following initial resuscitation, members of the neurosurgical team (senior resident or nurse practitioners) conducted a complete neurological assessment and then presented the case to the attending neurosurgeon. Admission AMS and AIS grades were determined according to the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI).\n62\n\nCT and MRI\nPreoperative multiplanar cervical spine CT was performed within 2\u20133\u2009h of trauma,\n63\nand multi-sequence multiplanar T2-weighted and STIR sequences were acquired within 5\u20137\u2009h following trauma.\n17\n,\n64\nWe defined the morphometric measures of spinal stenosis including the number of stenotic skeletal segments, the segmental level of maximum spinal cord compression, and the maximum canal compromise (MCC). Intramedullary lesion length was measured on sagittal T2 and/or STIR MRI. Sagittal and axial T2 and STIR MRI sequences were also used to determine the extent of spinal cord decompression following surgery.\n65\nPost-operative MRI studies were performed within a median of 53\u2009h (mean 75\u2009h) from injury. Decompression was defined as the presence of a CSF interface between the spinal cord and dura (either ventral, dorsal, or both) continuously from the foramen magnum to the first thoracic vertebra. Two spine fellowship-trained neurosurgeons (C.A.S. and K.M.C.) and two neurosurgeons (G.T.S. and B.A.) validated the extent of spinal cord decompression following surgery. Discrepancies were adjudicated by a consensus conference of the four neurosurgeons.\n64\n,\n66\nAn attending trauma neuroradiologist (K.S.) and the principal investigator (PI) independently measured the intramedullary lesion length (IMLL), and the mean value was taken for statistical analysis.\n64\n\nMethylprednisolone protocol and blood pressure augmentation\nFrom 2000 to 2009, 37 of the study patients were administered methylprednisolone following SCI; 30\u2009mg/kg within the first hour and 5.4\u2009mg/kg/h for the next 23\u2009h. From 2010 on, the use of steroids for SCI was discontinued (64 patients). Patients' mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was maintained between 85 to 90\u2009mm Hg for 7 days following trauma when medically feasible.\n67\n,\n68\n\nSurgical technique and timing of decompression\nTwelve neurosurgeons including five spine fellowship-trained neurosurgeons performed the surgeries. Surgeries included anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF), ACDF plus laminectomy and posterior spinal fusion (PSF), and laminectomy with PSF or laminoplasty. Post-operative CT and MRI were performed to confirm adequate hardware placement and to verify spinal cord decompression, respectively.\n\nIntensive care unit (ICU) care and long-term follow-up\nIn the ICU, enoxaparin (Lovenox\n\u00ae\n, Sanofi, USA) was administered 30\u2009mg twice daily starting within 24\u201348\u2009h of trauma for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, with screening for DVT by duplex ultrasound when clinically indicated. Early tracheostomy for ventilator support and percutaneous gastroenterostomy for nutrition were also routinely performed when indicated, as determined by the ICU and trauma team. During the entire in-hospital stay, ISNCSCI examinations, including digital rectal examination, were performed each day to track changes in AMS and AIS grade. After discharge, patients returned to the clinic at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months (or longer) for follow-up ISNCSCI examinations, which were performed by the staff of the Department of Neurosurgery as well as by certified neurologists and rehabilitation specialists in other facilities. Median follow-up was 12 months, and the interquartile range (IQR) was 9.5 months.\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics were used to characterize the patient population. We used a\nt\ntest or analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess the association between the outcome variable; that is, the final AMS, and the categorical explanatory variables. We also used a Pearson correlation coefficient to examine the association between the outcome variable and other continuous variables. Then, all variables that were significantly associated with the outcome variable in the univariate analysis were included in a multiple regression analysis to predict the outcome variable while adjusting for time-to-surgery (as \u226424\u2009h, 25\u201372\u2009h, and >72\u2009h) and IMLL in the model. Statistical significance was set at a 0.05 level. The statistical program of Stata/SE version 16.1 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX) was used for all analyses."

    "Methods": "Animals and housing\nAll animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS; Bethesda, MD). Male and female mice, 8 weeks old, were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (C57BL/6J, 000664; Bar Harbor, Maine) and group-housed (4-5 per cage) in Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care\u2013accredited facilities with a standard 12-h light\u2013dark cycle, with food (Harlan Teklad Global Diets 2018, 18% protein) and water available\nad libitum.\nAnimals acclimated to facilities for 7-10 days prior to baseline behavioral testing. All procedures involving rodent handling were performed by female investigators.\n44\n\nCHIMERA procedures\nMice were randomly assigned to sustain sham procedures or four CHIMERA brain injuries, delivered at 24-h intervals. CHIMERA procedures were performed as initially described by Namjoshi and colleagues.\n14\nMice were anesthetized with isoflurane (3% in 100% oxygen) in a clear induction chamber; anesthesia (2.5%) was maintained via nosecone while the animal was positioned on the device. The animal was mounted in a supine position in the animal holder, with the head flat over a hole in the head plate and the body angled approximately 32\u00b0. Crosshairs across the piston hole aid in aligning the animal's head, resulting in reliable impact to the dorsal cortical region. The body was held in place on the platform with Velcro straps, allowing the head to rotate in the sagittal plane when the piston was deployed, resulting in an impact rotational injury. Instrument pressure was set at 3.8-4.46 psi to obtain a piston velocity of 5.29\u2009m/sec, which corresponds to an energy level of 0.7\u2009J. (Energy (J)\u2009=\u2009(1/2m)\u2009\u00d7\u2009v\n2\n, where m is the mass of the piston (0.05\u2009kg) and v is the piston velocity.) Actual measured velocity for all impacts had an average of 5.2762, resulting in calculated energy of 0.6960 J with 2.36% coefficient of variation. Sham-treated mice underwent all procedures, including anesthesia and positioning on the device, but the impact was not delivered. The total duration of isoflurane exposure each day was approximately 4.5\u2009min for both injured and sham-control mice.\nAny occurrence of apnea immediately following the impact was noted, measured, and recorded. Injured and sham-treated mice were placed in a clean cage in a supine position immediately after cessation of anesthesia, and the latency to return to a prone position was recorded as the righting reflex. All mice received acetaminophen in their drinking water beginning when they were returned to their home cages after the first procedure, continuing until 24\u2009h following the final injury or sham procedure (1\u2009mg/mL; approximately 200\u2009mg/kg).\n\nBehavioral testing\nExperiment 1\u2014Spontaneous activity, motor and cognitive behavior\nA total of 59 mice were included in Experiment 1: Male Chimera, 15; Male Sham, 15; Female Chimera, 14; and Female Sham, 15. Open field (OF), rotarod, y-maze (spontaneous alternation test, working memory) and Morris water maze (MWM, spatial learning and memory) testing was performed as previously described.\n45\n,\n46\nBody weights were measured weekly. Baseline OF measurements were taken approximately 4 days prior to injury procedures, and OF behavior was assessed on Days 1, 7, 14, and 21 post-injury. The OF apparatus (Stoelting Co.) was a 40\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u200940\u2009cm arena with opaque black walls approximately 40\u2009cm high (\u223c 5 Lux). Each arena had an overhead camera connected to a computer with Any-Maze software (Stoelting Co.) that tracked movements of the mice during a 20-min testing session. Measures recorded included total distance traveled, time spent in an immobile state (defined as 70% of the animal remaining motionless for at least 2\u2009sec), and movement speed while mobile. One female sham mouse was excluded from all OF analysis due to abnormally high spontaneous activity levels (total distance traveled) during baseline testing (9.0 standard deviations [SD] above the group mean).\nMice were trained to perform on an accelerating rotarod (4-60 rotations/min over 3\u2009min) for 3 days prior to injury.\n46\nThe latency to fall from the rod or the time at which the mouse clung to the rod for three consecutive rotations was recorded and averaged for three trials each day. Performance on the 3rd training day was recorded as the baseline value, and post-injury behavior was assessed on Days 1, 7, 14, and 21. Rotarod testing on post-injury days was performed following open field assessment.\nHippocampal-dependent working memory was assessed on Day 10 following CHIMERA injuries by testing spontaneous alternation behavior in the y-maze.\n45\nThe apparatus (Stoelting, CO) consisted of three arms (36\u2009cm long with 16\u2009cm high walls) at a 120\u00b0 angle to one another, meeting at a central triangular zone. Testing was performed at approximately 15 Lux. Mice were individually placed at the end of a randomly chosen arm, and the mouse was free to explore all arms during a 5-min testing session. Objects around the room provided spatial cues. Movements of the mice were recorded by an overhead camera and entries to the arms were later scored by an observer blinded to the injury condition of the animal. A mouse with intact working memory is expected to display spontaneous alternation behavior, visiting all three arms in alternation, not returning to either of the arms most recently explored. An alternation was counted when the mouse entered the three arms consecutively, and percent correct alternation was calculated as 100\u2009\u00d7\nt\no\nt\na\nl\nn\nu\nm\nb\ne\nr\no\nf\na\nl\nt\ne\nr\nn\na\nt\ni\no\nn\ns\nt\no\nt\na\nl\na\nr\nm\ne\nn\nt\nr\ni\ne\ns\n\u2212\n2\n.\nHippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory was tested in the Morris water maze (MWM) on Days 24-37 following CHIMERA injuries.\n45\nSpatial learning trials were conducted for 4 days on Days 24-27 following injuries with a probe trial conducted 24\u2009h later (Day 28). Four days of reversal learning trials began on Day 31, and 24\u2009h following completion a reversal probe trial was conducted. Finally, 2 days later (37 days following injuries), mice underwent four visible platform trials. The MWM apparatus was a white circular tank (122\u2009cm diameter) filled with water (21\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C) to a depth of about 30\u2009cm. A round transparent platform (11\u2009cm diameter) was submerged just below the surface of the water approximately 15\u2009cm from the edge of the maze. Diffuse room lighting provided illumination of approximately 60 Lux. An overhead camera connected to a computer with Any-Maze software recorded movements of the mice during testing; within the software, the circular maze was divided into four equal quadrants.\nFour trials were performed on each learning day, with an inter-trial interval of 3-4\u2009min. The animal was placed, facing the wall of the maze, at a different start position along the perimeter of the tank for each trial, and the order of the start positions was varied each day. Mice were allowed 60\u2009sec to find the hidden platform using spatial cues (large black and white geometric shapes on the walls), after which it remained on the platform for 15\u2009sec. If the mouse did not find the platform in the allotted time, it was gently guided to the platform, allowed to remain there for 15\u2009sec, and assigned 60\u2009sec as the latency score for that trial. Following each trial, mice were gently removed from the maze, towel-dried, and placed into a heated cage. The software recorded the latency to find the platform, distance swam to the platform, and the swimming speed, and these measures were averaged over the four trials each training day.\nThe day after the final training trials (Day 28 following injuries) a single probe trial was conducted in which the platform was removed from the maze. The mouse was placed in the maze directly opposite the location in which the platform had been formerly located, facing the wall, and allowed a 60-sec swim. The software recorded the time in which the animal spent in the northwest (NW) quadrant (that previously housed the platform) and the number of times the mouse crossed the previous exact location of the platform.\nBeginning on Day 31 post-injury (3 days following the probe trial), reversal learning trials began. These trials were identical to the original spatial training trials on Days 24-27, except the hidden platform was moved to the opposite (southeast; SE) quadrant. The day following completion of reversal training trials (post-injury day 35), a reversal probe trial in which the platform was removed from the maze was performed.\nFour visible platform trials were conducted two days following the reversal probe trial (Day 37 following injury). A highly visible (patterned) flag was secured to the platform, placed in the center of the maze, and each mouse underwent four trials. A different start position was employed for each trial, and the software recorded the latency to find the platform and the distance swam to the platform.\nExperiment 2\u2014Trace fear conditioning\nThe TFC paradigm was employed in an additional 69 mice as a separate assessment of hippocampal-dependent learning.\n47\u201350\nMice (Male CHIMERA, 16; Male Sham,14; Female CHIMERA, 22; Female Sham, 17) were tested on Days 24-26 following CHIMERA or sham procedures. During conditioning on the first day, mice were placed in Plexiglas fear conditioning chambers (17\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u200917\u2009cm, \u223c5 lux; Ugo-Basile, Varise, Italy) with a metal rod floor, within sound-attenuating and light-tight cubicles. Salient black and white checkerboard or striped walls provided visual cues, and odor cues were provided with mint or lemon extract. Following a 3-min acclimation period, the animals were presented with a 70 dB white noise conditioned stimulus (CS), 20\u2009sec in duration. After a 20\u2009sec delay, the auditory stimulus was followed by a foot-shock, 0.6\u2009mA and 2\u2009sec in duration. The noise-shock pairing was repeated three more times, with intervals between the shock and next CS 210\u2009sec, 150\u2009sec, and 270\u2009sec, for a total of four pairings. The animals remained in the chambers for 1\u2009min following the final shock. To reduce stress for un-tested animals, mice were placed into holding cages following conditioning until all mice from an individual housing cage had completed testing.\nThe tone test was performed the day following conditioning. The chamber was altered with modified visual, light, tactile and odor cues. After a 3-min baseline, mice were presented with the 20-sec white noise CS (70 dB), followed by an inter-tone interval of 20\u2009sec. The CS was repeated four more times, for a total of five presentations of the noise and inter-trial interval. The amount of time mice spent freezing was recorded by Any-Maze software (Minimum freeze duration: 250\u2009msec; Freezing on threshold: 30 (no units); Freezing off threshold: 40 [no units]). Freezing detection is performed by Any-Maze by analyzing movement throughout the apparatus, taking into account that noise will be present, such as flickering of individual video pixels and breathing of the animal.\nOn the 3rd day, the contextual exposure test was performed with contextual conditions in the testing chamber identical to what they were during conditioning on the 1st day. Mice were placed in the chamber, and the amount of time spent freezing during a 5-min test session was recorded by Any-Maze software.\n\nHistology and immunohistochemistry\nFollowing behavioral testing, 37 days following the final injury, mice were deeply anesthetized (60\u2009mg/kg ketamine, 60\u2009mg/kg xylazine, intraperitoneally) and transcardially perfused with 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffer (PB) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1\u2009M PB. Brains were removed and post-fixed overnight (4% PFA in 0.1\u2009M PB), then transferred to 20% sucrose (in 0.1 M phosphate buffer) for cryoprotection. Following at least 24\u2009h of cryoprotection, brains were frozen in dry ice powder and stored at -80\u00b0C.\nSix brains from each injury and sex group (three from Experiment 1 and three from Experiment 2) were randomly selected and processed for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and parvalbumin staining by FD NeuroTechnologies, Inc. (FDN; Columbia, MD). Serial cryostat sections (30\u2009\u03bcm) were taken coronally from approximately bregma -0.94 to -4.16\u2009mm.\n51\nSets of sections at 210-\u03bcm intervals were processed separately for H&E, GFAP and parvalbumin. The first set of sections was mounted on Superfrost Plus microscope slides (Thermo Scientific, Portsmouth, NH), and stained with FD H&E solution\nTM\n(FDN). The second and third sets were processed for GFAP and parvalbumin-immunoreactivity, respectively.\nAfter inactivating endogenous peroxidase activity with 0.6% H\n2\nO\n2\n, sections were incubated free-floating at 4\u00b0C for 43\u2009h in 0.01\u2009M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) with 1% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and either rat monoclonal anti-GFAP immunoglobulin G (IgG; 1:20,000; Cat. #: 130300, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or rabbit polyclonal anti-parvalbumin IgG (1:20,000; Cat. #: ab11427, Abcam, Cambridge). The immunoreaction product was then visualized with the Vectastain Elite\n\u00ae\nABC kit (Vector Lab., Burlingame, CA) according to the avidin-biotin complex method of Hsu and colleagues.\n52\nBriefly, sections were incubated in PBS-containing biotinylated goat anti-rat (for\nGFAP\nsections) or anti-rabbit (for\nparvalbumin\nsections) IgG, normal goat serum and Triton-X for 1\u2009h and then in PBS containing avidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex for 1\u2009h, followed by incubation of the sections in 0.05\u2009M Tris buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.03% 3\u2032,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (Sigma) and 0.0075% H\n2\nO\n2\nfor 5\u2009min. After thorough rinsing in distilled H\n2\nO, sections were mounted on slides, dehydrated in ethanol, cleared in xylene, and cover-slipped in Permount\n\u00ae\n(Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ). Unless otherwise noted, all steps were performed at room temperature and followed by washes in PBS.\nAn additional 5-6 brains from each injury and sex group (approximately equal numbers from Experiments 1 and 2) were processed at USUHS for silver staining. Brains were sectioned (30\u2009\u03bcm) with a sliding microtome and sections were stored at -20\u00b0C in cryoprotectant until processing. Following seven days of incubation in PFA (4%) in 0.1M PB at 4\u00b0C, silver staining was performed employing FD NeuroSilver\nTM\nKit II, following the manufacturer's instructions.\nAll slides were scanned with a Zeiss AxioScan Z1. Zen 2.5 software (blue edition,\n\u00a9\nCarl Zeiss Microscopy) was employed to capture regions of interest (ROIs) from sections beginning at approximately bregma -1.50 (Franklin & Paxinos): GFAP: bilateral parietal cortex (pCTX), corpus callosum (CC), bilateral optic tracts (OTs), bilateral hippocampus (HP), bilateral fimbria of the hippocampus (FI); parvalbumin (pCTX, HP, bilateral amygdala (AMY); silver stain (CC, FI, OT, cerebral peduncles (CP;\nSupplementary Fig. S1\n). H&E and additional GFAP and\nparvalbumin\nsections were analyzed from somatosensory and motor cortex (smCTX; from close to the impact site, beginning at approximately bregma -0.70). Images of ROIs for GFAP and parvalbumin-stained sections were imported into ImageJ software for further processing. pCTX and smCTX were analyzed in 500\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u2009500\u2009\u03bcm regions, 1000\u2009\u03bcm from midline; the CC, OTs, and FIs were analyzed in 800\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u2009600\u2009\u03bcm, 350\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u2009350\u2009\u03bcm, and 250\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u2009250\u2009\u03bcm regions, respectively.\nThe percent area stained of each ROI was determined for GFAP-stained black/white images employing the threshold feature after the ROI was manually selected, and the ratio of area of positive signal to the total area is expressed as the percent area stained. Parvalbumin-stained images were analyzed similar to methods previously described.\n39\nThe particle analysis feature of ImageJ was employed to count cells on thresholded, black/white samples. Values for GFAP- and parvalbumin-analyzed slides were typically averaged across three sections per animal, approximately 210\u2009\u03bcm apart.\nSilver- and H&E-stained images are described qualitatively. All image analyses were performed by an investigator blinded to all experimental conditions of the animals from which the sections were taken.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed with SAS Studio 3.8 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and SPSS (version 21; IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY). Righting reflexes were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis tests performed for each injury day followed by Dunn-Bonferroni-corrected\npost hoc\nmultiple comparisons (SPSS). Behavioral measures recorded at multiple time-points (OF, rotarod, MWM training data) were analyzed in mixed models with Injury and Sex as fixed factors and Day as a repeated measure. Data from standard and reversal trials in the MWM were analyzed separately. Latency and distance traveled to platform from visible platform trials in the Morris water maze did not meet homogeneity of variance requirements as assessed with Levene's homogeneity of variance test; these values were transformed to natural log values prior to analyses. Two-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs; Injury\u2009\u00d7\u2009Sex) were performed for freezing during TFC for the baseline periods, and for the total amounts of freezing during tone and trace periods separately. Immunohistological (GFAP and parvalbumin) data were analyzed with ANOVAs with Sex and Injury as fixed factors and Side (e.g., AMY, OT) and/or Subregion (i.e., HP) as repeated measures). Interaction effects were followed up by Bonferroni-corrected planned contrasts (\nt\n-tests). Where appropriate, following significant main effects or planned contrasts, Cohen's\nd\neffect size was calculated as\n\u03bc\n1\n\u2212\n\u03bc\n2\ns\np\no\no\nl\ne\nd\n, where s\npooled\n=\ns\n1\n2\n+\ns\n2\n2\n2\n.\nFigures were designed with Microsoft Excel 2016 and Daniel's Excel XL Toolbox 7.34. Unless indicated otherwise, data presented in figures represent the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean."

    "Methods": "Participants\nThe study involved a concurrent cohort, prospective, and longitudinal design that included children eight to 16 years old with mild TBI and a comparison group of children with mild OI not involving the head. Participants were recruited during initial visits to the EDs at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, or Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio. Recruitment occurred from approximately 8:00\nam\nto 10:00\npm\n, seven days a week, and lasted 46 months, from March 2014 to December 2017. All recruitment decisions regarding inclusion and exclusion criteria were reviewed by an attending physician at each site. The Institutional Review Boards at each site approved the study, and parents provided written informed consent and children provided written assent before any involvement in the study.\nThe mild TBI group included children who sustained a blunt head trauma that resulted in at least one of the following three criteria: (1) an observed loss of consciousness (LOC), (2) a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13 or 14,\n36\nor (3) at least two acute signs or symptoms of concussion as noted by ED medical personnel on a standard case report form (i.e., post-traumatic amnesia, focal neurological deficits, skull fracture, post-traumatic seizure, vomiting, headache, dizziness, other mental status changes). Exclusion criteria included delayed neurological deterioration, neurosurgical intervention, LOC >30\u2009min, and GCS score <13. Children were not excluded if they were hospitalized or had intracranial lesions or skull fractures detected on CT scan.\nChildren were not required to complete a CT scan to be eligible for the study, but if CT scans were completed, they were available for the purpose of injury classification. Of the 40 children with mild TBI who had a CT scan, only four had trauma-related abnormalities. In addition, only six children demonstrated trauma-related abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) completed at the post-acute visit. Thus, the large majority of children in the mild TBI group had what would be diagnosed as a concussion.\nThe OI group included children who sustained upper or lower extremity fractures associated with Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) scores of 4 or less.\n37\nExclusion criteria for the OI group included any head trauma or symptoms of concussion, as well as any injury necessitating surgery or the administration of sedative medication.\nChildren were not excluded from either group if they were administered analgesic medication in the ED, including narcotics. Additional exclusion criteria for both groups included: (a) any other severe injury as defined by an AIS score greater than 4; (b) any associated injury likely to interfere with neuropsychological testing (e.g., fracture of preferred upper extremity); (c) hypoxia, hypotension, or shock during or after the injury; (d) alcohol or drug ingestion involved with the injury; (e) history of previous TBI requiring hospitalization; (f) pre-morbid neurological disorder or mental retardation; (g) injury resulting from child abuse or assault; (h) history of psychiatric disorder requiring hospitalization; or (i) medical contraindication to MRI.\nOf 588 eligible children (307 mild TBI, 281 OI) who were approached to participate in the study, 315 (195 mild TBI, 120 OI) consented and completed an initial assessment in the ED. Among those approached in the ED, those who consented did not differ in sex from those who declined, \u03c7\n2\n(1)\u2009=\u20090.182,\np\n=\u20090.669, or age,\nt\n(581)\u2009=\u20090.119,\np\n=\u20090.905. Consent rates were higher in the mild TBI group (63.5%) than the OI group (42.7%), \u03c7\n2\n(1)\u2009=\u200925.552,\np\n<\u20090.001. In addition, consent rates varied by race, \u03c7\n2\n(3)\u2009=\u200921.261,\np\n<\u20090.001, being higher among Black (60.9%) and multi-racial (76.3%) children and lower in white (45.3%) children.\nThose who consented also lived in census tracts with significantly lower median family income and percentage of residents below the poverty line than those who declined,\np\n=\u20090.019 and\np\n=\u20090.030 (Mann-Whitney\nU\ntests), respectively. Consent was not related to the percentage of minorities in children's census tracts,\np\n=\u20090.216.\nOf the 315 children who consented to participate, 217 (143 mild TBI, 74 OI) returned for a post-acute visit. Among those who consented, those seen only in the ED did not differ from those who returned for the post-acute visit on sex, \u03c7\n2\n(1)\u2009=\u20090.078,\np\n=\u20090.781, or age,\nt\n(313)\u2009=\u2009-0.257,\np\n=\u20090.798. Participants in the mild TBI group (73.3%) were more likely to return for the post-acute visit than participants in the OI group (61.7%), \u03c7\n2\n(1)\u2009=\u20094.718\np\n=\u20090.030.\nReturn rates for the post-acute visit also varied by race, \u03c7\n2\n(3)\u2009=\u200932.579,\np\n<\u20090.001, with multi-racial (96.6%) and white (79.8%) children more likely to return than Black children (54.3%). Children who returned also resided in census tracts with higher median family incomes and lower percentages of minorities and residents below the poverty line than those who were seen only in the ED,\np\n=\u20090.003, < 0.001, and\u2009=\u20090.028 (Mann-Whitney\nU\ntests), respectively.\nThe core sample for this study included the 143 children with mild TBI and 74 children with OI who returned for the post-acute visit. Participants who returned for the post-acute visit did not differ significantly from the combined group of children who declined to participate in the study or were seen only in the ED in terms of age,\nt\n(581)\u2009=\u2009-0.011,\np\n=\u20090.991, sex, \u03c7\n2\n(1)\u2009=\u20090.248,\np\n=\u20090.618, or census tract measures of median family income and percentage of minorities and residents below the poverty line, all\np\n>\u20090.451 (Mann-Whitney\nU\ntests). They did differ in race, \u03c7\n2\n(3)\u2009=\u200923.594,\np\n<\u20090.001, largely because a higher percentage of multi-racial children returned for the post-acute visit (73.7%) than did white (36.1%) or Black (33.1%) children.\nAs summarized in\nTable 1\n, the mild TBI and OI groups did not differ based on sex, age at injury, or Full Scale IQ. The mild TBI and OI groups did differ in race, \u03c7\n2\n(3)\u2009=\u20098.297,\np\n=\u20090.040; the mild TBI group had a higher percentage of white participants (52.4%) and lower percentage of multi-racial (9.8%) participants than the OI group (37.8% and 18.9%, respectively). In addition, the mild TBI group had higher socioeconomic status (SES) than the OI group,\nt\n(215)\u2009=\u20092.794,\np\n=\u20090.006, as measured by a z-score composite of standardized measures of total years of maternal education, median family income for the family census tract, and occupational status.\n38\nOf the 217 children completing the post-acute visit, 159 (102 mild TBI, 57 OI) returned at three months and 143 (97 mild TBI, 46 OI) returned at six months. The mild TBI and OI groups did not differ in attrition rates at three or six months.\nTable 1.\nDemographic and Clinical Characteristics of Participants\nVariable\nOI (\nn\n=\u200974)\nMild TBI (\nn\n=\u2009143)\nAge at injury, y, mean (SD)\n12.35 (2.37)\n12.56 (2.61)\nMale, No. (%)\n48 (64.9)\n95 (66.4)\nRace, No. (%),\nWhite\n28 (37.8)\n75 (52.4)\nBlack\n32 (43.2)\n50 (35.0)\nMulti-racial\n14 (18.9)\n14 (9.8)\nOther\n0 (0.0)\n4 (2.8)\nSES composite z score, mean (SD)\n-0.26 (0.90)\n0.13 (1.03)\nFull-scale IQ, mean (SD)\n97.89 (15.54)\n98.71 (15.04)\nLoss of consciousness, No. (%)\n1\n-\n38 (27.1)\nGlasgow Coma Scale score <15, No. (%)\n2\n-\n15 (11.7)\nInjured in sport or recreational setting, No. (%)\n3\n55 (80.9)\n110 (78.0)\nInjury mechanism\nFall\n32 (43.8)\n47 (33.3)\nStruck object\n18 (24.7)\n37 (26.2)\nStruck person\n7 (9.6)\n36 (25.5)\nBicycle or motor vehicle related\n7 (9.6)\n21 (14.9)\nOther\n9 (12.3)\n0 (0.0)\nOpen in a separate window\nOI, orthopedic injury; TBI, traumatic brain injury; SD, standard deviation; SES, socioeconomic status; IQ, intelligence quotient.\n1\nData missing\nn\n=\u20093.\n2\nData missing\nn\n=\u200915.\n3\nData missing\nn\n=\u20099.\n\nProcedure\nChildren completed an initial assessment at the time of recruitment, during their initial visit to the ED, that included a balance measure, as well as retrospective parent ratings of children's pre-injury symptoms. Children did not provide retrospective ratings of pre-injury symptoms. Participants and their families returned for post-acute visits, within three weeks of injury (mean\u2009=\u200910.31 days, standard deviation\u2009=\u20092.84, range 3\u201318 days), and also for follow-up assessments at three and six months post-injury.\nAll post-injury assessments included self-ratings of post-concussive symptoms by children and proxy ratings by parents, as well as balance and cognitive testing of the children. Children also completed a performance validity measure at all post-injury assessments, as well as a measure of intellectual functioning at the post-acute assessment. In addition, parents and children were asked to complete weekly symptom ratings remotely using a phone app or REDCap,\n39\nbeginning the week after the post-acute assessment.\n\nMeasures\nPre-morbid intellectual functioning\nThe two-subtest version of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) was used to assess the children's general intellectual functioning and provided an estimated Full Scale IQ.\n40\nAcute signs/symptoms\nA standardized injury case report form was used to elicit descriptive information regarding the injury and acute signs and symptoms of concussion including LOC, GCS scores, mechanism of injury, neurological status, reports of retrograde or anterograde amnesia, and other clinical factors. The information was gathered from medical records and medical personnel by recruiters and verified by attending physicians.\nBalance\nThe Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) was used to assess three stances (narrow double leg stance, single leg stance, and tandem stance) and two footing surfaces (firm surface/floor vs. medium density foam) held for 20\u2009sec with hands on hips and eyes closed. Error points, up to 10 per trial, were given for opening eyes, lifting hands off hips, and stepping, stumbling, or falling. The BESS has shown satisfactory reliability in children and adolescents.\n41\nIn the current study, the administration of the BESS was videotaped, and approximately 10% of the assessments were scored twice by independent raters. The BESS total score showed excellent reliability as assessed using the Krippendorf alpha (0.953), with satisfactory reliability on each of the six trials (alpha\u2009=\u20090.64\u20130.86). Because of the nature of children's injuries (e.g., lower extremity fracture) or technical problems (e.g., incomplete video coverage of the body), 30.8% of the mild TBI group and 63.5% of the OI group did not have BESS data from their ED visit; in addition, 48.6% of the OI group did not have BESS data from the post-acute visit.\nMore than 90% of children with mild TBI or OI had BESS data at all other assessments; the number of children with available BESS data at each assessment ranged from 89 to 129 for the mild TBI group and from 27 to 52 for the OI group. Because analyses used all available data, however, only 10 children from the core sample, two with mild TBI and eight with OI, were excluded entirely from analyses of the BESS.\nCognitive functioning\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox Cognition Battery (CB) was used to assess cognitive abilities.\n42\nThe battery consists of seven individual subtests that assess cognitive flexibility, visual attention and inhibitory control, processing speed, episodic memory, working memory, vocabulary knowledge, and reading. Standard scores corrected for age were derived for the fluid and crystallized cognitive composites, which were used as outcomes for this study.\nPost-concussive symptoms\nPost-concussive symptoms were assessed using the Health and Behavior Inventory (HBI).\n43\nThe HBI consists of 20 items that describe a variety of cognitive and somatic symptoms, yielding two subscales derived from factor analysis. Participants rate the frequency of occurrence of each item on a 4-point scale (0\u2009=\u2009never, 1\u2009=\u2009rarely, 2\u2009=\u2009sometimes, 3\u2009=\u2009often). The HBI includes child and parent proxy forms, worded slightly differently to reflect first versus third-person perspectives. The HBI is a core measure in the Common Data Elements for Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury and incorporated in the Child Sport Concussion Assessment Tool, 5th edition.\n44\n,\n45\nThe HBI has shown satisfactory reliability and validity in previous research.\n43\n,\n46\nIn the current sample, the Cronbach alpha was above 0.80 for the somatic scale and above 0.90 for the cognitive scale for both child and parent proxy ratings at each of the scheduled visits.\nMedical Symptom Validity Test (MSVT)\nChildren's performance validity was measured using the MSVT, which is a computerized, forced-choice recognition test designed to detect invalid performance. Children eight years and older are generally able to perform at very high levels of recognition accuracy, commensurate with adults.\n47\nPerformance on the MSVT accounts for substantial variance in cognitive test performance among children with mild TBI.\n48\n,\n49\nThe traditional MSVT cutoff was used initially to classify responses as being potentially invalid (i.e., a score of 85% or less on all three easy subtests). Of the participants meeting that criteria, some displayed a pattern of substantially worse performance on the difficult subtests than on the easy ones (difference of >20%), suggestive of cognitive impairment or memory deficit.\n47\nOnly participants who met the traditional MSVT cutoff but did not display evidence of cognitive impairment or memory deficit were considered to have potentially invalid performance.\n\nData analysis\nLinear mixed models were conducted for the measures of balance (i.e., BESS total score) and cognitive abilities (i.e., NIH Toolbox CB fluid and crystallized cognition composite age-adjusted standard scores), which had up to four (balance) or three (cognitive functioning) assessments available for analysis. Mixed models are advantageous with longitudinal data because they use all available outcome data for estimation. For each outcome, a fixed effects linear mixed model was fit with sex, group, days since injury, and their interaction as predictors. The SES also was included as a covariate in all analyses, and the model for the BESS total score also included age at injury as a covariate; the two cognitive abilities measures were already adjusted for age.\nPreliminary analyses indicated that symptom ratings for most children with mild TBI had returned to pre-injury levels by four weeks after injury, and also that weekly ratings became increasingly sparse after around 14 weeks post-injury. Therefore, the dataset that we modeled included ratings from the post-acute and three-month face-to-face assessments, as well as all weekly ratings out to 13 weeks after the post-acute assessment.\nWe fit generalized least squares models with a continuous first-order autoregressive structure to allow for correlated residuals from repeated measurement over time (i.e. nonindependent data).\n50\nFor each symptom scale, a model was fit with group, sex, days since injury, and their interactions as predictors. Age at injury, SES, and parents' retrospective ratings of pre-injury symptoms were included as covariates. To allow for nonlinearity, flexible restricted cubic splines were applied to all continuous predictors (age, pre-injury symptom rating, SES z-score, and time).\n51\nFor all predictors except for time, four knots (i.e., pivot points) were afforded at strategically spaced quantiles (i.e., 0.05, 0.35, 0.65, 0.95). For time, we specifically afforded five front-loaded knots (i.e., at 2, 3, 4, 8, 12 weeks) to accommodate our expectation for nonlinearity, particularly during the early phase of recovery. The generalized least square models also used all available outcome data for estimation. Significant group differences were explored using post-model fit contrasts by computing estimates of the Cohen d by dividing differences between estimated means by context-specific standard deviations calculated from the study sample.\nFor both linear mixed model and generalized least square analyses, if an interaction did not approach statistical significance (p\u2009>\u20090.10) after initial fitting, the model was refitted without the interaction term (starting with the highest-order term) until only significant interaction terms remained in the final model. Final models were also reestimated after excluding 10 children (nine mild TBI, one OI) who demonstrated invalid MSVT performance at any post-injury assessment. Children with suspected cognitive impairment or memory problems (seven mild TBI, two OI) were retained in these analyses."

    "Methods": "The proposed scoping review was conducted following the JBI methodology for scoping reviews.10\n\nInclusion criteria\nParticipants\nStudies of adult and adolescent (>15 years old) patients were included. All studies of pediatric patients (<15 years old) were excluded.\nConcept\nThe concept of interest for this scoping review was studies of SAH secondary to TBI, where isolated TSAH (iTSAH) refers to the presence of SAH in the absence of any other traumatic radiographic intracranial pathology, and TSAH refers to the presence of SAH with the possibility or presence of additional traumatic radiographic intracranial pathology. Central TSAH refers to SAH present in the Sylvian fissures or subarachnoid cisterns. All studies focused on non-TSAH were excluded.\nContext\nThe review was limited to studies conducted between 2005 and 2020.\n\nSearch strategy\nThe search strategy aimed to locate both published and unpublished studies. An initial limited search of MEDLINE and Scopus was undertaken to identify articles on the topic. The text words in the titles and abstracts of relevant articles and the index terms used to describe the articles were used to develop a full search strategy for PubMed, MEDLINE, and Scopus. A full search strategy for MEDLINE is detailed in\nAppendix\nI. In the second phase of the search, the search strategy was adopted to search EMBASE, Web of Science, and EBSCO. The reference lists of selected studies were screened for additional studies during the third phase of the search.\nStudies published in English, Spanish, and French between the years 2005 and 2020 were included.\nInformation sources\nThe databases searched included PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, EBSCO, and MEDLINE.\nTypes of sources\nThis scoping review considered experimental and quasiexperimental study designs, including randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized controlled trials, before and after studies, and interrupted time-series studies. Analytical observational studies, including prospective and retrospective cohort studies, case-control studies, and analytical cross-sectional studies, were considered inclusion. This review also considered descriptive observational study designs, including case series, individual case reports, and descriptive cross-sectional studies for inclusion. Also, systematic reviews that met the inclusion criteria were considered. Text and opinion articles were also considered for inclusion in this scoping review.\nStudy/source of evidence selection\nFollowing the search, all identified citations were collated and uploaded into EndNoteX9 (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA). The citations were then imported into Covidence online software (Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia) for screening. Two independent researchers (DG and LF) examined titles and abstracts for inclusion. The full texts of selected studies were retrieved and assessed. Full-text studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded, and the reasons for exclusion are listed in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram (\nFig. 1\n). Any disagreements that arose between the researchers during either title and abstract screening or full-text screening were resolved through discussion. Included studies underwent a process of data extraction. The results of the search are presented in the PRISMA flow diagram.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram.\n\nData\nData extraction\nData were extracted from the included studies by a reviewer and verified by a second reviewer using a data extraction tool developed in Covidence. The data extracted included study aim, country, methodology, length of study, sample size, population characteristics, outcome measures, a summary of findings, and conclusion and future directives. Extracted data are available in\nSupplementary Data 2, Table 3\n.\nData synthesis\nStudies were summarized in tables, graphs, and narratively."

We decided to use the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist instead of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for the non-randomized studies risk of bias assessment.\n\nSearch\nA comprehensive search was conducted by two independent investigators in three databases (PubMed, Embase, and Central\n\u00ae\n). Our query was based on the Population; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome (PICO) framework. We included studies that examined patients with TBI at all severity levels (P), and assessed them with GH therapy (I) and without replacement of the hormone (C) in terms of cognitive outcome (O) based on neuropsychological tests. We used the following query in all three databases: \u201c{[GH OR (growth AND hormone)] OR [IGF-1 OR (IGF AND 1) OR (insulin-like AND growth AND factor)]} AND [(brain AND injury) OR TBI OR concussion].\u201d We perfomred our search until October 22, 2019.\nWe limited our search to human studies written in English via the appropriate filters when searching in PubMed and Embase. To expand the search, we performed a recursive hand search on the references of relevant articles. We also searched PROSPERO, an international database for systematic reviews and meta-analyses for previously completed reviews on the subject.\n\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nWe excluded letters, comments, editorials, and reviews. In our review, we included observational studies, interventional trials, and case reports. We imposed no restriction in terms of the etiology of TBI. We included studies with TBI patients who received GH therapy. If there were multiple publications using the same group of patients, the latest was chosen.\n\nScreening and selection\nAfter the initial search, all records were imported into a reference management program (EndNote X7, Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, USA). The software was used in the process of removing duplicates by searching for articles with overlapping publication year, author, and/or title. After duplicates were removed, the authors screened the remaining articles against the pre-defined eligibility criteria by title, abstract, and then full text. Two different researchers conducted each step independently. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus.\n\nData extraction\nData were extracted from studies included by one of the investigators and re-checked by another, and were manually entered in an Excel 2016 sheet (Office 365, Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA). Data were collected on the first author, year of publication, study design, geographical location, number of patients, basic demographics (age, sex, education), time since injury, GH hormone dose, and the length of the treatment in each group. Finally, data were extracted on the neuropsychological outcomes such as digit span, processing speed index, verbal learning and visuospatial memory, depression, and QoL. Two different researchers conducted each step simultaneously. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus.\n\nQuality assessment and quality of evidence\nThe Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist for case reports and case series and for cohort studies was used to assess the quality of the studies included in the analysis\n26\n(\nTable 1\n). The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was used to assess the quality of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included.\n27\nTwo different researchers conducted each appraisal checklist independently (\nFig. 1\n).

Inclusion criteria were overnight hospitalization for traumatic injury (TBI or OI); no evidence of child abuse as the cause of the injury; no history of previous TBI, documented neurological problems, or developmental delays pre-injury; and English as the primary language spoken in the home.\nTBI severity was characterized using the lowest post-resuscitation GCS score and clinically obtained neuroimaging findings.\n62\nSevere TBI was defined as a GCS score \u22648. Moderate TBI was defined as a GCS score of 9\u201312 with or without abnormal neuroimaging (moderate TBI) or a higher GCS score with abnormal neuroimaging as defined by an intracranial or parenchymal injury or depressed skull fracture (complicated mild TBI). Mild TBI was defined as a GCS score \u226513 without abnormal neuroimaging. The OI group included children who had sustained a bone fracture (not including skull fractures), had an overnight hospitalization, and did not exhibit alterations in consciousness or other signs/symptoms of head trauma or brain injury.\n\nDNA collection and genotyping\nDNA was collected from saliva samples and purified using Oragene OG-500 self-collection tubes (DNA Genotek, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). The HumanExome v1.1 Bead Chip (Illumina, San Diego, CA) was used to perform genotyping using the Illumina iScan system to identify the\nBDNF\nrs6265 SNP. Genotypes were AA (methionine/methionine homozygote), GA (valine/methionine heterozygote), and GG (valine/valine homozygote). Consistent with earlier\nBDNF\nval66met studies, we used a dominant model combining persons with GA and AA genotypes into one group of Met allele carriers with assumed reduced activity-dependent secretion of BDNF. Principal component analysis was used to confirm European and African continental ancestry, which aligns with self-reported White and Black race, using 200 validated ancestry informative markers and HapMap genotypic data from persons of known ancestry as referent groups. Concordance with self-reported race was >95%. Results of analyses were similar when including only participants of European ancestry; therefore, both ancestral groups were retained in analyses to preserve power.\n\nOutcome measures\nParents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)\n63\nat all visits, the first of which involved retrospective recall of the child's behavior before injury to control for pre-injury differences in child functioning. The CBCL is a parent-report measure of child behavioral adjustment with high test-retest reliability and criterion-related validity. We analyzed the age- and sex-standardized Internalizing Problems, Externalizing Problems, and Total Problems T scores to assess child behavior. Higher scores reflect poorer behavioral adjustment. The CBCL is included in the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke recommended common data elements for pediatric TBI and is well validated for the pediatric TBI population.\n64\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were conducted using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC), except computation of conditional\nR\n2\nfor mixed models, which was performed in R 4.0.2.\n65\nBefore analyses, child outcome data were reviewed for plausibility according to the following rules to reduce the potential influence of outliers: 1) Participants with changes in outcome scores between the second and final study visit that exceeded 3 standard deviations (SDs) of change were excluded from respective analyses (\nn\n=\u20090 participants), and 2) outcome scores of T\u2009>\u200990 (4 SDs above the normative mean) were winsorized to 90 (\nn\n=\u20093 participants). Continuous data were summarized using means and SDs, and categorical data are presented as frequencies and percentages. For group comparisons, the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test were used. Although we performed many statistical tests, because of the non-independent and correlated outcome variables and exploratory nature of the study, all statistical tests were considered significant at\np\n<\u20090.05.\nWe examined genetic associations with outcome by injury group using longitudinal mixed models including all time points while accounting for the within-subject correlation with an unstructured covariance random effect. Because longitudinal mixed models do not require complete data for all participants, participants with only a subset of study visits were retained in the analyses. We examined the association of the\nBDNF\nrs6265 polymorphism (Met carriers vs. Val/Val homozygotes) with Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total Problems T scores and the moderating effect of injury group (TBI vs. OI) on these associations (e.g., allele status\u2009\u00d7\u2009injury group interaction). The three-way interaction of allele status\u2009\u00d7\u2009injury group\u2009\u00d7\u2009time was not examined because of insufficient power. Mixed models included random intercepts, slopes, and subjects. Random slopes were modeled across time.\nCovariates that were initially included and then trimmed if non-significant were the child's pre-injury functioning as assessed at the immediate post-injury visit on the variable of interest (Internalizing, Externalizing, or Total Problems T score) and SES (defined by averaging sample\nz\nscores for maternal education and median income).\n31\nTime post-injury and continental ancestry (dichotomized as European vs. African) were included as covariates in all models. Conditional\nR\n2\nfor mixed models were examined in R software using the function \u201cr2_nakagawa\u201d from the Performance package. Conditional\nR\n2\ndescribes the proportion of variation accounted for by both fixed and random effects.\n66\nTo understand significant interaction effects involving injury group, we plotted estimated values for dependent variables for each group by allele status to visualize the direction of effects and conducted\npost hoc\nstratified mixed models within each injury group."

    "Methods": "Study design\nWe performed an analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data obtained as part of a study of outcomes in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), and Operation New Dawn (OND) veterans. The parent study was reviewed by the Institutional Review Board at the VA Puget Sound. All participants provided written informed consent before study enrollment and participation in study procedures. The analysis of deidentified data was approved by the Oregon Health & Science University Institutional Review Board.\n\nParticipants\nParent study\nParticipants were recruited from VA Puget Sound, as well as through outreach to veterans' organizations. All patients were male and fluent in English. Enrollment and follow-up took place between March 2011 and September 2019. Exclusion criteria for the parent study included: a neurological disorder (including moderate or severe traumatic brain injury), lifetime Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition diagnoses of schizophrenia, other psychotic disorder, or bipolar disorder and a diagnosis of substance abuse or dependence within the past 3 months. MRI was obtained strictly for research purposes and not based on clinical need.\nCurrent study\nFor inclusion criteria, OEF/OIF/OND veterans were included in the current study if they 1) had MRI data available of sufficient quality for PVS segmentation and 2) reported a history of mTBI (attributable to blast or any other cause). mTBI was defined as per the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine diagnostic criteria for mTBI (i.e., one or more of the following was present): 1) loss of consciousness (LOC) up to 30\u2009min, 2) loss of memory for events surrounding the event for up to 24\u2009h, or 3) any alteration in mental state.\n25\n\nVariables\nClinical and demographic variables\nThese included age, race, ethnicity, and blood pressure.\nAssessment of mild traumatic brain injury\nInformation regarding the lifetime history of both blast and impact mTBI was obtained as previously described.\n26\n,\n27\nBriefly, a team of two physicians or physician assistants simultaneously completed semistructured interviews that yielded information regarding the number and characteristics of lifetime mTBIs and blast exposures. For each episode, participants were asked to report any loss/alteration of consciousness, post-traumatic amnesia, medical care received, and any change in duty status after the injury. For this analysis, mTBI exposure was stratified into three categories: 1) the number of mTBI with LOC sustained while in the military; 2) the number of mTBI with LOC sustained outside the military; and 3) number of blast exposures while in the military that met the definition of mTBI but were not associated with LOC.\nAssessment of sleep\nSleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Inventory (PSQI). The PSQI measures symptoms of sleep disturbances over 1 month. Responses are categorized into seven component categories. These categories are then combined to create one global score, with a range from 0\u201321. A global PSQI score\n>\n5 is usually used to qualify poor sleepers.\n28\nAssessment of post-concussive symptoms\nPresence of persistent post-concussive symptoms at the time of the interview was assessed with the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI). The NSI is a self-reported questionnaire commonly used to assess the presence and severity of post-concussive symptoms in veterans.\n29\nIt consists of 22 items, reflecting cognitive, affective, and somatic/vestibular symptoms. Items are graded on a 0\u20134 scale, with higher scores reflecting higher symptom severity.\n30\nMagnetic resonance imaging acquisition and review\nThree-dimensional T\n1\n-weighted magnetically prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (repetition time [TR]/echo time [TE]/inversion time [TI]\u2009=\u20097.6/3.5/909\u2009ms, imaging matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009176, resolution\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR; TR/TE/TI\u2009=\u20094800/245/1650\u2009ms, imaging matrix\u2009=\u2009168\u2009\u00d7\u2009168\u2009\u00d7\u2009120, resolution 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091.5\u2009mm) MRI were collected in the sagittal plane on a 3.0 Tesla (T) Philips Achieva whole-body scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) with a transmit-receive head coil.\nImaging pre-processing and perivascular space segmentation\nT\n1\n-weighted images were segmented into tissue types (i.e., white matter [WM], cortical gray matter, subcortical gray matter, and ventricular CSF) using Freesurfer v5.1. WM masks were corrected for tissue misclassification, as described previously,\n31\nand eroded by a single voxel to avoid potential partial volume effects. FLAIR volumes were bias field corrected using N4BiasFieldCorrection (\nhttp://picsl.upenn.edu/software/ants/\n). The determination of which acquisitions were too degraded to analyze was a qualitative one, though it is notable that each of these acquisitions failed WM segmentation at the Freesurfer stage.\nPerivascular space segmentation\nPVS segmentation was obtained using a previously described method that searches WM for hypointense objects that meet a set of morphological criteria; WM hyperintensities were avoided by consulting FLAIR.\n23\n,\n24\nEach PVS detected by the automated algorithm was assessed by a blinded researcher (M.L.) with experience in PVS analysis; false alarms were removed from further analysis.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using Stata/MP software (version 15; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the cohort's characteristics. Differences in clinical characteristics among included and excluded subjects were evaluated with two-sample\nt\n-tests. Multi-variate linear regression was used to assess the relationship between PVS burden (primary outcome) and covariates based on\na priori\nconsideration of potential predictors and confounders. PVS burden was defined as two separate outcome variables: PVS number (the number of PVS per cm\n3\nof white matter) and volume (the total volume of PVS [mm\n3\n] per cm\n3\nof WM). The primary exposure was the number of mTBIs with LOC sustained in the military. Potential predictors and confounders were: age, systolic blood pressure, number of mTBIs with LOC sustained outside the military, the total number of blast mTBIs without LOC while in the military, and poor sleep (dichotomous yes/no based on published PSQI parameters\n28\n). We also examined poor sleep as a potential effect modifier (interaction) of the association between the number of mTBI with LOC sustained in the military and PVS burden.\nAssumptions of normality, linearity, and homoscedasticity in the final model were tested with residual versus fitted plots and quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots. Multi-collinearity was tested by calculating correlation coefficients (\nSupplementary Table S1\n) and variance inflation factors (\nSupplementary Table S2\n). Secondary outcomes included individual PVS morphological characteristics (i.e., width and length). We used the Shapiro-Wilk test to assess the normality of distribution. PVS number volume, length, and width were not normally distributed, and therefore they were log-transformed. We report\np\nvalues as well as 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All reported\np\nvalues are two-sided, and the threshold for statistical significance is set to an alpha of 0.05. The correlation between PVS burden and severity of post-concussive symptoms (NSI) was evaluated with Pearson's correlation coefficient. Bonferroni's correction was used to adjust for multiple comparisons.\n\nData availability statement\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the parent study upon request and approval through VA Puget Sound."

    "Methods": "Participants and procedures\nParticipants (\nN\n=\u200973) were veterans with a history of mTBI who were recruited from the VA San Diego Healthcare System (VASDHS). Study procedures involved completion of a semistructured interview assessing TBI history, neuropsychological testing, and self-report questionnaires (see below under\nMeasures\nfor details). Inclusion criteria included having a history of at least one mTBI as defined by Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense (VA/DoD) criteria\n12\nand completing all relevant study procedures. Exclusion criteria included having a history of moderate or severe TBI, a serious neurological/medical condition (e.g., dementia, stroke) or psychiatric condition (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder), and current or recent (within the past month) substance abuse or dependence. Additional exclusion criteria included performance validity test failure (described below under\nMeasures\n). Institutional review board approval was obtained from the VASDHS, and all participants provided informed consent before participating in research activities.\n\nMeasures\nA modified version of the VA Semi-Structured Clinical Interview for TBI\n13\nwas used to gather details pertaining to lifetime TBI history. Specifically, the interview is designed to collect information pertaining to date(s) of injury, mechanism(s) of injury, and the presence/duration of loss of consciousness (LOC), alteration of consciousness (AOC), and post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) for any injury event reported. Those with a confirmed history of at least one mTBI based on VA/DoD guidelines\n12\nwere eligible for participation.\nA comprehensive neuropsychological assessment was administered to all veterans to assess the broad domains of memory, attention and processing speed, and executive functioning. The test battery included the following measures: California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition (CVLT-II); Logical Memory and Visual Reproduction from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Fourth Edition (WMS-IV); Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT); Block Design from the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence-Second Edition (WASI-II); Coding and Symbol Search from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV); Design Fluency, Trail Making, and Verbal Fluency from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS); and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test-64 Card Version (WCST-64). In addition to the above core tests, the Reading subtest from the Wide Range Achievement Test 4 (WRAT4) was administered to assess pre-morbid functioning, and measures of performance validity included the Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM) and the CVLT-II Forced Choice Recognition subtest. Performance validity test failure was defined as inadequate performance (based on manual-specific guidelines) on either TOMM Trial 2, TOMM Retention,\nor\nCVLT-II Forced Choice Recognition; participants demonstrating inadequate performance on\none or more\nof these measures were excluded.\nIn total, 25 variables were selected from the neuropsychological assessment and were converted from raw to norm-referenced standard scores using procedures described previously.\n14\nThree cognitive composite scores, including memory (eight items: CVLT-II Trials 1\u20135 Total Recall, Short Delay Free Recall, and Long Delay Free Recall; WMS-IV Logical Memory I and II; WMS-IV Visual Reproduction I and II; and RCFT Delay), attention/processing speed (A/PS; seven items: D-KEFS Trail Making Visual Scanning, Number Sequencing, Letter Sequencing, and Motor Speed; WASI-II Block Design; and WAIS-IV Coding and Symbol Search), and executive functioning (EF; 10 items: D-KEFS Design Fluency Filled, Empty, and Switching; D-KEFS Trail Making Number-Letter Switching; D-KEFS Verbal Fluency Letter, Category, Switching, and Switching Accuracy; and WCST-64 Perseverate Responses and Total Errors), were computed to represent mean cognitive performance. Additionally, three IIV indices were calculated reflecting degree of dispersion across the same cognitive domains (memory-IIV, A/PS-IIV, and EF-IIV). Each IIV index was computed by taking the standard deviation of the standard scores associated with each cognitive domain.\nThe 17-item PTSD Checklist-Military Version (PCL-M)\n14\nwas used to assess current PTSD symptoms. Veterans were asked to evaluate the degree to which they have been bothered by each symptom over the past month, using a rating scale ranging from \u201c1\u201d (not at all) to \u201c5\u201d (extremely). A PCL-M total score is generated by summing together the 17 items; higher scores on this measure reflect more severe PTSD symptoms.\nThe 26-item World Health Organization Quality of Life Short Version (WHOQOL-BREF)\n4\nwas used to assess HR-QOL; for the purpose of this study, the Physical Health domain from the WHOQOL-BREF was evaluated. The Physical Health domain includes items assessing activities of daily living, reliance on medical treatments, sleep, pain, mobility, capacity for work, and energy. The Physical Health domain score ranges from 0 to 100; higher scores reflect better functioning.\n\nStatistical analysis\nTo examine the association between cognitive functioning and HR-QOL, hierarchical linear regressions were conducted. PTSD symptoms (PCL-M total score) were entered in the first block, and cognitive scores were entered in the second block. Mean cognitive performance indices and IIV indices were evaluated in separate regressions. Although there were significant associations among the mean cognitive composite scores (\nr\ns\u2009=\u20090.345 to 0.529;\np\ns\u2009=\u2009<0.001 to 0.003), tolerance and variance inflation factor (VIF) statistics indicated that multi-collinearity was not an issue (tolerance\u2009=\u20090.64\u20130.78; VIF\u2009=\u20091.28\u20131.57). As for the IIV indices, there were no significant associations among these variables (\nr\ns\u2009=\u2009\u22120.020 to 0.181;\np\ns\u2009=\u20090.126 to 0.867). All analyses were conducted using SPSS software (Version 27; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL).\n\nAvailability of data\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author, L.D.W., upon reasonable request."

Food and water were available\nad libitum\n. After blast exposure, mice remained in the animal facility overnight before being transported (\u223c9.3\u2009km) in their home cages from the Uniformed Services University to the Laboratory of Behavioral and Genomic Neuroscience, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA). After a minimum 3-day acclimation at the NIAAA, behavior experiments were performed by researchers who were blind to the blast/sham conditions.

The initial number of mice generated in each experiment was 58 mice that received Sham (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009) treatment, 57 mice that received 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009Blast, 72 mice that received Sham (4\u2009\u00d7\u2009) treatment, and 115 mice that were assigned to the 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009Blast treatment. The number of animals used in the final analysis, after exclusions attributable to death after blast, is indicated in the figure legends.\n\nBlast injury\nBlast exposures were performed at the USUHS site with an Advanced Blast Simulator (ABS\n39\n) as described previously.\n15\n,\n40\nThe driver section of the ABS was separated from the transition section with two or three acetate sheets (0.254-mm thickness each; Grafix Plastics, Cleveland, OH) and two vinyl-mesh layers (mesh size 14.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910 grids/in\n2\n, wire diameter 0.635\u2009mm, Pet Screen, Hanover/New York Wire, Cat. No. 70589). The driver was sealed by the membrane material and pressurized to 150\u2013160 psi, before bursting the acetate/vinyl membrane. For single shock-wave exposure (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009Blast, \u223c15 psi peak pressure, recorded from a pencil gauge positioned adjacent to the animal), mice were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane in 100% oxygen for 4\u20136\u2009min and placed in a mesh rodent holder, with their ventral side facing the blast source. For repeated blast (4\u2009\u00d7\u2009Blast, \u223c15 psi peak pressure), mice were subjected to the blast procedure once per day for four consecutive days. Sham controls underwent the same procedures as the relevant single and repeated blast group (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009or 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009Sham), with the exception that no shockwave was delivered.\n\nDelay cued fear conditioning and extinction\nDelay fear conditioning was conducted essentially as previously described.\n41\u201343\nConditioning was conducted in a 30\u2009\u00d7\u200925\u2009\u00d7\u200925\u2009cm chamber with metal walls and a metal rod floor (Context A). To provide an olfactory cue, the context was cleaned between subjects with a 79.5% water/19.5% ethanol/1% vanilla extract solution. After a 180-sec acclimation period, the mouse received three pairings of a 20\u2009sec, 70-dB white noise cue (conditioned stimulus; CS), that coterminated with a 2\u2009sec, 0.6-mA scrambled footshock (unconditioned stimulus; US). Pairings were separated by a variable 60- to 90-sec interpairing interval. Mice remained in the testing context for 60\u2009sec after the final pairing.\nFear extinction was performed the next day in a novel context, Context B: a 27\u2009\u00d7\u200927\u2009\u00d7\u200911\u2009cm chamber with curved white Plexiglas walls and a floor of the same material, cleaned with a 99% water/1% acetic acid solution and located in a different room from Context A. After a 180-sec baseline, mice received 50\u2009\u00d7\u2009CS presentations with a 5-sec inter-CS interval. The next day, extinction retrieval was tested in Context B: 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009CS presentations (5\u2009sec of intertrial interval) after a 180-sec baseline. Later that day, fear renewal was tested by repeating the retrieval procedure, but with 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009CS presentations in Context A. CS and US presentations were controlled by the Med Associates Freeze Monitor System (Med Associates, Fairfax, VT). Freezing, as an index of fear, was scored manually by a researcher blind to blast group. Freezing was defined as the absence of any visible movement, except that required for respiration, and was scored at 5-sec intervals by an observer blind to genotype. The number of observations scored as freezing was converted to a percentage, [(number of freezing observations/total number of observations)\u2009\u00d7\u2009100], for analysis.\n\nTrace fear conditioning\nTrace fear was tested essentially as previously described.\n44\n,\n45\nConditioning was conducted in a 30\u2009\u00d7\u200925\u2009\u00d7\u200925\u2009cm chamber with metal walls and a metal rod floor (Context A). After a 180-sec acclimation period, the mouse received three pairings of a 20-sec, 70-dB white noise CS, followed by a 20-sec trace period and then a 2-sec, 0.6-mA scrambled footshock US. Pairings were separated by a variable 150- to 270-sec pairing interval. Mice remained in the testing context for 60\u2009sec after the final pairing.\nTo evaluate fear retrieval, responses to the CS were assessed on the second day in a novel context (Context B). After a 300-sec baseline period, mice received five CS presentations, separated by a 20-sec interval (Trace). On the third day, mice were placed in Context A, where they had received fear conditioning, for 300\u2009sec to evaluate context memory retrieval. Freezing episodes, >1\u2009sec in duration, were scored automatically by Video Freeze software (Med Associates), and percentage of freezing time in defined behavioral test phases (baseline, CS, and trace) was calculated.\n\nSocial recognition test\nSocial recognition was tested as described previously.\n46\nIn brief, the test mouse was placed in a novel home cage (14\u2009\u00d7\u200936\u2009cm), lined with fresh corn cob bedding, under dim light (21 lux). After a 15-min habituation period, an unfamiliar juvenile (post-natal day 45) mouse was placed in the cage for a 2-min sample period, and then both mice were returned to their home cages. Thirty minutes later, both mice were returned to the testing environment for a 2-min test period. Behavior was recorded using a GoPro HERO5 Black camera (GoPro Inc., San Mateo, CA). Social interaction was manually scored by a researcher blind to the blast exposure condition, as the summed duration of test mouse sniffing, following, or otherwise attending (within 1\u2009cm) to the juvenile mouse.\n46\nThe difference in social interaction time (\nsample\n-\ntest\n) and the proportional change in interaction time (\ntest\n/\nsample\n) was calculated.\n\nSpatial novelty preference Y-maze test\nThe Y-maze test was based on a previously described procedure.\n47\nThe apparatus consisted of three 30-cm-long arms, with 20-cm-high walls, constructed of clear acrylic, positioned at a 120-degree angle to one another and located in a room with handmade three-dimensional distal spatial cues. The floor of the maze was covered with a mixture of clean and dirty (from an unfamiliar, male mouse) bedding, at a ratio of 3:1. Arms were designated (spatial location counterbalanced across mice) as home, familiar, or novel. During the sample trial, the novel arm was blocked. Mice were individually placed at the end of the home arm, facing away from the familiar and novel arms, and after 5-min, they were returned to the home cage. One minute later, the mouse was returned to the maze, with the novel arm freely accessible and the bedding redistributed throughout the apparatus, for a 2-min test period. Behavior was recorded using a GoPro HERO5 Black camera.\nThe number of arm entries and total duration in the familiar and novel arms in the first minute of the test period was manually scored by a researcher blinded to the blast exposure condition and calculated to generate measures of novel arm preference as 1)\nPreference Index (duration)\u2009=\u2009time in novel arm/(time in novel arm + time in familiar arm)\nand 2)\nPreference Index (entries)\u2009=\n#\nentries into novel arm/(#entries into novel arm + #entries into familiar arm)\n. An entrance into the arms was scored when the mouse had all four paws in the arm.\n\nRNA purification and reverse-transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction\nA subset of mice from 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009Sham and 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009Blast were euthanized by cervical dislocation 2 days after completing fear and extinction testing (see\nTable 1\n). The head was briefly chilled in ice-cold PBS and the brain extracted on ice and flash-frozen in dry, ice-cold 2-methylbutane. Brain regions of interest (ROIs) were punched and transferred to RNAlater (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini kit (Qiagen). Fifty nanograms of RNA was used to synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA) using reverse transcriptase (iScript; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), and one twenty-fifth of its volume was used for the RT-qPCR reaction to quantify the cDNA of interest. RT-qPCR was performed using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with a StepOnePlus Real-Time qPCR instrument (Applied Biosystems). PCR was performed as follows: 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009denature (95\u00b0C for 20\u2009sec) and 46\u2009\u00d7\u2009PCR (95\u00b0C for 3\u2009sec, 60\u00b0C for 30\u2009sec), and relative mRNA levels were determined by normalizing cycle threshold (Ct) values of the target and reference housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (\nGapdh\n), using the \u0394\u0394Ct method. Primers were designed by primerBLAST (NIH, Bethesda, MD), and the sequences are provided in\nTable 2\n.\nTable 2.\nSummary of the Primers Used in RT-qPCR\nGene Forward (5\u2032 - 3\u2032) Reverse (5\u2032 - 3\u2032) Amplicon size Amplicon location\nGfap\nTGGCCACCAGTAACATGCAA CTCTAGGGACTCGTTCGTGC 188\u2009bp coding region (Rev primer spanning exon)\nAqp4\nTTCTCTTCGGTGCTAGGAAAC AGGAAGCTTATGTCTCTGGTG 158\u2009bp 3\u2032 UTR\nMbp\nCAGAAGAGACCCTCACAGCG CTAAAGAAGCGCCCGATGGA 125\u2009bp coding region\nGpr17\nTGGCTGTTACCCCACTTGTC TCTTCTGTGGCCCCCATTTG 147\u2009bp 3\u2032 UTR\nOlig2 TTACAGACCGAGCCAACACC TGGCCCCAGGGATGATCTAA 129\u2009bp 5\u2032 UTR and start codon\nNefh\nACCACCAGGAGGAGGTGG GTCCAACCTCACTCGGAACC 197\u2009bp coding region (exon spanning)\nHapln2\nCCTGAAGCAGCCAGACATCC ACTCCCTAGTACTGCAAGATGA 156\u2009bp 5\u2032 UTR (exon spanning)\nAgrin\nCCTACTCCTGCAAGGTTCGAG GACACCTGGTTGTCGCAGAT 136\u2009bp coding (exon spanning)\nVcan\nACCCGAGACCTACCCTGAAA ACAGAGGGACAGGCTTAGGT 170\u2009bp coding region\nCNPase\nCAGCAGGAGGTGGTGAAGAG AGATCACTGGGCCACAACTG 134\u2009bp coding region\nNg2 (Cspg4)\nCCAGGTGCTGTTCAGCGTGAG CATCAGCTGGTCAGAGGTGTC 160\u2009bp coding region\nTN-R\nCGTGAAGCCTTCTCTCTGCC AGTTGATGCAGACACCCAGG 184\u2009bp 5\u2032 UTR (exon spanning)\nGapdh\nAATGCATCCTGCACCACCAAC TGGATGCAGGGATGATGTTCTG 187\u2009bp coding region\nOpen in a separate window\nPrimer sequences and properties of a pair of primers per gene are listed.

Brains were removed and post-fixed overnight. The next day, brains were transferred to a 15% sucrose PBS solution and then to a 30% sucrose in PBS solution. After sinking in the 30% sucrose/PBS, brains were frozen with dry ice-cold 2-methylbutane and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until they were sectioned on a CM 3050S (Leica Biosystems, Wetzler, Germany), or a Microm HM500 OM (ThermoFisherScientific, Waltham, MA), cryostat.\nFor 2\u2032,3-cyclic nucleotide-3-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) and myelin basic protein (MBP) immunostaining, 50-\u03bcm coronal sections were washed in PBS, blocked with 1% BSA, 10% normal goat serum, and 0.3% Triton-X 100 in PBS for 2\u2009h at room temperature, then incubated for 2 overnights on a shaker at 4\u00b0C with antibodies against CNPase (D83E10, rabbit monoclonal immunoglobulin G [IgG], 1:100; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), MBP (SMI-99 mouse monoclonal IgG, 1:1000; Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA), or glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; rabbit polyclonal IgG, 1:2500; DAKO/Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 700 laser scanning confocal microscope with an EC Plan-NEOFLUAR 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009/0.30 objective. To ensure that the same level of optical sections was taken across all the samples, we obtained three z-stack images from the tissue attached to the cover-slip surface and used only the middle plane for analysis. Details of fluorescent signal quantification are described in the\nAnalysis of myelin density\nsection below.\nFor Black Gold II (Millipore Sigma) staining, 30-\u03bcm-thick coronal sections were mounted directly on gelatinized slides. Sections were washed in deionized H\n2\nO for 2\u2009min and stained in Black Gold II for 12\u2009min, then washed twice in DI H\n2\nO and submerged in a sodium thiosulfate solution for 3\u2009min. Sections were washed another three times before being stained in cresyl violet (Millipore Sigma) for 3\u2009min and then washed another three times. Finally, sections were dehydrated in a graded alcohol series (70%-95%-95%-100%-100%), two xylene washes, and cover-slipped using Permount (ThermoFisherScientific).\nFor staining the nodes of Ranvier, 18-\u03bcm-thick coronal sections were cut and directly mounted on slides. Slides were washed with PBS and blocked with 5% goat serum, 0.5% BSA, and 0.5% Triton-X-100, in PBS and incubated for 48\u2009h at 4\u00b0C in a humidified slide chamber with anti-Nav1.6 antibody (rabbit polyclonal IgG, 1:200; Alomone Labs Ltd., Jerusalem, Israel [as previously described\n48\n]) and anti-Caspr antibody (K65/35 mouse monoclonal IgG\n1\n, 1:100; NeuroMab, Davis, CA). Images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 880, using a Plan-Apochromat 63\u2009\u00d7\u2009/1.40 Oil DIC objective (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).\n\nMeasurement of nodes of Ranvier\nUnder the microscope, coronal sections (bregma +0.4 to +0.5) were selected with reference to the mouse brain atlas,\n49\nand the corpus callosum area close to the midline (between the lateral ventricles) was set as the acquisition area. Three optical sections were taken at 0.44-\u03bcm intervals and projected as single planes for length analysis. For each mouse, 30 nodes of Ranvier were randomly selected and the length of the nodal gap was measured using NIH ImageJ software\n50\nby a researcher blind to the blast exposure condition.\n\nAnalysis of myelin density\nMyelin density was determined using a custom-written Matlab code (Matlab 2018a; The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA) with an image-processing toolbox. Two lines, 200\u2009\u03bcm apart, spanning the full layers of the CA1 area of the hippocampus, were drawn onto the Hoechst channel of the MBP- or CNPase-stained images of the CA1. Intensity profile of the fluorescent pixel intensity signal (16-bit), average of mediolateral axis, was created along the dotted lines. Averaged values from different images were aligned for the dorsoventral level by using the peak of Hoechst signal intensity in the pyramidal cell layer, and the same ROI (the area defined by two lines) was applied for the immunostained channels of the same images. Then, intensity profiles of Hoechst fluorescent signal, MBP immunofluorescent signal, or CNPase immunofluorescent signal, along the dorsoventral axis of CA1, were graphed. To detect the most affected layer of hippocampal CA1, MBP signal intensity was normalized to the min/max value of each ROI of the image by this equation, Normalized intensity\u2009=\u2009[Intensity \u2013 min(intensity) / Max(Intensity) \u2013 min(Intensity)], and plotted. For Black Gold II staining of myelin, the brightfield image was processed for color deconvolution to split Nissl staining and Black Gold II signals using Fiji software, and the Black Gold II signal in\nstratum oriens\nof the CA1 area of the hippocampus was quantified.\n\nElectron microscopy\nA subset of mice (1 mouse from each of the 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009Sham and 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009Blast groups at the 1- and 8-week post-blast intervals) were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains were post-fixed in the same solution, rinsed four times in a 0.2-M cacodylate/calcium chloride buffer, and again post-fixed for 4\u2009h in 2% osmium tetroxide made in double-distilled water. After another four cacodylate/calcium chloride rinses, samples were stained with 1% uranyl acetate overnight. Samples were then washed three times in deionized H\n2\nO and dehydrated with a graded series of ethanol solutions. Once fully dehydrated, samples were embedded in Epon. Ultrasectioning and transmission electron microscopy microscopy was performed by Nicholas H. Conoan (University of Nebraska, EM Core; see Acknowledgments).\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (ver. 7.02; GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA) and SPSS software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). A repeated-measures (RM) three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted for the factors, CS, blast exposure, and time interval, as independent variables. For RM-ANOVA, a Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied for the delayed fear conditioning, trace fear conditioning, and myelin density analyses. For MBP and CNPase optical density analyses, the CA1 area was divided into 10 layers representing the\nstratum oriens\n,\nstratum pyramidale\n, and\nstratum radiatum\n(Str. Ori 1, 2, 3, 4; Str. Pyr 1, 2; and Str. Rad 1, 2, 3, 4), and a two-way RM-ANOVA was performed for blast exposure and layer as variables. To facilitate readability, only statistically significant (\np\n<\u20090.05) ANOVA results (main effect or interaction) are reported in the text."

    "Methods": "Rate of regulation\nOne of the earliest means of assessing dynamic CA in an intermittent fashion was described by Aaslid and colleagues and was termed the thigh cuff deflation technique (TCDT).\n52\nIn their seminal work, they induced an acute step decrease in ABP by rapidly deflating a thigh BP cuff that had previously been inflated above the subject's systolic BP for 2\u2009min. They then measured the time for the FV to return to its pre-deflation level and termed this the rate of regulation (RoR) with 0.2/sec considered as normal (Equation 4).\n52\nEquation 4\nR\no\nR\n=\n\u0394\nA\nB\nP\n\u2215\nC\nB\nF\n\u0394\nt\n\u00d7\n\u0394\nM\nA\nP\n\nAutoregulatory index\nTiecks and colleagues built on the RoR method and developed the autoregulatory index (ARI).\n52\nThey used a second order differential model of CA based on three physical properties: the time constant, the damping factor and the autoregulatory gain. A set of 10 parameter values were defined and an ordinal scale from 0 to 9 graded the strength of autoregulation. The TCD derived FV changes observed during the change in MAP are normalized and then compared with the model generated responses corresponding to the 10 grades to determine the best match and deemed to be the ARI. Here, 0 corresponds to complete loss of autoregulation, and 9 to hyperactive regulatory response. Normal CA is defined as an ARI of 4 to 7, and abnormal 3 and below.\n53\nIn a prospective study of 122 patients with severe TBI, Hlatky and colleagues determined the ARI every 12\u2009h for the first 5 days post-injury and then once daily for the following 5 days.\n54\nThey noted that ARI was on average abnormally low (2.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9) initially and continued to decrease to a nadir of 1.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1 between 36 and 48-h post-injury which is in keeping with other assessments of CA in severe TBI. Schramm and colleagues found a slightly later nadir of 4 days post-injury in their cohort of 16 patients.\n55\nSviri and colleagues found in their cohort of 36 severe TBI patients that 40% of those with a poor outcome had an ARI that failed to recover in the first 11 days after injury which underlines some prognostic utility to the ARI.\n56\nIn a follow-up study of 24 TBI patients, ARI testing was found to create only transient and relatively minor fluctuations in systemic physiologic measures as was therefore determined safe in this population.\n57\n\nTransient hyperemic response testing\nAnother method of assessing dynamic CA in an intermittent manner using TCD was described initially by Giller.\n58\nIn this technique, the carotid artery is compressed in the neck while the ipsilateral MCA is insonated. Compression should result in a reduction in FV of 30-50% or baseline to be considered adequate. After 3\u2009sec of stable reduction in FV, the carotid is released, and MCA FV are measured. This is known as transient hyperemic response testing (TRHT).\n58\nIn the setting of intact CA, CVR would have decreased to compensate for the reduced flow and once compression is released, an overshoot of at least 10% of baseline FVs is expected. Any overshoot less than 10% is thought to represent impaired CA.\n59\nIn a study of 47 TBI patients, Smielewski and colleagues performed THRT. They dichotomized their THRT results into positive and negative with a cutoff of 1.10 based on previous work done in healthy controls. They found that, in their study, population THRT was 1.11 (range 0.9-1.48). Those with a negative THRT more often had an admission GCS of <6 (14 vs. 9;\np\n<\u20090.05) and more often had an unfavorable outcome by 6-month dichotomized GOS (16 vs. 5;\np\n<\u20090.0004) demonstrating the prognostic utility of THRT.\n60\nThe primary limitation of intermittent methods of assessing CA is that they require eternal perturbations to that subjects' physiologic parameters. This in turn limits the frequency with which they can be performed. One advantage of this, however, is that there is a reasonable clarity that the changes in TCD signal are in reaction to the perturbation. While not widely used clinically, these methods have provided insight into CA in the setting of TBI.\n\nOrthostatic hypotension test\nA sudden change in head position can result in a sudden reduction in CPP. In the orthostatic hypotension test (OHT) the head position of the patient is rapidly elevated, over the course of less than 3\u2009sec, and the resultant drop in CBFV is evaluated by TCD. A reduction of CBFV of between 10 and 15% is considered within the limits of normal with reductions of mor that 20% being indicative of disrupted autoregulation. The utility of this test in the setting of moderate and severe TBI is limit by the difficulty in rapidly moving these critically ill patients. This is reflected in the small number of studies utilizing this method to examine autoregulation in TBI patients.\n61\n,\n62\nThere is however some evidence that OHT weakly correlates with TCDT (r\u2009=\u20090.23;\np\n<\u20090.05).\n61\nDespite this, the cumbersome nature of this method will likely limit further clinical evaluation."

    "Methods": "Study design\nThis was a retrospective cohort study using data from a subsample of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a longitudinal panel survey of adults over age 50 in the United States. The survey uses a national probability sample to capture a representative sample of adults living in households in the contiguous United States.\n22\nFor the present study, we combined data from two HRS waves (2014 and 2016). We gathered lifetime TBI exposure information from the 2014 wave and information on opioid pain medication use in the 2016 wave, the first HRS wave where opioid use data were available. We obtained information on presence of pain and pain severity in the 2014 and 2016 HRS waves. We excluded individuals who were deceased or lost between the 2014 and 2016 waves.\nThe flow diagram for the analytic cohort is provided in\nFigure 1\n. The dataset analyzed in the current study is publically available on the HRS website.\n23\nThis secondary data analysis study was considered nonhuman subjects research by our Institutional Review Board.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nFlow diagram for derivation of the analytic cohort. The inception cohort for this study were Health and Retirement Study (HRS) participants who were assigned randomly and completed the 2014 HRS Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Module. These participants were then followed up at the 2016 HRS core interview. Individuals who were lost from 2014 to 2016 and those who reported a blow to the head but no loss of consciousness (LOC) or altered mental status were excluded. Of note, N\u2009=\u200915 individuals were omitted in the analytic sample because they had a survey weight of 0.\n\nLifetime TBI exposure\nThe HRS implemented a TBI module in 2014 on a random subsample (N\u2009=\u20091480) of the core HRS sample. The HRS collected history of TBI exposure through a modified version of the Ohio State University TBI Identification Method (OSU TBI-ID), a structured interview that queries participants on whether they have sustained injuries to the head or neck in their lifetimes. The OSU TBI-ID has high validity and interrater reliability\n24\nand is used widely for retrospective TBI ascertainment, including within HRS studies.\n25\u201327\nFor each reported injury, HRS data collectors asked follow-up questions on age of each injury, and whether participants reported loss of consciousness (LOC), were dazed or experienced loss of memory, and whether they were hospitalized. For the present study, our primary exposure was TBI that resulted in LOC or a period of being dazed/loss of memory. Consistent with previous HRS studies,\n25\u201327\nwe excluded individuals who reported a past blow to the head that did not result in LOC or being dazed/having loss of memory, because this subgroup would not meet standard definitions for TBI.\n28\u201331\nThe additional information in the OSU TBI-ID on timing and severity of injury prompted examination of three additional TBI exposure classifications: (1) years since most recent TBI, (2) age at first TBI, and (3) number of lifetime TBIs. To characterize years since most recent TBI, we subtracted the age of reported TBI from the age at interview of the 2016 HRS wave.\n\nOpioid pain medication use\nIn 2016, HRS participants were queried on their opioid use in the last three months. Data collectors specifically asked participants whether they have used a \u201c\u2026class of pain medications, called \u201copioids,\u201d [which] includes such things as Vicodin, OxyContin, codeine, morphine, or similar medications. In the past three months, have you taken any opioid pain medications?\u201d\nThe HRS also collected data on over-the-counter (OTC) pain medication use, which we included in the present study as a comparator to prescription opioids. Participants were asked whether \u201cIn the past three months have you taken any OTC pain medications?\u201d Data collectors specified to participants that OTC pain medications include \u201c\u2026such things as Advil, Aleve, Tylenol, aspirin or similar medications.\u201d\n\nModerate-to-severe pain\nParticipants were asked two pain-related questions in the HRS 2014 and 2016 waves. The first question was, \u201cAre you often troubled by pain?\u201d If participants responded yes, then they were asked the follow-up question, \u201cHow bad is the pain most of the time: mild, moderate, or severe?\u201d We classified three pain groups over the study period based on reporting of moderate or severe pain. Individuals reporting moderate-to-severe pain in both 2014 and 2016 were considered to have persistent pain; individuals reporting moderate-to-severe pain in 2014 or 2016, but not both, comprised the intermittent pain group; and those not reporting moderate-to-severe pain at either time point were considered to be in the no pain group. Our classification of persistent pain is consistent with a previous HRS study.\n32\n\nCovariates\nAll models adjusted for the following covariates (measured at 2016 HRS wave): age, sex, race (white, Black, other). Unlike other potential demographic covariates, these characteristics are not affected by TBI exposure.\n33\nWe descriptively characterized additional covariates by TBI exposure, including education, living situation, active military service history, health insurance, and presence of selected chronic conditions.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAnalyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC)\n34\nsurvey procedures to account for the HRS complex multi-stage sample design involving stratification, clustering, and survey weights. We used 2016 HRS survey weights for analyses. We descriptively characterized the cohort by TBI exposure, opioid use, and pain groups. Next, we conducted a series of multi-variable logistic regression models evaluating the association between lifetime history of TBI and recent prescription opioid use, and OTC pain medication use, adjusted for age, sex, and race.\nIn pre-planned sensitivity analyses, we evaluated three alternate TBI exposure classification metrics (time since last TBI, age at first TBI, and number of lifetime TBIs) and recent use of opioid pain medications and OTC pain medications. We converted adjusted odds ratios (ORs) from all multi-variable logistic regression models to adjusted relative risks (RRs) using a published formula to quantify risk.\n35\nWe then evaluated the association between history of TBI and pain group (none, intermittent, persistent) using adjusted multi-nomial logistic regression, with the no pain group as the referent outcome. As a\npost hoc\nexploratory analysis, we characterized pain groups among individuals recently using opioid pain medications by TBI exposure to provide descriptive information on overlap between pain and opioid use by lifetime TBI exposure."

The TBI group consisted of 24 subjects (10 male, 14 female) between the ages of 11.6 and 18.9 years (mean 15.7\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1) at the time of MRI scanning, recruited from 13 sites. The control group consisted of 38 subjects (23 male, 15 female) between the ages of 9.0 and 18.0 years (mean 13.45\u2009\u00b1\u20092.80) at the time of MRI scanning. Demographic and injury characteristics are presented in\nTable 1\n. The study was approved by the institutional review board at the UW and all participating sites.

T\n1\n-weighted (T1w), T\n2\n-weighted, T\n2\n-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, T\n2\n*-weighted, diffusion tensor, and resting-state functional images were obtained for each subject. Manufacturer-specific protocols were patterned after protocols used in a similar multi-site TBI study, TRACK-TBI.\n72\nBefore subject enrollment, each site was provided with the scanner-specific protocol, which was installed on their system. A scanning procedure manual was developed for the study and disseminated to all participating sites. Before human data collection, sites were required to collect phantom data using the protocol, which was sent to the UW to verify protocol compliance. Once the site imaging protocol was approved, sites then enrolled adolescent TBI participants for scanning. Imaging was performed 12.0\u201325.5 months post-injury, with a mean interval between injury and MRI scanning of 20.00\u2009\u00b1\u20094.44 months.\nFor this study of MR volumetric measures, only T1w images were utilized. At all sites, T1w structural imaging was performed using a three-dimensional (3D) inversion-recovery prepared sequence with a rapid gradient echo readout (i.e., magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo on Siemens [Siemens Healthineers AG Erlangen, Germany] and Philips [Philips Healthcare, Amsterdam, Netherlands]; BRAVO on GE [GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL]). The protocol prescription was 3D sagittal images with a 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256 matrix over a 256-mm field of view and 192 slices that were 1\u2009mm thick (1-mm isotropic resolution), frequency encoding in superior/inferior direction, and in-plane parallel imaging with an acceleration factor of 2. On GE scanners, the inversion time (TI) was set to 450\u2009ms, and on Siemens and Philips scanners, the TI was 900\u2009ms.\n\nImage processing\nInitial quality assessment was done by visual inspection, and all images were found acceptable for further analysis. Structural T1w images were processed using a combination of FreeSurfer software (The General Hospital Corporation, Boston, MA)\n73\n,\n74\nand custom scripts. Segmentations of the total brain, ventricles, and midline corpus callosum were obtained. Segmentation results were visually inspected, and manual corrections were performed when segmentation errors were encountered. Focal lesions were not excluded from the total brain volume calculations because FreeSurfer does not label brain lesions. The VBR was then calculated for each subject. VBR is a legacy quantitative neuroimaging metric that was originally calculated as a linear measurement of the width of the anterior horn of the lateral ventricle and, in the same plane, divided by the width of the skull. With the advent of automated methods for image quantification, the VBR is now based on total ventricular volume (lateral, third, and fourth ventricular volume combined) divided by total parenchymal brain volume (all white matter + gray matter), multiplied by 100 so that the VBR value is reflected in whole numbers. In order to create cross-sectional representations of the CC, T1w images were reoriented to a mid-sagittal slice maximally intersecting the septum.\nA Matlab script (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA) was used to produce a binary brain-tissue mask of this sagittal slice. The FreeSurfer CC segmentation was overlaid on the binary mask to generate the CC cross-section, which was visually inspected, and non-CC tissues, including the fornix, were manually removed. The revised CC mask was used to measure the CC cross-sectional area.\n\nCognitive measures\nADAPT outcome assessments used in this study include the GOSE-Peds and neurocognitive testing performed at 1-year post-injury. The GOSE-Peds is a modification of the GOSE, with good discriminant, concurrent, and predictive validity in assessing developmentally appropriate functional outcomes after TBI.\n65\n,\n66\nGOSE-Peds is an 8-point scale with a score of 1\u20132 indicating good recovery, 3\u20134 indicating moderate disability, 5\u20136 indicating severe disability, 7 indicating vegetative state, and 8 indicating death. The GOSE-Peds score assessed at 12 months post-injury was used in this study. The 6-month post-injury score was used in 1 subject for whom the 12-month score was unavailable. Statistically significant effects remained significant when this subject was omitted.\nStudy participants were administered the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence\u2013Second Edition,\n75\na well-validated brief measure that estimates general intelligence, that is nationally standardized and normed for persons ages 6\u201390. All four WASI-II subtests (Vocabulary, Similarities, Block Design, and Matrix Reasoning) were administered to derive an overall IQ score. To derive composite PSI scores, participants completed the Coding and Symbol Search subtests from the Wechsler Scale of Intelligence for Children\u2013Fourth Edition,\n76\nfor participants ages 9.0\u201317.0 years and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale\u2013Fourth Edition\n77\nfor those \u226517.0 years of age. Five TBI subjects declined the neurocognitive assessment. IQ and PSI scores have a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAssociations between categorical variables were tested using a chi-square test with Yates\u2019 continuity correction by the chisq.test() function in R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), and two-sample\nt\n-tests were used to assess group differences of continuous variables. Adjusted group comparisons of continuous variables were tested using linear regression. Residual plots were visually inspected to check the assumptions of heteroscedasticity and normality. Cook's D metric was used to assess outliers with a threshold of 0.5. Associations with the ordinal variable, GOSE-Peds, were analyzed using an ordinal logistic regression model with the clm() function of the\nordinal\nlibrary in R. The proportional odds assumption was tested using the nominal_test() function of the\nordinal\nlibrary as well. The full model summaries, including all covariates, are included for all models in the Supplementary Material for both statistically significant and insignificant results. Only statistically significant results for the variables of interest in these models are reported within the text."

    "Methods": "Participants and study design\nThis phase 2b/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study examined the efficacy and safety of VX-210 treatment (\nFig. 1\n). Participants were enrolled at 28 sites in the United States and five sites in Canada. The study included male and female patients, 14\u201375 years of age (inclusive), with acute traumatic SCIs, C4\u2013C7 (motor level) on each side, and ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) Grade A or B. Patients with AIS Grade A and a C4 motor level on each side were required to have \u22651 point of motor activity between C5 and T1 on \u22651 side; patients with AIS Grade B and a C4 motor level on each side were required to have \u22651 point of motor activity between C5 and C7 on \u22651 side.\n3\nEligible patients had a pre-operative computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and were scheduled to undergo spinal cord decompression/stabilization surgery within 72\u2009h after injury. Patients with a body mass index \u226540\u2009kg/m\n2\n, who were pregnant or breastfeeding, or who had an acute SCI from a gunshot or penetrating/stab wound, non-traumatic SCI, brachial plexus injury, complete spinal cord transection, or multi-focal SCI were excluded. Additional key exclusion criteria included:\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nStudy design. The VX-210 (3-mg) treatment arm is not reflected in this schematic.\n\u22651 upper-extremity muscle group untestable during International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) screening examination;\nAltered mental capacity precluding reliable ISNCSCI examination;\nInability to undergo decompression/stabilization surgery within 72\u2009h after injury;\nParticipation in another clinical study for acute SCI without sponsor approval;\nKnown immunodeficiency, including human immunodeficiency virus or use of immunosuppressive or cancer chemotherapeutic drugs;\nHistory of an adverse reaction to a fibrin sealant or its components; and\nAny significant medical or psychiatric comorbidities that significantly interfere with study enrollment, outcomes, or assessments, as judged by the investigator.\nPatients were randomized to receive a single 9-mg dose of VX-210 in fibrin sealant or placebo (buffer solution) in fibrin sealant at a 1:1 ratio with goal enrollment of \u223c100 patients. Assuming that patients in the 9-mg VX-210 group had a 4-point greater improvement in upper-extremity motor score (UEMS) than patients in the placebo group, with a standard deviation (SD) of 6.0, \u223c50 patients per group would provide \u226580% power to detect a statistically significant treatment effect at 6 months. Anticipated withdrawal of 10% of patients before the 6-week follow-up assessment was also accounted for in the sample-size calculation. Randomization was stratified by age (<30 vs. \u226530 years of age) and AIS grade (A vs. B with sacral pinprick preservation vs. B without sacral pinprick preservation). A third treatment group receiving 3\u2009mg of VX-210 was initially included in the protocol, but was subsequently removed in April 2017 through a protocol amendment to accelerate completion of the trial and maximize target engagement. The higher dose, 9\u2009mg, was chosen to maximize target engagement because the patient numbers in the cervical SCI cohort of the previous study were too small for a true dose-response relationship to be assessed.\n5\nPatients were followed up for up to 12 months after treatment. At specified time points, patients were evaluated for medical, neurological, and functional changes, and serum was collected for pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunological analyses. An interim futility analysis was conducted when \u223c33% of enrolled patients had completed the 6-month follow-up visit. The study was planned to be stopped for futility if conditional power\n13\nwas <10.6% or the observed primary end-point treatment effect size was <1.19. The study was ended prematurely because of low conditional power after the pre-defined efficacy-based interim futility analysis was completed. Patients who were prematurely terminated from the study were required to complete an early termination visit, at which efficacy and safety assessments were performed. If a specific study visit (e.g., 6-month follow-up) was the closest to the early termination visit among all the study visits, then the assessments from the early termination visit were assigned to the corresponding study visit for analysis purposes and used in the final analysis, which was conducted after study closure.\n\nDose and drug delivery\nVX-210 was administered topically in a fibrin sealant to the dura mater (extradural surface) of the spinal cord. The one-time dose of VX-210 or placebo was administered by a surgeon directly to the dura mater of the spinal cord at the site of injury during decompression/stabilization surgery that commenced within 72\u2009h after SCI.\n\nOutcome measures\nThe primary efficacy end-point was the change in UEMS from baseline at 6 months after treatment. Secondary objectives included assessments of sensation and motor activity, as well as improvements in daily function based on analyses of the activities of daily living and requirements for attendant care. Secondary end-points included the following:\nSpinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) III self-care subscore at 6 months\n14\n;\nCapabilities of Upper-Extremity Test (CUE-T) score at 6 months. CUE-T is an evaluation of a patient's ability to perform specific functional movements or tasks with the arms and hands\n15\n;\nGraded Redefined Assessment of Strength, Sensibility, and Prehension (GRASSP) quantitative prehension score at 6 months. GRASSP is an assessment of a patient's ability to perform specific functions with the arms, hands, and fingers\n16\n;\nAIS grade conversion from baseline at 6 months;\nMotor-level change from baseline at 6 months; and\nPK parameters of VX-210.\n\nSafety and adverse events\nSafety evaluations included AEs, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical laboratory tests (i.e., serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis), physical examinations, surgical-site examinations, and immunogenicity measures. Safety and tolerability data were reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee to ensure the safety of enrolled patients.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using SAS\n\u00ae\nSoftware (Version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Categorical variables were summarized using counts and percentages, and continuous variables were summarized by means and SDs. Descriptive summaries of demographics and baseline characteristics, primary efficacy analysis, and secondary efficacy analysis were performed for randomized patients who received the study drug or placebo. Descriptive summaries for safety were performed for all patients who received the study drug or placebo. The primary efficacy analysis was based on a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM). The model included the change from baseline in UEMS at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after treatment as the dependent variable; treatment, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects; and subject as a random effect, with adjustment for age and AIS grade at baseline. With use of the MMRM and the assumption that unobserved values are missing at random, no missing data were explicitly imputed. Secondary efficacy end-points were summarized descriptively. The 3-mg VX-210 treatment group was not used in the statistical modeling, but was included in the safety reporting.\n\nEthics\nThe study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, the ethical principles in the Declaration of Helsinki, and local laws and regulations. An institutional review board or independent ethics committee provided approval for each participating site. All participants (or their legally appointed and authorized representative) provided informed consent, and assent if applicable."

    "Methods": "Participants and setting\nParticipants enrolled prospectively in the Veterans Affairs (VA) TBI Model Systems (TBIMS) National Database: a multi-center, longitudinal study of TBI outcomes. Participants were \u226518 years of age and admitted to one of five rehabilitation programs at VA Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers (PRC) (Richmond, VA; Tampa, FL; Minneapolis, MN; Palo Alto, CA; and San Antonio, TX). See Lamberty and colleagues\n20\nfor VA TBIMS inclusion and exclusion criteria. Analyses were conducted with a subset of TBIMS participants who were: (1) enrolled between 2010 and 2020, (2) admitted to one of the VA Polytrauma Transitional Rehabilitation Programs (PTRP) for post-acute rehabilitation, and (3) not missing data on variables of interest. PTRP are programs for V/SM with TBI that focus on community reintegration to home, work, school, or military service.\n21\n\nProcedures\nThis study was a sub-study of the parent VA TBIMS study that was approved by local institutional review boards at the PRC. The study conforms to all state and federal research regulations. Participants or their proxies provided informed consent prior to data collection. Demographics were obtained at study enrollment from interviews with the participants or their proxies including family members and staff familiar with participants after admission.\n20\nParticipants completed self-report measures.

CT/MRI findings included the first set of scans within 7 days of the TBI or first available CT/MRI regardless of time since injury. CT/MRI findings were categorized as either \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d for the following non-mutually exclusive categories: intracranial compression >5\u2009mm, punctate/petechial hemorrhages, frontal contusions, and temporal contusions.\nTable 1.\nDemographic Characteristics of the Total Sample\nVariables\nObserved\nn\nSummary\nMale\n346\n92% (318)\nRace\n331\nWhite\n69% (230)\nBlack\n13% ( 43)\nOther\n18% ( 58)\nMarital status\n346\nMarried\n31% (108)\nOther\n69% (238)\nEducation\n346\n\u2264 High school diploma\n39% (135)\n> High school diploma\n61% (211)\nAnnual earnings\n247\n< $50,000\n72% (179)\n\u2265 $50,000\n28% ( 68)\nEmployment\n346\nStudent/employed\n85% (293)\nOther\n15% ( 53)\nTBI characteristics\nAge at index TBI\n346\n23;28;40\nInjury severity category\n316\nMild\n9% ( 29)\nModerate\n13% ( 42)\nSevere\n78% (245)\nCause of injury\n344\nVehicular\n57% (196)\nFall\n17% ( 58)\nViolence: penetrating\n5% ( 18)\nViolence: blast\n4% ( 13)\nOther\n17% ( 59)\nDays from TBI to PTRP admission\n346\n57; 84;149\nCT status\n290\nCT done\n90% (262)\nCT not done\n10% ( 28)\nOpen in a separate window\nCategorical data expressed as % and (\nn\n).

Alcohol use was also assessed by the number of drinks per week in the month prior to injury via the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.\n25\nScoring included abstaining (0 drinks), light (1\u20133 drinks), moderate (3\u201314 drinks for men; 3\u20137 drinks for women), and heavy use (> 14 drinks for men; > 7 drinks for women). PTSD symptoms were measured with the PTSD Checklist\u2014Civilian version (PCL-C),\n26\nwhich is a 17-item self-report measure of how much individuals were bothered by PTSD symptoms in the past month. Responses range from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely).\nRehabilitation and TBI variables\nLength of stay in PTRP was counted in days. The FIM\n22\nis an 18-item clinician-rated measure of independence in activities of daily living. Items are rated on an ordinal 1 (total dependence) to 7 (complete independence) scale. Two items were rated by clinicians at discharge from inpatient rehabilitation and used for the study: Expression (ability to use clear vocal and non-vocal expression of language) and Problem Solving (the ability to make reasonable and safe decisions regarding financial, social, and personal affairs, and self-correction of tasks). Expression was chosen because impaired communication is associated with greater IAA.\n6\nProblem solving was chosen as a proxy for executive functioning ability which is related to greater IAA.\n9\nOutcome variable: IAA at admission to and discharge from PTRP\nThe 29-item Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory-4 (MPAI-4)\n27\nis completed by clinical staff and measures problems in abilities, adjustment, and relationships. All patient behavior displayed in front of staff was used to determine the scores for PTRP admission and discharge using clinical team consensus. Ratings were based on observations within a 3-week window at both time points. To evaluate IAA, Item #15 asked program staff to rate the level at which the patient experiences: \u201cIrritability, anger, aggression: Verbal or physical expressions of anger.\u201d Answer choices include: 0 (None), 1 (mild problems but does not interfere with activities; may use assistive device or medication), 2 (mild problems, interferes with activities 5\u201324% of the time), 3 (moderate problems; interferes with activities 25\u201375% of the time), 4 (severe problems, interferes with activities >75% of the time). Scores \u22651 indicate impairment by IAA. Scores \u22652 indicate disability from IAA. Reducing both impairment and disability can be treatment goals.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData were analyzed using statistical software Rv3.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) for descriptive statistics and modeling, and SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) macro\nwww.andrew.cmu.edu/user/bjones/index.htm\nfor group-based multi-trajectory models.\n28\u201330\nWe performed group-based multi-trajectory modeling to identify latent groups of participants who followed the same trajectories in IAA status from PTRP admission to discharge. Models for up to four groups were explored. The four-group model was chosen as the best model with the lowest Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and further verified by a clinical perspective. The four group model had participants with no IAA, delayed onset IAA, resolved IAA, and persistent IAA.\nA multinomial logistical regression model was then fit to the identified four subgroups to examine the associations among different variables and each subgroup. Estimated relative risk ratios for each independent variable examined how the risk of falling in the comparison group compared with the risk of falling in the reference group (No IAA). Independent variables were chosen based on the literature: PTRP length of stay (days), years of education (\u2264 high school vs. > high school), employment status (student/employed vs. not), sex (men vs. women), ever received mental health treatment (yes vs. no), past year use of illicit drugs (yes vs. no), drinking category (abstaining /light vs. moderate/heavy), PCL-C total, ever attempted suicide (yes vs. no), FIM Discharge: Expression (continuous like score), FIM Discharge: Problem Solving (continuous like score), extent of intracranial compression >5\u2009mm (yes vs. no), punctate/ petechial hemorrhages (yes vs. no), frontal contusions (yes vs. no), and temporal contusions (yes vs. no). The analysis was conducted on all participants who had variables of interest, reducing the multivariate sample to 172 (\nTable 2\n). We also examined the model with other covariates that may have been related to IAA, including if the participant had ever been involved in special education because of learning difficulties (yes vs. no) and if the participant had current feelings of sadness and depression, measured by an item from the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (0 vs. >0).\n31\nTable 2.\nA Summary of Predictors of Irritability, Anger, and Aggression (IAA) for Total Sample and Subgroups\nAll\nNo IAA\nDelayed Onset IAA\nResolved IAA\nPersistent IAA\nn\nSummary\nn\nSummary\nn\nSummary\nn\nSummary\nn\nSummary\nIAA at admission (MPAI#15)\n346\n89\n31\n61\n165\nNone\n35% (120)\n100% (89)\n100% (31)\n0% ( 0)\n0% ( 0)\nMild problem: without interference\n24% ( 84)\n0% ( 0)\n0% ( 0)\n56% (34)\n30% (50)\nMild problem: with interference\n28% ( 96)\n0% ( 0)\n0% ( 0)\n31% (19)\n47% (77)\nModerate problem\n11% ( 38)\n0% ( 0)\n0% ( 0)\n11% ( 7)\n19% (31)\nSevere problem\n2% ( 8)\n0% ( 0)\n0% ( 0)\n2% ( 1)\n4% ( 7)\nIAA at discharge (MPAI#15)\n346\n89\n31\n61\n165\nNone\n43% (150)\n100% (89)\n0% ( 0)\n100% (61)\n0% ( 0)\nMild problem: without interference\n32% (109)\n0% ( 0)\n65% (20)\n0% ( 0)\n54% (89)\nMild problem: with interference\n19% ( 66)\n0% ( 0)\n29% (9)\n0% ( 0)\n35% (57)\nModerate problem\n5% ( 18)\n0% ( 0)\n3% ( 1)\n0% ( 0)\n10% (17)\nSevere problem\n1% ( 3)\n0% ( 0)\n3% ( 1)\n0% ( 0)\n1% ( 2)\nPTRP length of stay, days\n346\n50; 83;120\n89\n45; 74;107\n31\n56; 92;120\n61\n61;102;137\n165\n46; 80;116\nYears of education\n346\n89\n31\n61\n165\n\u2264 High school diploma\n39% (135)\n38% (34)\n29% (9)\n48% (29)\n38% ( 63)\n> High school diploma\n61% (211)\n62% (55)\n71% (22)\n52% (32)\n62% (102)\nEmployment\n346\n89\n31\n61\n165\nStudent/employed\n85% (293)\n83% (74)\n90% (28)\n87% (53)\n84% (138)\nOther\n15% ( 53)\n17% (15)\n10% ( 3)\n13% ( 8)\n16% ( 27)\nMale\n346\n92% (318)\n89\n92% (82)\n31\n81% (25)\n61\n93% (57)\n165\n93% (154)\nEver received mental health treatment\n346\n35% (122)\n89\n24% (21)\n31\n29% ( 9)\n61\n38% (23)\n165\n42% (69)\nUse of illicit drugs\n343\n12% ( 42)\n88\n12% (11)\n30\n7% ( 2)\n61\n13% ( 8)\n164\n13% ( 21)\nDrinking category\n327\n86\n28\n56\n157\nAbstaining/light\n49% (160)\n47% (40)\n57% (16)\n41% (23)\n52% (81)\nModerate/heavy\n51% (167)\n53% (46)\n43% (12)\n59% (33)\n48% (76)\nPCL-C total\n284\n20;27;38\n71\n19;21;24\n24\n20;27;39\n56\n24;34;43\n133\n22;31;45\nPast suicide attempt\n345\n11% ( 37)\n89\n8% ( 7)\n31\n3% ( 1)\n61\n10%( 6)\n164\n14% (23)\nFIM Expression\n288\n6;6;7\n81\n6;6;7\n26\n6.0;6.5;7.0\n53\n5;7;7\n128\n6;6;7\nFIM Problem Solving\n290\n4;5;6\n82\n4;5;6\n26\n4;5;6\n53\n4;5;6\n129\n4;5;6\nExtent of intracranial compression >5\u2009mm\n261\n13% ( 34)\n71\n14% (10)\n21\n14% ( 3)\n51\n14% ( 7)\n118\n12% (14)\nPunctate/petechial hemorrhages\n270\n37% ( 99)\n71\n41% (29)\n22\n36% ( 8)\n51\n39% (20)\n126\n33% (42)\nFrontal contusions\n268\n57% (152)\n71\n56% (40)\n22\n41% ( 9)\n51\n61% (31)\n124\n58% (72)\nTemporal contusions\n267\n39% (103)\n71\n32% (23)\n22\n55% (12)\n50\n38% (19)\n124\n40% (49)\nOpen in a separate window\nCategorical data expressed as % and (\nn\n).

    "Methods": "Objective\nRestart TICrH aims to show that early anticoagulation restart after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage reduces major thrombotic events at only a small cost in recurrent major bleeding.\n\nTrial design\nThis PROBE trial will assign patients with anticoagulant-associated isolated traumatic intracranial hemorrhage to restart anticoagulation at 1, 2, or 4 weeks (\nFig. 1\n). It employs an adaptive randomization algorithm that increases the probability of patients being randomized to treatment arms with lower event rates. Entry is primarily driven pragmatically by clinician intent to restart any direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) \u2013 that is, apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, or dabigatran \u2013 after anticoagulant-associated traumatic intracranial hemorrhage and equipoise concerning restart at the specified time intervals.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nRestart Traumatic Intracranial Hemorrhage (the \u201cr\u201d distinguished intracranial from intracerebral) (TICrH) is a prospective randomized open label blinded end-point (PROBE) response adaptive clinical trial of different time intervals to restart anticoagulation after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (1). Arm restart days (7, 14, and 28) are illustrated here by the change from blue to red in the horizontal bars, a transition from thrombotic risk to bleeding risk (2), which are the opposing risks combined in the primary composite end-point. The composite end-point of major bleeding and thrombotic events (3) is illustrated by the red and blue vertical bars, which reflect the proportions of bleeding and thrombosis and predicted combined rate, along with the expected rates used for trial power in the next column. It is the differences in these composite end-points by arm that drives randomization adaptation (4). The algorithm decreases the probability of randomization to underperforming arms; that is, those with higher event rates. A second adaptative mechanism for the inclusion criteria is driven by total end-point event rate in all arms (and therefore does not require unblinding) (5). If total event rates are low, the trial will have difficulty detecting a difference between arms; therefore, the algorithm increases the subject end-point risk by increasing the CHA\n2\nDS\n2\n-VASc score inclusion criteria, enriching the sample for events. This makes detecting a difference between groups easier and prevents the trial from stopping for futility. The PROBE component of the trial is achieved with central blinded assessment of subjects for potential end-point events (by videoconference) with a blinded expert study end-point adjudication board determination of whether a valid end-point event has occurred.\n\nPatient population\nPatients evaluated for acute traumatic intracranial hemorrhage at research sites will be screened for eligibility after clinical stabilization. Patients who meet criteria (\nTable 1\n) or their legally authorized representatives will be asked to consent to enrollment. Site trauma registry data indicate that these patients are elderly (median age 80; range 59\u201399) and that almost all have fall-from-standing isolated brain injuries.\n3\nTable 1.\nInclusion and Exclusion Criteria\nInclusion criteria\n\u2022\u2002Clinician intent to restart a Direct Oral Anticoagulant (DOAC) after anticoagulant associated traumatic intracranial hemorrhage and equipoise concerning restart of anticoagulation at the specified time intervals.\n\u2022\u2002Acute traumatic intracranial hemorrhage on anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation (AF) or venous thromboembolism (VTE)\n\u2022\u2002Patient is higher risk for stroke or other thrombotic events as witnessed by having a CHA\n2\nDS\n2\n-VASc score of \u22653\nExclusion criteria\n\u2022\u2002Mechanical Value\n\u2022\u2002Ventricular Assist Device (VAD)\n\u2022\u2002Subdural hematoma \u22658\u2009mm maximum width or any midline shift at any time point or more than one SDH\n\u2022\u2002Physician plan to start/restart antiplatelet therapy during trial period\n\u2022\u2002Abbreviated injury Scale other than head \u22653\n\u2022\u2002Pregnancy\n\u2022\u2002Inability to understand need for adherence to study protocol\n\u2022\u2002Renal function below DOAC label exclusions\n\u2022\u2002Any active pathological bleeding\n\u2022\u2002Hypersensitivity to drug or other label contraindication\n\u2022\u2002Any bleeding that the investigator deems unsafe to restart DOAC at 1 week post injury, or conversely unsafe to hold DOAC to 4 weeks\n\u2022\u2002Completion of DOAC therapy expected prior to 60-day primary end-point\n\u2022\u2002Concomitant need for strong inducers/inhibitors of p-gp and CYP3A4\nOpen in a separate window\n\nInclusion/exclusion criteria justification\nFall risk\nWe did not exclude patients based on fall risk. One analysis showed that a patient would need to fall almost daily for a year to negate the benefit of stroke prevention from anticoagulation therapy.\n19\nIn this model, fall risk was not a relevant factor in the clinical decision to start treatment.\n19\nFall risk is a common reason that clinicians withhold anticoagulation,\n20\u201322\nbut there is little evidence that it should preclude treatment.\n19\n,\n22\n(See\nSupplementary Text 2\nfor full discussion.)\nDOACs\nRestarting is limited to DOACs (although anticoagulant at index bleeding is not) as opposed to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA), such as warfarin. VKA delayed onset would confound a timing trial, and heparin bridging is not standard in atrial fibrillation, which we expect to be the majority indication. DOACs are associated with lower intracranial hemorrhage risk and lower overall bleeding risk, which would be preferred in patients who have just had life-threatening bleeding.\n23\nIt is also likely clinicians would not be compelled by the results on VKA, especially if bleeding is great. They could reasonably contend that the result would have been different with only DOACs, which are rapidly replacing warfarin (\nFig. 2\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nTrends of new prescriptions for anticoagulants 2011\u20132017.\n39\n\nEquipoise\nClinical equipoise regarding restarting anticoagulation is different for spontaneous versus traumatic intracranial hemorrhage. For spontaneous hemorrhage, there is uncertainty about whether patients should ever be restarted. For traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, the main question is when to restart; not whether. In a global survey of 228 neurologists, neurosurgeons, and thrombosis experts, 98% stated that traumatic patients should be restarted, but they demonstrated wide variability about when.\n8\nMost preferred to restart by 1 month (\nFig. 3\n). The survey authors noted that \u201crandomized trials are direly needed in this population.\u201d Another neurosurgical survey also found most clinicians preferred restarting within a month.\n9\nThis equipoise informed our selection of time intervals.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nThis figure is adapted from Xu and coworkers,\n8\na global survey of experts across multiple specialties for restarting anticoagulation recommendations across 11 scenarios. For TICrH, 98% agreed that these patients should be restarted, but the timing of restart varied widely.\n\nTreatment\nDOAC is at label dose with label adjustments for creatinine clearance, and at continuation dose, i.e., not initial therapy high doses in the setting of VTE.\n\nPrimary end-point\nA 60-day composite endpoint that includes the following clinical events: new or expansion of intracranial hemorrhage, other BARC\n3a\n(the widely accepted Bleeding Academic Research Consortium scale which defines major bleeding) or above major hemorrhage,\n24\nstroke, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction (MI), proximal lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, and cardiovascular death (full definitions in\nSupplementary Text 3\nand at\nwww.RestartTICrH.org\n).\nComposite justification\nComposite end-points are standard in secondary prevention trials because they increase study power. Some recent trials of anticoagulation have separated the thrombotic and bleeding end-points. However, in the setting of anticoagulation restart decisions, a composite end-point that includes the relevant thrombotic and bleeding events closely approximates the actual clinical decision: a trade-off between thrombotic and bleeding risk.\nEnd-point timing justification\nAs all groups are anticoagulated, we do not expect separation of event curves past 60 days, which is 1 month past the last restart interval (\nFig. 4\n). Any differences in events after 60 days would more likely represent random fluctuations or statistical noise rather than true signal from the difference in the timing of restart. We did not set the end-point prior to 60 days because this allows for the known time, 1 month, that it takes most clots to be replaced with connective tissue and resorbed into the vessel wall and the wall to re-endothelialize.\n25\nThrombi that developed prior to anticoagulation are at risk of embolization during this period.\n25\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 4.\nThe trial end-point of 60 days was chosen because all arm event rate curves are expected to become parallel 30 days after the last arm is anticoagulated. This is the known time that it takes for most clots to be replaced with connective tissue and resorbed into the vessel wall, and for the wall to re-endothelialize. Thrombi that developed before anticoagulation are still at risk of embolization during this period. We do not expect any change in differences in event rates between arms after that period.\n39\n\nSecondary outcomes\nDVT\nDVT, although an event of great interest to patients and providers in trauma care, confers a lower mortality than the other end-point events, so we will perform a secondary analysis excluding it from the thrombotic component (\nFig. 5\n). Although short-term mortality after DVT is <5%, its long-term mortality and morbidity are quite high.\n26\nDVT patients have a fourfold risk of death versus controls, and an elevated risk for 8 years after the index thrombosis.\n26\nAlso, DVT patients rate their quality of life below patients with diabetes or chronic lung disease.\n27\nAs many as half of DVT patients develop post-thrombotic syndrome and chronic swollen legs.\n27\nAll of this supports including DVT in the primary composite end-point.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 5.\nSecondary analysis removes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from the composite, as it has lower mortality than the other elements.\nWeighting\nExploratory analysis will use 60-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Disability Rating Scale (DRS), two validated and widely used death and disability functional assessments,\n28\u201330\nperformed in follow-up on all patients. We will examine the disability of the end-point event beyond that of the index bleed disability to see if the opposing bleeding and thrombotic composite components are unequal. There are no published data on this incremental disability. A randomized trial is the\nonly way\nto level the disability from the index event evenly across groups to enable the additional disability from the secondary event to be seen. We expect half our end-point patients to have ischemic strokes and half to have VTE, with a few having MIs. All will have some degree of brain injury from their index bleeding. DRS and mRS will be used to calculate an appropriate utility-weighting approach to account for the relative severity of bleeding and thrombotic events, as opposed to contributing 1:1 as they will during the trial (see\nFig. 6\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 6.\nSecondary analysis evaluates if the bleeding and thrombotic components are equal or if one actually causes more disability than the other.\n\nAdaptive design\nAdaptive randomization\nResponse-adaptive randomization (RAR) uses pre-specified information formula criteria to rebalance allocation to the three treatment arms at interim points during enrollment. The approach improves study power by allocating increasingly more patients to the best performing arms. This increases precision of treatment efficacy estimates in the arms of greatest interest. RAR trials \u201clearn\u201d from the data and adapt randomization at interim periods based on group performance. For these reasons, RAR is becoming the preferred approach in clinical trial design generally and in trauma in particular.\n31\nAdaptive inclusion criteria\nWe set the CHA\n2\nDS\n2\n-VASc at a minimum of 3 to ensure a patient population at high risk of thrombotic events, with pre-defined decision rules to adjust the score at interim analyses based on trial performance. The period of contrasting treatment in the trial is only 3 weeks (difference in anticoagulant exposure between 1 week and 4 weeks restart). This feature allows enrichment of the sample for events, if necessary, and prevents the trial from ending in futility (\nFig. 1\n).\n\nPower and sample size\nUsing our Bayesian response adaptive randomization design with potential to stop early for success or futility, we plan to enroll a maximum of 1100 subjects (expected 10% lost to follow-up, leaving 990 analyzable). The study has 87% power (based on expected thrombotic event rates of 0.5, 3.5, and 6.25% and bleeding rates of 1, 0.67, and 0.33% in 1, 2, and 4 weeks respectively. See\nSupplementary Text 4\nfor full discussion). This is based on the expectation that the algorithm will allocate 50% of the subjects to the treatment arm with the lowest event rate (which we suspect will be 1 week) and 21% to the arm with the highest event rate (suspected to be 4 weeks). An independent data safety and monitoring committee will surveil for unanticipated effects.\n\nAnalysis of primary end-point\nPrimary analysis plan\nAll interim and final analyses will be conducted on the primary end-point, the 60-day composite of thrombotic events and rebleeding. Both end-points will be modeled as a function of the three treatment arms in an (arm restart) time/response (events composite) model. Two Bernoulli models will be used to estimate thrombosis and rebleeding. Each of the rates for the Bernoulli values by arm are\n\u03b8\nd\nand\n\u03b4\nd\nfor thrombosis and rebleeding, respectively. These rates are combined to provide a utility function\nU\nd\n=\n-\u03b8\nd\n-\n\u03b4\nd\n, so that higher values of\nU\nd\ncorrespond to the better arms.\nInterim analysis plan\nInterim data analysis will begin once 300 subjects are randomized and will continue after every 100 additional subjects enrolled until best treatment or futility criteria are met, or enrollment reaches 1100 subjects, whichever comes first. The interim analyses will assess the following decisions.\n1.\nStop enrollment prior to the maximum sample size because of a best treatment arm has been identified\n2.\nDiscontinue the trial because of futility\n3.\nContinue to enroll (if 1100 enrollments have not been reached)\nRules for each decision are pre-defined and based primarily on identifying the best treatment. The final analysis will also calculate posterior probability of all pairwise differences of the three arms. The trial will be considered conclusive under the following conditions.\n1.\nEarly success: if at any interim analysis the most likely arm has at least a 0.995 posterior probability of being best.\n2.\nEnd of enrollment success: if at the conclusion of accrual of 1100 patients, the most likely arm has at least a 0.95 posterior probability of being best or if the posterior probability that one arm is better than another is at least 0.99.\n3.\nEarly futility: if at any interim analysis all arms have at least a 0.25 probability of being best.\nPrimary analysis is \u201cintention to treat,\u201d although we will perform sensitivity analyses of \u201cas treated\u201d restart days (whether in or out of prescribed time window).\n\nC\nlosed loop translation\nCNTR is the largest trauma research network in the country. Each site is led by a trauma surgeon, who with neurosurgeons, most often make restart decisions after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage. CNTR investigators are in the nation's largest level 1 and level 2 trauma centers with a high volume of traumatic intracranial hemorrhage cases. CNTR is directly linked to the ACS-COT, the governing body for United States trauma center verification, which manages the Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) with site visits to assess compliance with quality metrics. Using this network for performing a randomized clinical trial leverages an existing group of highly motivated and research-oriented physician-scientists to study a problem that is of importance to their daily clinical practice. Further, the trial findings will be rapidly implemented at trauma centers because of the linkages with ACS-COT and TQIP, an enforcement mechanism already in place (\nFig. 7\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 7.\nTrauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) closed loop translation with enforcement mechanisms already in place ensures that trial findings are implemented in the larger trauma network and that reductions in thrombotic events and attendant healthcare costs, morbidity, and mortality are realized. For a trial with a total cost, direct and indirect, of $12,000,000, the 1st year return on investment is 1000 thrombotic events prevented at 850 trauma centers at an acute care cost of $35,000,000."
