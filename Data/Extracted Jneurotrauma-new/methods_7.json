    "Methods": "Subjects\nThe conjoint health ethics research board of the University of Calgary approved the research. Twelve mTBI patients with PPCS (5 males, 29\u2009\u00b1\u200910 years) (\nTable 1\n) were recruited from the Foothills Hospital Brain Injury Rehabilitation Clinic along with 12 healthy control participants (3 males, 30\u2009\u00b1\u200911 years), recruited through advertising and word of mouth. All subjects provided informed consent prior to participation in the study. Inclusion criteria for PPCS participants were (1) having been diagnosed with mTBI at least 3 months prior and currently experiencing persistent symptoms, (2) being between 18 and 50 years of age, (3) currently not on psychoactive drugs or medication (antidepressant, anxiety medication, recreational drugs), and (4) having no diagnosed neurological disorder. For controls, the same criteria (see criteria 2\u20134) were used. In addition, controls had no mTBI history, or had had only one mTBI, which had occurred >1 year prior to participation and resolved within the first few days.\nTable\n1.\nDemographics\nCondition\nAge\nSex\nSymptom score\nTime post-injury (days)\nPrior mTBI\nInjury comment\nPPCS\n22\nF\n41\n385\n3\nHit front of head on counter\nPPCS\n37\nF\n-\n470\n0\nHit back of head when fell\nPPCS\n20\nF\n70\n290\n0\nHit head above right eye when biking\nPPCS\n24\nM\n14\n195\n2\nHit head on running track - LOC\nPPCS\n38\nM\n13.5\n365\n5\nSports related - LOC\nPPCS\n18\nF\n24\n435\n1\nHit back of head during skiing\nPPCS\n18\nM\n34\n210\n10\nHit head on right side on glass, after body-check from the left\nPPCS\n41\nF\n14\n305\n3\nHead was hit on the right side with rock\nPPCS\n32\nM\n91\n273\n30\nElbow below the nose\nPPCS\n18\nM\n31\n152\n3\nHit to the left side of cerebrum during hockey (fell head first)\nPPCS\n41\nF\n47\n124\n0\nHit bottom right jaw on end of waterslide; LOC for 1\u2009min\nPPCS\n42\nF\n113\n456\n0\nHit head on steering wheel during car accident (whiplash)\nAsympt.\n25\nM\n0\n255\n3\nSports-related during football\nOpen in a separate window\nDemographics of PPCS patients included in the study as well as one asymptomatic patient, with age (second column); sex (third column); symptom score (fourth column) from the Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI) with additional Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 3 (SCAT3) questions; the time since injury until fNIRS measurement (fifth column); how many mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs) were diagnosed before this injury (sixth column) and how the injury was acquired (last column).\nPPCS, persistent post-concussion symptoms; LOC, loss of consciousness; Asympt., The participant who was symptomatic when recruited, but asymptomatic when data acquired. Not included in the statistical analysis.\nOriginally 37 possible participants were recruited. Ten of the 37 participants were excluded because they failed to meet the inclusion criteria (severity of injury [\nn\n=\u20093], psychoactive medication [\nn\n=\u20095], and persistent symptoms [\nn\n=\u20092]). The latter two excluded participants were an acute mTBI patient, who had had an mTBI 5 days prior, and a patient (25-year-old male football player) who had been asymptomatic for 2 months after experiencing PPCS for 6 months. These participants were not included in the group-level analysis, but the asymptomatic patient was used in the correlation plot between severity and coherence values as additional comparison. The remaining three exclusions were because: the participant gave contradicting information (\nn\n=\u20091), the participant was colorblind (\nn\n=\u20091), and the data did not have adequate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the majority of channels (\nn\n=\u20091). All participants provided demographic information and completed the Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI) with additional Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 3 (SCAT3) questions, which are standard symptom measurement scales.\n\nNIRS\nfNIRS measurements were continuously recorded with the TechEn CW7 using the wavelengths 690 and 830\u2009nm at 50\u2009Hz. We recorded four channels above and surrounding each right and left DLPFC and eight channels above and surrounding each left and right primary motor cortex (M1), respectively (\nFig. 1a\n). The anatomical locations (DLPFC and M1) were measured and marked on the head based on the 10\u201320 electroencephalographic (EEG) coordinate system (for M1, the location was determined by taking 20% of the preauricular distance and applying this number from the vertex [Cz] to the left preauricular point; for the DLPFC we used the software Beam\n26\n). The four (over frontal cortex on each side) and eight channel probes (over motor cortex on each side) were centered over the anatomical locations, with the same two channels consistently positioned directly over the DLPFC and the M1 coordinate, respectively.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSetup and analysis.\n(a)\nChannel locations centered over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (four channels) and primary motor cortex (M1) (eight channels).\n(b)\nCoherence was measured between (frontal, motor) and within hemispheres (right, left). (Modified picture from\nbrainvoyager.com\n). Data were analyzed using two methods:\n(c)\ndata driven method, in which all channels are used to find the maximal coherence between the two regions and\n(d)\nminimum-channel method, in which coherence between regions is calculated using only the two channels located directly above the DLPFC and M1 (10\u201320 system).\n\nTasks\nThe participants were seated on a chair facing a computer screen in a dimly lit room, and were asked to perform several tasks. fNIRS data were collected continuously during the protocol. The tasks included: \u201cRest\u201d (total, 180\u2009sec), in which the participant was asked to relax and view a dark screen with a fixation point; \u201cTap,\u201d for which the participant was asked to tap the right thumb sequentially to the other fingers in a self-paced rhythm (\u223c 1\u2009Hz; total time\u2009=\u2009250\u2009sec, 15\u2009sec rest alternating with 10\u2009sec tapping); \u201cStroop\u201d task, for which the participant was presented with color words in a certain ink that alternated in blocks of unmatched (e.g., \u201cred\u201d in blue ink) and matched (e.g. \u201cred\u201d in red ink) words, for which the participant was asked to name the ink, not the written word (total time\u2009=\u2009305\u2009sec, 15\u2009sec rest, with 15\u2009sec task); \u201cn-back,\u201d for which position and letter had to be matched in a 0, 1, and 2-back paradigm.\n27\n,\n28\nFor the n-back task (total, 180\u2009sec), 20 stimuli were presented in 2\u2009sec intervals (40\u2009sec) for each block (0, 1, and 2-back). The rest period between each block was 20\u2009sec, plus an additional 5\u2009sec of instructions prior to each block.\n\nPre-processing\nRaw fNIRS time courses were converted in HOMER2\n29\nto oxy- (\u0394HbO), deoxy- (\u0394Hb), and total-hemoglobin (\u0394tHb) time courses. Preprocessing was done using MATLAB-based software packages (MATLAB 6.1, The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, 2000) and included motion correction with NAP\n30\nand spline motion correction.\n31\nIn addition, individual channels were discarded when raw data were <90\u2009dB (no signal) or >140\u2009dB (oversaturated signal) as well as when SNR did not exceed SNR\u2009=\u20091. SNR was determined by the MATLAB function \u201csnr\u201d with unfiltered data as the input signal and high pass filtered data >1.5\u2009Hz as the noise component. This calculation is similar to that of Sato and colleagues,\n32\narguing that <1.5\u2009Hz, physiological signals such as cardiac, respiration, and low-frequency oscillations are expected, whereas above that cutoff, only noise is expected. Part of the low-frequency oscillations are believed to be an indirect measure of neuronal activity.\n33\nThis method achieved results identical to visual inspection of the noise level or the visual inspection of the presence of the cardiac waveform in the 830\u2009nm raw data, which are common methods for channel exclusion.\n\nPost-processing\nPreprocessed oxygenated fNIRS time courses (HbO) in the same hemispheres (e.g., between M1 and DLPFC centered channels) as well as between hemispheres (e.g., right with left DLPFC centered channels) were analyzed using coherence analysis\n34\nat 0.04\u20130.1\u2009Hz (\nFig. 1b\n). The mean coherence in this frequency domain was calculated with static coherence, similar to our previous work.\n16\nCortical communication was determined by coherence, evaluating the \u201csimilarity\u201d of two signals in the frequency domain. We used two methods to derive intra-hemispheric and inter-hemispheric coherence between and within the prefrontal and motor regions. First, for a general understanding of the sensitivity of inter-regional coherence, we used a \u201cdata driven\u201d method (\nFig. 1c\n), for which coherence was calculated among all channels in the four regions. In the data driven method, frontal channels include the channels directly over the right and left DLPFC, as well as all the neighboring channels for that region. The same is true for M1 and surrounding channels. For this method, the maximum coherence between each combination of regions was taken as the coherence value. Second, with the goal of simplifying the acquisition by reducing source-detector pairs to aid in future implementation in clinical settings, we investigated if similar sensitivity could be reached when we only analyzed two channels per region. We included in this \u201cminimum-channel driven\u201d method (\nFig. 1d\n), the two channels directly above the DLPFC and M1 on the right and left side (see\nMethods\nsection: NIRS) and calculated the maximum coherence between these channels. The reduction to two channels with the \u201cminimum channel method\u201d is to evaluate if the distinguishing location is confined to the DLPFC and M1 or is more diffuse in PPCS patients. In addition, fewer channels would make the method more clinically viable by significantly reducing the time to setup, and therefore make examinations quicker and more efficient. The reduction of needed channels also minimizes the size of the headgear needed, an important factor considering that mTBI patients commonly experience pressure in the head or headaches.\nFor each participant, four inter-regional coherence values per method were derived. Inter-regional coherence was quantified for (1) \u201cfrontal,\u201d between the channels centered over the right and left DLPFC; (2) \u201cmotor,\u201d between the channels centered over right and left M1; (3) \u201cright,\u201d between right DLPFC and right M1 centered channels; and (4) \u201cleft,\u201d between the left DLPFC and left M1 centered channels.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical comparisons were done in SPSS (IBM corporation) using a mixed ANOVA with inter-regional coherence as the dependent variable, \u201cPPCS\u201d versus \u201cControl\u201d as the between-subject variable, and \u201cTask\u201d (four levels [e.g., n-back, Stroop]) and \u201cBrain regions\u201d (four levels [e.g., frontal, motor etc.]) as the within-subject variables. Post-hoc pairwise comparison was done with multiple two sample\nt\ntests (one sided, \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05, adjusted for multiple comparison with the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg method\n35\n). Correlation between severity (symptom scale) and overall coherence values were analyzed in MATLAB (function \u201ccorr\u201d). The same function was used when evaluating the effect of the number of channels excluded in the analyses on the coherence values."

    "Methods": "Rose bengal derivatives\nFigure 1\nshows the molecular structures of unmodified rose bengal (RB1) and two modified derivatives. The first derivative (RB2) has the addition of a decyl carbon unit analog synthesized with the purpose of slowing diffusion into spared tissue, thereby reducing further damage to adjacent healthy tissue. The second derivative (RB3) has the addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) as an alternate diffusion retardant.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nChemical structure of rose bengal and its derivatives.\n\nContusion injury\nFemale Long-Evans adult rats weighing 200\u2013220g were used for this study, and all protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Minnesota. Rats were anesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane, and a laminectomy was performed at the T8\u2013T9 vertebral level. A moderate contusion injury was made with a 200 Kdyn force using the Infinite Horizon Spinal Cord impactor (IH 0400) (Precision System and Instrumentation LLC).\n\nScar ablation technique\nAll rats underwent SCI as described above. All rats then received either scar ablation treatment or saline injection six weeks after injury. Rats were anesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane, and the injury site was re-exposed. The photo ablation procedure is described in Zhang and associates.\n20\nBriefly, 1\u2009\u03bcL of 2% (diluted in 0.9% saline) rose bengal or derivative was injected into the cavity at the injury site through a 26-gauge blunt Hamilton metal needle connected to a Hamilton syringe. This injection was made at a depth of 0.8\u20131.0\u2009mm for 1\u2009min. Eight minutes after injection, the spinal cord was illuminated for 5\u2009min with the full-spectrum light of a halogen bulb (150W, 7\u2009cm distance). To prevent damage by the heating source from the halogen light, the spinal cord was bathed with saline solution during the illuminating time. Immediately after illumination, the wound was sutured.\n\nDiffusion analysis\nSix weeks after contusion injury, six rats (\nn\n=\u20092/RB group) were utilized to localize the rose bengal injected into the cavity, with the same injection technique as described above. The rats were euthanized without perfusion immediately after injection, and the spinal cord was harvested, fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, and then immersed in 30% w/v sucrose at 4\u00b0C. Spinal cord of 1\u2009cm length including the cavity epicenter was then sectioned and examined.\n\nRose bengal derivatives\nThere were four treatment groups: Group 1\u2014unmodified rose Bengal; Group 2\u2014decyl carbon rose Bengal; Group 3\u2014PEG rose Bengal; Group 4\u2014saline only. Within each group (six rats/group), rats were allocated randomly to be sacrificed at two time points; 24\u2009h after scar ablation (\nn\n=\u20093) and eight days after scar ablation (\nn\n=\u20093). These time points were selected to examine both acute and subacute changes of our treatment.\n\nTissue harvesting\nRats were fully anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of ketamine hydrochloride and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1\u2009M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. Spinal cords were removed and post-fixed overnight in the same fixative solution, then immersed in sucrose (30% w/v) and washed with PBS. A segment of the spinal cord 1.0\u2009cm in length encompassing the injury site was removed and embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT embedding compound (VWR, Mississauga, ON, Canada). The tissue was sectioned in the transverse plane at 20-\u03bcm intervals using a Leica CM3050 S cryostat.\n\nHistology and cavitation analysis\nTo analyze cavitation, every eighth section from the spinal cords of rats sacrificed at 24\u2009h and 8 days for all four treatment groups was processed for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) staining. Ten sections per rat (rostrocaudally 1.6\u2009mm from the epicenter of the cavity) were imaged on a Leica DMi8 inverted microscope. To compare the cavity area between groups, a modified protocol that combines H&E (background) and LFB (myelin) staining was developed. The area of maximum cavitation (epicenter) of each section was traced using Image J software from Fiji (v.1.45) (National Institutes of Health [NIH]; Bethesda, MD). The measurements obtained were then used to generate values for the cavity area for each of the cords from each treatment group (\nn\n=\u20093).\n\nImmunohistochemistry (IHC):Glial scar analysis\nAfter transcardial perfusion, spinal cords were processed for immunohistochemical analysis. To identify effects on the components of the glial scar, serial transverse sections surrounding the lesion epicenter (every eighth section) were utilized to identify astrocytes with both GFAP and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member (ALDH1), which assists in the identification of GFAP negative astrocytes. The CSPGs were also characterized, and collagen type I alpha 1 (COL1A1) was used to describe the fibroblastic component of the glial scar.\nBriefly, after blocking by 0.01M PBS containing 1% horse serum for 1\u2009h at room temperature, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight. The primary antibodies were anti-GFAP (1:500, Dako), anti-ALDH1 (1:200, NeuroMab), anti-CSPGs (1:200, Sigma), and anti-COL1A1 (1:250, Novus Biologicals). Sections were then washed three times for 30\u2009min in PBS. Sections were incubated with their corresponding fluorescent secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (donkey anti-mouse, donkey anti-rabbit, 1:1000), or Alexa Fluor 555 (donkey anti-goat, donkey anti-mouse, and donkey anti-rabbit 1:500) (Thermofisher Scientific) for 1\u2009h at room temperature. After three washes for 10\u2009min in PBS, sections were counterstained with DAPI and coverslipped with Immu-Mount mounting medium (Thermofisher Scientific). Images were obtained with a Leica DMi8 inverted microscope.\n\nIHC:Spared tissue analysis\nSerial transverse sections surrounding the lesion epicenter (every eighth section) were utilized to identify effects on the remainder of the injured spinal cord. Serial sections were used to identify neurons (NeuN), oligodendrocytes (adenomatous polyposis col\u2014APC), endogenous neural stem cells (nestin), serotonergic axons (5HT), and macrophages/microglia (ED1). Briefly, after blocking by 0.01M PBS containing 1% horse serum for 1\u2009h at room temperature, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight. The primary antibodies were anti-NeuN (1:200, Abcam), anti-APC (1:20, Calbiochem), anti-nestin (1:100, BD Pharmagen), anti-5HT (1:7500, Immunostar), and anti-ED1 (1:250, Novus Biologicals).\n\nQuantification\nFor the quantification of the immunofluorescent signal, images of sections (at epicenter) per rat were acquired on a fluorescent microscope (Leica DMi8 inverted microscope) at 10x magnification. Six random fields of view (0.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n2\nmm\n2\nper field) per section within an area of 0.35\u2009mm\n2\naround the cavity were considered for quantification. Immunoreactivity was quantified with the Image J software from Fiji (v.1.45) (NIH; Bethesda, MD) by measuring the integrated optical density (intensity of fluorescence per unit of surface area). Biological variation in relation to any differences in stain absorption of any individual section was accounted for by defining the threshold.\n21\nTo define the threshold (T), the number (\nn\n=\u200910) of known negative and positive regions were randomly selected from three different sections from both control and treated samples. Mean intensities (u1 and u2) and standard deviations (\u03c31 and \u03c32) were obtained for negative and positive regions. Later threshold was calculated as T\u2009=\u2009u1* \u03c32+u2* \u03c31/ \u03c31+ \u03c32. A different threshold was calculated for each antibody.\nThe average integrated density of an antibody signal was recorded per section around the lesion cavity, averaged for each rat, and compared across treatment groups. The results were expressed in arbitrary units. Quantification of NeuN was performed by counting the number of positive cells per section in the gray matter of the spinal cord from each rat.\nThe sections that were selected to illustrate the various scar components in the figures were obtained from the area surrounding the epicenter of the lesion. Some biological variation is seen because they are not all from the same animal but from one of three animals in each group. These are representative sections only and the quantitative data were calculated for each rat around the entire lesion cavity.\n\nFunctional testing\nRats were evaluated using Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) open field locomotor testing.\n22\nEvaluation time points included immediately before and after SCI, day 1 after injury, and then weekly at days 7, 14, 21, 28 post-injury, and after scar ablation. Observers were blinded as to the treatment group.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data are presented as mean \u00b1standard error. BBB scores of all rats were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Cavitation area and all quantitative IHC data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. The Bonferroni\npost hoc\ntest was used to identify differences among groups. Statistical significance was determined at\np\n<\u20090.05. All IHC quantitation, cavitation analysis, and functional testing were performed in a blinded fashion."

    "Methods": "Blast model\nThe blast injury model used was adapted from the previously developed Cranium Only Blast Injury Apparatus (COBIA).\n20\nThe central component of the COBIA was a Mastershot (a 22 caliber, single-shot, powder-actuated tool, Ramset RS22; ITW Ramset, Glendale Heights, IL) mounted vertically on a custom-fabricated stand. The Mastershot was modified by removing the piston that normally drove the fastener, making it function like a firearm allowing the blast wave to propagate undampened through the barrel (\nFig. 1B\n). The muzzle of the Mastershot was snugly fit into a custom blast director, constructed from polyvinyl chloride pipe (10\u2009cm long with an inner diameter of 2\u2009cm), (\nFig. 1B\n). The blast wave was generated by firing a 22 caliber crimped brass blank cartridge (power hammer loads power level 4, yellow color coding, with 179\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009mg of smokeless powder, Ramset 42CW, Ramset, Glendale Heights, IL).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExperimental design for wide-field Ca\n2+\nimaging of hippocampal neurons in mice exposed to a cranial blast\n(A)\nA wide-field fluorescence microscope coupled to a scientific complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (sCMOS) camera was used to image neurons expressing a genetically encoded Ca\n2+\nsensor (GCaMP6f)\nin vivo\n.\n(B)\nThe Cranium Only Blast Injury Apparatus (COBIA) consisted of a modified nail gun coupled to a blast director to direct the blast wave vertically onto the freely moving head of unanesthetized mice.

The sensor was positioned \u223c2\u2009cm from the dissipation chamber, where the head of the mouse was positioned. Transducer outputs were digitized using a NADAQ data acquisition system (National Instruments, NI-USB-6259) at 350\u2009kHz, and analyzed offline.\nWe calibrated our COBIA device using this sensor, which had a 500\u2009kHz resonant frequency (100\u2009kHz maximum sampling frequency). To compare to the pressure measurements reported in the study by Kuehn and coworkers, we filtered the pressure trace at 12\u2009kHz to measure a comparable transient overpressure.\n20\nTo compare to the shock tube device reported by Goldstein and coworkers, we filtered the blast pressure trace at 2 KHz.\n11\nAlthough the severity of the blast injury is typically attributed to the magnitude of the pressure produced (peak blast overpressure), and the duration of peak overpressure,\n5\n,\n19\n,\n20\n,\n31\nnone of the animals exposed to the blast lost consciousness or exhibited noticeable abnormal behavior either immediately following the blast or the week after. In addition, upon dissection, the brains were unremarkable with no contusions. Because of the similarities of the blast overpressure in this study to those in prior studies, we consider results of this study most relevant to mild blast injury.\n11\n,\n20\n\nWide-field imaging and blast procedure\nAll animal procedures were approved by the Boston University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Nine adult female C57BL/6 mice (Taconic; Hudson, NY) 2\u201312 months old at the start of the experiments, were imaged as described previously.\n30\nBriefly, under isoflurane anesthesia, mice were stereotaxically injected in CA1 (anteroposterior [AP], \u22122\u2009mm; mediolateral [ML], 1.4\u2009mm; dorsoventral [DV], \u22121.6\u2009mm) with 0.25\u2009\u03bcL of\nAAV9-Syn-GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40\nvirus (titer \u223c6e12 GC/mL, University of Pennsylvania Vector Core) using a microsyringe pump (UltraMicroPump3-4; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) at a speed of 40\u2009nL/min. On complete recovery (at least 5 days), animals were then surgically implanted over the CA1 viral injection site with a custom imaging window constructed using a stainless steel cannula (outer diameter [OD], 0.317\u2009in; inner diameter [ID], 0.236\u2009in; height, 2\u2009mm) adhered to a cover-slip (size 0; OD, 3mm), and a custom aluminum head-plate to allow awake head fixed imaging. On complete recovery from implant surgery (\u223c 2 weeks), mice were accustomed to head fixation before imaging sessions began (\nFig. 1D\n).\nAwake, head-fixed animals were imaged using a custom-built fluorescence microscope as previously described (\nFig. 1A\n).\n30\nBriefly, the imaging setup consisted of standard optics for GCaMP6 imaging and a scientific CMOS (sCMOS) camera (ORCA-Flash4.0 LT Digital CMOS camera C11440-42U; Hamamatsu, Boston, MA). Imaging data (1024 x 1024 pixels, 16 bit) were collected at 20\u2009Hz and analyzed offline. No anesthetics or analgesics were used for any of the blast or imaging protocols.\nMice were first imaged for 100\u2009sec to obtain baseline activity prior to the blast, and then removed from the imaging setup and inserted into a mouse restrainer (Stoelting Co. Wood Dale, IL) that permitted full mobility of the head (\nFig. 1B\n). For the blast group (\nn\n=\u20094 mice), restrained mice were placed 2\u2009cm under the blast dissipation chamber and positioned so that the blast was directed dorsally between bregma and lambda. For the sham group (\nn\n=\u20095 mice), restrained mice were positioned adjacent to the COBIA, so that mice experienced the sound of the blast but not the blast pressure. Prior to blasts, tape was placed over the imaging cannula and a wetted custom paper cone was fitted to cover the head to allow reproducible positioning of the head, to allow free movement of the head, and to prevent potential quaternary damage from gun powder during blasts. Immediately following blasts, animals were removed from the restrainer and quickly repositioned and head-fixed in the imaging setup. This transfer process typically took <5\u2009min. Calcium imaging was then performed for 100\u2009sec for all mice at each of the following intervals: immediately following head-fixation after blast (0\u2009min), and at \u223c10\u2009min (range, 6\u201315\u2009min; mean, 10\u2009min 45\u2009sec), 20\u2009min (range, 16\u201326\u2009min; mean, 21\u2009min 19\u2009sec), 35\u2009min (range, 29\u201346\u2009min; mean, 35\u2009min 32\u2009sec), and 65\u2009min (range, 57\u201376\u2009min; mean, 65\u2009min 28\u2009sec) after blast/sham (\nFig. 1E\n). Each animal underwent these procedures once a day for two consecutive days.\n\nCalcium imaging data analysis\nFor each imaging session, the 100\u2009sec videos for the five time points following the blast/sham-exposure (0, 10, 20, 35, and 65\u2009min after blast/sham exposure and head re-fixation) were first concatenated, and then processed as one video (500\u2009sec total duration) to provide a continuous registration of regions of interest (ROIs) across all time points. Each of the 100\u2009sec baseline videos taken immediately prior to blast or sham exposure was processed separately, because it was difficult to accurately align the ROIs between the videos taken before and after the blast, when the mice were transferred from the imaging setup to the COBIA device. Ca\n2+\nimaging videos were first filtered with a homomorphic filter to enhance contrast, and then motion corrected using a rigid correction as previously described.\n30\nCircular ROIs with a radius of 6 pixels (corresponding to 7.8\u2009\u03bcm) were manually selected as being centered on the cell body on a maximum projection image across all video frames using a code we developed (\nhttps://github.com/HanLabBU/mTBI_Ca_Hippocampus\n).\nRaw calcium traces were extracted for each identified ROI as the mean intensity of all pixels within a given ROI, where the absolute value of each pixel intensity was determined from the motion-corrected videos without the homomorphic filter. The raw calcium intensity for each cell was used to determine whether a cell was elevated or suppressed. A probability density estimate (PDE) of raw pixel intensities was calculated using MATLAB 8.1 (MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, 2013) for each cell for the imaging periods immediately after blast (Period 1) and 65\u2009min (Period 5) after blast. The difference in mean pixel intensity between Period 5 and Period 1 for each cell was calculated. To establish a confidence interval, pixel intensity differences were pooled across all sham mice for all imaging sessions. A 95% confidence interval was determined from the 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles of these pooled differences. The width of this confidence interval was applied to the unity line, which would suggest no difference between Period 1 and Period 5. Differences in mean pixel intensity that fell outside of this confidence interval for both blasted and sham-exposed mice were classified as elevated (Period 1 > Period 5) or suppressed (Period 1 < Period 5).\nFor additional analyses, we also calculated normalized Ca\n2+\ntraces as\n, where\nF\nis the linearly detrended instantaneous fluorescence intensity,\nF\n0\nis the linearly detrended mean fluorescence for a given imaging period, and\nF\n5\nis the mean fluorescence for the final imaging period (Period 5, \u223c65\u2009min after blast). Binarized traces were then created from the normalized traces by setting the rising phase of calcium activation events to 1s, with 0s elsewhere along the binary trace. Specifically, normalized Ca\n2+\ntraces (\n) were low-pass filtered with a sixth order Butterworth filter at a cutoff of 2\u2009Hz. A global standard deviation (SD) was calculated across all concatenated videos (SD\nall\n) for each trace. Calcium activation events were identified as peak values that were at least 3 SD\nall\nabove the mean for each imaging period. Each of these peaks was counted to determine an integer value of the calcium event rate. From each peak point, the data points prior to the peak with a positive derivative were set to a binary 1, with all other data points were assigned as 0s. To determine if a cell showed a significant decrease or increase in dynamic activity after blast, a bootstrapping method was used. The percentage of time a cell was active was measured during a 10\u2009sec window that was randomly permuted 1000 times from the trace over the course of each period to determine how active the cell was for that time period. These bootstrapped samples for Period 1 and Period 5 were compared for each cell using a two tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test. Cells that were statistically different (\np\n<\u20090.05) between the two time periods were classified as showing increased activity or decreased activity, where decreased cells were those with less activity in Period 1 than in Period 5, and increased cells were those with more activity in Period 1 than in Period 5.\nEach cell was determined to be either suppressed, elevated, or consistent in its basal levels, as well as determining whether the calcium event rate was increased, decreased, or unmodulated by comparison of time Period 1 to time Period 5 for each cell. Each of these classifications was quantified as the fraction of total neurons within each mouse, and those values were used for population analyses between sham and blasted mice.\n\nImmunocytochemistry\nOne week following the second blast, mice were perfused with 0.9% NaCl heparinized saline followed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer (PB) pH 7.4 (containing sodium phosphate monobasic [Sigma, Cat# S0751], and sodium phosphate dibasic [Sigma, Cat# S3264]). Brains were post-fixed overnight at 4\u00b0C, and then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PB overnight at 4\u00b0C. Brains were then blocked from bregma \u22120.94\u2009mm to \u22122.92\u2009mm using an adult mouse brain slicer matrix (BSMAS001-1, Zivic Instruments, Pittsburgh, PA), and sectioned at 40\u2009\u03bcm using a freezing sliding microtome (Reichert Jung Inc. Depew, NY). Brain slices were stored at \u221220\u00b0C in cryoprotectant (containing 30% sucrose [Sigma, Cat#S0389], 30% ethylene glycol [Fisher Scientific, Cat#BP230-1], and 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone [Fisher Scientific, Cat#BP431-500]) in Tris-buffered saline pH 7.6 (0.4\u2009M Trizma HCl [Sigma, Cat# T-3253], 0.01\u2009M Trizma base [Sigma T-1503], and 0.15\u2009M sodium chloride (Fisher Scientific, Cat# BP358-212]) for subsequent immunostaining.\nFree-floating sections were first mounted and dried onto Colorfrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Mounted slices were rehydrated in PB prior to incubation with 5% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, Inc. West Grove, PA) in PB containing 0.3% TritonX100 (PBTx). Slices from each animal were immunostained overnight at 4\u00b0C using either mouse monoclonal anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP 1:250, Clone No. N206\u2009A/8, UC Davis/NIH NeuroMab Facility Cat# 75-240, RRID:AB_10672299), or rabbit anti-Iba1 (1:1000, Wako, Catalog No. 019-19741), followed by the appropriate fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies, donkey anti-mouse Cy3 (1:500, Jackson Immuno Research, Catalog No. 715-165-150) or donkey anti-rabbit 647 (1:500, Jackson Immuno Research, catalog No. 711-605-152), for 2\u2009h at room temperature. These primary antibodies have been previously characterized in the mouse brain.\n32\n,\n33\nSlices were then cover-slipped in Gelvatol (10% polyvinyl alcohol [Sigma, Cat#P8136], 20% glycerol, Sigma G-9012, 0.02% sodium azide [Fisher Scientific, Cat#-227-100], and 0.2\u2009M Tris [Amresco, Cat#0497], pH 8.5]) or Vectashield with 4\u20326-diamindino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) to visualize nuclei.\nSections were imaged using a Nikon Eclipse motorized microscope (Nikon Instruments, Inc.) at 10x. ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) was used to analyze the stained slices.\n\nImmunocytochemistry quantification\nThe percent area occupied by GFAP was analyzed using ImageJ software. Immunostained images were first inverted so that signal appeared black and then binarized using the Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA) algorithm in ImageJ. Five randomly selected cells per slice, and three slices per hemisphere with visible somata were analyzed for each mouse. An area large enough to enclose a single cell was used for all analyses. The area fraction, defined as the percent coverage (percent area) of immunoreactivity within each area, was obtained for each binary image using the area fraction selection from the ImageJ measure plugin. It was expected that evidence of glial activation would be reflected by a greater percent area because the cells would be larger in size and therefore occupy a greater percentage of the area. Values for percent area were obtained for individual cells (\nn\n=\u20095 cells per hemisphere). To account for any differences caused by the presence of the imaging window (ipsilateral), the hemisphere opposite to the window (contralateral) was analyzed separately as an internal control.\nTwo broad classifications of Iba1 phenotypes were chosen for evaluation: ramified and unramified. Manual counts of Iba1 positive cells identified as ramified or unramified were performed within the same ROI applied to the hemisphere ipsilateral to the imaging window as well as to the contralateral hemisphere.\nGFAP and Iba1 immunoreactivity were first evaluated using a paired\nt\ntest (\np\n<\u20090.05) for the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres for sham (\nn\n=\u20095) and blast exposed (\nn\n=\u20096) animals. A two-tailed unpaired\nt\ntest (\np\n<\u20090.05) was then performed to compare the results from sham and blasted animals. Data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. Statistical analysis of immunocytochemistry was performed using SPSS (IBM Corp. Released 2016. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 24.0, Armonk, NY)"

    "Methods": "Study design\nData were obtained from the prospective observational Radboud University Brain Injury Cohort Study (RUBICS).\n23\u201326\nAll patients with mild, moderate or severe TBI admitted between January 1998 and December 2010 to the emergency department (ED) of the Radboud University Medical Centre (RUNMC), a level I trauma center in the Netherlands, were included in the database. The ethical standards committee of the RUNMC had approved this study.\n\nStudy participants\nIn the current study, 797 patients were selected from the RUBICS database based on the following inclusion criteria: patients' age was \u226516 years, written informed consent was given by patients (or guardians), patients had mTBI and were admitted to the ED of RUNMC between January 2003 and June 2010. Diagnosis of mTBI was based on a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13\u201315 after initial resuscitation or followed by sedation and intubation during resuscitation for a non-neurological cause. Exclusion criteria were alcohol or drug abuse or dementia, unknown address, and not being able to speak or write Dutch. We selected 92% (\nn\n=\u2009731) of mTBI patients who completed the RPQ (filled in all items) at 6 month follow-up for all analyses throughout this study.\n\nMeasurements\nClinical data were registered in the ED at admission by a neurologist and/or neurosurgeon and entered by a research nurse into the RUBICS databank. Demographic data (age, sex, and educational level), trauma mechanism, hospitalization, clinical variables, comorbidities, functional outcome (GOSE), and the RPQ were all collected with a postal questionnaire, which was self-rated by patients or guardians at 6 months after the trauma. Structured interviews during regular visits to the outpatient clinic or during consultation by telephone were used to determine GOSE scores.\n27\n\nAssessment of persistent post-concussion symptoms and diagnosis of PCS\nThe prevalence rates and severity of persistent post-concussion symptoms were assessed with the postal RPQ at 6 month follow-up. Patients were asked to rate the severity of 16 different symptoms, commonly found after TBI, over the past 24\u2009h. In each case, the symptoms were compared with how severe they had been before the injury occurred (premorbid). The patient was asked to rate the symptoms on a five point Likert scale: 0 (not experienced at all), 1 (not a problem), 2 (mild problem), 3 (moderate problem), and 4 (severe problem).\nIn the literature, there is not a gold standard concerning the use of the RPQ. Therefore, we used the following classification methods to classify patients as having PCS: mapped ICD-10/DSM-IV, RPQ total score,\n12\nRPQ 3,\n14\nand three-factor model (\nTable 1\n) .\n15\nThe mapped ICD-10/DSM-IV requires that three or more symptoms in the list in\nTable 1\nreach cutoff, the RPQ3 requires that one or more symptoms in the list in\nTable 1\nreach cutoff, the RPQ total score requires a sum score of all items of the RPQ of \u226512, and the three factor model requires that one or more items within each of the cognitive, emotional, and somatic scales reaches cutoff. For each classification method, we used two different rating scores as cutoff (\u2265 2 and \u22653), resulting in eight different classification methods in total. Because no clear cutoff was found in the literature for the RPQ13, this scale was not taken into consideration. It should also be noted that the RPQ is based on self-report rather than clinical examination, and does not include information on the duration of the symptoms and clinically significant impairment. Therefore, it cannot accurately diagnose PCS.\n20\nTable\n1.\nClassification Methods Regarding Post-Concussion Syndrome\nClassification methods\nMapped ICD-10/DSM-IV\nRPQ Total score\n13\nRPQ3\n14\nThree factor model\n15\nAt least 3 symptoms from the list below\nAll symptoms from the list below\nAt least 1 symptom from the list below\nAt least 1 symptom from each scale from the list below\nEligible symptoms from\nHeadache\nHeadache\nHeadache\nCognitive\nForgetfulness, poor memory\nthe RPQ\nDizziness\nDizziness\nDizziness\nPoor concentration\nSleep disturbance\nNausea and/or vomiting\nNausea and/or vomiting\nTaking longer to think\nFatigue\nNoise sensitivity\nEmotional\nBeing irritable, easily angered\nBeing irritable, easily angered\nSleep disturbance\nFeeling depressed or tearful\nForgetfulness, poor memory\nFatigue\nFeeling frustrated or impatient\nPoor concentration\nBlurred vision\nRestlessness\nLight sensitivity\nSomatic\nHeadache\nDouble vision\nDizziness\nForgetfulness, poor memory\nNausea and/or vomiting\nPoor concentration\nNoise sensitivity\nTaking longer to think\nSleep disturbance\nBeing irritable, easily angered\nFatigue\nFeeling depressed or tearful\nBlurred vision\nFeeling frustrated or impatient\nLight sensitivity\nRestlessness\nDouble vision\nCutoff; rating score 2\nThree items with score \u22652\n\u2265 12 (only symptoms \u22652)\na\nOne item with score \u22652\nEach scale has one item \u22652\nCutoff; rating score 3\nThree items with score \u22653\n\u2265 12 (only symptoms \u22653)\nOne item with score \u22653\nEach scale has one item \u22653\nOpen in a separate window\na\nExample: Six symptoms with rating score 2 qualify as having PCS.\nICD, International Classification of Diseases; DSM, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; RPQ, Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire; PCS, post-concussion syndrome.\n\nRisk factors\nLooking at the available data in our data set and using previous literature,\n20\u201322\nthe variables age, gender, level of education, injury mechanism (assault vs. other mechanisms), Injury Severity Scale (ISS), Abbreviated Injury Score of the Head (AISH), comorbidity, traumatic abnormalities on the head CT scan, and whether the patient was admitted to the hospital were considered as risk factors. We hypothesized that older age, female gender, lower years of education, higher ISS and AISH scores, comorbidity, abnormalities on CT, and being hospitalized would be associated with PCS.\n\nFunctional outcome\nFunctional outcome was assessed using the 6 month GOSE, which was completed as a postal questionnaire. The GOSE is a functional measurement scale specifically designed for TBI.\n28\n,\n29\nThe instrument evaluates functional outcome through eight categories encompassing consciousness, independence at home and outside the home, work, social and leisure activities, family and friendship, and return to normal life.\n30\nAfter accumulating these categories an eight point scale ranging from 1 (dead) to 8 (completely recovered) is established, which has the ability to distinguish among functional outcomes. For 20 patients included in our study, the GOSE score was missing. When there was no available outcome at exactly 6 months, outcomes measured within a 2 month range were also approved. Functional impairment was classified as a GOSE score of \u22646.\n27\n\nStatistical analysis\nFor demographic data (age, sex, and educational level), trauma mechanisms, hospitalization, clinical injury variables and comorbidities, descriptive analyses were performed. Patients included in the current study were compared with those having incomplete RPQ data on demographic (gender, age, educational level) and clinical variables using \u03c7\n2\ntests (categorical variables) and Student's\nt\ntests (continuous variables).\nPrevalence of PCS using the eight divergent classification methods was determined by computing the percentage of patients meeting the specific criteria of each classification method. We subsequently determined overlap between classification methods by calculating the number and percentage of patients diagnosed with PCS according to multiple classification methods.\nThe univariable associations between predictors and PCS according to multiple classification methods were explored by using \u03c7\n2\ntests (categorical variables) and an independent samples\nt\ntest (continuous variables). All variables were included in a stepwise backwards multivariable logistical regression to identify significant risk factors (\np\n<\u20090.05) of PCS. The association between PCS and functional impairment (GOSE \u22646) was determined by calculating the percentage of patients for each classification method of PCS that was functionally impaired. McNemar tests were used to see if the classification methods differed significantly in PCS/no PCS pattern at the population level, and a Cochran's Q test was used to see if the classification methods differed significantly (\np\n<\u20090.05) at an individual level. Multiple imputation technique with five data sets was used to impute missing data for the following predictor variables: education (182 missing), comorbidity (237 missing), and hospital admission (2 missing).\nAll statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 21 for Windows (IBM SPSS Statistics, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL)."

    "Methods": "Mice\nExperiments were performed on 6\u20138-week-old male C57/BL6 mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME; IMSR Cat# JAX:000664, RRID: IMSR_JAX:000664). All experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Separate cohorts of animals were used for behavioral and electrophysiological experiments because of the large number of animals necessary for electrophysiological experiments.\n\nSurgical procedures\nAnimals were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (100\u2013200\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (0.06\u20130.16\u2009mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection. Once fully anesthetized, animals were placed in a stereotaxic frame (Stoetling, Wood Dale, IL). The scalp was incised and pulled away to fully expose the right parietal bone. An ultra-thin Teflon disk, with the outer diameter equal to the inner diameter of a trephine was glued to the skull with Vetbond (3M, St. Paul, MN) between lambda and bregma, and between the sagittal suture and the lateral ridge over the right hemisphere. Guided by the Teflon disk, a trephine was used to perform a 3\u2009mm diameter craniectomy over the right parietal area. Following craniectomy, a Luer-lock needle hub (3\u2009mm inner diameter) was secured above the skull opening with Loctite superglue and dental acrylic, filled with saline and capped. Lastly, animals were removed from stereotaxis, placed on a heating pad until fully recovered from anesthesia, and then returned to their respective home cages.\n\nLFPI\nTwenty-four hours following craniectomy, animals were placed under isoflurane anesthesia (2% oxygen in 500\u2009mL/min) in a chamber, and respiration was visually monitored until animals reached a surgical plane of anesthesia (one respiration per 2\u2009sec). At this point, animals were removed from isoflurane, and the needle hub was refilled with saline and connected to the FPI device (Department of Biomedical Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond) via high-pressure tubing. The animal was placed onto a heating pad on its left side, and upon resumption of normal breathing pattern but before sensitivity to stimulation, the injury was induced by a 20\u2009msec pulse of saline onto the intact dura. The pressure transduced onto the dura was monitored with an oscilloscope, with injury severity ranging between 1.4 and 1.6 atm. Immediately after injury, the hub was removed from the skull, and the animal was placed in a supine position to assess righting reflex. After righting, the animal was subjected to inhaled isoflurane to suture the scalp. Animals were allowed to recover on a heating pad until mobile, at which point they were returned to their home cages. Sham animals underwent all surgical procedures including attachment to the FPI device, with exclusion of the actual fluid pulse.\n\nObject-place recognition memory behavioral task\nOne week after LFPI or sham surgery, hippocampal-dependent spatial information processing was assessed with an object-place recognition memory task adapted from Oliveira and colleagues.\n39\nThe task consisted of a respective training and testing day, spanning a total of 2 days. Mice were handled for 5\u2009min each day for 4 days prior to training. During the training day, mice first received one 6\u2009min habituation trial followed by three identical 6\u2009min training trials with 3\u2009min inter-trial intervals in their home cage. Habituation consisted of 6\u2009min in a rectangular open field box (30.5\u2009\u00d7\u200951\u2009\u00d7\u200930.5 cm) with visual cues placed on each of the arena walls in the absence of objects. Subsequent training trials took place in the same box, but now with three identical, complex objects positioned diagonally in the box. Corner objects were placed 3 inches away from each wall. Mice were allowed to freely explore the environment and the objects for the duration of each trial. Twenty-four hours from the first training trial, mice were placed back in the box for a single 6\u2009min testing trial. The three objects were again present, but one of the outer two objects was now displaced to a novel spatial location (\nFig. 1A\n). Time spent exploring the displaced and non-displaced objects was measured in the third training trial and testing trial. The initial diagonal orientation of the objects, as well as the testing object selected for displacement, was counterbalanced between mice. Testing was always performed in the morning at the end of the dark phase of a 12\u2009h light\u2013dark cycle.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nLateral fluid percussion injury (LFPI) animals show impairment in object-place recognition task.\n(A)\nThe task consisted of familiarization training with three identical objects, each in a distinct spatial location. In the testing trial, one object was displaced to a novel location.\n(B)\nThe normalized difference in the time spent exploring the displaced and non-displaced objects in testing and training was calculated as a discrimination index (i.e., positive index scores signify more time spent exploring the object in testing). If the animal showed a preference for the displaced object in the test trial over the non-displaced objects, this was considered a demonstration of spatial novelty detection. (Sham, displaced vs. non-displaced objects,\np\n=\u20090.0004; LFPI, displaced vs. non-displaced objects,\np\n=\u20090.5970; Sham displaced vs. LFPI displaced,\np\n=\u20090.0019;\nn\n=\u200910 animals for each condition). Discrimination index calculation as follows: Discrimination index\u2009=\u2009[(Object\u2009\u00d7\u2009interaction time\ntesting\n/Total Interaction time\ntesting\n)\u2009\u00d7\u2009100] \u2013 [(Object\u2009\u00d7\u2009interaction time\ntraining\n/Total Interaction time\ntraining\n)\u2009\u00d7\u2009100].\n\nBehavioral analysis\nAll testing and training sessions were videotaped and analyzed by an experimenter blinded to the injury conditions of the animals. Object interaction times were independently calculated by both manual observation of video recordings, and automated open-source behavioral software developed by Patel and colleagues.\n40\nThe results of the manual and automated behavioral analysis were then subsequently averaged together. Total object interaction time, as well as time spent with each object, were recorded for each trial. Each animal's exploratory response to the spatial object displacement was measured with a normalized discrimination index.\n39\nThe discrimination index was calculated by subtracting the percent of total interaction time a mouse spent exploring the respective object category (i.e., displaced and the non-displaced), in the testing trial from the percent of total interaction time exploring the same object category in the third training trial. Therefore, a positive index percentage value indicated that the animal spent more time with that object in testing than in training. Criteria for what was considered as object interaction was limited to the times when mice were facing and sniffing the objects within a 2\u2009cm radius and/or touching them; sitting on the objects did not count as an exploration interaction. The first 2\u2009min in the third training and testing trials were used for analysis, as preliminary testing in na\u00efve mice showed a significant decrease in total object interaction time after the first 2\u2009min of each trial. Animals that did not explore the objects for more than 3\u2009sec during training or testing were excluded from analysis.\n\nSlice preparation\nAll electrophysiological experiments were performed on days 6\u20138 after LFPI or sham surgery. Slice preparation was performed as previously described.\n41\nBriefly, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane, the brain was dissected out and placed in ice-cold oxygenated (95% O\n2\n/5% CO\n2\n) sucrose-containing artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing (in mM): sucrose 202, KCl 3, NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n2.5, NaHCO\n3\n26, glucose 10, MgCl\n2\n1, and CaCl\n2\n2. The hemisphere contralateral to the craniectomy was removed prior to vibratome slice cutting. Hippocampal-entorhinal slices (HEC) slices 350\u2009\u03bcm thick were cut on a vibratome (VT1200S, Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). HEC slice orientation was used in an effort to maximally preserve intact perforant path and mossy fiber pathway axons. In a subset of slices (\nn\n=\u20092 slices per group), the hilus was transected with a scalpel at the terminal ends of DG stratum granulosum immediately following vibratome slicing to sever mossy fiber axons traveling to area CA3. Slices were transferred to 33\u201337\u00b0C oxygenated (95% O\n2\n/5% CO\n2\n) control aCSF containing (in millimolars): NaCl 130, KCl 3, NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n1.25, NaHCO\n3\n26, glucose 10, MgCl\n2\n1, and CaCl\n2\n2. Slices were allowed to incubate and equilibrate for at least 60\u2009min before recording. Voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging and extracellular field potential recordings were performed in an interface chamber with a flow rate of 2.0\u2009mL/min and maintained at 27\u201330\u00b0C.\n\nExtracellular field recordings\nElectrodes for recording field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were fabricated from borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL; #1B150F-4), pulled to a tip resistance of 2\u20136\u2009M\u03a9 when filled with aCSF. fEPSPs were recorded from an electrode placed in the suprapyramidal blade of the DG middle stratum moleculare. Stimulating electrodes were non-concentric bipolar (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL; #ME12206) and placed at the apex of the stratum moleculare. Electrical stimuli were 100\u2009\u03bcs in duration. Field potential input\u2013output relationships (50\u2013500\u2009\u03bcA stimulation, 50\u2009\u03bcA increments, 8\u2009sec inter-stimulus interval) were performed prior to VSD recordings. Field potential recordings were also recorded simultaneously with VSD recordings. The inter-stimulus interval for field potentials recorded during the VSD trials was 20\u2009sec. This duration was necessary to accommodate every other trial subtraction method used for VSD analysis. Simultaneous VSD and field recordings were performed at 200\u2009\u03bcA, 300\u2009\u03bcA, and 400\u2009\u03bcA stimulation intensities in aCSF.\nIn a separate experiment, extracellular recordings of orthodromic population spikes from the stratum granulosum of the dentate infrapyramidal blade and CA3 stratum pyramidale were recorded simultaneously. A non-concentric bipolar electrode was again placed at the apex of the dentate stratum moleculare to stimulate afferent perforant path fibers from the entorhinal cortex. Paired-pulse stimulation (100\u2009msec inter-stimulus interval), each pulse 100\u2009\u03bcsec in duration, was used to elicit population spikes in both the DG stratum granulosum and CA3 stratum pyramidale, and, subsequently, fEPSPs in the CA3 stratum lucidum and stratum radiatum (\nFig. 2\n). A paired-pulse protocol was chosen in order to increase the probability of eliciting a population spike in CA3 rather than a single stimulation (preliminary data, not shown). Field potential input\u2013output relationships (20\u2013500\u2009\u03bcA stimulation, 8\u2009sec inter-stimulus interval) were performed for each cell layer. Recordings were obtained with an Axoclamp 900\u2009A amplifier and pClamp10 data acquisition software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), filtered at 2\u2009kHz. Population spike amplitude was measured as the amplitude of the first negative deflection overriding the field EPSP waveform.\n42\nField potential data were analyzed using pClamp10 and custom-written MATLAB scripts.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nAnatomy of the dentate gyrus and area Cornu Ammonis [CA3] in a hippocampal-entorhinal cortex (HEC) brain slice. The perforant path (PP) is composed of axons from layer II of the entorhinal cortex, which traverse the subiculum and enter the stratum moleculare (StM) of the dentate gyrus (i.e., molecular layer [ML]), to synapse onto distal dendrites of granule cells. Granule cell bodies are located in stratum granulosum (StG; i.e., granule cell layer). Granule cell axons pass through the dentate hilus (HIL) forming the mossy fiber pathway (MF). Mossy fibers synapse onto CA3 pyramidal cell proximal dendrites in the stratum lucidum (StL) of area CA3. Pyramidal cell bodies are situated in stratum pyramidale (StP; i.e., pyramidal cell layer). Pyramidal cell axons project into the stratum oriens (StO). Pyramidal cells additionally send recurrent associational/commissural (A/C) axon collaterals to stratum radiatum (StR) where they synapse onto other pyramidal cells, forming the CA3 autoassociational network. In all experiments described, a nonconcentric bipolar stimulating electrode was placed in the dentate ML at the apex to stimulate perforant path fibers (Stim).\n\nVoltage-sensitive dye imaging acquisition\nDye stock solutions of di-3-ANEPPDHQ (Invitrogen) were prepared at a concentration of 20\u2009mg/mL in ethanol and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. Dye working solutions were prepared at a concentration of 67\u2009\u03bcg/mL by diluting dye stock solution 1:300 in aCSF on the day of recording. Slices were stained for 16\u2009min, and afterwards rinsed thoroughly with aCSF before being transferred to the recording chamber. Stained slices were then washed for another 15\u201320\u2009min prior to commencing VSD recording. As in extracellular field recordings, a non-concentric bipolar electrode was placed at the apex of the stratum moleculare to elicit electrical stimulation. The dye was excited by seven high-power green LEDs (Luxeon Rebel LXML-PM01-0100, Philips) coupled to a 535\u2009\u00b1\u200925\u2009nm bandpass filter and 565\u2009nm dichroic mirror. Emitted VSD fluorescence was isolated with a 610\u2009nm long-pass filter and recorded at 0.5\u2009kHz with a fast video camera with 80\u2009\u00d7\u200980 pixel resolution (NeuroCCD, Redshirt Imaging, Decatur, GA) through a reverse-lens macroscope with a 50\u2009mm f/1.3 M46 lens (Dark Invader). Each camera pixel imaged a 25\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u200925\u2009\u03bcm region of tissue. The fluorescence light source was triggered 230\u2009msec prior to the acquisition of the fluorescence signal to allow the light onset emission transient to stabilize, and the electrical stimulus was delivered 170\u2009msec after commencing fluorescence data acquisition. All VSD recordings were 13 trials, 1.0\u2009sec in duration (1000 samples), with a 20\u2009sec interval between electrically stimulated trials. Each stimulated trial was followed 10\u2009sec later, by a non-electrically stimulated trial that was used to subtract photo-bleaching from the active signal. All VSD figures and statistics reported here are from recordings at 200\u2009\u03bcA stimulation, as this elicited an approximately half maximal field potential response, while providing a high enough signal-to-noise ratio for VSD analysis.\n\nVoltage-sensitive dye imaging analysis\nInitial processing of VSD signals was performed as described previously.\n41\n,\n43\nAll VSD measurements were recorded as fractional change in fluorescence values (\u0394F/F), which were calculated as follows: fluorescence values for each pixel in each trial were normalized according to the average fluorescence in the pixel during a 64\u2009msec window immediately preceding the electrical stimulus. Then, the average from the corresponding pixel in the non-electrically stimulated trial was normalized and subtracted from the individual electrically stimulated trials to correct for photo-bleaching. VSD recordings were filtered in x and y spatial coordinates by convolution with a 5 pixels\u2009\u00d7\u20095 pixels Gaussian filter (\u03a3\u2009=\u20091.2 pixels), and in time by convolution with a five sample median filter. No additional filtering was applied to any of the images or analysis of VSD data. For VSD videos and representative movie frames, the \u0394F/F for each pixel for the given sample (1\u2009msec) is displayed as pseudocolor superimposed onto the image of the brain slice, where warm colors (i.e., red and orange) indicate depolarization and cool colors (i.e., blue and purple) indicate hyperpolarization. Time points selected for the representative movie frames correlate to fluorescence peaks analyzed in the regional average line plots. Peak maps were generated by pseudo-coloring and plot the maximum \u0394F/F value at each pixel regardless of time for that slice.\nRaster plot construction, analysis, and statistics were performed using the MATLAB VSD analysis toolbox.\n44\nTo begin raster construction, regions of interest (anatomical regions) were defined for segmentation. In these experiments, the anatomical boundaries of the DG stratum moleculare, stratum granulosum and hilus, as well as the CA3 stratum pyramidale, radiatum/lucidem, and oriens, were clearly visible and used to draw region boundaries. The DG strata granulosum and moleculare were subdivided into suprapyramidal and infrapyramidal blades, as these blades have been found to have different circuit properties and connections.\n45\nThere was no clear visual division between the subregions CA3a,b, or c; therefore, approximate geometric divisions were made consistently across slices to include the regions closest to the dentate, putatively CA3b/c.\nRegions were then split into 100\u2009\u03bcm segments along the rostrocaudal axis, numbering segments in ascending order from the rostral to caudal ends of each region. Average \u0394F/F values were calculated for each spatiotemporal site and plotted as pseudocolor in the distance from stimulating electrode versus time raster plots. To account for slight variability in region of interest size when creating average raster plots, all individual slice raster plots were stretched or compressed to have the same number of segments. That number was set as the mean number of segments from the individual slices. VSD recordings were made in a maximum of two slices per animal; therefore, \u0394F/F values for each anatomical region of interest were averaged to create a raster plot for each animal for group analysis. Statistical comparison of group raster plots was performed at each individual spatiotemporal site using a permutation test (\nt\n=\u20091000). Permutation is a nonparametric test that randomly resamples data to generate a null distribution describing variability in the data. Significant differences (\u03b1 < 0.05) were registered at sites where injury versus sham groupings explained the variability in the data. The\np\nvalues generated are displayed in pseudocolor on the\np\nvalue raster plots. Multi-segment averages were calculated for each anatomical region by averaging the mean \u0394F/F value for each signal to generate a regional average, and were plotted as line plots (i.e., multi-segment regional average line plots). Line plots show the average \u0394F/F (dark line) surrounded by ellipses marking the standard error of the mean (shaded surrounding). The initial fast depolarization peak (max \u0394F/F between 0 and 35\u2009msec), was used for analysis, as it roughly corresponds to the time scale of synaptic transmission. The segments selected for line plots were the same between conditions and consistent by region.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses and calculations were performed using MATLAB and/or GraphPad Prism.\nA priori\npower calculations were performed using G*Power based on variability from similar previous experiments.\n46\nThe spatial object recognition task discrimination index was analyzed with one way ANOVA with\npost-hoc\nTukey's multiple comparisons test. Student's\nt\ntests were used to compare total object interaction times in training and testing, respectively. All statistical tests for fEPSP data were conducted using Mann\u2013Whitney\nU\ntests, or two way repeated measures ANOVA with Sidak's multiple comparison test in order to test for injury effect and stimulation intensity effect. VSD data were analyzed spatiotemporally with the permutation test described by Bourgeois and coworkers where applicable.\n44\nStatistical significance is represented here as *:\np\n<\u20090.05,\np\n<\u20090.01**,\np\n<\u20090.001***.\nN\nvalues represent number of animals in each condition, with a maximum of two slices per animal. For physiological experiments (fEPSP and VSD) when multiple brain slices from a single animal were used, data from individual brain slices generated from the same animal were averaged, yielding a single animal value for each given measure. The value generated was used in group analysis and statistics, based on the animal\nn\n. Data in the figures are presented as group means\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM."

A review of each individual's medical records was performed, and cases with other comorbidities were excluded.\n\nNeuropathological evaluation\nParaffin-embedded sections were processed for neuropathological evaluation according to the procedure of the Veterans Affairs-Boston University\u2013Concussion Legacy Foundation (VA-BU-CLF) Bain Bank as previously described.\n32\nThe following stains were applied to the tissue: Luxol fast blue, hematoxylin and eosin, Bielschowsky's silver, p-tau (AT8), \u03b1-synuclein, amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2), TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP)-43, phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43), SMI-31 and SMI-34.\n33\nNeuropathological diagnoses were made blinded by a board-certified neuropathologist.\n\nCTE pathological staging\nCTE classification was based on the four pathological stages described previously.\n32\nIn Stage I, there are isolated perivascular foci of p-tau NFTs, neuropil threads, and astrocytic tangles mostly in the depths of cerebral sulci of the superior, dorsolateral, lateral, and inferior frontal cortices as well as p-tau NFT degeneration in the locus coeruleus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, medulla, and cingulate gyrus. In Stage II multiple foci of tau pathology at the depths of the sulci mostly in the superior, dorsolateral, lateral, and inferior frontal, anterior inferior and lateral temporal, inferior and superior parietal, insular and septal cortices, and substantia innominata were described. Stage III exhibits NFTs diffusely in the frontal, temporal and parietal cortices, mainly around small vessels and within the depths of sulci. The hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, amygdala, nbM, and locus coeruleus show extensive neurofibrillary pathology as well as frequent NFTs in the hypothalamus, substantia nigra, and dorsal and median raphe nuclei. Stage IV shows a significant loss in brain weight and pronounced frontal and temporal lobe atrophy. At the light microscopic level, there is severe spongiosus of cortical layer II and widespread neuronal loss, including the substantia nigra, patchy widespread myelin loss, extensive glial tangles, and small NFTs in a patchy irregular distribution throughout frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices as well as extensive NFT degeneration in the insula, septa, temporal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, substantia nigra, and locus coeruleus. In Stage IV, p-tau pathology also involves the cerebellum, medial lemniscus, and inferior olives of the medulla. CTE stage correlates with the progression of clinical symptoms.\n32\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nAn initial set of paraffin-embedded blocks containing the nbM was cut at 8\u2009\u03bcm, slide mounted, deparaffinized, rehydrated and boiled in a citric acid solution (pH 6) for 5\u2009min, for antigen retrieval.\n4\nAfter several washes in 0.1M Tris-buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.4), sections were incubated with 3% H\n2\nO\n2\nfor 30\u2009min at room temperature to eliminate endogenous peroxidase activity, and blocked with 0.1\u2009M TBS containing 0.04% Triton X-100 and 10% normal goat serum (NGS; Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) for 1\u2009h. Subsequently, sections were incubated in a solution containing polyclonal rabbit antibody directed against the p-tau epitope pS422 (1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific Pierce, Rockford, IL), a marker of pretangles mixed in a 0.1\u2009M TBS/2% normal goat serum solution overnight at room temperature.\n18\n,\n34\nThe next day, sections were washed in TBS and then incubated with the secondary biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA), and processed with avidin-biotin complex reagent (ABC; Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). Tissue was then developed in 0.05% 3\u2019, 3\u2019-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and 0.005% H\n2\nO\n2\nresulting in a brown reaction product. These sections were counter-stained with Cresyl Violet for identification of the nbM neurons. A second set of sections was dual labeled using the abovementioned pS422 tau antibody and a monoclonal antibody directed against p75\nNTR\n(1:500; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), an excellent marker of cholinergic nbM neurons in humans to identify non-tangle-bearing cholinergic neurons at the light microscopic level.\n4\n,\n35\nDual-stained neurons were not evaluated for expression level changes, because of difficulties in consistently identifying these cells with the LCM. All slides were dehydrated in a series of graded concentrations of ethanol, (70, 90, 95, and 100%) but not cover-slipped.\n\nQuantitation of the number of pS422 compared with p75\nNTR\nneurons in the nbM\nCounts of single labeled pS422 nbM neurons were performed within at least two sections using the Nikon Microphot-FXA microscope at 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification and normalized to the total number of p75\nNTR\npositive neurons as previously described.\n4\nResults are presented as percentage of cell counts.\n\nSingle-cell gene expression analysis\nSingle immunolabeled pS422 and p75\nNTR\nnbM neurons (a total of 30 neurons per CTE case pooled/per assay) from CTE Stages II (\nn\n=\u20096), III (\nn\n=\u20095), and IV cases (\nn\n=\u20096) were microaspirated by laser capture microdissection (PALM MicroBeam C IP, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging Inc., Thornwood, NY). The amplification of mRNA was performed with terminal continuation (TC) RNA amplification, which preserves the original quantitative relationships among the transcripts.\n36\u201338\nMicrodissected nbM cells were homogenized in Trizol solution (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and RNAs were reverse transcribed in the presence of the poly d (T) primer (100\u2009ng/mL) and TC primer (100\u2009ng/mL) in 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009first strand buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific), 500\u2009\u03bcM deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP)s, 5\u2009mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 20\u2009U of SuperRNase Inhibitor (ThermoFisher Scientific), and 200\u2009U of reverse transcriptase (ThermoFisher Scientific). Single-stranded complementary DNAs (cDNAs) were digested with RNase H and re-annealed with the primers in a thermal cycler: RNase H digestion step at 37\u00b0C, 30\u2009min; denaturation step at 95\u00b0C, 3\u2009min; and primer reannealing step at 60\u00b0C, 5\u2009min. This step generated cDNAs with double-stranded regions at the primer interface. Samples were then purified by column filtration (Montage PCR filters; Millipore, Billerica, MA). RNAs hybridization probes were synthesized by\nin vitro\ntranscription with the use of\n33\nP incorporation in 40\u2009mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5); 6\u2009mmol/L MgCl2; 10\u2009mmol/L NaCl; 2\u2009mmol/L spermidine; 2.5\u2009mmol/L DTT; 125\u2009\u03bcmol/L adenosine triphosphate (ATP), guanosine triphosphate (GTP), and cytidine triphosphate (CTP); 2.5\u2009\u03bcmol/L cold uridine triphosphate (UTP); 20\u2009U of RNase inhibitor; 2 kU of T7 RNA polymerase (Epicentre, Madison, WI); and 60\u2009\u03bcCi of 33P-UTP (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). The labeling reaction was performed at 37\u00b0C for 4\u2009h. Radiolabeled terminal continuation RNA probes were hybridized to custom-designed microarrays without further purification. Single-cell gene array expression was run in triplicate for each case.\n\nCustom-designed microarray platforms and data analysis\nPlatforms consist of 1\u2009\u03bcg of linearized cDNA purified from plasmid preparations adhered to high-density nitrocellulose (Hybond XL, GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ).\n26\n,\n38\n,\n39\ncDNAs were verified by sequence analysis and restriction digestion. Approximately 576 cDNAs were used on our custom array platform. Arrays were hybridized for 24\u2009h in a solution consisting of 6\u2009\u00d7\u2009saline-sodium phosphate-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009Denhardt's solution, 50% formamide, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and denatured salmon sperm DNA (200\u2009\u03bcg/mL) at 42\u00b0C in a rotisserie oven. Following the hybridization protocol, arrays were washed sequentially in 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009saline sodium citrate (SSC)/0.1% SDS, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009SSC/0.1% SDS, and 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009SSC/0.1% SDS for 15\u2009min each at 37\u00b0C. Arrays were placed in a phosphor screen for 24\u2009h and developed on a phosphor imager (Storm 840, GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ).\nHybridization signal intensity was determined utilizing ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). Briefly, each array was compared with negative control arrays utilizing the respective protocols without any starting RNA. Expression of TC amplified RNA bound to each target minus background was expressed as a ratio of the total hybridization signal intensity of the array (a global normalization approach). Global normalization effectively minimizes variation because of differences in the specific activity of the synthesized probe and the absolute quantity of the probe.\n29\n\nIn situ\nhybridization\nIn situ\nhybridization was performed to validate our single cell expression findings. In situ hybridization was performed on 8\u2009\u03bcm paraffin-embedded nbM sections from Stage II and Stage IV CTE cases following the manufacturer's instructions. Customized probe of CLCN5 (Cat. No. 300031, Accession No NM_001127899.3; Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Newark, CA) was used for\nin situ\nhybridization using the RNAscope 2.5HD Assay-Brown Kit (Cat No. 322300; Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Newark, CA). The probe region covers 1164\u2009bp spanning nucleotides 771\u20131934. Expression of dihydrodipicolinate reductase mRNA from\nBacillus subtilis\nwas used as negative control. Images were obtained using a Nikon Eclipse microscope\n\nStatistical analysis\nDemographic, clinical characteristics and cell counts were evaluated across pathological CTE Stages II, III, and IV using a one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test followed by Holm\u2013Sidak and Dunn's post-hoc test for multiple comparisons as appropriate with statistical significance set at 0.05 (two tailed).\nRelative changes in total hybridization signal intensity and in individual mRNAs were analyzed by one way ANOVA with a Holm\u2013Sidak post\u2013hoc method for multiple comparisons. False discovery rates were also estimated as described previously.\n29\n,\n40\nExpression levels were analyzed and clustered using bioinformatics and graphics software packages (GeneLinker Gold, Improved Outcomes Inc., Kingston, ON). Expression levels of select transcripts were correlated with clinical pathological variables using a Pearson test. The level of statistical significance was set at\np\n<\u20090.05."

Following euthanasia, one group of the subcutaneous continuous infusion dosing paradigm animals were used for mitochondria experiments while the other group was utilized for analysis of \u03b1-spectrin degradation.\nTable\n1.\nSubcutaneous Continuous Infusion Dosing Paradigm\nGroup\nLoading dose (15\u2009min post-injury)\nOsmotic pump (immediate)\nSham\nNone\nNone\nVehicle\nSaline s.c.\nSaline\nCremophor i.p.\nCremphor\nPhenelzine\n10\u2009mg/kg s.c.

Osmotic pumps were placed subcutaneously immediately following impact injury and closure of the craniotomy site. Pumps were removed 72\u2009h later at the time of euthanasia. Loading doses were administered 15\u2009min following impact. Cremophor (saline/650\u2009mg cremophor/32.9% ethanol/mL) was prepared to deliver an equal amount cremophor as received by CsA animals. Saline was prepared to deliver an equal amount of saline as PZ animals.\nPZ, phenelzine (in saline); CsA, cyclosporine A (in saline/650\u2009mg cremophor/32.9% ethanol/mL); s.c., subcutaneous, i.p., intraperitoneal.\nThe third cohort of animals was assigned to the 12\u2009h intermittent PZ dosing paradigm. Animals in the 12\u2009h intermittent PZ dosing paradigm received the following dosing schedule (\nTable 2\n): sham (no impact injury, no drug administration); vehicle (15\u2009min post-injury bolus dose of subcutaneous saline, followed by subcutaneous bolus saline every 12\u2009h up to and including 60\u2009h); PZ (15\u2009min post-injury bolus dose of 10\u2009mg/kg PZ in saline, followed by subcutaneous bolus 5\u2009mg/kg PZ in saline every 12\u2009h up to and including 60\u2009h).\nTable\n2.\nPhenelzine 12\u2009h Intermittent Dosing Paradigm\nGroup\nLoading Dose (15\u2009min post-injury)\nMaintenance dosing: 12\u2009h, 24\u2009h, 36\u2009h, 48\u2009h, 60\u2009h\nSham\nNone\nNone\nVehicle\nSaline s.c.\nSaline s.c.\nPhenelzine\n10\u2009mg/kg s.c.

Maintenance doses were administered every 12\u2009h up to and including 60\u2009h. Animals were euthanized 72\u2009h post-injury. Saline was prepared to deliver an equal amount of saline as PZ animals.\nPZ, phenelzine (in saline); s.c., subcutaneous.\n\nCCI TBI\nAnimals were anesthetized using 4% isoflurane, shaved, and placed into a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf, Tujunga, CA) where isoflurane was maintained at 3% for the duration of the procedure. A midline incision was made to expose the skull, and a 6\u2009mm craniotomy was created lateral to the sagittal suture and midway between lambda and bregma using a Michele Trephine (Miltex, Bethpage, NY). The exposed brain with intact dura received a severe CCI using a computer-controlled pneumatic impact device (TBI 03010; Precision Systems and Instrumentation, Fairfax Station, VA) fitted with a 5\u2009mm beveled tip and set to impact at a depth of 2.2\u2009mm with a 500\u2009msec dwell time and an impact velocity of \u223c3.5\u2009m/sec, as described previously.\n44\nAfter injury, Surgicel (Johnson & Johnson, Arlington, TX) was placed onto the dura and an 8\u2009mm plastic disk was affixed to the skull using tissue adhesive (Gesswein, Bridgeport, CT) to close the craniotomy site, and the incision was closed using wound clips. Sham animals underwent the same procedure but did not receive an impact injury.\n\nLoading dose drug administration\nFifteen minutes following injury, animals assigned to the subcutaneous continuous infusion dosing paradigm, received a loading dose of the appropriate drug. CsA (Perrigo; Minneapolis, MN; 50\u2009mg/mL in saline/650\u2009mg cremophor/32.9% ethanol/mL) was administered intraperitoneal at 20\u2009mg/kg.\n62\n,\n63\nCremophor (CsA vehicle) was administered intraperitoneal to deliver an equivalent volume of saline/cremophor/ethanol. PZ (MP Biochemicals, Solon, OH) was administered subcutaneously at 10\u2009mg/kg in saline.\n29\nSaline (PZ vehicle) was administered subcutaneously to deliver an equivalent volume of saline. Sham animals did not receive injections.\n\nOsmotic pump preparation\nThe day prior to implantation, osmotic pumps (2ML1, Alzet osmotic pumps; Cupertino, CA) were loaded with appropriate drug concentrations and allowed to prime overnight at 37\u00b0C, then maintained at 37\u00b0C until the time of implantation. CsA pumps were loaded to deliver 10\u2009mg/kg/day/3 days of CsA (Perrigo; Minneapolis, MN; 50\u2009mg/mL in saline/650\u2009mg cremophor/32.9% ethanol/mL) based on a previously optimized CsA dosing protocol.\n62\n,\n63\nCremphor pumps (CsA vehicle) were loaded to deliver an equivalent volume of saline/cremophor/ethanol. Phenelzine pumps were loaded to deliver 10\u2009mg/kg/3 days of PZ (MP Biochemicals, Solon, OH) in saline based on an approximate 12\u2009h plasma half-life in humans and a previously optimized 12\u2009h intermittent dosing protocol.\n29\nSaline pumps (PZ vehicle) were loaded to deliver an equivalent amount saline.\n\nImplantation of osmotic pumps\nImmediately following impact injury and closure of the craniotomy site, a sagittal incision was made approximately half-way down the animal's back. Hemostats were used to create a subcutaneous pocket anterior and posterior to the incision site. Pre-loaded osmotic pumps (2ML1, Alzet osmotic pumps, Cupertino, CA) were inserted into the subcutaneous pockets with the flow moderator positioned away from the incision site. The incision was then closed with wound clips, and animals were allowed to recover while body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C using a warm water circulating heating pad. Vehicle animals received a saline pump (PZ's vehicle) and a cremophor pump (CsA's vehicle). PZ animals received a PZ pump and a cremophor pump. CsA animals received a CsA pump and a saline pump. PZ + CsA animals received a PZ pump and a CsA pump. Sham animals did not undergo pump implantation.\n\nPZ 12-h intermittent dosing protocol\nFifteen minutes following injury, PZ animals received 10\u2009mg/kg PZ (MP Biochemicals, Solon, OH) in saline subcutaneously, followed by 5\u2009mg/kg PZ subcutaneously every 12\u2009h up to including 60\u2009h.\n29\nVehicle animals received an equivalent amount of saline at the appropriate time point. Sham animals did not receive injections (\nTable 2\n).\n\nTissue extraction and pump removal\nAnimals were euthanized 72\u2009h following injury, which represents the peak of mitochondrial dysfunction, LP, and \u03b1-spectrin degradation,\n72\nusing CO\n2\n, followed by decapitation. An 8\u2009mm cortical punch centered over the injury was collected in order to collect the epicenter of injury and the penumbral region. Cortical punches were either processed for isolation of mitochondria or cortical protein. Pumps were removed and residual volumes were measured to ensure proper drug delivery. Animals in which pumps did not run properly, as determined by the removed pumps still having most of their drug still in the pumps, were removed from the study.\n\nIsolation of Ficoll-purified cortical mitochondria\nMitochondria were isolated as described previously.\n12\n,\n44\nCortical punch tissue was immediately homogenized in ice-cold isolation buffer (215\u2009mmol/L mannitol, 75\u2009mmol/L sucrose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20\u2009mmol/L HEPES, 1\u2009mmol/L EGTA, pH 7.2) using Potter-Elvejhem homogenizers. Samples were then centrifuged twice at 1300\u2009g for 3\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. Supernatants were additionally centrifuged at 13,000\u2009g for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. The crude mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer, placed into a nitrogen bomb at 1200 psi for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C to release synaptic mitochondria, and then layered onto a discontinuous 7.5% and 10% Ficoll gradient and centrifuged for 100,000\u2009g for 30\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer without EGTA, centrifuged at 10,000\u2009g for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C to remove Ficoll, and then resuspended in isolation buffer without EGTA to a final concentration of \u223c10\u2009mg/kg. Protein concentrations were determined with a BCA protein assay kit (ThermoFisher, Cleveland, OH) and measured at absorbance 562\u2009nm with a BioTek Synergy HT plate reader (Winooski, VT).\n\nMitochondrial bioenergetics analysis\nMitochondrial respiratory function was measured using a Clark-type electrode in a continuously stirred, sealed, and thermostatically controlled chamber maintained at 37\u00b0C (Oxytherm System; Hansatech Instruments, Norfolk, UK). Mitochondria (60\u2009\u03bcg-80\u2009\u03bcg) were placed into the chamber containing 250\u2009\u03bcL of KCl respiration buffer (125\u2009mmol/L KCl, 2\u2009mmol/L MgCl\n2\n, 2.5\u2009mmol/L KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20\u2009mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.2). Following a 1\u2009min equilibration, complex-I respiration was initiated by addition of 5\u2009mmol/L pyruvate and 2.5\u2009mmol/L malate. Two boluses of 150\u2009\u03bcmol/L ADP were added and state III respiration was monitored. The ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin (2\u2009\u03bcmol/L) was added and state IV respiration was monitored. The protonophore FCCP (2\u2009\u03bcmol/L) was added and maximal state V(I) respiration was monitored. Complex-I was inhibited by addition of 100\u2009nmol/L rotenone. Complex-II maximal respiration was initiated by the addition of succinate (10\u2009mmol/L) and state V(II) was monitored. Respiratory rates for individual states were calculated as nmol O\n2\nper mg of protein per min. Respiratory control ratio (RCR) was calculated by dividing state III respiration rate (second bolus of ADP) by state IV respiration rate.\n12\n,\n75\nFollowing bioenergetics analysis, remaining mitochondrial protein was immediately frozen at \u221280\u00b0C for use in Western blot.\n\nWestern blot analysis: cortical \u03b1-spectrin degradation and lipid peroxidation-induced cortical mitochondrial oxidative damage\nCortical punch tissue collected from the cohorts of animals designated for analysis of \u03b1-spectrin degradation was immediately placed into ice-cold Triton-lysis buffer (1% Triton, 20\u2009mmol/L Tris-HCl, 150\u2009mmol/L NaCl, 5\u2009mmol/L EGTA, 10\u2009mmol/L EDTA, 20\u2009mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (Complete Mini\u2122 Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tablet, Roche). Similarly, mitochondria protein being stored at \u221280\u00b0C following bioenergetics analysis was thawed and resuspended in lysis buffer. All samples were sonicated, vortexed, and then centrifuged at 14,000\u2009rpm for 30\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. Protein concentrations were determined with a BCA protein assay kit (ThermoFisher, Cleveland, OH) and measured at absorbance 562\u2009nm with a BioTek Synergy HT plate reader (Winooski, VT). Due to the limited yield of mitochondrial protein following Ficoll-purified isolation, bioenergetics analysis and processing for Western blot, only samples containing greater than 100\u2009\u03bcg of protein, allowing for analysis of both 4-HNE and acrolein, were utilized for Western blot. For analysis of \u03b1-spectrin, 10\u2009\u03bcg of protein was run on a 3\u20138% Tris-Acetate Criterion\u2122 XT polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with XT Tricine Running Buffer (Bio-Rad). For analysis of 4-HNE or acrolein, 50\u2009\u03bcg of protein was run on a 4\u201312% Tris-Acetate Criterion\u2122 XT polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) with MOPS buffer (Bio-Rad). Following separation of proteins by polyacrylamide gel, protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a semi-dry electro-transferring unit for 15\u2009min (\u03b1-spectrin) or 1\u2009h (4-HNE, acrolein) at 15V. Following transfer, membranes were blocked at room temperature for 1\u2009h in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 5% milk. Membranes were incubated with the following primary antibodies in TBS with Tween (TBST) containing 5% milk overnight at 4\u00b0C: mouse monoclonal anti-\u03b1II-spectrin (Enzo, Farmingdale, NY, 1:5,000), rabbit polyclonal anti-\u03b2-tubulin (Abcam, Cambridge, CA, 1:5000-1:10,000), rabbit polyclonal anti-4HNE (Alpha Diagnostics, San Antonio, TX; 1:1000), rabbit polyclonal anti-acrolein (Abcam, Cambridge, CA, 1:2000), and rabbit polyclonal anti-VDAC (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, 1:30,000). Membranes were washed in TBST following incubation with primary antibody.\nMembranes were incubated with the following secondary antibodies in TBST with 5% milk for 1\u2009h at room temperature: goat anti-rabbit IgG IRdye800CW (Rockland, Limerick, PA, 1:5000), goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 680 (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA1:10,000), and goat anti-mouse IgG IRDye800CW (Rockland, Limerick, PA, 1:5000) Membranes were washed in TBST, and then imaged and quantified using the Li-Cor Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). For analysis of \u03b1-spectrin degradation, \u03b1-spectrin breakdown products were normalized to tubulin. For analysis of mitochondrial protein, 4-HNE and acrolein were normalized to VDAC. A protein loading control was loaded onto each gel to control for inter-gel variability. For \u03b1-spectrin, bands at 145\u2009kD and 150\u2009kD were analyzed. Due to broad binding of 4-HNE and acrolein to lysine, histidine, arginine, cysteine protein residues, as well as differential banding patterns between 4-HNE and acrolein,\n72\nmitochondrial 4-HNE was analyzed between 80\u2009kD-150\u2009kD and mitochondrial acrolein was analyzed between 60\u2009kD-100\u2009kD.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was conducted using Prism version 7.0 (Graph Pad, San Diego, CA). Results are reported as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation. Analysis was done by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK)\npost hoc\nanalysis when appropriate. A\np\nvalue <0.05 was considered significant. Grubb's test was used to remove statistical outliers."

    "Methods": "Participants\nPatients between 12 and 18 years old were consecutively recruited from either the University of New Mexico Hospital Emergency Department (UNMH;\nn\n=\u200942) or The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Minds Matter Concussion Program (CHOP;\nn\n=\u200942). All patients were seen during the acute to semiacute injury phase of pmTBI (within 28 days of injury). As expected based on the different types of medical care for concussion, patients were seen at longer post-injury intervals in the concussion clinic. Forty-one age-, education-, and sex-matched children served as HC, mostly obtained at the New Mexico site. Two patients (one UNMH and one CHOP) and one HC were extreme outliers on two or more tests (three times the interquartile range) and were excluded from further analyses. One UNMH patient had a high level of pre-examination symptoms with no symptoms following neurosensory testing, and was therefore also excluded. The final cohort consisted of 40 UNMH pmTBI patients (15 females; age, 15.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0; 6.6\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4 days post-injury), 41 CHOP pmTBI patients (18 females; age, 14.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6; 11.3\u2009\u00b1\u20097.4 days post-injury), and 40 HC (14 females; age, 14.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9). Informed consent was obtained from participants according to each institution's guidelines.\nAll pmTBI experienced a brain injury associated with the onset of new symptoms. Loss of consciousness (if present) was <30\u2009min, and post-traumatic amnesia (if present) was limited to 24\u2009h. Exclusion criteria for both UNMH and CHOP participants included a positive history of neurological disease, major psychiatric disturbance (i.e., anything other than adjustment disorder), autistic spectrum disorders, prior closed head injuries with >5\u2009min of loss of consciousness, active litigation, substance abuse, or alcohol abuse. HC were excluded for all of the mentioned criteria, as well as for a history of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or learning disorder.\n\nNeurosensory examination\nThe examination focused on vestibulo-ocular, ocular motor, vestibulospinal, and visual deficits. Selected tests were derived from a number of different sources or newly devised (see\nSupplementary Text and Fig. S1\n; see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). A measure of symptom validity/effort is highly recommended,\n27\nbut does not currently exist for standardized neurosensory tests. All participants, therefore, performed a vigorous dorsiflexion of both feet for \u223c20\u2009sec (the double dorsiflexion foot stretch [DDFS]), as this was deemed to be nonspecific to the vestibulo-ocular, ocular motor, visual, or vestibulospinal systems and did not require substantial physical exertion. To avoid bias, the DDFS was always administered first, prior to any other neurosensory examination.\nThe majority of neurosensory tests (i.e., smooth pursuits, horizontal and vertical saccades, horizontal and vertical vestibulo-ocular reflex, visual motion sensitivity) were derived directly from The Vestibular/Ocular Motor Screening (VOMS),\n12\nwith no alterations to the instructions. Per guidelines, a metronome (see\nSupplementary Materials\nfor rates) was used to assist the participants in guiding the tempo of movements. The VOMS measurement of NPC (measured to 0.5\u2009cm across three trials) was replaced with a more standardized procedure used in clinical trials for convergence insufficiency that uses the Astron Accommodative Rule (Gulden Ophthalmics, Elkins Park, PA) with a standard single 20/30 card as the visual target.\n28\n,\n29\nA total of three trials were conducted, and each trial was halted when the participant reported a doubling of the stimuli or when the experimenter noticed binocular loss of convergence. Monocular accommodation was acquired over a single trial for each eye, using the exact same visual stimulus as convergence. The King\u2013Devick test was used to further quantify saccadic eye movements,\n30\n,\n31\nwith total number of errors and completion time recorded. Finally, a tandem gait task assessed balance, with participants taking 10 steps forwards and backwards with eyes open and closed (five steps each).\nAll participants were required to rate the degree to which they experienced four symptoms (headache, dizziness, nausea, and fogginess)\n12\non an 11 point Likert scale prior to the start of the neurosensory examination (i.e., pre-examination symptoms) and immediately following each task listed (i.e., symptom provocation). The primary outcome measures were the total self-reported symptom burden prior to neurosensory testing (i.e., sum of all pre-examination symptoms) and the total burden of symptom provocation reported after performing the neurosensory tests (i.e., sum of\npositive\ndifferences or increased symptoms across each individual test relative to pre-examination levels). The latter variable excluded the score from the nonspecific symptom provocation measure (DDFS) in the calculations. Secondary analyses examined symptom variation (i.e., sum of differences in symptoms for each individual test relative to pre-examination levels).\n\nStatistical analyses\nOne way group (UNMH vs. CHOP vs. HC) ANOVAs evaluated hypotheses regarding symptom provocation (primary) or total symptom change (secondary) using rank-transformed data caused by non-normality. A Fisher's exact test examined whether the number of participants exhibiting nonspecific symptom provocation (DDFS) differed across the three groups. ANOVAs or multivariate ANOVAs (MANOVAs) were performed on all quantifiable measures (e.g., distances, errors) to assess for group differences using log-based (e.g., skewed data) or rank (error data) transformations as appropriate. Binary logistic regression examined whether symptom provocation was more sensitive and specific for classifying patients from controls relative to pre-examination symptom report. Any simple effects tests were corrected for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni correction) and only significant findings are reported. Statistical tests were conducted on transformed data whereas actual data (i.e., nontransformed) are presented in figures."

    "Methods": "Participants and recruitment\nAll varsity athletes at a single Division I university who sustained one or more concussions during their collegiate athletic careers between January 2011 and December 2016 were recruited for this study via email to provide electronic consent for review of their student treatment record. Diagnosis of concussion was made by a team physician according to the criteria put forth by the International Conference on Concussion in Sport (3rd and 4th).\n1\n,\n32\nOf the 238 individuals who sustained a concussion during this period, 121 provided consent, 6 actively declined consent, and 111 did not respond. Records were reviewed for compliance with the following inclusion criteria: no history of a neurological disorder (e.g., epilepsy) other than migraines; no psychiatric disorder other than anxiety and depression; specific dates of injury and clearance to return to full contact participation; recovery period uninterrupted by an extended school holiday break such as spring break, winter holidays, or summer; and having been assessed in the clinic within 3 days of injury (although within 24\u2009h is standard practice and was true for the majority of cases). Of the 121 cases, 92 met inclusion criteria. Two additional cases were excluded because recovery from concussion was complicated by a simultaneous illness (i.e., viral illness and a sinus infection); clinician notes indicated ambiguity regarding whether persisting symptoms (e.g., headaches, fatigue, nausea) were caused by post-concussive effects or the unrelated illness. Approval for this study was granted from the Northwestern University's Institutional Review Board.\n\nProcedure\nAthletes' electronic treatment records were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic and medical history information, including history of concussion prior to college, was abstracted from the health documentation completed by medical staff upon a student's entrance to the university. Records were reviewed for concussions sustained during the athlete's collegiate athletic career. If an athlete sustained multiple concussions during his or her collegiate career, data from the first injury only were included in this study. In eight cases, the athlete's first injury did not meet study criteria (e.g., recovery was interrupted by a school break or there was missing recovery information), so data from the athlete's second concussion were used for this study.\nDetermining sex and HC-group classification\nSex was determined based on sex assigned at birth recorded in health documents completed upon entrance to the university. Females were divided into hormonal contraception users (HC) and non-hormonal contraception users (non-HC) based on (1) the medications recorded at the time of injury, which was individually confirmed and recorded by the treating clinician in the injury notes, and (2) review of the female health questionnaire completed prior to each academic year. Women taking OCP (\nn\n=\u200923) or using the NuvaRing (\nn\n=\u20091), which releases similar hormone levels as OCP into the bloodstream, were assigned to the HC group. Women not using oral contraceptive pills, NuvaRing, or any other hormonal contraception method (\nn\n=\u200925) were assigned to the non-HC group. The single female in this study using an intrauterine device (IUD) (Mirena\n\u00ae\n) was excluded from HC vs. non-HC analyses because of the unique nature of the Mirena IUD. The Mirena IUD releases hormones that primarily remain concentrated in the uterus. However, a minimal amount of hormones, relative to OCP-users, circulates through the bloodstream.\n33\nBecause of the variation in plasma hormone levels in Mirena IUD users compared with OCP/NuvaRing users, the Mirena IUD user was excluded from the HC vs. non-HC analyses, but was included in the male vs. female analyses.\nConcussion outcomes\nPrimary concussion outcome variables were abstracted from the athlete's clinic notes, which are composed of assessments completed by team physicians and athletic trainers. Per the university's athletics' recommended protocol, athletes completed the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool, 2nd ed. (SCAT-2\n32\n) or 3rd ed. (SCAT-3\n1\n) with an athletic trainer immediately after the concussion was suspected or reported. The SCAT-2 and \u22123 contain an identical symptom rating scale, composed of 22 total symptoms rated on a seven point Likert scale of severity from 0 (none) to 6 (severe). Therefore, the symptom evaluation yields two scores: (1) total symptom number (range: 0\u201322), and 2) symptom severity score (range: 0\u2013132). In accordance with university recommendations, athletes diagnosed with concussion completed a symptom inventory at least every 24\u2009h following the suspicion or reporting of a concussion until clearance for full return to play. The athlete's peak symptom severity score was used in analyses as the indicator of peak symptom burden. For all athletes in this study, the peak symptom burden ratings occurred within 5 days of injury.\nThe university's athletic protocol requires concussed athletes to refrain from all physical activity, including athletic participation, until symptoms have returned to baseline levels for at least 24\u2009h. At this time, athletes begin the return-to-play protocol, which, at the time of study, consisted of gradual, stepwise increase in physical exertion, starting with light aerobic activity (e.g., stationary biking) and progressing to noncontact athletic participation. After progressing to noncontact participation, athletes complete computerized cognitive testing (Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Test [ImPACT\n\u00ae\n]) and are evaluated by an external independent neurology consultant. The team physician then makes final clearance for full-contact athletic participation. The return to play protocol takes a minimum of 5 days. LOR was calculated by subtracting the number of days between final clearance by the team physician and the date of injury. The physician clearance date was used instead of the symptom resolution date, because some athletes experience a return of symptoms once they begin the gradual return to play protocol, indicating that the injury has likely not resolved.\n\nStatistical analyses\nDescriptive analyses were conducted to evaluate group differences in demographic and injury characteristics (males vs. females and HC vs. non-HC females); one way analyses of variance (ANOVA) was used for continuous data and \u03c7\n2\ntests were used for categorical data (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05). Because of non-normal distributions, LOR and peak symptom severity were log-transformed for main hypotheses testing.\nTo evaluate sex differences in symptom burden and LOR, we conducted a regression analysis predicting LOR by sex and the sex-by-symptom severity interaction. To evaluate the effect of hormonal contraception on symptom severity and LOR outcomes in female athletes, we conducted two separate ANOVA tests evaluating group differences on LOR and symptom severity. Post-hoc testing was conducted based on main omnibus test results. Effect sizes were calculated using Cohen's\nd\nformula\n34\non non-log transformed values."

    "Methods": "Participants\nThe present study was based on a prospective longitudinal pre- to post-season study design that initially recruited a total of 75 female athletes from two local high school soccer teams, 72 of which consented for participation and were enrolled. Fifteen athletes were unable to complete imaging because of metal orthodontics, resulting in 57 participants for imaging collection, which were divided into either a non-collar group (\nn\n=\u200925) or a group that wore a neck collar device (\nn\n=\u200932) for the entirety of the soccer season. The entire team of one school (school A) was assigned to the non-collar group, whereas the majority of another school's team (school B) was assigned to the collar group. In order to balance the two groups' sizes, the last seven athletes recruited from school B were divided among the two groups, resulting in four of the seven athletes from school B being assigned to the non-collar group and three of the seven athletes being assigned to the collar group. All 25 participants in the non-collar group completed pre-season MRI. Among these 25 participants, three participants (all from school A) were lost for the following reasons: quitting the team (1), dropping out because of injury (1), and experiencing an early season-ending anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury (1). One additional participant from the non-collar group (from school B) was excluded because of the excessive error rate (40%) during the N-Back task performance. These four athletes were excluded from data analysis. All 32 participants assigned to the collar group completed MRI at pre-season. Among these, five participants were lost for the following reasons: being cut from the team (4) and not completing the post-season testing (1). Therefore, a total of 48 high school female athletes, with 21 in the non-collar group and 27 in the collar group, were included in the final analysis. Among these athletes, two from the non-collar group and four from the collar group reported a history of concussion within 5 years prior to the current soccer season.\n\nImpact surveillance and quantification\nEach participant was provided with an X-Patch sensor (X2 Biosystems; Seattle, WA).\n27\nThe X-Patch is a small and durable device attached by an adhesive patch to the mastoid (behind the ear) that tracks impacts and stores data until it can be uploaded to a PC. It is composed of a triaxial accelerometer and gyroscope, which measures three axes of linear acceleration and three axes of angular velocity, respectively, to calculate forces imparted to the head and, thus, head impact magnitude. Members of the research staff applied the X-Patch to each participant immediately preceding a practice or game and removed it afterward, and each sensor's recorded data were uploaded to a PC after each exposure. Head impacts were recorded for all games and practices during the soccer season.\n\nN-Back working memory fMRI paradigm and task performance\nAll participants performed a verbal working memory N-Back task at both the pre- and post-season fMRI sessions. The N-Back task was conducted for 0-Back and 2-Back conditions. The details of the fMRI experimental paradigm have been described elsewhere.\n7\nBriefly, the fMRI paradigm used in the present study consisted of five cycles of fixation (12\u2009sec), 0-Back (26\u2009sec), and 2-Back (26\u2009sec) periods. During the 0-Back period, a series of letters, including A, B, C, D, and O, were presented successively in a random order. Participants were instructed to press a handheld button when the letter \u201cO\u201d was presented. During the 2-Back task period, a series of letters, including A, B, C, and D, were presented successively in a random order. Participants were instructed to press a button when a letter shown was the same as the letter that had been presented two trials back. For both the 0-Back and the 2-Back conditions, 80 trials were included (16 per period). Number of targets was 20 for the 0-Back condition and 21 for the 2-Back condition. The stream of stimulus was generated in a random order for the study but remained constant across participants.\nN-Back task performance outcome variables included accuracy and response time at both pre- and post-season fMRI sessions.\n1.\u2002Accuracy was calculated based on Donaldson's nonparametric discrimination score A\u2019\n28\nfor both the 0-Back task and the 2-Back task responses. The formula for calculating A\u2019 is as follows:\nThe score ranges from 0.5 to 1, with a value closer to 1 indicating better accuracy.\n2.\u2002Response time was calculated as the time between the beginning of letter display and the time when the button was pressed, for both the 0-Back and 2-Back tasks. Only the trials with correct responses were included for calculating this variable.\n\nDescription of the neck collar\nParticipants in the collar group wore a neck collar device that applied mild jugular vein compression with the aim of ameliorating potential slosh injury.\n29\nThe collar device was made of an outer collar that consisted of a thermoplastic elastomer (durometer 80 Shore A), an inner collar that consisted of thermoplastic elastomer (durometer 50 Shore A), and a stainless memory steel composite insert. The collar size was determined individually based on neck circumference and the visual evidence of ultrasound internal jugular vein (IJV) dilation. At the initial fitting of the collar, a registered vascular technologist (J.A.) utilized ultrasound to ensure that the proper collar and IJV responses (e.g., visual evidence of IJV dilation superior to collar) occurred as prescribed. Through the support of daily onsite staffing and tracking, the collar group had a compliance rate of 100% through the course of the soccer season for all games and practices.\n\nMRI image acquisition\nMR images were all acquired on a 3T Phillips Ingenia scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands) with a 32 channel, phase array head coil. A single shot EPI sequence was used for fMRI data acquisition with the following specifications: repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE)\u2009=\u20092000/35\u2009msec; flip angle\u2009=\u200990 degrees; 160 dynamic scans; field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u2009240\u2009\u00d7\u2009240\u2009mm; image acquisition and reconstruction matrix\u2009=\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200964; 38 axial slices; resolution\u2009=\u20093.75\u2009\u00d7\u20093.75\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009mm. A magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) sequence was used to acquire high resolution three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted images (sagittal): TR/TE\u2009=\u20098.1/3.7\u2009msec; FOV\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256\u2009mm; matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256; in-plane resolution\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm; slice thickness\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm; number of slices\u2009=\u2009180. MRI data using additional sequences, including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting state fMRI, and task-based lower extremity motor fMRI, were also acquired. The findings based on these additional sequences will be reported separately.\n\nImage data processing and analysis\nAnalysis of fMRI working memory data was performed using the FMRIB Software Library (FSL) (\nwww.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl\n) and Analysis of Functional Neuroimages (AFNI) software packages. The first level fMRI data processing pipeline included reorientation, brain extraction, slice timing correction, alignment, outlying frame identification, and normalization to Montr\u00e9al Neurological Institute (MNI) 152 template. Motion artifacts in fMRI data were regressed out of using a 24 parameter motion model along with an additional parameter for each outlying volume.\n30\nThe residuals from the motion regression were then bandpass filtered from 0.01 to 0.1\u2009Hz and smoothed with a 6\u2009mm (full width at half maximum [FWHM]) Gaussian filter using AFNI's\n3dBandpass\n. FLS's mixed effect model (FMRIB's Local Analysis of Mixed Effects [FLAME]) was used to generate the 2-Back versus 0-Back contrasts based on the timing of the N-Back paradigm.\nThe second level analysis included generating the group activation map for the N-back task, testing the pre- to post-season change in the brain activation, and testing the group difference of the longitudinal change, as well as correlation analysis with working memory performance and head impact exposure. The group activation map for the 2-Back versus 0-Back contrast across all 48 participants at pre-season was calculated using FSL's FLAME mixed effect model (model 1) based on the contrast and variance images from individual subjects. The threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) was used with 5000 permutations to account for the potential type I error resulting from the multiple comparisons in the voxelwise data analysis.\n31\nThe within-group longitudinal fMRI changes between pre- and post-season sessions and the group difference of this longitudinal change were also processed and analyzed in FSL using FLAME with multiple comparisons corrected (TFCE with 5000 permutation). As time of day may potentially affect BOLD response in fMRI, we compared the time when N-Back fMRI started during the day between the two groups. No significant group difference in time of day was found at either pre-season or post-season (\np\n>\u20090.05, two tailed two sample\nt\ntest). There was no systemic bias as to whether the post-season scan was done earlier or later in the day than the pre-season scan in either of the two study groups (\np\n>\u20090.05, two tailed paired\nt\ntest). In addition, we also examined head motion data to rule out their potential confounding effect on the findings. The x, y, z rotation and translation parameters (in radian and mm, respectively) derived from the frame-by-frame realignment, as well as the root mean square motion and frame-wise displacement (both measured at a 50\u2009mm radius), were first compared between the two groups at both pre- and post-season time points and then tested longitudinally for pre- to post-season difference. No statistically significant findings were identified in any of these comparisons (all\np\n>\u20090.05, two tailed, two sample\nt\ntest in cross-sectional comparisons between groups; paired\nt\ntest in longitudinal comparisons between time points). Detailed statistical results from these comparisons can be found in\nTables S1\u2013S3\n(see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). Several additional variables, including age, the time intervals between the pre- to post-season scanning and between the last head impact and post-season, as well as the head impact exposure variables at different g force thresholds, were also individually tested as covariates for potential confounding effects in the analysis of group differences of longitudinal activation change. As none of these variables showed significant effects during the initial test, they were not included in the final statistical analysis.\nIn the correlation analysis, we first calculated the difference in the pre- and post-season Z maps from the brain areas that presented significant longitudinal within-group difference in fMRI brain activations. The Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas was used to parcellate brain regions with significant longitudinal change into individual anatomical regions. The pre- to post-season difference in Z-statistics was extracted from these individual segments and used for correlation with change in task performance and exposure to head impacts based on Pearson correlation analysis."

Only those who underwent early 1.5T MRI assessment using a standardized clinical research MRI protocol\n1\nwere included. From October 2004 to October 2013 a total of 396 patients (7\u201370 years old) with moderate and severe TBI were admitted, of which 222 patients underwent MRI within five weeks post-injury and were considered for inclusion in the present study.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nFlowchart of the 158 included patients. TBI, traumatic brain injury; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; GCS, Glasgow Coma Scale.\nExclusion criteria were: (1) age younger than 7 years, to ensure reliable GCS scoring; (2) age older than 70 years because of the higher prevalence of nonspecific white matter lesions in the elderly population\n23\n; (3) evacuation of mass lesion (\nn\n=\u200949, Marshall CT score 5) or nonevacuated mass lesions >25\u2009mL (\nn\n=\u20095, Marshall CT score 6)\u2014to reduce the influence of increased ICP on GCS scores; (4) 3T MRI examination (\nn\n=\u20095); or (5) missing GCS score (\nn\n=\u20095). This left 158 patients eligible for analyses. All patients were included prospectively in the Trondheim TBI Studies, and the methodology for the collection of demographic and injury-related variables is described in previous publications.\n1\n,\n21\n\nGCS score\nFor intubated patients, the pre-intubation GCS score was used, while for the other patients, the admission GCS score at Trondheim University Hospital was used. All GCS scores were collected in nonsedated patients. The GCS scores were collected at the scene of injury by anesthesiologists (\nn\n=\u200973), at the primary hospital by consultants/residents in general surgery (\nn\n=\u200918), or on admission at Trondheim University Hospital by consultants/residents in neurosurgery or neurology (\nn\n=\u200967). The GCS score at either the primary hospital or at the university hospital was assessed at median 60\u2009min post-injury (interquartile range [IQR] 30\u201390, 7% after 5\u2009h [unknown time of injury\nn\n=\u200910, missing\nn\n=\u20094]). If the GCS score of the patient rose significantly during the first few hours and stabilized, as a sign of alcohol intoxication, the highest GCS score was used (\nn\n=\u20095). The eye component of the GCS score was also registered (missing\nn\n=\u20098).\n\nOther injury variables, blood alcohol concentration, and outcome\nInjury Severity Score (ISS) was estimated, and pupillary dilatation, secondary events such as pre-hospital or admission hypoxia and hypotension were registered. This was performed at any time point before or at admission\u2014hence, not necessarily at the same time as the GCS score assessment. Because blood alcohol concentration (BAC) may influence the GCS score,\n24\nBAC was analyzed and a cutoff value of >100\u2009mg/dL for intoxication was chosen in the comparison between included and nonincluded patients.\n25\nA radiologist or resident in neurosurgery/radiology in collaboration with three neuroradiologists reviewed all the admission CT scans (first CT). Compressed or absent basal cisterns were described to evaluate signs of increased ICP and the Marshall- and Rotterdam CT scores were used.\n26\n,\n27\nA.M.F (radiologist) reviewed the first and worst CT scans for any uni- or bilateral lesions in the thalamus, brainstem, and basal ganglia for all patients with such TAI lesions on MRI. In addition, 10 patients without TAI lesions in these subcortical structures on MRI were both randomly chosen and added to the mix of images. Worst CT was defined as the CT scan (first CT or follow-up CT) that yielded the worst Marshall CT score. Marshall 5 and 6 were regarded equally as the worst score.\nThe radiologist was blinded to the MRI findings and their distribution among the patients as well as to all other information except for age and date of CT. Head injury-related global outcome was assessed 12 months post-injury by the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE).\n8\n,\n28\n\nMRI\nThe MRI examinations were performed either at St. Olavs Hospital or at one of its referral hospitals. The 1.5 Tesla scanners (Siemens symphony or Siemens Avanto; Siemens Medical, Erlangen Germany) with a six-channel head coil were used. The previously described\n1\nclinical TBI MRI protocol consisted of sagittal turbo spin echo (TSE) T2 imaging, sagittal, transverse T2* weighted gradient echo imaging (GRE), coronal and transverse T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging, and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI).\n\nImage reading\nFor 138 of the patients, K.G.M. (resident in radiology), K.A.K, J.R., and M.F, (all experienced consultant neuroradiologists) read the MRIs in accordance with pre-defined variables.\n21\nAll were blinded to patient identification, clinical information, and time of examination. For the last 20 patients J.X. (resident in radiology) characterized the image findings in collaboration with K.G.M, K.A.K., and M.F., using the same procedures. Interrater analysis for classification of TAI grade was performed in an earlier study (weighted Cohen \u03ba 0,74, 95% CI 0.69\u20130.80).\n21\nThe TAI lesions were described according to their location\u2014as lesions in hemispheric white matter, corpus callosum, thalamus, basal ganglia, and brainstem (\nFig. 2\n). Lesions in the thalamus, basal ganglia and brainstem were classified as uni- or bilateral. The presence of lesions in the different imaging sequences\u2014i.e., T2*GRE, FLAIR, and DWI\u2014were recorded. Periventricular signal hyperintensities (\u201ccaps and bands\u201d) that were considered part of the normal aging were not registered as TAI,\n29\nnor were other nonspecific white matter hyperintensities,\n23\n,\n30\nor traumatic lesions acquired during a surgical procedure (e.g., from insertion of intracranial pressure devices). Superficial lesions in the cortex were defined as contusions.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nMagnetic resonance imaging of patients with traumatic axonal injury (TAI) lesions: (\nA\n) T2* gradient echo image showing multiple bilateral lesions in the thalamus (unbroken arrows) and basal ganglia (broken arrows). (\nB\n) Fluid attenuated inversion recovery image showing multiple TAI lesions (arrow shows TAI lesion in the right thalamus).\n\nStatistical analyses\nPatient- and injury characteristics are presented as percentages, mean and median with IQR (25th to 75th percentile). Mann Whitney\nU\ntest was used for comparisons of medians between groups (GCS score and other variables without normal distribution). Spearman rho was used to assess correlation between the eye component of the GCS score and the total GCS score, and Fisher exact test was used for comparison of proportions. Cohen \u03ba (ranging from 0 to 1, where 1 is perfect agreement) was used to assess the agreement between MR and CT findings in the thalamus, basal ganglia, and brainstem. Ordinal univariable regression analyses with inverted GCS score as the dependent variable were performed to assess its association with TAI lesions in different locations, where no visible lesion in the location in question was coded as the reference category. Rotterdam CT score was analyzed as a scalar variable.\nWe chose not to perform multivariable analyses because we consider this to be an explorative study. Adjustment for other injury variables in the acute phase may also be challenging when studying association to GCS score. Also, because TAI lesions in different locations are highly correlated, lesion locations were analyzed separately to avoid multicollinearity. All analyses were performed with the IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Statistics V.21 or STATA/IC V.13.1. Threshold for significance was\np\n<\u20090.05, two-tailed.\n\nEthics\nThe Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics approved the study, and written consent was obtained from the patients or, when incapacitated, from their next of kin."

    "Methods": "VX-210 is under investigation as a potential therapy for acute cervical SCI in the phase 2b/3SPinal Cord InjuryRhoINhibition InvestiGation (SPRING) trial. This article presents the design of the SPRING trial.\n\nSPRING is a multicenter, phase 2b/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of VX-210 (NCT02669849), which is currently enrolling patients with acute traumatic cervical SCI (Fig. 3).35Approximately 100 patients will be enrolled at about 45 sites in the United States and Canada (Table 1). The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of VX-210 treatment. The primary endpoint, change from baseline in upper extremity motor score (UEMS) at 6 months, has been selected as a measure of clinically meaningful neurological improvement. Given that each of the muscles evaluated in the UEMS assessment is critical for daily function, small increases in UEMS can correspond to clinically meaningful improvements in functional recovery. Total motor score is not appropriate because 1) it assesses contraction strength of 10 key muscles in the upper and lower extremities on each side of the body and does not evaluate muscle groups by the potential for function or the functional value of an increase in score, and 2) the mechanism of action and target engagement would dictate a primary assessment focused on regeneration and sprouting local to the injury site. Secondary endpoints include examination of the effects of VX-210 on functional recovery by both question- and task-based assessments, change in AIS grade, and change in motor level.\n\nInclusion/exclusion criteria\nKey inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study are summarized in\nTable 2\n. Eligible patients are between 14 and 75 years of age and have an acute traumatic cervical SCI. Patients must have an AIS grade of A or B; a motor level of C4, C5, C6, or C7 on each side as determined by a formal International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) examination; and a screening UEMS of \u226416 points on each side (maximum total 32/50).

Patients must be scheduled to undergo spinal decompression/stabilization surgery commencing within 72\u2009h after the initial injury, and computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results must be consistent with the patient's neurological deficit. The subset of patients with C7 SCI added by protocol amendment was included to expand the range of eligible patients for the SPRING trial without compromising the primary analysis of change in UEMS.\nTable\n2.\nEligibility Criteria: Phase 2b/3 SPRING Trial\nKey inclusion criteria\nKey exclusion criteria\nPatient characteristics\n\u2022\u200214\u201375 years, inclusive\n\u2022\u2002Body mass index \u226540\u2009kg/m\n2\n\u2022\u2002Breastfeeding or pregnancy\nInjury\n\u2022\u2002Acute traumatic cervical SCI\n\u2022\u2002Acute SCI from gunshot or penetrating/stab wound; nontraumatic SCI; brachial plexus injury; complete spinal cord transection; or multi-focal SCI\nNeurological impairment\n\u2022\u2002Motor level of C4, C5, C6, or C7 on each side\n\u2013 Screening UEMS score must be \u226416 points on each side.\n\u2013 Patients with AIS grade A and a C4 motor level on both sides must have at least 1 point of motor activity between C5 and T1 on at least 1 side.\n\u2013 Patients with AIS grade B and a C4 motor level on both sides must have at least 1 point of motor activity between C5 and C7 on at least 1 side.\n\u2022\u2002AIS grade A or B\n\u2022\u2002\u22651 upper extremity muscle group untestable during screening ISNCSCI examination\n\u2022\u2002Unconsciousness or other mental impairment that precludes reliable ISNCSCI examination\nDecompression/stabilization\n\u2022\u2002Scheduled and planned to undergo spinal cord decompression/stabilization surgery commencing within 72\u2009h post-injury\n\u2022\u2002Inability to undergo decompression/stabilization surgery commencing within 72\u2009h post-injury\nOther\n\u2022\u2002CT or MRI consistent with neurological deficit\n\u2022\u2002Participation in any other clinical study for acute SCI without approval by the sponsor\n\u2022\u2002Known immunodeficiency, including HIV or use of immunosuppressive or cancer chemotherapeutic drugs\n\u2022\u2002History of an adverse reaction to a fibrin sealant or its components\n\u2022\u2002Any significant medical or psychiatric comorbidities that would significantly increase the risk of study enrollment or significantly interfere with study outcomes or assessments, as judged by the investigator\nOpen in a separate window\nAIS, American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale; CT, computed tomography; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; ISNCSCI, International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; SCI, spinal cord injury; UEMS, upper extremity motor score.\nExclusion criteria include body mass index \u226540\u2009kg/m\n2\n; acute SCI from a penetrating gunshot or stab wound, nontraumatic SCI, brachial plexus injury, complete spinal cord transection, or multifocal SCI; \u22651 upper extremity muscle group untestable during screening ISNCSCI examination; unconsciousness or mental impairment that precludes reliable screening ISNCSCI examination; inability to undergo decompression/stabilization surgery commencing within 72\u2009h post-injury; known immunodeficiency, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or the use of immunosuppressive or cancer chemotherapeutic drugs; breastfeeding or pregnancy; history of an adverse reaction to a fibrin sealant or its components; any significant medical or psychiatric comorbidities (e.g., neurological, cardiac, respiratory, hepatic, renal, bleeding/coagulation disorder, and active malignancy) that would significantly increase the risk of trial enrollment and/or significantly interfere with trial outcomes or assessments, as judged by the investigator; or participation in any other clinical study for acute SCI without approval by the study sponsor.\n\nStudy design\nIn this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, each patient receives either a single 9-mg dose of VX-210 in fibrin sealant or a placebo (buffer solution) in fibrin sealant. The one-time treatment or placebo is administered by a surgeon directly onto the dura mater of the spinal cord at the site of injury during spinal cord decompression and internal stabilization surgery (\nFig. 2\n). Patients are randomized to the 9-mg or placebo groups at a 1:1 ratio using an interactive Web or voice response system, with stratification by age (<30 vs. \u226530 years) and AIS grade (A vs. B with sacral pinprick preservation vs. B without sacral pinprick preservation). VX-210 and placebo are supplied in 2.0-mL glass vials, and the blinded study drug labeling complies with applicable local and national regulations. Each clinical site is provided with formulation preparation instructions and surgical guidelines to promote standardization of VX-210/placebo preparation and administration processes. All clinical site personnel are blinded throughout the study; unblinding of an individual patient's treatment by the investigator is limited to medical emergencies or urgent clinical situations in which knowledge of the patient's study treatment is necessary for clinical management. Follow-up assessments of recovery in VX-210-treated versus placebo-treated patients are conducted at 6 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment (\nTable 3\n). Medical, neurological, and functional changes are evaluated at pre-defined time points, and serum samples are collected for pharmacokinetic, biomarker, genetic, and immunological analyses. In the phase 1/2a trial, the 9-mg dose was the highest concentration tested, had a safe and tolerable safety profile,\n28\nand was chosen to maximize target engagement.\nTable\n3.\nSchedule of Selected SPRING Trial Assessments\nEvent/assessment\nScreening\na\nSurgery\nb\nPost-surgery\nc\n6-week follow-up (\u00b17 days)\nd\n3-month follow-up (\u00b17 days)\nd\n6-month follow-up (\u00b17 days)\nd\n12-month follow-up (\u00b17 days)\nd\nEarly termination\nd\nSafety follow-up 28 (\u00b13) days after treatment\nd,e\nAEs and past and concomitant medications and procedures\nContinuous from signing of ICF through the last study visit\nEfficacy assessments\nISNCSCI examination\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nSCIM III\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nGRASSP quantitative prehension\nX\nX\nX\nCUE-T\nX\nX\nX\nFollow-up questionnaire\nX\nX\nX\nX\nSF-36\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nEQ-5D-5L\nX\nX\nX\nX\nHospitalizations\nContinuous from signing of ICF through the last study visit\nStudy drug administration\nVX-210 or placebo\nX\nPharmacokinetic assessments\nSerum samples for PK\nX\nf\nX\nf\nX\nf\nOpen in a separate window\na\nResults of assessments performed as part of standard of care (except for ISNCSCI examination) within 72\u2009h after initial injury and before signing of the ICF may be carried forward as screening results.\nb\nSurgery refers to the spinal decompression/stabilization surgery that commences within 72\u2009h after initial injury, during which the study drug (VX-210 or placebo) is administered in a fibrin sealant.\nc\nPost-surgery assessments are performed within 7 days of completion of surgery.\nd\nFollow-up assessments of recovery are conducted at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after treatment.\ne\nThe safety follow-up visit is required in addition to the early termination visit only for patients who prematurely terminate from the study before day 28 after treatment.

UEMS is a portion of the ISNCSCI neurological assessment that focuses on the hand and arm strength most relevant to individuals with a cervical SCI.\n36\nMuscle contraction strength is graded in five key arm and hand muscle groups on each side of the body from 0 (total paralysis) to 5 ([normal] active movement, full range of motion against gravity, and full resistance in a functional muscle position expected from an otherwise unimpaired person), for a total possible UEMS of 50. Change from baseline to 6 months in UEMS for the VX-210 9-mg group will be compared to that of the placebo group for the primary evaluation of efficacy.\nSecondary endpoints evaluating functional recovery include 1) the Spinal Cord Independence Measure III (SCIM III) self-care subscore (a question-based evaluation of a patient's ability to feed, dress, groom, and bathe independently on a daily basis) at 6 months post-treatment\n37\u201339\n; 2) the capabilities of upper extremity test (CUE-T) score (an evaluation of a patient's ability to perform specific functional movements or tasks with the arms and hands, such as grasping a pencil, pushing, or lifting a weight) at 6 months post-treatment\n40\n,\n41\n; and 3) the graded redefined assessment of strength, sensibility, and prehension (GRASSP) quantitative prehension score (an assessment of a patient's ability to perform specific functions with the arms, hands, and fingers, such as turning a key in a lock or pouring water in a cup) at 6 months post-treatment.\n42\u201346\nSecondary endpoints evaluating neurological recovery include AIS grade conversion and motor level change from baseline to 6 months post-treatment, which are both derivatives of the ISNCSCI neurological assessment. Pharmacokinetic parameters of VX-210 will also be evaluated. The ISNCSCI, SCIM III, CUE-T, and GRASSP assessments are conducted by independent trained assessors. All efforts are made to use the same assessor for a given efficacy assessment for a given patient.\nSafety evaluations include AEs, vital signs, electrocardiograms, clinical laboratory tests (i.e., serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis), physical examinations, surgical site examinations, and immunogenicity measures. Safety and tolerability data will be reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee to ensure the safety of patients in the study.\n\nInterim analysis\nAn interim analysis will be conducted when 33% of enrolled patients have completed the 6-month follow-up visit, and the study may be stopped for futility depending on the results of this interim analysis. An independent data monitoring committee will conduct the review and make a recommendation to the study sponsor on the topic of futility.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe null hypothesis to be tested is that the mean change from baseline in UEMS at 6 months post-treatment is the same for the 9-mg dose of VX-210 and placebo. This null hypothesis will be tested at a two-sided significance level (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05). Using a standard deviation of 6.0, if the 9-mg VX-210 group improves in UEMS by 4 points more than the placebo group (a clinically meaningful difference), the approximately 100 study patients (\u223c50 patients/group) will provide \u226580% power to detect a statistically significant treatment effect for the 9-mg VX-210 group compared to placebo. The primary analysis will include those who prematurely terminate before the 6-month follow-up.\nTo control the type I error rate, a hierarchical testing procedure will be used for the important efficacy endpoints. The first endpoint in the testing hierarchy will be the primary endpoint (change from baseline in UEMS at 6 months post-treatment). The second endpoint in the testing hierarchy will be the SCIM III self-care subscore at 6 months post-treatment. Treatment effects will be analyzed for each time point.\n\nEthics and informed consent\nThe study is being conducted in accord with the current International Conference on Harmonisation Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), which is consistent with the ethical principles founded in the Declaration of Helsinki, and in accord with local applicable laws and regulations. An institutional review board (IRB) or independent ethics committee (IEC) reviews all appropriate study documentation to safeguard the rights, safety, and well-being of the patients. The study is only conducted at sites where IRB/IEC approval has been obtained.\nAfter the study has been fully explained, the patient (or a witness or legally appointed and authorized representative) signs and dates an informed consent form before study participation. The method of obtaining and documenting the informed consent and assent (if applicable) and the contents of the consent comply with the ICH GCP and all applicable laws and regulations."

Exclusion criteria were: concurrent infection such as frank urinary tract infection as indicated by lab evidence (urinalysis, positive culture) and some clinical occurrence such as hematuria, fever; incontinence between catheterizations; and pressure ulcers, cancer, chemotherapy, neutropenia, or autoimmune disease. Uninjured participants were \u226518 years old, without history of SCI, within an age range and sex distribution similar to the chronic SCI participants.

RNA quality and quantity was measured using the Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). RNA was amplified using the Illumina RNA Total Prep Amplification Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and analyzed on the HT-12v4 Expression BeadChips (Illumina, San Diego, CA), which contained 47,323 probe sets. Raw data were background subtracted and quantile normalized in Genome Studio (Illumina), and missing bead values were imputed, with the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm used by Genome Studio. There were 34,694 unique gene symbols, and expression data were averaged over multiple probe sets for the same gene symbol. Data exported from Genome Studio was log\n2\ntransformed for analysis in Partek Genomics Suite (Partek Inc., St. Louis, MO). In Genomics Suite, genes that failed to have a transformed maximum value \u22655 in any sample were filtered from the dataset, resulting in 11,261 genes analyzed. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed in Partek Genomics Suite to examine overall variation in gene expression profiles using default settings in two dimensions (first two components). In the SCI group, we used repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA; Partek Genomics Suite) to determine that overall, visit 1 and visit 2 gene expression profiles did not differ significantly from each other (see\nResults\n). PCA identified visit 1 as an outlier for 2 participants (Partek Genomics Suite), so visit 1 data were used for 29 participants and visit 2 data were used for 2 participants.

    "Methods": "Adult, female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (n=\u200959; 225\u2013250\u2009g) were obtained from Harlan Scientific (now Envigo, Huntingdon, UK) and housed at the College of Medicine University Laboratory Animal Resources facility at Drexel University (Philadelphia, PA) according to National Institutes of Health guidelines and approved Institutional Care and Use Committee protocols (seeTable 1). All animals were acclimated to the facility for 1 week before undergoing C3/4 lateralized contusions. One week post-injury, animals were injected with either vehicle (Hank's balanced salt solution [HBSS];n=\u200912), allogeneic (SD;n=\u200919) or transgenic (Fischer green fluorescent protein [GFP]-expressing;n=\u200916) dissociated FSC tissue, and allowed to recover for 1 month before undergoing tracing procedures (n=\u200943) and terminal electrophysiology (n=\u200939; seeTable 1). Unless otherwise stated, animals were anesthetized with separate injections of xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg, subcutaneous [S.Q.] injection); Anased\u00ae; Akorn Animal Health, Lake Forest, IL) and ketamine (120\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneal [I.P.] injection; KetaVed\u00ae; Vedco, St. Joseph, MO) for all survival surgeries. Immediate post-operative care included administration of Lactated Ringers solution (5\u2009mL, S.Q.), yohimbine (1.6\u2009mg/kg S.Q.; Yobine\u00ae; Akorn), and buprenorphine (0.025\u2009mg/kg, S.Q.; Buprenex\u00ae; Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Hull, UK). A schematic diagram highlighting the methods used in this study is shown inFigure 1.\n\nMid-cervical (C3/C4) lateralized contusions\nIn anesthetized animals, a dorsal incision was made extending from C1 to C5, and overlying cervical muscles were retracted from cervical vertebrae. A partial, lateral laminectomy of the C3 and rostral C4 portions of the vertebrae was performed to expose the dorsal spinal cord and dura. A lateralized contusion injury was made on the left side of the spinal cord at C3/C4 using the Infinite Horizons pneumatic impactor device (Precision Systems & Instrumentation, Fairfax Station, VA;\nFig. 1A\n), with a preset impact force of 200 kilodynes (KD; zero dwell time). Animals that experienced respiratory arrest post-injury were immediately intubated and placed on a ventilator. These animals were weaned from ventilator support within an hour of injury. Animals that were unable to wean within an hour post-injury were excluded from the study. Post-injury, muscle overlying the spinal cord was closed using sterile, 4-0 or 5-0 vicryl sutures and skin was closed with would clips. Each animal received a respiratory stimulant, doxapram hydrochloride (Dopram\n\u00ae\n; 5\u2009mg/kg, S.Q.; West-Ward, Eatontown, NJ), in addition to normal post-operative care.\n\nFetal spinal cord tissue collection and preparation\nDeveloping (E13\u2013E14) embryos were collected from time-mated SD or F344-Tg(UBC-EGFP) rats and placed into a petri dish containing HBSS (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD; -Mg\n2+\n, -Ca\n2+\n). Distinct features of E14 embryos, such as average crown-rump length (\u223c9.5\u201310.0\u2009mm) and the presence of precartilaginous formations within handplates, were used to determine gestational age.\n28\nAny embryo smaller than 9\u2009mm or larger than 11.5\u2009mm (associated with E13.5 and E14.5, respectively) was excluded from the study. Average crown-rump length of F344-GFP\u2013derived embryos used for transplantation was 9.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u2009mm, whereas the average length of SD-derived embryos was 11\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u2009mm. Though embryo sizes appeared slightly different between the two strains, other indications of gestational age (such as digit formation) were similar. The entire spinal cord was extracted from each embryo in HBSS under a laminar flow hood using a stereo microscope (S6D; Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Careful dissection of spinal cord tissue ensured the exclusion of meninges, dorsal root ganglia, and any brain or brainstem tissue. It should be noted that while this tissue is typically referred to as \u201cfetal spinal cord\u201d (FSC), it is, in fact, derived from an embryonic developmental stage.\n29\n,\n30\nTo be consistent with previously published reports,\n15\n,\n16\n,\n27\n,\n31\n,\n32\nand avoid confusion with \u201cembryonic stem cells\u201d (ESCs), we will also refer to our embryonic spinal cord donor tissue as FSC. Once dissected, FSC tissue was kept in clean, sterile HBSS on ice while all tissue was collected (typically around 2\u2009h for all embryos). Strips of spinal cord tissue were then cut into smaller blocks (\u223c12\u2009mm in length) and were mechanically dissociated into a suspension in sterile HBSS using a 200-\u03bcL pipette (as described previously by Reier and colleagues).\n26\n,\n33\n,\n34\nIn the absence of chemical dissociation that others have used,\n35\n,\n37\nFSC suspensions were comprised primarily of cellular clusters rather than single cells. Cell density and viability was determined before transplantation by staining a small sample of cell suspension with trypan blue (Gibco) and manually counting cells with a hemocytometer. The minimum acceptable viability for these studies was 75%, and cell density averaged 150,185 cells/\u03bcL, \u00b137,904 cells/\u03bcL.\n\nFetal spinal cord transplantation\nOne week after contusion, animals were anesthetized and the injury site was re-exposed. Scar tissue that had adhered to the dura at the site of laminectomy was gently removed and a small incision was made in the dura overlying the site of injury (easily identifiable because of bruising and tissue discoloration) using a 25-gauge needle. A volume of FSC suspension to include 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n6\ncells (average\u2009=\u20096.5\u2009\u00b1\u20092.5\u2009\u03bcL) was injected into the lesion cavity immediately after preparation of the cells (\nFig. 1B\n) using a 25\u2009\u03bcL Hamilton syringe (gastight) with a custom, 30-gauge needle (Luer-lock, 45-degree bevel), fitted into a micromanipulator (Model Kite-L; World Precision Instruments LLC, Sarasota, FL). An equal volume of HBSS was injected into the lesion cavity of control animals. Overlying muscle was sutured and skin was closed with wound clips. Transgenic FSC recipients received daily injections of cyclosporine A (CSA; 1\u2009mg/kg, S.Q.) beginning 3 days before transplantation and continuing through the end of the study.\n\nNeuroanatomical tracing\nFour weeks after transplantation, animals were anesthetized (2\u2009L/min of 4% isoflurane in 100% O\n2\nto induce anesthesia, 2.5% isoflurane to maintain; South Medic Inc., Barrie, Ontario, Canada) and underwent a laparotomy to expose the abdominal surface of the diaphragm. A retrograde, transynaptic tracer (PRV614 Bartha strain; encoding for expression of red fluorescent protein; 50\u2009\u03bcL, titer 1.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n10;\nUniversity of Florida Vector Core, Gainesville, FL) was topically applied to the entire surface of the ipsilateral, hemidiaphragm (72\u2009h before sacrifice, as previously described\n11\n) to trace donor neurons synaptically integrated with host phrenic circuitry. In a subset of these animals (\nn\n=\u20096), 1\u2009\u03bcL of biotinylated dextran amine (10,000 molecular weight [MW]; 5% [w/v] in sterile saline; biotin dextran amine [BDA]; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was injected into the lateral gray matter of the C1\u2013C2 spinal cord ipsilateral to injury, 1 week before diaphragm pseudorabies virus (PRV) tracing. In a second group of animals (\nn\n=\u20098), PRV152 (encoding for expression of GFP; 1\u2009\u03bcL; titer 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n10\n) was injected directly into the transplant 72\u2009h before sacrifice, to examine host-to-donor neuronal connectivity. All intraspinal tracer injections were made using a 10-\u03bcL NanoFil\n\u00ae\nsyringe (World Precision Instruments) with a 35-gauge needle attached. Overlying muscle was sutured and skin was closed with wound clips for all tracing surgeries.\n\nTerminal phrenic nerve recordings and analysis\nTerminal, phrenic nerve recordings were made in 4 animals that had received SD-derived FSC transplants 4 weeks previously. Initially, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (2% in 100% O\n2\nbefore transitioning to urethane [1.2\u2009g/kg] before recording; Acros, Morris Plains, NJ), vagotomized, paralyzed (vecuronium bromide, 3\u20134\u2009mg/kg/h; Patterson Veterinary Supply, Devens, MA), and mechanically ventilated. Bilateral phrenic nerve recordings were conducted using silver, bipolar hook electrodes immersed in a mineral oil base (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ) as previously described.\n8\nMean arterial pressure, tracheal pressure, and end-tidal CO\n2\nwere monitored throughout the experiment. Baseline phrenic nerve activity was recorded under controlled ventilatory conditions (50% O\n2\n, balance N\n2\n) as well as during a 5-min, continuous hypoxic challenge (10% O\n2\n). At this point, a cocktail of glutamatergic antagonists was injected into the transplant epicenter (0.86\u2009mm lateral from the midline, 1-mm depth) through a glass pipette (25 um optical density). The cocktail included both an \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist (100\u2009nL of 5\u2009mM of 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione; Sigma-Aldrich, Allentown, PA) and an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist (100\u2009nL of 5mM (2\nR\n)-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid; (2\nR\n)-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate; Tocris, Bristol, UK). After a 90-min washout period, a cocktail of serotonergic receptor antagonists (serotonin [5HT] 1, 2, and 7) was injected into the same site (100\u2009nL of 5\u2009mM of Ritanserin; Tocris; 100\u2009nL of 5\u2009mM of Pimozide; Tocris). After each drug injection, phrenic activity was recorded again under both normal and challenged respiratory conditions. At the end of each experiment, 200\u2009nL of BED (biotin ethylenediamine; Biotium, Fremont, CA) was injected to visualize the site of antagonist application and determine the extent of diffusion. BED was selected for its MW (286) to ensure accurate representation of antagonist diffusion. In a subset of animals, simultaneous phrenic nerve and multi-unit, donor neuron activities were recorded in the center of the transplant using a Carbostar-3 microelectrode (Kation Scientific, Minneapolis, MN).\nRaw phrenic nerve traces were rectified (DC bias removed with a 0.1-sec window width) and integrated (T\u2009=\u20090.03\u2009sec, time constant). Integrated signals were averaged over 40-sec intervals immediately before and 10\u201315\u2009min after the application of drug and at the end of each respiratory challenge. The average amplitudes of phrenic bursts was determined from the averaged integrated signal for each condition. Recordings were made using LabChart software (ADInstruments, Sydney, Australia). Analysis was completed using OriginPro 2016 software (OriginLabs, Northampton, MA).\n\nTerminal diaphragm electromyography recordings and analysis\nTerminal, bilateral diaphragm electromyography recordings were conducted as previously described (Lane and colleagues, 2012).\n5\nAt 5 weeks post-injury (4 weeks post-transplantation), rats were anesthetized with xylazine and ketamine, as described above (\nn\n=\u200935). All fur was shaved from the abdomen and neck, and the MouseOx Plus\n\u00ae\nneck cuff sensor was used to monitor pulse oximetry for the duration of the experiment (STARR Life Sciences Corp., Oakmont, PA). MouseOx data were also integrated a CED digitizer and integrated with Spike2 recording. Rats were placed in the supine position on a thermal heating pad and allowed to rest until recorded oxygen saturation was stable >95%. At this point, a laparotomy was performed to expose the diaphragm. Two electrodes (PFA-coated tungsten wire; A-M Systems, Inc., Sequim, WA) were inserted into each hemidiaphragm, in the medial portion of the costal muscle near the lateral branch of the inferior phrenic artery. Care was taken to ensure equidistant and symmetrical placement of electrodes. Baseline activity was recorded for ten minutes before administering a 5-min respiratory challenge\u2014hypoxic gas (10% O\n2\n, balance N\n2\n) delivered through a nose cone at a rate of 2\u2009L/min. After challenge, animals were immediately perfuse-fixed. All recordings were amplified (A-M Systems Differential AC amplifier, Model 1700), digitized (Power3 1401 digitizer; Cambridge Electronic Design, Ltd. [CED], Cambridge, UK), and recorded using Spike2 software (version 7; CED). Analysis was performed as described above using OriginPro software (OriginLabs). Briefly, signals were integrated and 40-sec averages of bursting activity were taken from the end of baseline and hypoxia challenge. Amplitude was calculated from the averaged, integrated signals, and two-tailed\nt\n-tests were used to determined significance between corresponding treatment groups.\n\nTissue collection and histology\nA lethal dose of pentobarbital sodium and phenytoin sodium (0.4\u2009mL, I.P.; Euthanasia Solution, Vedco Inc., St. Joseph, MO) was given to each animal, and after loss of corneal reflex and respiratory arrest, an incision was made through the thoracic cavity to expose the heart. Animals were intracardially perfused with 0.9% saline solution, followed by intracardial fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1\u2009M of phosphate-buffered solution (PBS). Spinal cord and brain tissue were dissected and post-fixed in 4% PFA before being transferred to a cryoprotectant solution (15\u201330% sucrose in PBS). Spinal cords were embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature compound (Tissue-Tek\n\u00ae\n; Andwin Scientific, Schaumburg, IL; free-floating sections) or M1 Embedding-Matrix (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA; on-slide sections) and frozen sections (25\u201340\u2009um thickness, longitudinal and cross-sections) were cut using a cryostat (Leica Biosystems). IHC was completed using primary antibodies against PRV (1:10,000; courtesy of Dr. Lynn Enquist at Princeton University), GFP (1:750; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), choline acetyl transferase (1:200; EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA), serotonin (1:500; Immunostar, Hudson, WI), c-fos (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Dallas, TX), neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN; 1:500; EMD Millipore), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:5000; EMD Millipore), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; 1:500; EMD Millipore), glutaminase (1:100; Abcam), rat endothelial cell antigen (RECA) 1 (1:100; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and glutamate decarboxylase 65/67 (GAD65/67; 1:5000; EMD Millipore). All sections intended for bright field microscopy were labeled with a biotinylated secondary antibody, followed by application of avidin-biotin complex (Vectastain ABC Kit; Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) and enzyme substrate (DAB [3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine]; Sigma-Aldrich) to visualize staining. Fluorescent sections were cover-slipped using aqueous mounting medium (Fluoromount G\n\u00ae\n; Southernbiotech, Birmingham, AL; or Dako Fluorescent Mounting Medium, Dako North America, Carpinteria, CA), and bright field sections were counter stained with Cresyl Violet and cover slipped with nonaqueous mounting medium (Richard-Allan Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI). All images were taken using Zeiss Imager M2 with Apotome.2 and Zen Blue software (Carl Zeiss, Oberkocken, Germany).\n\nAnatomical analysis\nAll morphometric analyses were completed on images obtained from the Zeiss Imager M2 microscope. Investigators were blinded to animal identity throughout analysis. Quantification of PRV- and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive cells were completed manually from images as described previously.\n11\nBriefly, PRV- and ChAT-positive neurons were identified in every other section (horizontal, 40\u2009um thick) as having neuronal morphology and positively labeled cytoplasm with a visible nucleus. Total number of positively ChAT-labeled cells was estimated by multiplying the summed raw counts by a factor of 2. An Abercrombie correction factor was applied to raw counts to account for cells that may have been split between histological sections and counted twice. The size of ChAT-positive cell bodies was also measured using the Feret's diameter in Image J (NIH, Bethesda, MD).\nQuantitative measurements of transplant and lesion cavity volume were made in recipients of GFP transplants using ImageJ. The area of GFP-positive tissue in every section was selected using a color threshold with the following parameters: hue (60\u2013110), brightness (50\u2013max). Area measurements were multiplied by the section thickness (40\u2009um) and added together for a volume estimation.\nAxonal outgrowth was quantified using selected longitudinal sections (40-um thickness) from GFP-transplant recipients that had been IHC labeled for GFP to enhance the signal. Three sections from each animal (one each through the dorsal horn, intermediate gray, and ventral horn) were imaged using consistent settings for Z-stack (5 slices), magnification (20\u2009\u00d7\u2009), and Apotome.2 (5-phase with phase correction and weak deconvolution). Area of GFP-positive fibers was measured at multiple points along the length of the section, beginning at each transplant edge (both rostral and caudal) and continuing at 4-mm intervals throughout the rest of the cervical spinal cord. At each measurement point, area of GFP-positive signal was measured as described above for a 300-um-length section spanning the width of the whole cord. Histograms showing changes in axonal density as a factor of distance from the transplant were generated using Origin Pro Software. Nonparametric statistical analyses included multiple, pair-wise comparisons with a significance level of 0.05 and were completed using SigmaPlot (Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA)."

    "Methods": "Experiments complied with the United Kingdom (UK) Animals Scientific Procedures Act (1986) and were approved by the Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body of Imperial College London. Unless otherwise stated, reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Dorset, UK).\n\nThe shock tube blast generator\nA shock tube was used to generate controlled overpressure waves that model real-life free-field explosions with a Friedlander-type waveform.\n32\nThe shock tube (\nFig. 1A\n) is a 3.8\u2009m long horizontal stainless steel tube, with three 1.22\u2009m long sections, with internal diameter of 0.059\u2009m and external diameter of 0.073\u2009m. The first section, 1.22\u2009m long, is the high pressure driver section, separated from the low pressure (1\u2009atm) section, 2.44\u2009m long, by a double breech assembly, 0.08\u2009m long. The double breech allows one or two Mylar\n\u00ae\npolyester diaphragms (RS Components, Northants, UK) to be clamped between the high pressure driver section and the driven section with gas tight seals provided by nitrile O-rings (\nFig. 1A\ninset). The effective driver volume can be adjusted by including one or more cylindrical polyethylene \u201cblanking\u201d sections inside the driver section.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\n(A\n) Schematic drawing of the shock tube used for these studies. The driver section is filled with compressed air via a control panel with control valves and pressure gauges allowing separate control of the pressure in the breech and the driver tube. A solenoid-controlled vent valve allows the pressure in the breech to be rapidly vented, triggering diaphragm rupture in the double-breech configuration. The breech (inset) can be used in single-diaphragm or double-diaphragm configuration. The driven section (left of the breech) has two ultrafast rise-time dynamic pressure transducers, mounted radially, halfway along (sensor 1) and at the distal end (sensor 2). These sensors are connected to a high bandwidth digital storage oscilloscope. (\nB\n) Detail of the shock tube assembly used in these\nin vitro\nexperiments. The Millicell culture insert (small grey circle) with organotypic slices is inside a polythene bag containing experimental medium. The polythene bag is clamped all around a circular aperture in front of the shock-tube distal flange.\nFor these\nin vitro\nexperiments, we used a 15% driver volume in the single and double diaphragm configuration to generate shockwaves with peak overpressures of 55\u2009kPa and 50\u2009kPa, respectively. The driver section was pressurized with compressed air (BOC, Guildford, UK). Burst pressure is determined by the diaphragm material and thickness and in the double diaphragm configuration is triggered by venting the breech section through a fast-acting servo-valve. Two ultrafast piezoelectric high dynamic pressure transducers (2300 V1, Dytran Instruments, Chatsworth, CA) were mounted radially on the shock tube. Sensor 1, mounted in the middle of the driven section, was used for triggering data acquisition; sensor 2, mounted at the end of the driven section, was used for measurement of shockwave peak overpressure and duration (\nFig. 1\n). The pressure transducers were connected to a current source power unit (model 4103C, Dytran Instruments) and output signals recorded on a high bandwidth oscilloscope (model DPO4104B, Tektronix Inc, Beaverton, OR).\nShockwave data were acquired at a sampling rate of 50\u2009MHz over 20\u2009msec (1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n6\nsamples/wave). Voltage signals were saved on digital storage media and analyzed offline on a computer using MATLAB software (Release 2015a, MathWorks, Natick, MA) and the appropriate calibration factor for each pressure transducer provided by the manufacturer.\n\nIn vitro\nslice cultures\nOrganotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs) were prepared from postnatal day five to seven C57BL/6N mouse pups under aseptic conditions using the interface method described by Stoppini and associates\n33\nwith some modifications.\n34\u201336\nSlices on tissue culture inserts (Millicell-CM, Millipore, Carrigtwohill, Ireland) were cultured at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO\n2\nin air in a humidified incubator (BB6220, Heraeus, Germany) for 12\u201314 days. The growth medium was changed on the first day of culture and every two to three days thereafter.\n\nPreparation of OHSCs for\nin vitro\nblast-TBI\nAfter 12\u201314 days in culture, the tissue culture inserts were transferred to six-well culture plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) containing pre-warmed (37\u00b0C) serum-free \u201cexperimental medium\u201d with propidium iodide (PI) (75% minimum essential medium Eagle; 25% Hank balanced salt solution; 5\u2009mg/mL\nd\n-glucose; 2\u2009mM\nl\n-glutamine; 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution; 10\u2009mM HEPES; 4.5\u2009\u03bcM PI; pH titrated to 7.2). At 1\u2009h after transfer to experimental medium, the slices were imaged (see\nQuantifying cell injury\n) to assess baseline slice health before injury and to ensure that all slices were equivalent at the start of the procedure (and before allocating to experimental groups). A small number of slices exhibited areas of dense staining at this stage (likely because of mechanical damage occurring during slice preparation) and were excluded from further analysis.\nImmediately after baseline imaging, individual tissue culture inserts were sealed carefully in sterile polyethylene sample bags (Twirl'em\n\u00ae\n3\u201d\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u201d, Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK) using aseptic conditions. Each bag was pre-filled with warmed (37\u00b0C) experimental medium that had been saturated by bubbling with 95%O\n2\n; 5%CO\n2\nfor 45\u2009min. Gas bubbles were carefully excluded on sealing sample bags. We determined whether slice submersion affected slices and found no significant difference between slices that had been maintained without submersion and those submerged (data not shown).\n\nIn vitro\nblast injury procedure\nAt 1\u2009h after submersion of the tissue culture insert, each sample bag was assigned randomly to either blast or sham group and clamped symmetrically all round in a vertical position in front of the shock-tube outlet using a custom-made stainless steel assembly (\nFig. 1B\n) with the inserts positioned perpendicular to the axis of the shock tube with the OHSCs facing the shock tube. The OHSCs in the blast groups then were exposed immediately to a single shockwave (\nFig. 2B\n). After blast-injury or sham procedure, each sample bag was placed in a thermo-regulated box (37\u00b0C) before OHSCs were returned to air-liquid interface conditions.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\n(\nA\n) Experimental timeline. (\nB\n) A representative shockwave obtained using single 23-\u03bcm Mylar\n\u00ae\ndiaphragm, peak overpressure 55\u2009kPa, positive wave duration 0.4\u2009msec, and impulse 10.3\u2009kPa\u2022msec. Shockwave data were obtained from a pressure transducer mounted radially on the distal flange of the driven section. (\nC\n) Images showing typical (\ni\n) uninjured sham slice, (\nii\n) blast-TBI exposed slice, and (\niii\n) xenon-treated blast-TBI slice, at 72\u2009h after injury. The red propidium iodide fluorescence is used as a marker of dead or dying cells. Scale bar\u2009=\u2009500\u2009\u03bcm. (\nD\n) For each slice, an image intensity histogram was produced and injury quantified by counting the number of pixels above a threshold of 50 in the intensity histograms (dashed vertical line). The lines shown indicate the intensity histograms of images of a typical sham slice (black line) and a typical blast-injured slice (red line) at 72\u2009h after the blast or sham procedure.\nOur objective was to develop a model that was sensitive to injury induced by a primary blast wave. Because of the sensitivity of our measurement of cell death, and in common with other\nin vitro\nbrain injury models,\n35\n,\n36\nthere is a degree of injury in the sham slices. For this reason, we ensured that every experiment included a sham group, and we randomly allocated slices to sham and blast groups. We took care to ensure that sham slices were treated identically to the slices exposed to a shockwave (sealed in the sample bags and suspended on the stainless steel rig for an equivalent period), but the shock tube was not fired. The level of injury in the sham slices at 24\u2009h and 48\u2009h was similar to that observed in our\nin vitro\nblunt TBI model,\n36\nbut at 72\u2009h was greater than the blunt TBI model, likely reflecting the greater slice manipulation in the blast model. The injury in the blast-exposed slices was significantly (\np\n<\u20090.01) greater than sham slices at all time points after blast.\nIn some of the earlier experiments, to be able to distinguish between the different magnitudes of blast (50\u2009kPa; 55\u2009kPa) and to assess how injury developed after both blast intensities, we had larger group sizes (\u223c30\u201350 slices). In the xenon neuroprotection experiments, we chose the higher blast intensity (55\u2009kPa), and in these experiments, smaller group sizes (\u223c12) were used for the injury and treatment groups; because we included a sham group per condition in every experiment, the sham group was larger (\u223c23).\n\nExperimental gas treatment\nAfter the blast-TBI procedure, inserts were carefully removed from the sample bags inside a laminar flow tissue culture hood and transferred to six-well culture plates with pre-warmed (37\u00b0C) experimental medium. The six-well plate was transferred back to either the humidified incubator (37\u00b0C, 5% CO\n2\nin air) or, for the gas treatment experiments, plates were randomly assigned to either xenon or control gas (helium) groups and transferred to one of two small custom-made hyperbaric chambers containing a high-speed fan for rapid gas mixing, housed in an incubator set at 37\u00b0C.\n34\n,\n35\nThe chamber (volume 0.925\u2009L) was flushed with humidified control gas (20%O\n2\n; 75%N\n2\n; 5%CO\n2\n) for 5\u2009min at 5\u2009L/min.\n36\nThe chamber was then sealed and an additional 50% atm of helium or xenon was added (the total final pressure inside the chamber was 1.5\u2009atm). The partial pressures of O\n2\nand CO\n2\nwere fixed at 0.2\u2009atm and 0.05\u2009atm, respectively.\nSix-well plates were removed from the chamber at 24\u2009h, 48\u2009h, and 72\u2009h for imaging (\nFig. 2A\n). For quantification of injury, slices in six well plates were allocated a well identifier A\u2013F and a slice number (e.g., 1\u20134). Imaging was performed and data files stored with reference to these identifiers until the final analysis. After imaging, plates were transferred back to the chamber and the appropriate gas mixture was reestablished.\n\nQuantifying cell injury\nThe PI only enters cells with compromised cellular membranes and becomes fluorescent after binding to nucleic acids allowing quantification of cell injury.\n37\u201339\nAn epifluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse 80i, Kingston upon Thames, UK) with a low power objective (Nikon Plan UW 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification, NA 0.06) was used to visualize PI fluorescence (\nFig. 2C\n). A digital camera (Micropublisher 3.3 RTC) and image capture software (QCapturePro, Qimaging Inc., Surrey, British Columbia, Canada), were used as described previously.\n36\nImage intensity analysis of the red channel was performed using ImageJ software,\n40\nwith the distribution of intensities plotted as a histogram over 256 intensity levels. Slices under uninjured conditions exhibited a well-defined peak in the intensity distribution, which fell rapidly to zero. As a measure of injury caused by the shockwave exposure, the number of pixels above a threshold of 50 was integrated (\nFig. 2D\n).\n36\n\nImmunofluorescence\nAt the end of the experiment, slices on Millicell inserts were washed with warmed (37\u00b0C) phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by fixation for 1\u2009h with 4% paraformaldehyde (ThermoFisher, Loughborough, UK) in PBS. Slices were detached carefully from inserts and mounted on glass slides. Slices were blocked for 90\u2009min with 10% goat serum in PBS, incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with cleaved caspase-3 primary antibody (9661S, Cell Signaling Technology, Leiden, Netherlands, dilution 1:200) followed by 1\u2009h incubation at room temperature with Alexa Fluor\n\u00ae\n488 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (A-11008, Life Technologies, Paisley, UK, dilution 1:500), with 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009washes with PBS 0.3% Triton X 100 between each step. Slices were imaged using a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope with a\u2009\u00d7\u2009100 objective (Nikon Plan Fluor, NA 1.3 oil, WD 0.20).\n\nStatistics\nResults are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean. Significance was assessed using a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance with Holm-Sidak\npost hoc\ntest. Factor 1 was treatment (sham, xenon, control), and factor 2 was time before or after the injury (-1\u2009h, 24\u2009h, 48\u2009h, and 72\u2009h), where factor 1 was the repeated factor. Statistical tests were implemented using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA)."

    "Methods": "Animals and experimental groups\nWild-type C57Bl/6 mice obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) were maintained in the animal facility in standard conditions at a 12-h light/dark cycle and food and water\nad libitum\n. All animal care and manipulations were carried out according to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Young adult animals (9\u201310 weeks) were quarantined and individually housed in cages for 1 week before being randomly assigned to experimental groups: sham, TBI, and TBI + MCC950. Each group was divided into two subgroups for acute and subacute assessment of neurological damage at 24 and 72\u2009h post-TBI. After the neurological assessments all animals were euthanized at 24 or 72\u2009h post-TBI, and the brain samples were harvested according to the prerequisite procedure for immunoblotting or histological evaluations. MCC950 (Adipogen Life Sciences, San Diego, CA) was dissolved in sterile saline and dosed in animals (50\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneally) at 1 and 3\u2009h post-TBI, based on published reports.\n22\n,\n24\n\nInduction of traumatic brain injury\nC57Bl/6 mice were subjected to CCI or the sham surgery under isoflurane (2\u20133%) anesthesia. Briefly, mice were placed in a stereotaxic frame (Leica Biosystems, Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL), and a 3.5-mm craniotomy was made in the right parietal bone midway between bregma and lambda with the medial edge 12\u2009mm lateral to the midline, leaving the dura intact. Mice were impacted at 4\u2009m/s with a 20-ms dwell time and 2-mm depression using a 3-mm-diameter convex tip, mimicking a moderate TBI. Sham mice underwent the identical surgical procedures, except the impaction. Body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C using a small animal temperature controller throughout all procedures. The incision was closed with VetBond tissue adhesive (1469SB; 3M Science, Maplewood, MN), and animals were allowed to recover.\n\nAssessment of neurological severity score\nNeurobehavioral assessment was performed at 24 and 72\u2009h post-TBI in a blinded fashion using a 10-point neurological severity score (NSS).\n18\nOne point was given for each failure to account for the cumulative score with a maximum of 10. The assessment consisted of 10 different tasks: 1) presence of mono- or hemiparesis; 2) inability to walk on a 3-cm-wide beam; 3) inability to walk on a 2-cm-wide beam; 4) inability to walk on a 1-cm-wide beam; 5) inability to balance on a 1-cm-wide beam; 6) inability to balance on a round stick (0.5\u2009cm diameter); 7) failure to exit a 30-cm-diameter circle (for 2\u2009min); 8) inability to walk a straight line; 9) loss of startle behavior; and 10) loss of seeking behavior.\n\nAssessment of cerebral edema\nBrain water content (BWC), a sensitive measure of cerebral edema, was quantified using the wet-dry method, as detailed by our group.\n25\nBWC was estimated in 3-mm coronal sections of the ipsilateral cortex (or corresponding contralateral cortex), centered upon the impact site. Tissue was immediately weighed (wet weight), then dehydrated at 65\u00b0C. The sample was reweighed 48\u2009h later to obtain a dry weight. Percentage of tissue water content was calculated using the following formula: BWC\u2009=\u2009[(wet weight\u2013dried weight)/wet weight]\u2009\u00d7\u2009100%.\n\nWestern blotting\nThe pericontusional cerebral cortex was microdissected from brains harvested from euthanized animals and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue samples were homogenized in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail and processed for western blotting as previously described.\n25\nThirty micrograms of sample proteins were loaded and separated trough electrophoresis on a 4\u201320% polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were blocked for nonspecific binding and probed with primary antibodies against NLRP3, caspase-1, ASC (1:1000; AG-20B-0014; AG-20B-0042; AG-25B-0006; Adipogen Life Sciences), IL-1\u03b2, caspase-3, phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-Akt), protein kinase B (Akt; 1:000; CST-12242; 9664; 9271; 9272; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; 1:1000; ab32138; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB)/p65 (1:1000; Sc-8008; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; after Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 washes, membranes were incubated with horseradish-peroxidase\u2013conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The bands were then visualized by means of a chemiluminescent substrate system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The bands' densities were quantified using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD) and normalized with the expression of beta actin as the housekeeping gene, and expressed as fold change. (Please see\nSupplementary Figures 2\u20137\nfor full western blots with original markings; online supplementary material may be found at at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com/neu\n)\n\nImmunofluorescence staining\nMice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 10% formalin (Thermo Fischer Scientific). Brains were removed and post-fixed in the same fixative overnight at 4\u00b0C and then with 30% sucrose in PBS for 72\u2009h. Sunk brains were frozen-sectioned in the coronal plane at a thickness of 10\u2009\u03bcm. Sections were blocked with Serum-Free Protein Block (X0909; DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) and then incubated with primary antibodies against NLRP3, caspase-1 (1:200; 1: 250; Adipogen Life Sciences), and IL-1\u03b2 (1:100; Cell Signaling Technology) overnight at 4\u00b0C in a humid chamber. After washing, slides were incubated with fluorescent anti mouse secondary antibodies (1:200; 072-04-18-03; Dylight-549; SeraCare KPL Products, Milford, MA) for 1\u2009h at room temperature and mounted with ProLong\u2122 Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Invirogen, Carlsbad, CA), and viewed using a Zeiss 710 confocal laser scanning microscope. Negative controls were prepared by omitting the primary antibodies. Immunofluorescence intensities were quantified using ImageJ software (NIH) in five different fields per section digitized from the perilesional area using a\u2009\u00d7\u200940 objective lens.\n\nStatistical analysis\nSample-size estimation\nSample-size determinations were made at alpha\u2009=\u20090.05, and data are reported as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error. Based on IL-\u03b2 expression value of 4.92\u2009\u00b1\u200910% for saline TBI, and a reduction to 1.87\u2009\u00b1\u200910% for mice treated with MCC950 + TBI, a sample size of 5/group was provided at least 90% power to detect this difference. One-way analysis of variance was performed to detect any difference in a variable in more than two groups. Tukey's post-hoc was then used to specify the significant differences. A two-tailed Student's\nt\n-test was applied in cases the variable was compared in two groups like NSS comparison. Statistical significance was accepted at the 95% confidence level (\np\n<\u20090.05)."

    "Methods": "Experimental design\nTwenty-eight adult female Fisher 344 rats (10\u201314 weeks old, 200\u2013250\u2009g) were experimental subjects. This strain of rat is inbred, allowing for syngeneic cell transplants that are not rejected by the immune system. For behavioral analysis, three groups of animals were studied. All groups underwent a unilateral contusion at the C5 vertebra (C6 spinal cord level) (\nn\n=\u20097 animals per group) followed by a second surgery two weeks later. Group 1 received implants of syngeneic E14-derived spinal cord NPC grafts into the lesion site that were derived from green fluorescent protein (GFP+) rats (see below), allowing unequivocal tracking of cell fate and axon extension out from the graft; Group 2 received implants of GFP-expressing syngeneic fibroblasts into the lesion site, as a cellular graft control; and Group 3 received injections of cell diluent (fibrin +4 growth factor cocktail, see below) into the lesion cavity. Animals underwent biweekly forelimb functional testing on the Montoya staircase task and were sacrificed 12 weeks post-graft.\nThree rats did not learn the task and thus were used for anatomical assessment of the graft at one month post-graft. Three weeks post-graft, these rats were injected with Fluoro-Gold into the ulnar nerve to retrogradely label motor neurons innervating forelimb musculature, to determine lesion/graft proximity to these motor neuron pools. In addition, four animals underwent unilateral C6 contusions and were sacrificed at two weeks post-lesion for histological assessment of the lesion cavity, to understand the nature of the lesion cavity at the time of cell grafting.\n\nEmbryonic day 14 NPC isolation and cell preparation\nSpinal cord NPCs were isolated from syngeneic GFP-expressing Fischer 344 (F344) embryonic day 14 (E14) spinal cords, as described previously.\n3\n,\n11\nBriefly, inbred transgenic F344 rats expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) under control of the ubiquitin promoter (F344-Tg [UBC-EGFP] F455Rrrc) were obtained from Rat Resource Research Center, University of Missouri. Timed pregnant embryos were collected from days 13.5\u201314.5 post-coitus and examined for eGFP expression with an ultraviolet flashlight (BlueStar). Spinal cords were dissected out from the fetus and the overlying meninges removed. Spinal cords were digested in 0.25% trypsin (ThermoFisher) at 37\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. Fire-polished pipets were used to gently triturate the spinal cord tissue, and then centrifuged at 2500\u2009rpm for 2\u2009min. Cells were re-suspended in Neurobasal media (ThermoFisher), stained with 0.2% trypan blue, and live cells counted on a hemocytometer.\n\nSurgical procedures\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines for laboratory animal care and safety were followed strictly. All procedures were performed under anesthesia with a combination (2\u2009mL/kg) of ketamine (25\u2009mg/mL) and Dormitor\n\u00ae\n(1\u2009mg/mL).\nFor spinal cord C6 contusions, blunt dissection was used to expose the C5 and C6 vertebrae. A laminectomy was performed of the C5 vertebra exposing the C6 spinal cord. The lateral aspects of the C2 and C6 vertebra were clamped with Adelson forceps. A 2-mm round impactor tip was positioned over the side of the spinal cord corresponding to the preferred paw, as determined during behavioral pre-training. The Infinite Horizon impactor device (Precision Systems and Instrumentation) was used to delivery a force of 200\u2009kDyns.\n10\nThe muscles were sutured and the skin stapled. Rats were given ampicillin (20\u2009mg/kg, subcutaneously [SC]) and Banamine\n\u00ae\n(1\u2009mg/kg, SC) in 3\u2009mL lactated Ringer solution immediately after the surgical procedure, placed in a 37\u00b0C incubator, and 1\u2009h later given Antisedan\n\u00ae\n(1\u2009mg/kg, intramuscularly) to counteract the Dormitor. For three days post-operation, rats were given daily SC injections of a 3\u2009mL solution containing lactated Ringer solution, ampicillin (20\u2009mg/kg), Banamine (1\u2009mg/kg).\nTwo weeks post-contusion, the animals were re-anesthetized with ketamine/Dormitor and placed in a spinal stereotax (Kopf). The lesion site was re-exposed by blunt dissection. Immediately before transplantation, 1.25\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n6\ncells of dissociated E14 spinal cord-derived NPCs or fibroblasts were concentrated by centrifugation and resuspended in 5\u2009\u03bcL of fibrinogen containing a 4-factor growth factor cocktail: 10\u2009\u03bcg/mL Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 (FGF-2) 10\u2009\u03bcg/mL Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) 50\u2009\u03bcg/mL Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) (all from Peprotech), and 50\u2009\u03bcM of the calpain inhibitor, MDL28170 (Sigma).\n12\nThe laminectomy site was identified, and a total volume of 5\u2009\u03bcL containing cells (1.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n6\ncells) and grafting cocktail was injected directly into the lesion site using a Picospritzer II (General Valve). Cells were injected into three points (one point at the lesion epicenter and two points 0.5\u2009mm rostral and caudal). The muscles were sutured, the skin stapled, and the rats were maintained in a 37\u00b0C incubator until awakened with Antisedan. Rats were given daily SC injections of a 3\u2009mL solution containing lactated Ringer solution, ampicillin (20\u2009mg/kg), and Banamine (1\u2009mg/kg) for three days post-surgery.\nTo label motor neurons retrogradely, 1\u2009\u03bcL of a 4% solution of Fluoro-Gold (Fluorochrome, Inc.) was loaded into a glass pulled pipet tip using a 5\u2009\u03bcL Hamilton syringe, then attached to a Picospritzer. The pipet tip was carefully inserted freehand into the ulnar nerve at the level of the bicep and the fluid slowly pulsed with the Picospritzer. One week later, the animals were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).\n\nBehavior testing\nBefore SCI, all rats were acclimated to the human tester and the testing apparatus. Rats were pre-trained for two to three weeks on the Montoya staircase (Lafayette Instrument Company) as described previously.\n13\nBriefly, rats were allowed 15\u2009min to consume sugar pellets\nad libitum\nwhile in the apparatus. Animals were trained five days per week (2\u2009\u00d7\u2009/day for 15\u2009min) until they were able to retrieve seven pellets per side. For weekly or biweekly testing, rats were food deprived for 24\u2009h, then placed in the Montoya staircase. Testers blinded to group identity recorded the number of pellets eaten, displaced, or dropped. Pellet retrieval accuracy was calculated as a percentage of sugar pellets displaced that were eaten.\n\nTissue preparation and immunohistochemistry\nRats were transcardially perfused with 0.9% NaCl\n2\n, followed by ice cold 4% PFA. Spinal cords were removed and post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA, then transferred to 30% sucrose in 0.1M phosphate buffer and cryoprotected for three days at 4\u00b0C. Horizontal tissue sections of a 1\u2009cm block of spinal cord tissue containing the lesion/graft site were cut on a freezing microtome set to 25\u2009\u03bcm. Serial tissue sections were collected in tissue cryoprotectant solution. A subset of slides were stained with 0.25% cresyl violet to label Nissl bodies or immunolabeled, as described below.\nFluorescent immunolabeling\nFor immunolabeling, one in 12 tissue sections was pooled and washed in tris-buffered saline (TBS). Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked for 1\u2009h in a solution of 5% donkey serum in 0.25% triton-x in TBS (TBS++). Sections were transferred to primary antibody solution containing a mixture of primary antibodies (\nTable 1\n) overnight in TBS++ at 4\u00b0C. After TBS washes, sections were incubated in biotinylated donkey anti-chicken (5\u2009\u03bcg/mL, Jackson Labs) in TBS++ for 1\u2009h at room temperature (RT). After TBS washes, sections were incubated with Vectastain ABC reagent (1:200, Vector Labs) for 30 min at RT. After TBS washes, sections were incubated in biotinylated tyramide (1:2500 in 0.6% H\n2\nO\n2\nin TBS) for 30\u2009min at RT. Sections were then rinsed in TBS and incubated for 1\u2009h at RT in TBS++ containing a mixture of Alexa-488 conjugated streptavidin and the appropriate donkey secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa-568 or Alexa-647.\nTable\n1.\nFluorescent Immunolabeling\nAntibody\nLabeling\nSpecies\nVendor\nConcentration\n5-HT\nSerotonergic axons/terminal\nGoat\nImmunostar\n0.5\u2009\u03bcg/mL\nChx10\nV2a spinal interneurons\nSheep\nAbcam\n2\u2009\u03bcg/mL\neGFP\nGrafted cells\nChicken\nAves\n10\u2009\u03bcg/mL\nGephyrin\nInhibitory post-synaptic density\nMouse\nSynaptic Systems\n1\u2009\u03bcg/mL\nGFAP\nAstrocyte processes\nRabbit\nAgilent (Dako)\n1\u2009\u03bcg/mL\nFluorogold\nTracer\nRabbit\nFluorochrome, Inc.\n1:50 dilution\nHomer-1\nExcitatory post-synaptic density\nRabbit\nSynaptic Systems\n1\u2009\u03bcg/mL\nMAP2\nNeuronal soma/dendrites\nMouse\nMillipore Sigma\n1\u2009\u03bcg/mL\nNeuN\nNeuronal nuclei\nMouse\nMillipore Sigma\n1\u2009\u03bcg/mL\nRIP\nOligodendrocyte processes\nMouse\nDSHB\n5\u2009\u03bcg/mL\nSOX9\nAstrocyte transcription factor\nGoat\nR&D Systems\n2\u2009\u03bcg/mL\nSYN\nPre-synaptic terminals\nRabbit\nProteintech\n2\u2009\u03bcg/mL\nSYN\nPre-synaptic terminals\nMouse\nGenetex\n2\u2009\u03bcg/mL\nOpen in a separate window\n5-HT, 5-hydroxytrytamine; eGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; MAP2, microtubule associated protein; RIP, RIP antigen; SOX9, SRY Homeobox-like Gene 9; SYN, synaptophysin.\nTo counterstain all nuclei, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 0.5\u2009\u03bcg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich) was added for the final 5\u2009min. Sections were washed in TBS, mounted on gelatin-subbed slides, air-dried, and coverslipped with Mowiol mounting medium. For labeling of post-synaptic proteins (gephyrin and Homer1), sections were first incubated in pepsin (1\u2009mg/mL in 0.2N HCl diluted in H\n2\nO) for 6\u2009min at 37\u00b0C. Sections were then washed in TBS and incubated in primary antibodies and visualized with fluorescent conjugated secondary antibodies, as described above.\n\nImaging\nFluorescent images were acquired with a Keyence all-in-one microscope or an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope. Images were imported into Photoshop CS6 and minimally altered for brightness and contrast.\n\nStatistical analysis\nIn all quantification procedures, observers were blinded to the nature of the experimental manipulations. For behavioral outcomes, multiple group comparisons were made by repeated measures two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (group vs. time) with a significance level of 95% followed by Fisher's\npost hoc\ntesting.

    "Methods": "Participants\nA total of 72 right-handed participants were recruited for this study (see\nTable 1\nfor demographic data), which included three groups: (i) 24 athletes (12 women) practicing a CS in a university team (rugby, soccer; A-CS); (ii) 24 athletes (12 women) practicing a NCS in a university team (swimming; A-NCS); and (iii) 24 nonathletes (12 women; NA). Athletes were recruited from local varsity athletics departments and were screened carefully with a semi-structured interview to rule out the presence of any history of concussions. A semi-structured interview was also conducted with NA participants to ensure they had not taken part in organized sports or regular physical activity (more than once per week). Participants had no psychological, psychiatric, or neurological disorder, and no substance abuse history. The groups were matched with regards to gender, education level, and age.\nTable\n1.\nDemographic Data\nGroup\nGender\nAge\nEducation (years)\nBMI (kg/m\n2\n)\nN-A\n\u2642 (n\u2009=\u200912)\n23.58 (3.29)\n16.50 (2.43)\n22.25 (2.76)\n\u2640 (n\u2009=\u200912)\n22.33 (2.42)\n16.08 (2.30)\n20.97 (2.44)\nA-NCS (swimming)\n\u2642 (n\u2009=\u200912)\n21.83 (2.33)\n15.83 (1,90)\n23.30 (2.16)\n\u2640 (n\u2009=\u200912)\n21.67 (1.92)\n16.08 (1.78)\n21.65 (1.54)\nA-CS (rugby & soccer)\n\u2642 (n\u2009=\u200912)\n22.83 (3.01)\n16.33 (2.77)\n23.26 (2.01)\n\u2640 (n\u2009=\u200912)\n23.83 (2.51)\n17.25 (1.37)\n24.30 (2.52)\nOpen in a separate window\nBMI, body mass index; N-A, nonathletes; A-NCS, noncontact-sports athletes; A-CS, contact-sports athletes.\nNumbers in parentheses represent standard d\u00e9viations.\nParticipants were recruited for a single session that included a neuropsychological assessment followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The study was conducted at the Unit\u00e9 de Neuroimagerie Fonctionnelle of the Centre de Recherche de l'Institut Universitaire de G\u00e9riatrie de Montr\u00e9al and was approved by the local ethics committee. All subjects gave written informed consent and received financial compensation for their participation.\n\nTraining frequency\nAthletes were tested during the off-season or summer training camp and were never tested after vigorous physical activity or on a practice day. Frequency of training, number of university-level years of play, and total years of practice are presented in\nTable 2\n(information was available for NA:\nn\n=\u200920; A-NCS:\nn\n=\u200922; A-CS:\nn\n=\u200919). In contact-sports athletes, position data were available for 12 soccer players (six defenders, five midfielders, and one forward), and five rugby players (one prop, one lock, one wing, one scrum half, and one outside center).\nTable\n2.\nGroup Characteristics\nGroup\nFrequency of training (times/week)\nUniversity level years\nTotal years of practice\nN-A\n0.80 (0.76)\n-\n-\nA-NCS (swimming)\n6.41 (2.92)\n2.07 (1.28)\n11.93 (3.43)\nA-CS (rugby & soccer)\n4.68 (1.00)\n2.53 (1.18)\n13.00 (6.66)\nOpen in a separate window\nN-A, nonathletes; A-NCS, noncontact-sports athletes; A-CS, contact-sports athletes.\nNumbers in parentheses represent standard deviations.\n\nCognitive assessment\nBefore the imaging session, participants were evaluated by a trained neuropsychologist. Neuropsychological tests were chosen to evaluate cognitive functions that have been reported to be vulnerable to the effects of concussion and head impact exposure.\n28\n,\n29\nThese were (i) Attention: focused and sustained attention (Ruff 2&7, D2), and processing speed (Symbol Digit Modality Test, Color Trail A, D-KEFS Color-Word Interference Test\u2013Naming and Reading conditions); (ii) Executive Functions: inhibition and mental flexibility (D-KEFS Color Word Interference Test\u2013Inhibition and Inhibition/Switching Conditions, Color Trail B); and (iii) Memory: visual memory (Rey Complex Figure Test).\n\nMRI\nMR acquisitions were made using a Siemens Trio 3T whole-body MRI system (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a 32-channel receive-only head coil.\n\nSusceptibility-weighted imaging\nData were acquired using a high-resolution three-dimensional gradient-echo sequence with the following parameters: time to repetition (TR)\u2009=\u200928\u2009msec, time to echo (TE)\u2009=\u200920\u2009msec, flip angle (FA)\u2009=\u200915 degrees, voxel size\u2009=\u20090.8\u2009\u00d7\u20090.7\u2009\u00d7\u20091.2\u2009mm\n2\n, BW\u2009=\u2009120\u2009Hz/Px. MRI images were reviewed by a board-certified neuroradiologist, blind to group information, to detect the presence of micro-hemorrhages. Micro-hemorrhages were defined as small round lesions with homogeneous low signal intensity, without continuity with surrounding vascular structures.\n\nMRS\nAcquisition of neurometabolite signals was performed using a MEGA-PRESS sequence\n30\nwith the following parameters: T\nR\n=\u20093\u2009sec, T\nE\n=\u200968\u2009msec, FA\u2009=\u20099 degrees. Double-banded pulses for water suppression and editing of c-CH2 GABA resonance at three ppm were used. Variable power with optimized relaxation delays (VAPOR\n31\n) and outer volume suppression were optimized for the human 3T system and used for additional water suppression. Four blocks of 32 EDIT OFF and 32 EDIT ON alternate scans were acquired. Frequency drift correction was applied between each block. Using anatomical landmarks described by Youstry and associates,\n32\na first voxel-of-interest (VOI) (30\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u2009mm\n3\n) was positioned over the knob-like area representing the hand in left M1. The second VOI (30\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u2009mm\n3\n) was positioned over the left prefrontal cortex.\nMRS data were analyzed using LC Model\n33\nfor the EDIT DIFF (difference spectra) and the EDIT OFF spectra. Data with Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) of 35% or more were excluded from further analysis. An experimentally measured metabolite-nulled macromolecular spectrum from the occipital region and metabolite spectra using chemical shifts and J couplings were used as the basis set for editOff spectra. The metabolite-nulled basis spectra used in this study were built from occipital acquisitions on an independent cohort of 11 healthy adults. The occipital region was chosen for its high signal-to-noise ratio, and subjects were selected for having no medical, neurological, or psychiatric conditions and for not receiving m\u00e9dication. LC Model fitting was performed over the spectral range from 0.2 to 4.0 ppm, and LC Model spline model of the baseline was deactivated using the NOBASE\u2009=\u2009T input parameter.\nAn experimentally measured metabolite-nulled macromolecular spectrum from the occipital region (average from 11 subjects) and the experimentally measured spectra from 100\u2009mM phantoms of NAA, GABA, Glu, and Gln at 37\u00b0C and with pH adjusted to 7.2 were used as the basis set for difference spectra. LC Model spline model of the baseline was also deactivated using the NOBASE\u2009=\u2009T input parameter. No baseline correction, zero-filling, or apodization functions were applied to the\nin vivo\ndata before LC Model analysis. tCr (Cr-CH\n3\n+ PCr-CH\n3\n), mIns, and tNAA (sNAA+NAAG) concentrations were obtained from EDIT OFF spectra, and GABA and Glx concentrations were obtained from difference spectra.\nMetabolite quantification was performed using a water reference. Tissue composition was obtained from the anatomical MR images of each subject, which were segmented to GM, WM, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) content using the automated FreeSurfer pipeline (V 5.3.0). The T\n1\nand T\n2\nrelaxation times of water used in the calculation of attenuation factors were taken from published reports (T\n1\n[GM]\u2009=\u20091.29\u2009s, T\n1\n[WM]\u2009=\u20090.87\u2009s, T\n1\n[CSF]\u2009=\u20094\u2009s, T\n2\n[GM]\u2009=\u2009110\u2009ms, T\n2\n[WM]\u2009=\u200980\u2009msec, and T\n2\n[CSF]\u2009=\u2009400\u2009msec).\n34\n,\n35\nWater attenuation was computed using the fractional volume of each compartment.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 24 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY). One way analyses of variance with group (A-CS, A-NCS, NA) as the between-subjects factor were conducted for neuropsychological and neurometabolic data. A Kruskal-Wallis H test was used to compare the number of micro-hemorrhages between groups."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nWe obtained a sample of retrospective data from 313 previously deployed service members with blast injury, seen at the ISCRC from 2009 through 2014. Neuropsychological reports were available for 61 of the subjects referred to MEB, which included an assessment of the validity of the cognitive tests. Ten subjects were excluded because it was concluded that the cognitive test results were invalid. This reduced the total sample size to\nN\n=\u2009303.\nPatients treated at the ISCRC are referred typically by their medical officer or other healthcare provider. In some cases, patients self-refer for evaluation. The center currently receives about 40 new referrals per month. A nurse practitioner or physician assistant as well as a team of nurses evaluate the patient initially and review the history of brain injury. Subsequently, patients are evaluated by an interdisciplinary team: speech and language, physical therapy, occupational therapy, behavioral health, neurology, sports medicine, and pastoral counseling. Providers from each discipline determine whether the patient requires their specific services based on their symptoms and functional impairment.\nAfter the initial evaluations, the patient and providers meet as a team to discuss the recommended treatment plan and next steps. Evaluation and care are provided in a collaborative environment that promotes physical, psychological, and spiritual health. Interdisciplinary care is facilitated by the colocation of these providers in the ISCRC. Follow-up treatment team meetings are scheduled every four weeks until discharge to reassess progress in the program, make necessary adjustments, and plan for eventual discharge. The typical patient moves through the program over a 12-week period. Patients are offered traditional medical treatment as well as complementary medical programs including yoga, iRest\n\u00ae\nmeditation, cognitive behavioral therapy groups, acupuncture, mindfulness-based stress reduction, art therapy, therapeutic writing, equine facilitated communication, and therapeutic photography. According to internal ISCRC tracking data, approximately 80% of the service members who participate in the program return to full duty.\nInformation from clinical records, neuropsychological tests, and self-report measures were tested individually for association with MEB status. In addition, we derived quantitative measures of regional white matter integrity from the diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. Patient information was collected from a variety of sources. Some data were retrieved from the electronic Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA) medical record. The MRI data were retrieved from the picture archiving and communication system (PACS) at Camp Lejeune. Other information was retrieved manually from the patient's clinic notes, including reported symptoms and history of brain injury. All patient data were de-identified and coded with a study-specific identifier at Camp Lejeune before transfer to the University of Pennsylvania for analysis.\nAll of the variables in the data set have some degree of missing data. Patients seen more recently have more data because the use of standardized tests and questionnaires has expanded at ISCRC over the time span of the study. This means the statistical tests have different power because the sample size varies substantially. We identify the sample size for each test with a lower case\nn\n.\n\nPopulation characteristics and medical histories\nLimited demographic information and individual history were recorded where available. Patient demographics are summarized in\nTable 1\n. To protect patient privacy, demographic information was limited to sex, race, and marital status. Individual age was not recorded in the data set; based on internal clinic records, the average age of the population seen is 27.9 years with 48% of patients less than age 26. Before injury, all subjects were on full active duty and required to meet the physical and cognitive standards of active duty Marines.\nTable\n1.\nPatient Characteristics and Traumatic Brain Injury History\nVariable name/MEB status\nMEB\nRTD\nOther\nRace, White\n27\n65\n27\nRace, Black\n1\n5\n2\nRace, Asian\n0\n3\n0\nRace, Other\n9\n12\n3\nRace, NA\n48\n93\n8\nSex, Male\n83\n176\n40\nSex, Female\n2\n2\n0\nMarital status, Married\n46\n77\n25\nMarital status, Single\n12\n33\n9\nMarital status, Divorced / separated\n9\n18\n3\nMarital status, NA\n18\n50\n3\nNumber of deployments (median, interquartile range)\n2, 1\u20133\n2, 1\u20133\n2, 1\u20133\n1 TBI blast\n15\n52\n11\n2 TBI, blast\n12\n18\n6\n2 TBI, mix blast and nonblast\n7\n20\n6\n3+ TBI blast\n12\n27\n5\n3+ TBI, mix blast and nonblast\n39\n61\n12\nOpen in a separate window\nMEB, medical evaluation board; RTD, return to duty.\n\nInformation from clinical histories\nThe patient history contains, in narrative form, self-reported individual and family medical history including history of TBI, reports of symptoms, and other information related to the patient recorded by the examining physician. Blast TBI history was determined by patient report in the medical record. Following standard definitions, a TBI was classified as mild if the reported loss of consciousness and/or confusion and disorientation was shorter than 30\u2009min. A data structure was defined to encode information as either numerical (e.g., number of reported blast injuries) or categorical (e.g., was there a blast injury caused by an improvised explosive device [IED], Yes/No). Records were reviewed manually, and the extracted data was recorded in a spreadsheet.\nWe recorded the number of head traumas from blast and lifetime total concussions, including injuries sustained before military service. In addition, we recorded details about blast exposures when they were present in the clinical notes, including devices of blast injury, the estimated proximity to the device, and the location of the individual at the time of injury.\n\nStandardized tests and surveys\nIn addition to the narrative history, standardized tests and surveys were administered to some patients. Most of these have now become standard at the clinic. The tests included in the study are:\nAlcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)\nThis is a 10-item questionnaire that screens for hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption, developed by the World Health Organization.\n13\nHeadache Impact Test (HIT-6)\nThis is a headache-related quality of life score.\n14\nThe HIT-6 is a six-item questionnaire that assesses an individual's perception of headache burden over the past month.\n15\n,\n16\nNeurobehavioral Symptoms Inventory (NSI)\nThis is a questionnaire measuring self-reported symptoms of concussion.\n17\nThe variant of the NSI test used at Camp Lejeune is the \u201cNSI-22,\u201d containing 22 questions. Four of the symptoms (concentration, memory, difficulty making decisions, and slower thinking) are related to cognitive impairments. The NSI has been validated in a population of veterans from the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n16\nThe NSI is currently being used by both the U.S. Department of Defense and the Veterans Administration as part of their Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom TBI evaluation process of post-concussional symptoms and as a core outcome measure of concussion treatment.\n18\u201320\nPatient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9)\nThis is an assessment of depression where subjects are asked to rate the frequency in which they experienced eight depressive symptoms in the past two weeks; the ninth question addresses thoughts of suicide.\n21\nPittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)\nThis is a self-rated questionnaire that assesses sleep quality and disturbances over a one-month time interval.\n22\nNineteen individual items generate seven component scores including subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction.\nPTSD Checklist, Military Version (PCLM)\nThis is a 17-item self-report checklist of PTSD symptoms for a military population based closely on the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV)\ncriteria. Respondents rate each item from 1 (\u201cnot at all\u201d) to 5 (\u201cextremely\u201d) to indicate the degree to which they have been bothered by that particular symptom over the past month. The PCLM has a recommended cutoff score of 50 for indicating a probable diagnosis of combat-related PTSD.\n23\nRepeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neurological Status (RBANS)\nThis comprises 12 individual subtests (list learning, story memory, figure copy, line orientation, digit span, coding, picture naming, semantic fluency, list recall, list recognition, story recall, and figure recall) similar to those of independently developed neuropsychological measures. It provides a measure of functioning across a variety of cognitive domains, with an administration time of 30\u2009min.\n24\nSubtest raw scores are converted to index scores for six general areas: immediate memory, visuospatial/constructional ability, language, attention, delayed memory, and overall function.\n25\nThe RBANS is a widely used measure of cognitive functioning and has been validated to assess cognitive functioning among a variety of populations, including TBI,\n26\nand has been used extensively in studies with the military population. In a study by Mckay and associates,\n27\nthe RBANS was demonstrated to be a clinically valid and reliable tool in the brief screening of individuals who experience a TBI.\n\nMRI data\nNeuroimaging data was acquired on a 1.5T Siemens Espree scanner. The standard neuroimaging protocol at the TBI clinic includes sagittal T1 and axial T2 and fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) images and an axial diffusion-weighted imaging series. Diffusion was measured along three orthogonal planes, at b-values of (0, 500, and 1000) s mm\n2\n. The earliest FLAIR data (2009\u20132010) had a resolution of 0.94\u2009\u00d7\u20090.94\u2009\u00d7\u20096.5\u2009mm\n3\n(\nn\n=\u200962). The majority of images after 2010 had an in-plane resolution of 0.45\u2009\u00d7\u20090.45\u2009mm\n2\n(\nn\n=\u2009167), but some were acquired at intermediate resolutions of approximately 0.75\u2009\u00d7\u20090.75\u2009mm\n2\nin plane and 6.5 or 5.2\u2009mm-thick slices (\nn\n=\u200943). The diffusion images were almost all acquired at similar resolution, either 1.25\u2009\u00d7\u20091.25\u2009\u00d7\u20096.5\u2009mm\n3\n(\nn\n=\u2009137) or 1.2\u2009\u00d7\u20091.2\u2009\u00d7\u20096.5\u2009mm\n3\n(\nn\n=\u2009113), with a few later scans acquired at the highest resolution of 0.6\u2009\u00d7\u20090.6\u2009\u00d7\u20095.2\u2009mm\n2\n(\nn\n=\u200922). In all cases, apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) were computed on the scanner, and these were used for analysis.\nTo analyze the ADC in white matter, we transferred regions of interest (ROIs) from a standard template brain to each subject brain by image registration, using the open-source Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) toolkit.\n28\nThe labels are defined in the International Consortium of Brain Mapping-diffusion tensor imaging-81 (ICBM\n-\nDTI-81) atlas and identify major white matter tracts in the MNI152 brain template space.\n29\nFour ROIs were selected to test for association with MEB status: the genu of corpus callosum, the splenium of corpus callosum, the posterior limb of the internal capsule (bilateral), and the anterior corona radiata (ACR) (bilateral). These regions have been found to have anisotropy changes in multiple DTI studies of TBI.\n30\nOther white matter ROIs including the cingulum and uncinate fasciculus were also abnormal in several studies in the meta-analysis, but the size and curvature of these structures made them too difficult to reliably segment in our data.\nTransferring labels from the MNI152 template to individual subjects involves image registration of images with very different contrasts and spatial resolution. To meet this challenge, we broke the registration problem down into a series of simpler registrations, which were combined to map the white matter ROIs to each individual image. The first step was the construction of a population-specific template (\nFig. 1\n). The population template was constructed by iteratively registering and averaging FLAIR images from 100 randomly chosen subjects.\n31\nThe population template has 1\u2009mm\n3\nspatial resolution, like the MNI152 template: by averaging information from a large number of subjects, we were able to produce a reasonable interpolation between the 6.5-mm\u2013thick slices of the individual images.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nThe registration pipeline for apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) analysis. (\na\n) The population template is built from 100 randomly selected fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. (\nb\n) The registration pipeline computes a series of transforms that are combined to warp ADC and white matter regions of interest to the subject space.\nEach individual structural image was then registered to the population template. Because the population template is an average of images from the same population of subjects, using the same MRI imaging sequence and scanner, a population template helps accomplish unbiased and robust registration.\n32\nThe registration from the population template to MNI152 was computed once and applied consistently for all subject images.\nThe final registration shown in\nFigure 1\naligns the ADC image from each subject to the subject's FLAIR image. The two images are already closely aligned because they were acquired at the same time. A small correction accounts for patient motion and geometric distortions that differ between MRI sequences.\nThe subject FLAIR images were segmented into three tissue classes: cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), gray matter, and white matter, using the Atropos tool in ANTs.\n33\nEach slice of the FLAIR image was segmented independently. A k-means classifier with three classes was used to initialize the segmentation. After each slice had been segmented, the mean intensities of gray matter, white matter, and CSF were computed over the whole brain, and the slice-by-slice segmentation was repeated with the k-means initialized consistently for each slice. On visual inspection, the segmentation appeared successful at segmenting CSF voxels from those containing gray or white matter; however, the separation of gray from white matter voxels was less reliable, especially in the internal capsule ROI (\nFig. 2\n). Therefore, we did not exclude voxels within the white matter ROIs (defined by registration from the MNI template) if they were segmented as gray matter in the FLAIR image.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nRegion of interest (ROI) post-processing. The labels are first warped to the subject image from the template. The warped labels are refined by removing voxels where the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is above a maximum threshold, or where the segmentation of the fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) image classifies the voxel as cerebrospinal fluid.\nAfter registration and segmentation of the native FLAIR images, we resampled the FLAIR images to a consistent resolution of 0.65\u2009\u00d7\u20090.65\u2009\u00d7\u20096.5\u2009mm to minimize any bias in the resampling of the template ROIs into the subject FLAIR images. The registration warps were composed and applied once, transferring the white matter ROIs from MNI152 to the resampled subject FLAIR image with a single interpolation. The distortion-corrected ADC images were also resampled into the same FLAIR image space.\nThe ROIs were then masked with the FLAIR segmentations to remove voxels classified as CSF, and further masked with an ADC threshold to remove voxels with partial CSF volume. The ADC in normal white matter is relatively stable around 700\u2009\u03bcm\n2\nms\n\u2212\n1\n, and we removed voxels where the ADC was greater than 1000\u2009\u03bcm\n2\nms\n\u2212\n1\n(\nFig. 2\n). To verify that this threshold was well above normal white matter variance, we computed the group mean of each individual's median ADC in labeled voxels before masking (748\u2009\u03bcm\n2\nms\n\u2212\n1\n), and the mean interquartile range (IQR) (110\u2009\u03bcm\n2\nms\n\u2212\n1\n). The final masked labels were reviewed manually, and six of 278 ADC images were removed from the analysis because one or more of the ROI labels were of low quality because of registration or segmentation errors.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe main aim of this work was to construct a multivariate model that could predict MEB or RTD outcomes. Because currently there is no single prognostic indicator for mTBI, a variety of data is collected and assessed by the ISCRC medical team; however, these have not been combined previously into a multivariate statistical model. We hypothesized that a multivariate model could predict MEB or RTD outcomes. Models with too many variables, however, are liable to overfit to training data and generalize poorly. We therefore performed exploratory univariate tests and selected variables based on the univariate results as well as the availability and completeness of data and previous evidence in the TBI literature. The\np\nvalues of the univariate tests are uncorrected for multiple comparisons.\nDichotomous categorical variables were tested for association with MEB status, using the \u201cepiR\u201d package (\nhttps://CRAN.R-project.org/package=epiR\n) in R (\nhttp://r-project.org\n). We report the incidence risk ratio (IRR, also called relative risk) of MEB referral between dichotomous groups, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) as well as a\np\nvalue from a chi-square test for differences in outcome between groups with and without exposure to a hypothesized risk factor.\nFor example, consider a test of whether marital status is correlated with the incidence of MEB referral. Among married patients, 46 were referred to MEB and 77 RTD. The incidence risk of MEB is therefore 46 / (46+77)\u2009=\u200937.4%. The incidence risk differs from the odds (46/77\u2009=\u20090.60), although the two become similar when the incidence risk is small. Among nonmarried patients, 21 were referred to MEB and 51 RTD, an incidence risk of 29.2%. This results in an IRR of 1.28, suggesting that married patients are more likely to be referred to MEB. The estimated 95% CI for the IRR is (0.84, 1.96), however, which spans 1.0, suggesting that the effect is not significant. The corresponding\np\nvalue is 0.24, and we would not reject the null hypothesis that marital status is uncorrelated with MEB.\nIn the\nresults\nsection, we report the total numbers in the MEB and RTD group (\nnM\nand\nnR\n), the IRR, CI, and associated\np\nvalue. For the example above, this would be\nnM\n=\u200967,\nnR\n=\u2009128, IRR\u2009=\u20091.28, CI\u2009=\u2009(0.84, 1.96),\np\n=\u20090.24. Full incidence risk data are listed in\nTable 2\n. Point estimates and CIs for both the IRR and odds ratio may be computed from this table using the \u201cepi.2by2\u201d function in epiR.\nTable\n2.\nCategorical Variables Tested with \u201cepiR\u201d\n*\nCategorical variable\nnM\nnR\nTotal\nIncidence risk (%)\nOdds\nNumber of TBI 3+\n51\n88\n139\n36.7\n0.58\nNumber of TBI 1\n15\n52\n67\n22.4\n0.29\nNumber of TBI 1 or 2\n34\n90\n124\n27.4\n0.38\nDistance to blast \u22643m\n21\n37\n58\n36.2\n0.57\nDistance to blast >3m\n18\n33\n51\n35.3\n0.55\nLocation at blast: vehicle enclosed\n27\n67\n94\n28.7\n0.40\nLocation at blast: dismounted\n23\n46\n69\n33.3\n0.50\nLocation at blast: vehicle open\n8\n20\n28\n28.6\n0.40\nOpen in a separate window\nTBI\n, traumatic brain injury.\n*\nEach test compares two rows of this table\u2014for example, 3+ TBI vs. 1 TBI. The sample sizes for medical evaluation board (MEB) (nM) and return to duty (RTD) (nR) reported in the text are the sum of the two rows used in the test.\nFor continuous data, we performed two-sample, two-tailed\nt\ntests, without assuming equal variance between the MEB and RTD groups (Welch\nt\ntest). The\np\nvalues are reported directly by the \u201c\nt\ntest\u201d function in R. The\nt\nstatistics are positive where the sample mean of the MEB group \u03bcM is greater than that of the RTD group \u03bcR.\nFinally, we combined variables of interest to predict MEB or RTD status using a binomial logistic regression, implemented in the \u201cglm\u201d method in R. In this model, the dependent variable is MEB or RTD status, encoded as 1 for MEB and 0 for RTD. The model estimates the probability of MEB referral given the variables of interest."

Diffusion imaging was performed at multiple shells: 5 b-values (250, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500\u2009sec/mm\n2\n) along with multiple diffusion encoding directions (6, 20, 20, 30, 60, respectively) using multiband (factor of two) echo-planar imaging (EPI) for accelerated acquisitions with anterior-posterior (AP) phase encoding direction. Three non-weighted diffusion images (b\u2009=\u20090\u2009sec/mm\n2\n) also were acquired. Other imaging parameters were: field of view\u2009=\u2009220\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u2009220\u2009mm, acquisition matrix\u2009=\u200988\u2009\u00d7\u200988, image resolution\u2009=\u20092.5\u2009\u00d7\u20092.5\u2009\u00d7\u20092.5\u2009mm\n3\n, number of slices\u2009=\u200956, repetition time/echo time\u2009=\u20094900/95\u2009msec, bandwidth\u2009=\u20092104\u2009Hz/pixel, and a generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions factor of two. For geometric distortion correction, an additional image with b\u2009=\u20090\u2009sec/mm\n2\nwas acquired with the same imaging parameters but with reversed (PA) phase encoding direction. The total acquisition time is about 12\u2009min.\n\nImage analysis\nDiffusion image processing\nThe pre-processing steps for the diffusion images include Marchenko-Pastur principal component analysis denoising,\n24\nGibbs correction,\n25\ngeometric EPI distortion correction (FSL's function, \u2018topup\u2019), eddy current distortion and motion correction (FSL's function, \u201ceddy\u201d), and outliers detection.\n26\nIn-house image processing software developed in MATLAB R2016a (The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA) was used to calculate maps of the WMTI metrics (AWF, D\naxon\n,\n,\n, tortuosity \u03b1), as well as both DTI metrics (FA, MD, axial diffusivity [AD], radial diffusivity [RD]) and DKI metrics (MK, axial kurtosis [AK], radial kurtosis [RK]).\n\nTract-based spatial statistics\nVoxel-wise analyses were performed using standard procedures of tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS).\n27\nSubject FA maps were registered to the FA template (\nhttp://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FMRIB58_FA\n) and voxel-wise statistics were performed on FA values projected onto the WM skeleton by looking for local maximum values perpendicular to the skeleton. All other parametric maps underwent the same transformations and processes.

For TBSS analysis, age and sex were included as covariates, and the significance level was set at\np\n<\u20090.05 with the family-wise error (FWE) correction for multiple comparisons using the TBSS package.\n27\nA receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted using MedCalc version 17.5.3 (MedCalc Software bvba, Ostend, Belgium) to identify a threshold value for a significant diffusion metric to discriminate mTBI patients from controls. The threshold was identified by maximizing the Youden index, implying that characterizing subjects as test positive or negative for mTBI according to the threshold maximized the average of sensitivity and specificity. Corresponding areas under the ROC curve (AUCs), sensitivities, and specificities were calculated."

    "Methods": "Participants\nTwenty subjects with TBI were recruited from the Neurological Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at the Queen's Medical Center (QMC) in Honolulu, Hawaii. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the QMC, and all TBI subjects had proxy consent provided by their legal guardians. Twenty subjects were enrolled; 3 were excluded because of medical instability that prevented MRI scanning. Seventeen subjects were able to complete MRI scanning, and 2 subjects were excluded from analysis because of imaging artifact. Therefore, fifteen subjects were included in the final imaging analysis. TBI subjects had no pre-existing neurological or psychiatric illness, an admission Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) <13, and were mechanically ventilated and medically stable enough to tolerate MRI within the first 21 days post-injury (mean duration of injury at the time of scan, 10.47\u2009\u00b1\u20096.77 days). During the brain imaging acquisition, all TBI subjects received mechanical ventilation, were lightly sedated with benzodiazepines and analgesia, and were monitored by the NICU team. Eighteen age- and sex-matched healthy controls without a history of TBI or any chronic medical or neuropsychiatric illnesses were also recruited and studied as comparison subjects.\n\nImage acquisition\nA 3.0-Tesla Siemens TIM Trio Scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) with a 12-channel head coil was used for all MR scans. The MRI Protocol included a three-plane localizer (repetition time/echo time (TR/TE)\u2009=\u200920/5\u2009ms; 1 average) and a sagittal three-dimensional magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) scan (TR/TE/TI [inversion time]\u2009=2200/4.11/1000\u2009ms; 1 average; 208\u2009\u00d7\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009144 matrix) that was used to assess structural abnormalities. In addition, a fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) scan (TR/TE/TI\u2009=\u20099100/84/2500\u2009ms) was performed for further assessment of gross white matter abnormalities. To evaluate microstructural abnormalities, diffusion measures were obtained using the following parameters: bmax\u2009=\u20091000s/mm\n2\n; 12 directions; TR\u2009=\u20093700\u2009ms; TE\u2009=\u200988\u2009ms; in-plane resolution\u2009=\u20091.7\u2009\u00d7\u20091.7\u2009mm; and 4\u2009mm axial slices with a 1-mm gap. For each slice, four averages with one additional b\u2009=\u20090 image were acquired. All images were visually inspected to ensure quality of DTI data. Standard quality assurance procedures in DTIStudio (DWI standard deviation maps) were used to identify and eliminate slices and volumes that were affected by motion. All TBI patients were intubated, sedated, and given pharmacological paralysis as needed to avoid head motion artifact. Two of the 17 participants' scans had excess artifacts with distortions on the DTI attributed to large areas of hemorrhage and were not included in the final analyses.\n\nImage processing and diffusion-tensor imaging analysis\nDTI data sets were first transferred to DTIStudio (\nwww.MriStudio.org\n) running on a Windows platform, and motion correction was then performed before calculation of a tensor field as previously described.\n10\nUsing dual-channel large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM), each tensor field was then transformed to the corresponding JHU-MNI atlas space using a nonlinear transformation process.\n11\nAfter the LDDMM registration to a single-subject, skull-stripped MNI atlas, 79 brain regions were automatically segmented in each hemisphere. As previously described, FA, AD (the first eigenvalue), RD (mean of the second and third eigenvalues), and mean diffusivity (MD; mean of the three eigenvalues) were calculated for each participant in each region of interest (ROI) as defined by the JHU-MNI atlas.\n10\nPre-processing and quality assessment for the scans were also performed using the Mahalanobis distance, which provides information regarding deviation from the center of the distributions of the variables. This statistical method of using the deviation maps also identified and eliminated slices and volumes that were affected by motion and ensured accurate registration. From the 79 segmented regions, 25 ROIs from the major white matter tracts and subcortical regions were selected from both hemisphere for further analyses. These ROIs were chosen based on the existing literature regarding brain regions affected in patients with TBI.\n12\u201320\nThese regions include the caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, anterior, superior, and posterior corona radiata, corticospinal tract, superior longitudinal fasciculus, posterior limb and retrolenticular internal capsule, genu, body, and splenium of the corpus callosum, and thalamus (\nFigs. 1\u20135\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nDTI measures in genu (GCC) and splenium of corpus callosum (SCC).

Scatter plots show higher RD and MD values in TBI patients (red dots) compared to controls (blue triangles) bilaterally. Only 2 TBI patients had lesions within the left PCR (red dots with black outline in scatterplots, and white arrow, top middle MRI). Three-dimensional representations of the left (yellow) and right (blue) PCR ROIs are shown on an axial MRI (middle bottom panel). See\nTable 2\nand text for corrected\np\nvalues.

Scatter plots show higher MD values in both thalamus of TBI patients (red dots) compared to controls (blue triangles); however, only the left thalamic MD remained significant after Bonferroni corrections.

ANCOVA, analysis of covariance; MD, mean diffusivity; ROI, region of interest; TBI, traumatic brain injury.\nIn total, 11 of the regions had both left and right while the corpus callosum regions had the left and right combined, yielding 25 ROIs measured for MD, but only 17 ROIs were measured for FA, AD, and RD because these three measures are not interpretable in the subcortical gray matter due to the many cross-fibers. However, measures from TBI patients' ROIs that included visible brain lesions were removed from the final analyses for the\np\nvalues presented in the\nResults\nsection because blood products can cause DTI signal dropout.

Student's\nt\n-test or chi-square was used to assess group differences in demographic variables. One-way analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were utilized to assess group differences in DTI metrics for the selected brain regions between TBI versus control groups. Holms-Bonferroni correction of multiple comparisons\n21\nwas applied for each DTI metric.\np\nvalues <0.05 that survived Holms-Bonferroni correction were considered statistically significant. Age was included as a covariate because DTI measures change significantly with age.\n22\nSpecifically, regional FA has been demonstrated to decline in a predictable fashion in association with normal aging.\n23\nTherefore, control subjects were carefully age matched as represented in\nFigures 1\u20135\n. Additionally, Shapiro-Wilk tests were used to evaluate the normality of DTI measures in each ROIs that showed group differences, separately for TBI and control subjects. For measures that deviated from normality, nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to confirm ANCOVA results (group differences)."

    "Methods": "Experimental animals\nAll animals in this study were used under strict accordance to the Purdue University Animal Care and Use Committee protocol and guidelines. A total of 61 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Envigo RMS, Inc., Indianapolis, IN) ranging from 200 to 400\u2009g were used. Animals were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (80\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg) through intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections. Animals used for survival surgeries were acclimated to animal housing for at least 1 week pre-surgery.\n\nSpinal cord surgical extraction\nAfter anesthesia and sensory deprivation, a transcardial perfusion was performed with cold oxygenated (95% O\n2\n, 5% CO\n2\n) Krebs solution. Rapid removal of the vertebrae column was followed by a complete laminectomy and careful excision of the spinal cord by cutting spinal roots. The dura mater was independently removed and ventral white matter strips were collected by subdividing the spinal cord twice longitudinally. Tissue segments were incubated in fresh Krebs solution for 60\u2009min at room temperature and bubbled continuously with 95% O\n2\n, 5% CO\n2\nto maintain a pH of 7.2\u20137.4. Krebs solution contained (mM): 124.0 NaCl, 2.0 KCl, 1.2 KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 1.3 MgSO\n4\n, 26.0 NaHCO\n3\n, 5.6 sodium ascorbate, 10.0 dextrose, and 1.2 CaCl\n2\n.\n\nDouble sucrose gap recordings\nSpinal cord sections were placed on a double sucrose gap recording chamber for functional assessments.\n6\n,\n15\n,\n30\n,\n41\nIn the recording chamber, spinal cord segments were placed across the central compartment, adjacent sucrose gap compartments, and outside wells. The central compartment was continuously perfused (2\u2009mL/min) with 37\u00b0C Krebs solution, sucrose gaps were perfused (1\u2009mL/min) with isotonic sucrose (320\u2009mM), and the outer wells were filled with isotonic KCl (120\u2009mM). To keep compartments isolated, vacuum grease and microplastic plates were used to seal spinal cord tissue on both sides of the sucrose gap chambers. Ag/Cl electrodes in the central and outer KCl compartments were used to stimulate and record axonal conduction. Electrodes in the central compartment were connected to an instrument ground. Axons were stimulated with 0.1-ms constant current unipolar pulses at one end and recorded at the opposite end. All conduction occurred along the length of the central compartment. Recordings and data acquisition were accomplished using a bridge amplifier (Neuro Data Instruments, new York, NY) and custom Labview software (National Instruments, Woburn, MA) on a Dell PC\n\u2122\n(Dell, Round Rock, TX).\n\nCompound action potentials\nCompound action potentials (CAPs) are the spatiotemporal summation of all single-unit action potentials fired by individual axons. Assessment of CAP amplitudes was measured through constant application of 0.1-ms unipolar pulses every 3\u2009sec with a supramaximal stimulus (110% of the maximal stimulus). Multiple CAP waveforms were captured at pre-determined times and averaged for subsequent analysis. In addition, real-time plots of the CAP amplitude through the course of the experiment were recorded and saved for future reference.\n6\n,\n15\n,\n30\n,\n41\n\nActivation threshold\nSpinal cord segments stimulated in the double sucrose gap recording chamber were assessed for axon activation thresholds. Large-caliber axons were activated at lower voltages whereas small-caliber axons remained inactive until higher voltages were applied. Current-voltage tests were performed by applying stimuli at increasing voltages from 1.85 to 6.5\u2009V. Each voltage was repeated five times and an average was taken for analysis. The stimulus was delivered at a frequency of one every 3\u2009sec.\n\nAbsolute and relative refractory periods\nRefractory periods were measured using twin stimuli (110% the maximal stimulus) with an increasing interstimulus interval. The interval ranged from 0.5 to 15\u2009msec, where each stimulus interval was repeated five times and an average taken. The amplitude of the first CAP remained the same for each twin stimuli. Absolute refractory periods were defined by the time required to illicit a second CAP, whereas the relative refractory periods were defined by the time required to illicit a second CAP with an amplitude that was 90% or greater than that of the first CAP.\n\nFrequency stimulation response\nAxonal conduction response to frequency stimulation was measured over a short period of time where trains of repetitive stimuli at a supramaximal stimulus (110% of the maximal stimulus) were applied. Spinal cord segments were stimulated with low- and high-frequency stimulation at 500 and 1000\u2009Hz for 100\u2009ms, which elicited 50 and 100 CAPs respectively. The last three CAPs were averaged and expressed as a percentage of the first CAP. Each measurement was repeated five times and an average was taken for analysis.\n\nEx vivo\nspinal cord stretch injury model\nAn SCI device was used to induce a constant degree of stretch that is detailed in previous publications.\n6\n,\n15\n,\n42\n,\n43\nThe spinal cord strip was placed across the center compartment in the double sucrose gap recording chamber, resting on a flat raised stage with a central hole. A stretch rod released from a pre-determined height fell at \u223c1.5\u2009m/s on to the cord to induce the stretch injury. To stabilize tissue through the injury procedure, a nylon mesh was laid on top of the cord in the chamber. Immediately post-injury, the rod and nylon mesh were removed.\n\nIn vivo\ncontusive injury model\nAnimals were anesthetized pre-surgery as described above. The dorsal surface of the T-10 spinal cord was exposed after removal of the spinous process and vertebral lamina. The exposed surface of the spinal cord was injured with an NYU (New York University) weight-drop impactor using a 10-g rod 3\u2009mm in diameter. Injury was generated by dropping the rod at heights of 12.5\u2009mm (mild) or 25\u2009mm (moderate). Sham animals received a laminectomy of T-10 vertebrae only. Post-operative care included daily manual bladder expression in contused rats until reflexive control of bladder function returned. Saline (3\u2009mL) was administered subcutaneously to prevent dehydration.\n44\u201346\nFor the purpose of\nex vivo\nevaluation, 3\u20136 months post-SCI, spinal cord tissue was excised and placed in the double sucrose gap recording chamber.\nIn vivo\nevaluation, both motor and sensory behavior, were conducted 2 weeks post-injury.\n\nMotor function behavioral assessment\nLocomotion of animals was assessed using a rotarod test 2 weeks post\u2013moderate contusive SCI. Rotarod performance test was used to assess the strength and coordination in the lower extremities known to be impaired in SCI.\n47\nRats were tested on the rotarod at increasing revolutions per minute (rpm) of 0\u201330\u2009rpm over 3\u2009min and then remained at 30\u2009rpm. They were assessed for the time on rotarod and rpm the animal could sustain before falling off. Each trial was repeated three times.\n\nNociception behavioral assessments\nImpacts of potassium channel blockers (4-AP and 4-AP-3MeOH) on neuropathic pain behaviors were investigated through mechanical allodynia and cold hyperalgesia tests. Specifically, a hindlimb von Frey and cold test was conducted to assess the \u201cbelow-SCI-level\u201d hypersensitivity. Either 1 or 5\u2009mg/kg of PCBs were administrated by i.p. injection 2 weeks post-SCI. Behavioral tests time points were 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 24\u2009h after PCB injection.\n\nMechanical allodynia\nAs an indicator of mechanical hyper-reflexia, a foot withdrawal threshold to mechanical stimuli was used. Rats were placed on a metal mesh floor, covered by a transparent plastic box, and allowed to acclimate alone for 10\u2009min before testing. Mechanical stimulation used calibrated von Frey filaments: 0.4, 0.6, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, and 15.0\u2009g (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL). Each filament was applied 3\u20135\u2009sec perpendicular to the plantar surface of the hindlimb with sufficient bending force at a frequency of one per minute. A positive response was considered rapid withdrawal of the hindlimb with or without licking and biting. When a positive response was observed, a lower-grade filament was then applied, and in the absence of a response, the next greater stimulus filament was presented. The 50% of the mechanical thresholds were calculated based on the up-down method.\n48\n\nCold hyperalgesia\nSensitivity to cold application was measured using the 100% acetone-evoked evaporative cooling test.\n49\n,\n50\nSimilar to mechanical hyper-reflexia, animals were placed on a metal mesh floor, covered with a transparent plastic box, and acclimated to their surroundings for 10\u2009min before testing. Acetone (0.05\u2009mL) was applied 2\u2009mm from the plantar surface of the hind paw, and withdrawal or hind paw licking response indicated cold hyperreflexia. The acetone was applied five times to each plantar paw at intervals of 5\u2009min.\n\nPharmacological agents\n4-AP (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 4-AP-3-MeOH (Matrix Scientific, Elgin, SC) were used in all experiments. For spinal cord segments, each compound was first dissolved into ddH\n2\nO to make a stock solution of 10\u2009mM. Before use for recordings, each compound was diluted to desirable concentration in normal Krebs solution.\n29\n,\n30\nSolutions were continuously oxygenated and maintained at 37\u00b0C.\nFor behavioral assessments after acute application of PCBs, both 4-AP and 4-AP-3-MeOH were dissolved in sterilized phosphate-buffered saline at a concentration of 1\u2009mg/mL (pH at 7.4). The final injection volume was based on the weight of the rats, aiming to reach a final concentration of 1 or 5\u2009mg/kg. Therefore, for a rat with a body weight of 250\u2009g, 1.25\u2009mL was needed for a dosage of 5\u2009mg/kg, and 0.25\u2009mL was needed to reach a dosage of 1\u2009mg/kg. Each compound was applied through i.p. injections 2 weeks post\u2013contusive SCI.\n\nStatistical analysis\nFor comparison of electrophysiological recordings, a paired Student's\nt\n-test was used. The Pearson correlation coefficient (\nr\n) was used to evaluate the linear correlation of some electrophysiology measurements. One-way analysis of variance and Tukey's honestly significant difference were used to detect significance between groups for behavioral motor and pain assessments. Statistical significance was measured at\np\n<\u20090.05, and averages are shown as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM)."

    "Methods": "All procedures followed National Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Penn State Hershey College of Medicine. Male Wistar rats \u22658 weeks old (totaln=\u2009104, Hsd:WI, Stock 001, Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) on entrance into the experiment, and initially weighing 175\u2013200\u2009g were used and double housed in a room maintained at 21\u201324\u00b0C and a 12:12-h light-dark cycle with food and water providedad libitum.\n\nSurgical procedures and animal care\nRats were assigned randomly for SCI or surgical control surgery, and each group was divided further into three-day (\nn\n=\u200920 total) and three-week (\nn\n=\u200920 total) post-surgical study groups. For studies of colonic inflammation, two additional T3-SCI or surgical control cohorts of one-day (\nn\n=\u200916 total) and seven-day (\nn\n=\u200916 total) post-surgical duration were generated as well as a separate set of three-day (\nn\n=\u200916 total) and three-week (\nn\n=\u200916 total) T3-SCI or surgical control cohorts. Before surgical procedures, rats were anesthetized deeply with isoflurane (2\u20133%, 1\u2009L/min O\n2\n) as necessary to achieve areflexia (absence of palpebral reflex) and were maintained at 35.5\u201337.5\u00b0C on a feedback-controlled heating block; rectal temperature was monitored continuously (TCAT 2LV, Physitemp Instruments, Clifton, NJ).\nAs described previously,\n16\nall animals were administered ophthalmic ointment to both eyes, buprenorphine SR (1\u2009mg/kg, subcutaneously [SC], Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc., Richmond, VA) to alleviate post-operative pain, and antibiotic agents (Enroflox, 10\u2009mg/mL concentration at 1\u2009mL/kg SC, Bayer, Shawnee Mission, KS) to reduce post-surgical infection before any surgical manipulation. Once a deep plane of anesthesia was achieved, the skin overlying vertebral thoracic levels 1\u20133 (T1\u2013T3) was shaved and cleaned with three alternating applications of Nolvasan (chlorhexidine acetate, Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA) and ethanol. The surgical site was incised 3\u20134\u2009mm along the midline, and the underlying spinous processes were cleared of all musculature. Using fine tipped rongeurs, spinal T3 was exposed via laminectomy of the T2 spinous process, which extended laterally to the T2 transverse processes.\nThe rats were placed in the Infinite Horizon controlled impact device (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, LLC, Lexington, KY) and clamped via the T1 and T3 spinous processes. Once secure, a rapid 300\u2009kDyn force (15\u2009sec dwell time) was applied to the cord and overlying dura. Procedures for the control animals were the same as for spinal injury except that the spinal cord and surrounding dura mater were not disturbed after laminectomy. On completing the surgical procedure, the muscle tissue overlying the lesion site was closed in anatomical layers with polyglactin suture and the skin closed with 9\u2009mm wound clips. Wound clips were removed five to seven days after operation as necessary. Animals were administered warmed supplemental fluids (5\u2009mL lactated Ringer solution, SC) and placed in an incubation chamber maintained at 37\n\u00b0\nC until the effects of anesthesia had subsided.\nAfter operation, animals were single housed in corncob filled animal housing tubs on a warming unit (Gaymar T-pump, Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI) to maintain a warmed environment (\u223c25\u00b0C). Because of the necessity for single housing, each cage contained segments of 8\u2009cm diameter plastic tubes as environmental enrichment. Rats that received T3-SCI received subcutaneous supplemental fluids (5\u201310\u2009mL lactated Ringer solution) twice daily, and antibiotic agents (Enroflox, 10\u2009mg/kg) once daily for five days after operation. Manual compression of the bladder was performed at least twice daily in animals with T3-SCI until the return of spontaneous voiding. The ventrum of control animals was inspected daily without need for manual compression of the bladder.\nBecause of the reduction in locomotor capacity after T3-SCI, a reservoir of chow was placed at head level to facilitate ease of access for feeding. All T3-SCI rats ingested a measureable amount each day, thereby confirming that access to chow was available. Body weight and food intake were measured daily for all animals as an index of well-being. Animals were fasted overnight before experimentation and euthanasia.\n\nIn vivo\nphysiological surgical instrumentation\nAfter three days or three weeks after the initial surgical procedure, animals were fasted overnight, water provided\nad libitum\n, before being deeply re-anesthetized for\nin vivo\nphysiological instrumentation with thiobutabarbital (Inactin; Sigma, St. Louis, MO; 75\u2013150\u2009mg/kg intravenously [IV]), which does not affect long-term cardiovascular\n17\nor gastrointestinal\n18\nautonomic function. Animals were placed on a feedback-controlled warming pad (TCAT 2LV, Physitemp Instruments) and maintained at 37\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C for the duration of the experiment.\nOnce fully anesthetized for physiological instrumentation, the animal was intubated tracheally by way of a 1\u20132\u2013cm midline incision on the ventral side of the neck caudal to the mandible toward the sternal notch. Tracheal intubation maintains an open airway and facilitates clearing of respiratory secretions if necessary. The underlying strap muscles were separated using blunt dissection at the midline to expose the trachea. The exposed trachea was isolated from the underlying esophagus to place a loop of 3-0 Ethilon\n\u2122\nsuture between the trachea and esophagus to form a ligature. The trachea was opened ventrally by making a small incision in the membrane between two of the cartilaginous rings of the trachea just caudal to the thyroid gland. A small piece of polyethylene tubing (PE-270, 5\u2009mm in length and beveled at one end) was inserted into the trachea and secured in place with the ligature. The strap muscles were returned to their proper anatomical location, and the overlying skin was secured around the tracheal tube with 3-0 Ethilon.\nPressure transducer implantation consisted of two 3.5F Mikro-Tip\n\u00ae\ncatheter pressure transducers (Millar SPR-524, Millar Instruments; Houston, TX) that were inserted into the proximal and distal colon. For the proximal colon, a midline laparotomy was made to locate the cecum. Once isolated, a small incision was made immediately distal to the cecum, and the transducer was inserted approximately 2\u2009cm. Surgical glue was used to secure the catheter and seal the incision. For the distal colon, the probe was lubricated and introduced into the rectum and distal colon such that the tip of the transducer was positioned approximately 4\u2009cm from the rectum.\nBecause excessively manipulating the colon can provoke changes in colon physiology (see\n19\n), the transducer was placed in an area of colon that was sufficiently absent of fecal pellets (\u2265 1\u2009cm) to minimize handling of the tissue by the experimenter. Fecal pellets from the distal colon were displaced only if absolutely necessary. Signals from Mikro-Tip catheters were amplified and recorded continuously on a computer using SciWorks DataWave software (DataWave Technologies; Loveland, CO), and after 1\u2009h of stabilization, 10\u2009min of baseline colonic responses were recorded from both the proximal and distal colon.\n\nTissue harvest\nAt the conclusion of\nin vivo\nphysiological experiments, deeply anesthetized rats received a pneumothorax and were exsanguinated via cutting the left ventricle of the heart. For each animal, colonic tissue (proximal and distal) was isolated and collected. Tissue samples were preserved in one of two manners: (1) Fresh tissue samples were placed in aluminum foil and then immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, or (2) for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Masson trichrome staining, or immunohistochemistry, tissue samples were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24\u2009h and then transferred to 70% ethanol for an additional 24\u2009h before paraffin embedding.\nAt the completion of intestinal tissue collection, the vertebrae encompassing the spinal cord lesion level were removed, and the entire vertebral tissue sample was post-fixed overnight in refrigerated phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 4% paraformaldehyde. After three to seven days, the dorsal surface of the individual vertebrae was removed and the spinal cord extracted for re-emersion in fresh refrigerated PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 30% sucrose before embedding for cryosectioning.\nAll rats designated for quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) quantification (\nn\n=\u20098 per each surgical condition\u2009\u00d7\u2009four post-operative time points) were euthanized without previous physiological experimentation. To gain a greater temporal picture of the inflammatory process, animals were grouped into one-, three-, and seven-day and three-week post-operative cohorts. Deeply anesthetized rats were exsanguinated via decapitation at the same time (09:00\u201310:00). For each animal, colonic tissue (proximal only) was isolated and placed in aluminum foil and then immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.\n\nHistological processing\nFor histological staining of T3-SCI lesion extent, tissue was cryosectioned (40\u2009\u03bcm thick), and alternating sections were mounted on gelatin coated slides. To compare lesion severity with the spinal cords of control animals, spinal cord sections were stained with Luxol fast blue (LFB) to visualize myelinated fibers. The LFB-stained slides were imaged digitally on a Zeiss Axioscope light microscope and Axiocam CCD camera, imported into Adobe Photoshop and contrast digitally adjusted to allow consistent identification of LFB-stained (i.e., spared) white matter.\nFor individual images, the boundaries of the tissue slice were outlined to determine cross-sectional area. A separate threshold histogram was generated, and the pixels corresponding to LFB staining above background were selected. These pixels were quantified and expressed per unit cross-sectional area.\n20\nThe lesion epicenter was defined as the section with the least proportion of LFB-stained tissue. The proximity of the T3 lesion center to the cervical enlargement precluded an appropriate determination of spinal cord cross-sectional area in undamaged tissue rostral to the injury (i.e., damaged tissue extended into the cervical enlargement as described in.\n21\nTherefore, it was necessary that the cross-sectional area of the intact spinal cords at T3 of comparably sized animals be determined for normalization purposes. The LFB-stained myelin in injured tissue was then expressed as a percent of the total spinal cord cross-sectional area as would be predicted by the intact tissue.\nWhole colon histology and histochemistry were performed using paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue samples from the colon. Two to three discontiguous portions of the sample tissue were placed in the same embedding cassette and processed in an automated Tissue-Tek VIP processor and paraffin-embedded with a Tissue-Tek TEC embedding station (Sakura Finetek USA, Torrance, CA). The\nen bloc\nsamples were cross-sectioned serially at 6\u2009\u03bcm, and multiple sets of nonadjacent serial sections were mounted on Plus-slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and processed for H&E staining or histochemical staining for collagen (Masson trichrome; Abcam; Cambridge, MA). All slides were marked with a nonidentifying numeric code to prevent observer bias during analysis.\nImage analysis of the tunica muscularis from both the proximal and distal colon cross sections were captured in three different, randomly selected, regions at 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification. Using the Zeiss image acquisition software ZEN 2, the entire tissue area and the area of only the tunica muscularis was recorded as described previously.\n22\nCollagen content of the tunica muscularis was quantitatively estimated by Masson trichrome histochemical stain to differentiate collagen fibers (blue) and muscle fibers (red) within the proximal and distal colonic tunica muscularis.\nColonic H&E sections were analyzed for quantification of colonic crypt depth and width using the same Zeiss Zen software. A minimum of three different, randomly selected, regions imaged at 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification were used. To maintain consistency of analysis, only crypts on naturally occurring submucosal folds were selected. In addition, a subset of colonic H&E sections was examined by an American College of Veterinary Pathologists diplomate also blinded to treatment and the consistency of results verified across observers. Tissues sections were analyzed by measuring the crypt depth and width and calculating crypt depth:width ratio.\nEnteric neuronal immunohistochemistry was performed using serially adjacent 6\u2009\u03bcm sections of the paraffin embedded colon tissue; samples were taken and subjected to heat-mediated antigen retrieval in 10\u2009mM sodium citrate buffer for 20\u2009min. Nonspecific antibody binding was reduced by incubation in UltraVision Protein Block (TA060PBQ; Thermo Scientific) for 5\u2009min at room temperature. The sections were incubated for 24\u2009h at 4\u00b0C in a primary antibody cocktail that comprised antihuman neuronal protein C and D antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-HuC/D; dilution 1:200; Life Technologies, A21271) and 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA). HuC/D is used commonly as an enteric pan-neuronal marker (see\n23\n), and was employed as such in our studies. After the incubation, the tissue underwent three 2\u2009min washes in wash buffer and then was incubated in a secondary antibody cocktail for 2\u2009h at room temperature (anti-mouse immunoglobulin G [IgG]-peroxidase antibody; dilution 1:100; Sigma-Aldrich, A0168 and 2% BSA). Labeling was localized using diaminobenzadine (DAB) and sections were counterstained with hematoxylin.\nUsing a previously described protocol to determine the number of neurons per enteric ganglion area,\n24\nimages of HuC/D positive ganglia from each tissue section were analyzed using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Individual ganglia demonstrate variable cross-sectional size within the intact myenteric plexus, and this might be reflected in what region of the ganglion appears in the plane of the section. While reduction of the ganglion area could be expected as a result of neuronal loss, differences in cross-sectional area are deemed to be a greater source of variability. To normalize quantification of the number of neurons, the total ganglion area was measured (as \u03bcm\n2\n), the number of HuC/D positive neurons within that ganglion were counted, and calculated as the number of neurons per unit area.\n\nRibonucleic acid (RNA) isolation, RT reaction, and qRT-PCR\nThe qRT-PCR was used to quantify the level of inflammatory mediators present at the assigned time points. Tissue sections from the proximal colon were analyzed for intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (\nIcam1\n), monocyte chemotactic protein (\nCcl2\n), and macrophage inflammatory protein-1a (\nCcl3\n), after T3-SCI and control surgical procedures. Nomenclature is presented according to Rat Genome Nomenclature Committee guidelines (\nwww.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/nomen/gene.shtml\n) along with more common, informal usage. These molecules are reported commonly in the scientific literature and were selected as reliable biomarkers of gastrointestinal pathophysiology.\n25\nUsing a previously reported protocol,\n16\nwhole colon tissue sections were used for RNA isolation. Briefly, frozen tissue was homogenized in TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) followed by RNeasy Microkit procedures (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The RT was conducted using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For RT, \u223c1\u2009\u03bcg of RNA from each sample was added to random primers (10\u2009\u00d7\u2009), dNTP (25\u2009\u00d7\u2009), MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (50\u2009U/\u03bcL), RT buffer (10\u2009\u00d7\u2009), and RNase Inhibitor (20U/\u03bcL) and incubated in a thermal cycler (Techne TC-412, Barloworld Scientific, Burlington, NJ) for 10\u2009min at 25\u00b0C, then for 120\u2009min at 37\u00b0C. Primers for\nActb\n(\u03b2-actin) were a QuantiTect Primer Assay (Rn_Actb_1_SG QuantiTect Primer Assay QT00193473, Qiagen, Frederick, MD). Primers for\nIcam1\n,\nCcl2\n(MCP-1), and\nCcl3\n(MIP-1a) were designed using Primer Express (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The forward and reverse primer pairs were reported previously.\n16\nReal-time PCR used SYBR Green 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009Master Mix (Qiagen) according to previous description.\n16\nThe quantity of\nIcam1\n,\nCcl2\n(MCP-1), and\nCcl3\n(MIP-1\u03b1) mRNA was based on a standard curve and normalized to\nActb\n(\u03b2-actin) mRNA (ABI QuantStudio 12KFlex with available OpenArray block, Applied Biosystems). The suitability of\nActb\nas an internal control was assessed through analysis of the raw data between groups, and no variability of\nActb\nwas detected.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe occurrence of outliers was tested using a Grubbs test macro written in GraphPad (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). No significant outliers were identified. All subsequent statistical calculations were performed using SigmaPlot software (version 12.5; Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA). Between group results from anatomical or\nin vivo\nstudies were compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey\npost hoc\nanalysis. Results are expressed as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM) with significance defined as\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Study inclusion and exclusion criteria\nPublished studies were included that fulfilled three main criteria: 1) The study was specific to the pediatric population (between the ages 0 and 18 years, or participants of those ages were analyzed separately if older participants were included); 2) participants had a history of TBI; and 3) the study provided quantitative and/or qualitative information about pain (nonheadache pain or overall pain) whether from child or parent report. We included all study designs, including descriptive case studies, case series, cohort studies, case-control studies, and clinical trials. Pain could be measured using any method. Articles were excluded if they did not specifically examine pain in children after a TBI or only reported on headache pain. Studies were also excluded if they were not written in English. No restriction was imposed on sex, race, geographical residence, or source of population (e.g., community, hospital, registry, or health administrative data).\nThe primary outcomes of interest were pain characteristics reported in children at any time point before or after TBI. Preferably, the diagnosis of TBI was based on internationally recognized criteria, such as the World Health Organization Collaborating Center Task Force on Mild Traumatic Brain Injury,\n13\nalthough studies using other methods (e.g., self-report) or local clinical judgment were also included.\n\nSearch strategy\nThe search for relevant publications included studies up to October 2016. The search strategy was developed using MeSH terms in MEDLINE (OvidSP), as well as relevant keywords. The terms \u201ctraumatic brain injury\u201d or \u201cconcussion\u201d or \u201cbrain injury\u201d were exploded and searched in the title and/or abstract. The term \u201dpain\u201d was exploded, and \u201cchild\u201d or other synonymous terms (e.g., adolescent, infant, and pediatrics) were searched in the title and/or abstract. In consultation with a librarian, the search strategy was adapted for use in other databases (EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, SportDiscus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews). The full search strategy can be viewed in the\nAppendix\n.\n\nStudy selection\nWe selected studies in three stages (title screen, abstract screen, and full text screen) completed by two independent reviewers (V.K. and M.V.) based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria described above. Any disagreement was resolved between the two reviewers. Further, the citation lists of all included articles were scanned for any articles that may have been missed. The two reviewers (V.K. and M.V.) extracted data from included studies using a standardized data collection form. The level of the evidence was assessed using the \u201cLevels of Evidence for Primary Research\u201d for prognostic studies.\n14"

    "Methods": "We conducted a scoping review following the methodological framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley31to achieve the broad goals of summarizing current scientific knowledge of geriatric TBI and identifying major research gaps. Briefly, a scoping review is similar to a systematic review, incorporating a systematic approach to reference search, and is therefore less susceptible to bias than a traditional rapid, critical, or expert review.39However, given the broader nature of the research question, it generally uses more flexible screening and inclusion criteria and does not involve systematic quality assessment.\n\nIn consultation with an experienced medical librarian, we conducted literature searches in PubMed, Web of Science, Biosis Previews, Embase, and PsycINFO to explore six related questions about TBI in the elderly. The PubMed search used the following MeSH terms and keywords: ((\u201cbrain injuries, traumatic\u201d [MeSH] OR \u201cbrain concussion\u201d [MeSH] OR \u201ctraumatic brain injury\u201d OR \u201ctraumatic brain injuries\u201d OR concussion) AND (\u201caged, 80 and over\u201d [MeSH] OR elderly or \u201colder adults\u201d or geriatric or elders)) without limiting results by date of publication. Because there are no available MeSH terms to specifically identify adults ages 50 and older, we used a combination of the one available specific MeSH term (\u201cAged, 80 and over\u201d) and several non-MeSH terms (\u201celderly,\u201d etc) to identify our target age category. This search returned 9010 citations. We combined this root search with each of six targeted subtopic searches: 1) epidemiology (2435 citations); 2) outcomes (2180 citations); 3) biomarkers (721 citations); 4) neuroimaging (including magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] and positron emission tomography [PET]; 1447 citations); 5) comorbidities (682 citations); and 6) guidelines (176 citations). Subtopic searches were conducted on February 6, 2017, and results were not limited by date of publication. The PubMed search algorithm was then translated to work properly in Web of Science, Biosis Previews, Embase, and PsycINFO by substituting in database-specific controlled vocabulary. These additional database searches yielded the following nonduplicated citations in each subtopic: 1) epidemiology (1446 citations); 2) outcomes (1603 citations); 3) biomarkers (262 citations); 4) neuroimaging (including MRI and PET; 1043 citations); 5) comorbidities (352 citations); and 6) guidelines (327 citations).\n\nEnglish-language titles and abstracts were manually screened by the authors (R.C.G., K.D.O., and M.R.M.) for relevance. Priority was given to references originating from PubMed. The vast majority of citations identified were not relevant to geriatric TBI, and therefore >95% of citations were eliminated at this initial stage. Additional articles were identified from governmental sources, for example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), from consultation with subject-matter experts, and from cited reference searching in PubMed. This scoping review represents a qualitative summary and synthesis of the most relevant literature identified."

    "Methods": "Participants\nThis study was approved by the Department of Research Ethics at Simon Fraser University (Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada) and conforms to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.\n37\nParticipants were recruited using a multi-method approach. Postcards advertising the study were distributed at local rehabilitation and community centers in Greater Vancouver, Canada. Online advertising for the study was posted on our institution website (\nwww.icord.org\n) as well as discussion forums and online community groups specific to SCI, including: Inspired Spinal Cord Injury Support Community (\ninspiredsciforum.com\n); Care Cure Community (\nsci.rutgers.edu\n;) Spinal Injury Network (\nspinal-injury.net\n); Apparelyzed (\napparelyzed.com\n); and Spinal Cord Injury British Columbia (\nfacebook.com/SpinalCordInjuryBC\n). Information about the survey was also e-mailed to 250 randomly selected English-speaking individuals who had indicated they wished to be contacted about ongoing SCI research and were members of a mailing list owned by the Rick Hansen Institute (\nrickhanseninstitute.org\n).\nThe convenience sample of participants self-administered either a paper-based or online survey (\nfluidsurveys.com/s/bowelcare-SCI\n;\nSupplementary Appendix A\n) (see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). To begin the survey, participants received some basic information about the study (\nSupplementary Appendix A\n) (see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n) gave consent (by clicking a link in the online version or by submitting the responses in a pre-addressed envelope for the paper-based version) and acknowledged that they had sustained a SCI and were over 18 years old. Paper copies were administered and collected from a local rehabilitation facility.\n\nQuestionnaire design\nThe\nBowel care and cardiovascular function after spinal cord injury questionnaire\n(\nSupplementary Appendix A\n) (see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n) was designed using the International Bowel Function Basic and Extended Data Sets, developed by a working group including members from the American Spinal Injury Association and the International Spinal Cord Society.\n38\n,\n39\nAdditional questions were incorporated from another recent community-based bowel survey.\n8\nQuestions about cardiovascular signs and symptoms were included based on previous work in individuals with SCI.\n40\nBasic questions about nutrition, hydration, medication use, and participant demographics were also included. Due to the personal nature of some questions, and the potential for participants with impaired hand function to need assistance in completing the survey, it was not required for individuals to complete all items.\n\nMeasurements\nWhen considering the measurements derived, we denote relevant survey question numbers as noted in\nSupplementary Appendix A\n(see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n) using the abbreviation Q[number].\nNeurological level and completeness of spinal cord injury\nRespondents self-reported their neurological level of injury (Q1). Motor and sensory completeness of injury was determined by respondent's answers to the following questions: 1) Can you feel touch in your anal area? (Q2); 2) Can you voluntarily tighten your anal sphincter? (Q3); 3) Can you feel light touch below your lesion level? (Q4); 4) Can you feel the difference between sharp and dull below your lesion level? (Q5); and 5) Can you lift your legs against gravity? (Q6) If the answer to all of these questions was \u201cno,\u201d then an individual was considered to have a motor and sensory complete injury. Use of mobility aids was considered (Q7\u20138).\nBowel management\nBasic bowel management information (method used, medication use, positioning during bowel care, level of assistance required, typical duration of routine, frequency and timing of bowel care, experiences of fecal incontinence, and satisfaction with their bowel care) was collected using questions from the International Bowel Function Basic and Extended Data Sets\n39\n,\n41\nand previous surveys (Q9\u201329).\n8\nParticipants were also asked how bowel management fits into their life (Q31). Participants were asked questions about their fluid intake and use of diuretics (Q50\u201355).\nQuality of life\nAs a test of internal validity, QoL with respect to bowel management was evaluated in two different ways. Participants were asked to rank qualitatively whether their bowel management has \u201cNo impact,\u201d \u201cLittle impact,\u201d \u201cSome impact,\u201d or \u201cMajor impact\u201d on their QoL (Q30). Participants were asked to rank the impact of managing their bowel on QoL compared to other aspects of their injury (sexual function, pain, bladder management, spasticity, using a wheelchair for mobility, and skin concerns) on a scale from zero (0) to ten (10), with ten being the worst effect and zero being the least effect (Q32).\n8\nThis continuous measure was taken to be their overall QoL with respect to their bowel management. A larger score was indicative of a poorer QoL, whereas a lower score indicates a greater QoL.\nCardiovascular symptoms\nParticipants were asked about whether they had experienced AD and OH, and how often (Q36\u201337; Q42\u201345). Five-point ordered Likert scales were used to assess symptoms of AD during bowel care, and at other times of the day (Q35, Q38). Frequencies of AD symptoms were assessed using a range of \u201cNever,\u201d \u201cRarely,\u201d \u201cMonthly,\u201d \u201cWeekly,\u201d and \u201cDaily,\u201d whereas severity was assessed as \u201cNot experienced,\u201d \u201cMild,\u201d \u201cModerate,\u201d \u201cSevere,\u201d and \u201cVery severe.\u201d When considering symptoms of AD during bowel care, in addition to considering the full item response, symptoms were also considered in a dichotomized form independent of severity as \u201cexperienced\u201d (mild, moderate, severe, or very severe symptoms reported) and \u201cnot experienced\u201d (no symptoms experienced). We also asked about symptoms of AD in response to 12 other common AD stimuli (Q39) and provided an opportunity for individuals to add a category \u201cother\u201d to identify additional stimuli. An overall symptom severity score of AD both overall (Q38) and during bowel care (Q35) was determined by assigning numerical values to the Likert scale (\u201cNever\u201d or \u201cNot experienced\u201d\u2009=\u20090; \u201cRarely\u201d or \u201cMild\u201d\u2009=\u20091; \u201cMonthly\u201d or \u201cModerate\u201d\u2009=\u20092; \u201cWeekly\u201d or \u201cSevere\u201d\u2009=\u20093; and \u201cDaily\u201d or \u201cVery severe\u201d\u2009=\u20094) and summing the responses to individual symptoms. \u201cOther\u201d symptoms were scored in a similar way where identified and incorporated in the overall symptom score, because we were particularly interested in the overall symptom burden of AD. Use of \u201cboosting\u201d through deliberate initiation of AD was considered (Q41).\nSixteen common symptoms of OH were also assessed using the same frequency range and severity (Q46). These symptoms were also assigned a composite severity score in the same manner as the AD data described above. We also asked about symptoms of OH in response to 10 other common OH stimuli (Q47) and provided an opportunity for individuals to add a category \u201cother\u201d to identify additional stimuli. Participants were asked about their fainting history (Q42\u201345).\nParticipants were asked whether symptoms of OH or AD had ever interfered in their ability to participate in common activities (Q40, Q48; activities of daily living, work, exercise, sexual activity, rehabilitation, household chores, driving, and social activities). A category \u201cother\u201d was available for participants to identify additional activities.\nParticipants were asked if they experienced symptoms of cardiac arrhythmia (heart palpitations, irregular heartbeats, or a feeling of \u201cfluttering in the chest\u201d during bowel care) (Q33), and, if yes, how often this occurred (daily, weekly, monthly, rarely, or never; Q34).\nFatigue was score on a linear scale (0, no fatigue; 10 severe fatigue; Q49).\n42\n\nStratification of participants by injury level\nFor analysis of cardiovascular symptoms, participants were stratified by their self-reported injury level into two subgroups: those with injury at or above the seventh thoracic segment (T7) and those with injuries below T7. High-level injuries can disrupt the sympathetic control of the heart and the vasculature in the splanchnic bed, increasing susceptibility to OH, AD, and cardiac arrhythmia. In an effort to account for uncertainty regarding precise injry details with self-reported data, and physiological variability in autonomic pathways, the cut-off for defining an individual at risk for cardiovascular abnormalities was set conservatively, at T7.\nData on frequency of bowel incontinence were considered separately for those with an upper motor neuron neurogenic bowel disorder (those with injury at or above L1) and those with a lower motor neuron neurogenic bowel disorder (those with injury below L1).\n\nStatistical analyses\nData processing and statistical analyses were performed on JMP (Version 12.0.1; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC), R (Version 3.0.2; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), and RStudio software (Version 0.98.507; RStudio, Boston, MA). Due to the sensitive nature of the questions, it was not required for individuals to complete the survey in its entirety, with skipping questions or \u201cnot applicable\u201d as possible options; thus, not all respondents completed all question or subquestion items. Accordingly, responses are expressed as the percentage of responses received for each item, followed by the number of item responses expressed as a proportion of the total responses received for that question (percent [item response/question response]). Comparisons of proportions between subgroups were made using Fisher's exact test. Interval data were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, with Bonferonni correction for repeated tests. Chi-squared tests were used to compare the distribution of cardiovascular symptoms and triggers between SCI groups. Post-hoc comparisons were made using pair-wise Fisher's exact tests. To evaluate predictors of OH, we considered the following factors: level of injury (coded as a linear scale with C1\u2009=\u20091, C2\u2009=\u20092, etc.); age; duration of injury; fatigue score (linear scale from zero [no fatigue] to ten [severe fatigue]); amount of AD experienced daily; and whether respondents intentionally used fluid restriction to aid in bladder management (coded on the linear scale as \u201cNo\u201d\u2009=\u20091; \u201cYes, but rarely\u201d\u2009=\u20092; \u201cYes, sometimes\u201d\u2009=\u20093; and \u201cYes, often\u201d\u2009=\u20094). Linear regression models were then performed to establish predictors of OH. To evaluate potential predictors of the impact of bowel care on QoL, we considered the following factors: duration of injury; level of injury; number of bowel management approaches used; duration with current routine (number of years using the current bowel management approach); time to complete current routine (time in minutes to complete a single bowel care routine); frequency of bowel incontinence (coded on a linear scale as \u201cNever\u201d\u2009=\u20091; \u201cLess than once per month\u201d\u2009=\u20092; \u201cOnce per month\u201d\u2009=\u20093; \u201cNot every week but at least once per month\u201d\u2009=\u20094; \u201cNot every day but at least once per week\u201d\u2009=\u20095; \u201cOnce daily\u201d\u2009=\u20096; and \u201cTwo or more episodes per day\u201d\u2009=\u20097); severity of AD symptoms during routine; fatigue score; and whether respondents intentionally used fluid restriction to aid in bladder management. As an initial step, we performed simple unadjusted correlations (Spearman's\nr\n) between these possible variables of interest with QoL, and with each other as potential confounds. Multiple linear regression models were then performed to establish the predictors of QoL when potential confounds were considered. These regression models included the following factors: duration or injury; level of injury; number of bowel management approaches used; duration with current routine; time to complete current routine; frequency of bowel incontinence; severity of AD symptoms during routine; fatigue score; and whether respondents intentionally used fluid restriction as independent variables. Significant predictors were determined to be primary predictors of QoL. Secondary predictors of QoL were determined by linear regression models including all above independent variables run against primary predictors of QoL. Data were included in the regression analyses where all parameters were available for each individual\u2014where questions relating to parameters of interest were skipped, data for that individual were not incorporated in that particular regression model. Akaike information criterion (AIC) variable importance analysis was performed to determine the relative importance of each approach to bowel management. A score \u22650.8 was considered to indicate factors with a high variable importance. Statistical significance was assumed at a\np\nvalue of <0.05. Where appropriate, data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error (SE), unless otherwise stated."

    "Methods": "Animals and housing\nAll animal protocols were approved by the University of Maryland, Baltimore, Animal Use and Care Committee (IACUC) and the United States Army Animal Care and Use Review Office (ACURO). Male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (300\u2013350\ng\n; Envigo, CA), were maintained under a controlled environment with an ambient temperature of 23\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00b0C, at 12\u2009h light/dark cycle, and continuous access to food and water\nad libitum\n. Experimental groups consisted of 10\u201315 rats/group for behavioral studies and 5\u20136 rats/group for immunohistochemistry or biochemical analyses.\n\nUnderbody blast and blast mitigation design\nFollowing scaling analysis and procedures previously described,\n4\n,\n7\nrats were exposed to underbody blast paradigms generating a mean maximal G force of \u223c2850\ng\n, as recently reported.\n6\nIn brief, two isoflurane anesthetized rats were secured, while unconscious, within fiberglass restrainers (Stoeling Inc., IL) bolted to the top aluminum platform, which was 38\u2009cm\n2\nand 2.5\u2009cm thick. The restraints included a custom-fit metallic cone to minimize head movement, secondary acceleration, and head impact. The top platform was located directly above another 38\u2009cm\n2\naluminum platform, which was 5.0\u2009cm thick. Both platforms were separated by a 0.6\u2009cm thick, hard-rubber pad to dampen oscillatory acceleration forces. Each platform had a 3.5\u2009cm diameter hole located at each corner though which 2.0\u2009cm thick guide-poles were located, allowing for purely vertical movement. This device was located in a steel water tank at a water level of 0.2\u2009cm below the bottom platform. An explosive charge of 2.0\u2009g pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) was secured at a fixed 5\u2009cm depth (stand-off distance) in the water beneath the center of the lower platform. This charge was detonated electrically exactly 5\u2009min after anesthesia was discontinued, when the rats were fully conscious.\nExperiments were performed to test the ability of unique, acceleration absorbing frame designs to reduce the G force transmitted to the rats. Five uncoated or polyurea-coated, crushable aluminum cylinders were placed between the top and bottom platforms in an effort to mitigate the force transduction between the bottom and top platforms. Each cylinder was 66\u2009mm wide and 38\u2009mm high, with an aluminum wall thickness of 0.1\u2009mm. When present, the polyurea coating thickness was 1.6\u2009mm thick. The weight of each cylinder was 2.1\u2009g for the uncoated and 14.6\u2009g for the polyurea coated. For all blast paradigms, with or without mitigation, two accelerometers were placed on the top of the higher platform near the head end of the restraints and used to determine the acceleration and jerk (first derivative of acceleration), measured by Underwater Explosives Research Division (UERD)-Tools software (United States Navy). Pressure sensors were also placed near the head-end of the restraints during several experiments, verifying that the pressure changes experienced by the rats were <1\u2009psi. Sham animals were also anesthetized with 4% isoflurane for 5\u2009min, secured on the platform, and removed 5\u2009min later without blast exposure.\nAll blast and sham animals were returned to their respective cages immediately after blast or sham procedures and examined for any physical injuries every 30\u2009min for 3\u2009h. Necropsies were performed immediately on all animals that died following blast exposure.\n\nBehavioral analysis\nThe Y maze test was performed to assess hippocampus-dependent working memory on day 0, at \u223c1\u2009h, and at days 6, 13, and 27 post-injury, as previously described.\n6\n,\n8\nIn brief, each rat was placed at the center of the maze and allowed to explore for 5\u2009min. Movement was recorded using an overhead camera, and analysis was performed with the Any-Maze software (SD instruments, CA). Arm visit sequences and number of entries to each arm were recorded. Working memory was defined by the frequency of alternately exploring different arms, and was determined using the formula: total number of alternations/(total number of arm entries \u22122)\u2009\u00d7\u2009100. The elevated Plus maze test was performed to evaluate anxiety-like behaviors by rats on days 1, 8, 14, and 28 post-blast, as previously described.\n6\n,\n9\nIn brief, rats were individually placed on the central area of the Plus maze and allowed to explore for 10\u2009min. Movement was recorded by an overhead camera, and data were analyzed by Any-maze software, to provide information including the time spent in each arm and the central area and the total distance traveled. Anxiety-like behavior is inversely proportional to the time the rats spend in the open arms.\n\nExperimental time points, tissue collection, and processing\nRats were deeply anesthetized with an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a mixture of ketamine (160\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (120\u2009mg/kg) at different times following blast or sham blast procedures (\nFig. 1\n). They were then euthanized by exsanguination via transcardial perfusion for 5\u2009min with oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing 148\u2009mM NaCl, 5\u2009mM glucose, 3.0\u2009mM KCl, 1.85\u2009mM CaCl\n2\n, 1.7\u2009mM MgCl\n2\n, 1.5\u2009mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, and 0.14\u2009mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n(pH 7.4). The rats were then perfused for 15\u2009min with a fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde in 50\u2009mM K\n2\nHPO\n4\nand 50\u2009mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n(pH 7.4). Their brains were removed, maintained in fixative for 24\u2009h, and transferred to 30% sucrose. After brains sank to the bottom of the 30% sucrose solution within a few days, they were individually sliced in 40\u2009\u03bcm thick sections, preserved in cryoprotectant (66\u2009mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 190\u2009mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.87\u2009M sucrose, 30% ethylene glycol, and 1.25\u2009mM povidone), and stored for histology and immunohistochemistry at \u221220\u00b0C. For Western blot analysis, rats were decapitated with a guillotine. Their brains were rapidly removed and dissected to collect different regions, including the hippocampus and the cortex, which were immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExperimental design. Detailed timeline of behavioral tests and end-points of experimental procedures starting on study day 0 (blast or sham blast exposure). YM, Y-maze test; PM, plus-maze test; H, histology; WB, Western blots; E, euthanasia; TC, tissue collection.\n\nImmunostaining\nHistological staining of frozen coronal brain sections was performed to assess the level of perivascular immunoglobulin G (IgG) effusion as a measure of blood\u2013brain-barrier (BBB) disruption. These sections were also used for immunostaining of the vascular endothelial marker glucose transporter 1 (GluT-1) and the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). We also assessed the presence of inflammatory cells by co-immunostaining for F4/80 (marker of activated microglia/macrophages) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Further, we stained for the expression of apoptosis biomarker, cleaved caspase 3, and the density of pre- and post-synaptic markers Bassoon and Homer-1, respectively. Staining methods used were either fluorescence immunostaining or nickel diaminobenzadine (DAB) immunostaining. Brain sections were co-stained for the expression of ICAM-1 and GluT-1, F4/80 and iNOS, Bassoon and Homer-1, or cleaved caspase 3 and neuronal nuclear antigen as previously described.\n10\nIn brief, free-floating sections were rinsed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then blocked in 1% horse serum in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X for 1\u2009h. Sections were transferred in a solution containing goat anti-ICAM-1 antibody (1:2000; Santa Cruz, CA) and mouse anti-glucose transporter monoclonal antibody (1:1500; Abcam, MA), rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3 polyclonal antibody (1:10,000; Millipore, CA) and mouse anti-NeuN monoclonal antibody clone, A60 (1:2000; Millipore, CA), rat anti-F4/80 monoclonal antibody (1:500; eBioscience, San Diego, CA) and rabbit anti-iNOS polyclonal antibody (1:3000; Millpore, CA), or mouse anti-Bassoon (1:2000; Enzo life sciences, NY) and rabbit anti-Homer-1 antibody (1:1000; Invitrogen/ThermoFisher Scientific, NY) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. They were washed in PBS and incubated for 1\u2009h at room temperature in a mixture of corresponding secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594 (1:1500; Invitrogen, NY). Sections were washed with PBS followed by 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) used for nuclei counterstaining.\nBrain sections were single-labeled for the presence of IgG, using nickel DAB. Free-floating sections were rinsed in PBS, blocked with 1% horse serum, and incubated with rabbit IgG antibody (1:2500; eBioscience, CA) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Sections were washed and incubated at room temperature in biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:2000; Vector Laboratories Inc., CA), for 1\u2009h, followed by incubation in Vesta Stain solution and in nickel DAB, and rinsed in PBS.\n\nWestern blot analysis\nWestern blotting analysis was used to evaluate the expression levels of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK-1/2), phosphorylated ERK, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), \u03b1 ii spectrin and \u03b2-actin proteins in the hippocampus of blast and sham rats. Hippocampal tissues were manually homogenized in lysis buffer composed of 50\u2009mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 6\u2009mM MgCl\n2\n, 1\u2009mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 75\u2009mM sucrose, 1\u2009mM dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma, MO), and 1% protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Cell Signaling Technology, MA). Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000\ng\nfor 20\u2009min. Proteins (20\u201340\u2009\u03bcg) present in the supernatants were separated by electrophoresis on 4\u201312% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-rad, CA), and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against ERK1/2, phosphor-ERK1/2 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, MA), \u03b1 ii spectrin (1:3000, Invitrogen/ThermoFisher scientific, NY), Bcl-2 (1:2000, ProteinTech, IL) and mouse monoclonal antibody against \u03b2-actin (1:4000; Sigma, MO). Blots were washed in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated for 1\u2009h at room temperature with corresponding horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (1: 5000; Millipore, MA). HRP-labeled proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Thermo Scientific, IL), and protein bands were visualized using a digital blot scanner (LI-COR, NE).\n\nData analysis\nThe number of cleaved caspase 3 immunopositive cells were quantified using 40\u2009\u03bcm thick sections of the hippocampus dentate gyrus and cornu ammonis (CA) 2/3 regions by the optical fractionator method of stereology using the Stereo Investigator software (MBF Bioscience, VT). For each brain, six sections corresponding to every 12 serial sections expanding from bregma \u22121.60 to \u22126.3 to cover the whole hippocampus area were analyzed. For quantification, the dentate gyrus and the (CA 2/3) subregions in the hippocampus of each brain hemisphere were demarcated. Grid spacing of 75\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u200975\u2009\u03bcm in the\nx\nand\ny\n-axis and guard zones of 2\u2009\u03bcm at the top and bottom of each section were used to count immunopositive cell bodies. The total number of cleaved caspase 3 positive cells in the hippocampal subregion of interest was divided by the covered area to determine the cellular density per area, expressed as cells/mm\n2\n.\nImageJ software (National Institutes of Health [NIH]) was used to measure immunoblot protein band signal intensity and the percent area of IgG, ICAM-1, or F4/80 immunostaining in brain tissue. The signal intensities for Bcl-2 and \u03b1 ii spectrin were expressed as a ratio of \u03b2 actin signal intensity (used as loading control) and that of phospho-ERK1/2 was expressed as a ratio of total ERK1/2. Sections stained for IgG, ICAM-1, or F4/80 were optically segmented by threshold. These thresholded images were automatically measured for the relative percent containing a positive IgG, ICAM-1, or F4/80 signal in ImageJ. This method is proportional to the percent area covered by the IgG, ICAM-1, or F4/80 immunopositive signal.\nThe puncta analyzer software was generously provided by Dr. Cagla Eroglu (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC) and incorporated in ImageJ to determine the Bassoon, Homer-1, and Bassoon/Homer-1 co-localized puncta as previously described.\n11\n,\n12\nIn brief, sections co-immunostained against Bassoon and Homer-1 were highlighted, and quantification was performed with rolling ball radium set at 50 with \u201cwhite background\u201d unchecked and the puncta size for Bassoon and Homer-1 set at 4 pixels. At the end of the quantification, the puncta density for Bassoon and Homer-1 and the co-localized Bassoon/Homer-1 puncta were generated.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad InStat 3 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Analysis of variance together with Tukey\u2013Kramer multiple comparisons post-hoc test were used to compare differences among the multiple groups. Results are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical significance was defined as\np\n<\u20090.05.\nThe individuals who performed the histological, biochemical, and behavioral assays were blinded to animal group identifications, using codes that were revealed after data collection was completed."

    "Methods": "Participants\nAfter obtaining approval from the Washington University Human Research Protection Organization Institutional Review Board, 10 subjects were enrolled and informed consent was obtained. Recruitment was performed by A.H.H. and W.Z.R. This study played no role in the medical care of SCI subjects. To be included in this study, participants were required to (1) have a history ASIA A, B, C or D SCI prior to enrollment; (2) be able to participate in physical examinations and surveys; (3) speak English; (4) be medically stable; and (5) tolerate an unsedated MRI. Exclusion criteria were: being \u226418 or >80 years old; pregnancy; having an MRI-incompatible device (e.g., a pacemaker); having a known diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, spine tumor, brain tumor, encephalopathy, traumatic brain injury, psychiatric disease, dementia, meningitis, stroke, transient ischemic attacks, neurodegenerative disorder, epilepsy, previous incident of SCI, or HIV-related myelopathy; having a history of abnormal brain MRI; and having a systemic instability or being deemed unstable to tolerate standard unsedated MRI sequencing, abnormal orientation, and cranial nerve physical examination. Control MRI data from 37 normal controls subjects (average 42.6 years, range 23\u201365) without any significant medical history were collected. The majority of control participants were males (20). No experimental or control subjects were diagnosed with any psychiatric condition, and none were taking chronic opioids, muscle relaxants, or other analgesics. Education level was not recorded.\n\nGeneral methodology\nOnce identified and enrolled in the study, medical records from the subject's initial SCI and recovery were reviewed. Patients with an SCI were assessed upon enrollment and every 4\u20136 months as tolerated. During each visit, validated clinical scores and outcomes were collected, and patients received a resting state fMRI of the brain. Seven subjects received one MRI and three subjects received two serial MRIs. Behavioral outcome measures included International Standards for the Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury including data from a complete motor and sensory physical examination\n4\n,\n30\nand Manual Motor Testing.\n31\nRS-fMRI was obtained at the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology at Washington University School of Medicine.\n\nClinical examination and measures\nSubjects underwent a detailed clinical examination by a neurological surgery provider intended to provide a comprehensive evaluation of neurological function. Examination of orientation and cranial nerves were performed to exclude significant and potentially confounding cerebral pathology. International Standards for the Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury including data from a complete motor and sensory physical examination\n4\n,\n30\nand manual motor testing\n31\nare well-established and commonly used methods to grade neurological status after SCI.\n\nAcquisition and preprocessing of the RS-fMRI\nImaging was acquired using a 3.0 Tesla Siemens Trio scanner (Erlagen, Germany) with a standard 32 channel head coil. A high-resolution T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo was used for atlas registration. T2-weighted fast spin echo images were used for RS-fMRI atlas registration. T2* echo-planar imaging sequence responsive to BOLD contrast (flip angle 90 degrees, 4\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u2009mm voxels, echo time (TE) 27\u2009ms, repetition time (TR) 2200\u2009ms, bandwidth 2441\u2009Hz) covered the entire brain while the subjects were asked to fixate on a visual cross-hair and remain awake. Three runs of 164 frames totaling 18\u2009min were completed. Preprocessing, registration, and quality assurance measures was performed as previously described.\n32\u201334\nBriefly, preprocessing included correction for asynchronous slice acquisition by compensation for slice-dependent time shifts, correction of even\u2013odd interleaving acquisition, image debanding, intensity normalization to mode 1000, spatial smoothing with a 6\u2009mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel, and low-pass (< 0.1\u2009Hz) filtering. Frame scrubbing was performed based on the temporal derivative of root-mean-square variance over voxels (DVARS) >0.5%.\n35\nNuisance regression was performed to remove signals related to 12 parameter rigid body head motion, bilateral white matter, bilateral cerebrospinal fluid, and global signal. Images were aligned by rigid body transformation to a standardized atlas space and re-sampled in 3\u2009mm isotropic cubic voxels for further analysis.\n\nSeed-based correlation mapping and connectivity measurements\nSeed-based correlation mapping is one of the most widely adopted techniques for studying co-fluctuations in intrinsic neuronal activity, or functional connectivity.\n36\n,\n37\nSeed-based analysis requires prior knowledge of the locations of regions of interest (ROIs). Thirty-six ROIs were derived by maximizing topographic concordance between results obtained by seed-based correlation mapping and spatial independent component analysis as described.\n38\u201340\nResting-state networks (RSNs) and ROI coordinates were selected as described in Brier and colleagues, except for seeds 26\u201329.\n32\nSeeds 26 and 27 were left and right insula as previously described.\n32\nSeeds 28 and 29 were left and right parietal opercula, respectively. Somatomotor, language, and visual RSNs were combined into a unified sensory-motor network (SMN). Five RSNs included default mode network (DMN), dorsal attention network (DAN), salience network (SAL), control network (CON), and unified somatomotor network (SMN,\nFig. 1\n). Correlation maps were generated by extracting time courses from each of the 36 seed regions. Pearson product-moment correlation (\nR\n) is the most widely used method to measure functional connectivity within and between networks.\n5\n,\n36\n,\n41\u201344\nPearson correlations were calculated between the time course from seed ROIs and that from all other ROIs. Pearson correlations were converted to normally distributed variables, z, with application of a Fisher's z transform. Functional connectivity maps were generated for complete SCI subjects by averaging the correlation maps between subjects. Average internal and cross connectivity of the DMN, DAN, CON, SAL, and SMN RSNs were calculated for each subject as detailed by Brier and colleagues.\n32\nThe average change in correlation over time was calculated for each ROI. This was performed by subtracting the z-transformed correlation of the 2 month MRI from the \u22656 month MRI for each subject. Then change in connectivity was averaged across the three subjects.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nRegions of interest (ROIs).

    "Methods": "Subjects\nData were collected from 37 US Military Veterans recruited from the areas surrounding Waco, TX. Before beginning the study, participants were screened and excluded for MRI safety issues, any Axis I psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, dementia, substance abuse disorder, or any substance use in the last 12 hours before MRI scanning. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. This study was approved by the Central Texas Veterans Health Care System Institutional Review Board.\nEach participant completed between one and five two-hour study sessions on separate days spanning less than three months. The first session included participant screening, informed consent, behavioral assessment, neuropsychological testing (not described here), and a brief initial MRI scanning session to determine whether participants could tolerate the scanning environment without excessive movement.\nParticipants who exhibited motion in fewer than 50% of timepoints in the initial fMRI scan (see \u201c\nFMRI Preprocessing\n\u201d below for details) were invited back for up to four additional sessions. These additional sessions were devoted entirely to MRI scanning. In all scanning sessions, the MRI technologist performing the scanning was blind to the goals of the study and to the TBI/PTSD status of the participant.\nIn total, 27 participants completed the initial session and at least one scanning-only session. One participant was subsequently excluded from analyses due to outlier measures of functional connectivity believed to result from a scanner malfunction. This left 26 participants (5 females; mean \u00b1 SD age: 37.0 \u00b1 11.8) included in the current results.\n\nBehavioral assessment\nBehavioral assessment focused on determining whether individuals had a history of TBI, as well as identifying the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms. TBI history was assessed using the Vasterling TBI assessment interview\n67\n, which obtains self-reports of all lifetime TBI events. Measures of interest in this study included the severity of the worst TBI event, as well as the total number of lifetime TBI events. We found that 5 participants had no history of TBI, while 17 had at least one mild TBI (but no moderate or severe TBIs) and 4 had at least one moderate TBI (but no severe TBIs). No individuals with a history of severe TBI completed the scanning protocol. The mean \u00b1 SD number of lifetime TBI events experienced was 2.1 \u00b1 1.7 (range: 0 \u2013 6). The time since the most recent TBI was also recorded.\nThe severity of PTSD symptoms was assessed using the PTSD Check List for DSM-5 (PCL-5)\n68\n. The measure of interest was the summed PCL-5 symptom severity score. PCL-5 scores were not available for one participant; that participant was thus excluded from all analyses examining relationships with PCL-5. The mean \u00b1 SD PCL-5 score of the remaining participants was 34.2 \u00b1 22.7 (range: 0 \u2013 77).\nWe also assessed combat exposure using the 34-item version of the Full Combat Exposure Scale (FCES;\n69\n), in which participants rate the frequency of their exposure to a variety of combat elements. FCES scores have previously been associated with PTSD severity\n70\n. Finally, we recorded the medications currently taken by each subject and grouped them into major medication categories. None of these measures except PCL-5 score differed between the TBI groups (\nTable 1\n).\nTable 1:\nDemographic and assessment measures in each TBI group.\nThe \u201cTest\u201d column shows the p value from a statistical test of differences between groups. This p value is variously derived from a Chi-square test (Gender, # with PTSD diagnosis, # on medications), a one-way ANOVA (Age, fMRI data retained, % fMRI data lost, PCL-5, FCES), or a two-sample t-test between the Mild and Moderate groups (# TBIs, Time since last TBI).\nNo TBI\nMild TBI\nModerate TBI\nTest\nN\n5\n17\n4\n--\n# F\n0\n3\n1\np=.53\nAge (years)\n37.4 \u00b1 13.3\n38.2 \u00b1 11.8\n35.8 \u00b1 14.4\np=.94\nfMRI data frames retained\n1848 \u00b1 1336\n2502 \u00b1 1213\n2784 \u00b1 879\np=.46\n% fMRI data lost\n26.8 \u00b1 28.4\n22.7 \u00b1 15.9\n24.1 \u00b1 15.2\np=.91\n# TBIs\n--\n2.0 \u00b1 1.1\n3.0 \u00b1 1.6\np=.55\nTime since last TBI (years)\n--\n11.7 \u00b1 10.6\n7.5 \u00b1 3.3\np=.44\nTotal PCL-5\n16.2 \u00b1 17.9\n35.9 \u00b1 22.0\n54.7 \u00b1 13.6\n*p=.05\n# with clinical PTSD diagnosis\n2\n7\n2\np=.94\nTotal FCES\n10.8 \u00b1 14.5\n30.6 \u00b1 33.4\n42.7 \u00b1 7.6\np=.28\n# participants on medications\nAnti-depressant\n3\n8\n1\np=.57\nAnti-psychotic\n0\n2\n0\np=.56\nBenzodiazepines\n0\n1\n0\np=.76\nMood stabilizer\n0\n1\n1\np=.33\nOpen in a separate window\n\nMRI image acquisition\nImaging was performed on a Philips Achieva 3T MRI scanner. Scanning in the initial session included collection of one T1-weighted MPRAGE image, one DTI scan, and one T2*-weighted BOLD contrast sensitive fMRI scan. FMRI was collected during the \u201cresting state\u201d, in which participants passively viewed a white crosshair on a black background and were instructed not to fall asleep.\nScanning in subsequent sessions included collection of one MPRAGE, one DTI scan, and as many 6.6-minute resting state fMRI scans as could be collected in the rest of the two-hour session. Participants took breaks after every thirty minutes of scanning and were encouraged to request additional breaks whenever they felt fatigued. Breaks were allowed to be of any length but were generally around five minutes.\nScanning parameters were as follows:\nT1-weighted sagittal MP-RAGE \u2014TE = 3.08 ms, TR partition = 2.4 s, TI = 1,000 ms, flip angle = 8 degrees, 176 slices, 1x1x1 mm voxels.\nDTI \u2014 32 directions with two b-values (b=0 sec/mm\n2\nand b = 800 sec/mm\n2\n), TE = 93 ms, TR = 3891 ms, AP phase encoding, flip angle = 90 degrees, in-plane resolution = 2x2 mm, 60 slices, slice thickness = 2 mm.\nFMRI \u2014 a gradient echo-planar imaging sequence with TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 90 degrees, in-plane resolution = 3x3 mm, 34 3.0mm-thick axial slices with a 1.0mm gap between slices, TR=3.0s, 132 volumes acquired per run for 6 minutes and 36 seconds of scan time.\nAcross all scanning sessions, participants underwent an average \u00b1 SD of 4.5 \u00b1 1.2 DTI scans (range: 2 to 6) and an average \u00b1 SD of 24.9 \u00b1 10.1 6.6-minute resting state scans (range: 5 to 44).\n\nMRI Processing and Analysis\nStructural MRI data\nT1 preprocessing:\nAll T1-weighted MPRAGE images were visually inspected for image quality and for potential abnormalities. The best image from each subject was corrected for magnetic field bias, skull-stripped, and linearly warped to the MNI-152 template using FSL tools\n71\n.\nCortical surface generation:\nGeneration of cortical surfaces from the MPRAGE followed procedures described in\n72\n. Anatomical surfaces were generated from the native-space MPRAGE using FreeSurfer\u2019s recon-all processing pipeline (version 5.3)\n73\n\u2013\n76\n. The fsaverage-registered left and right hemisphere surfaces were brought into register with each other, resampled to 164,000 vertices using Caret tools\n77\n, and down-sampled to the fs_LR 32k template space. These surfaces were then transformed into MNI atlas volumetric space by applying the previously calculated MPRAGE-to-MNI transformation.\nDiffusion MRI data\nDTI Processing:\nDTI images were processed using the Diffusion Toolbox in FSL\n71\n,\n78\n. All diffusion tensor images were corrected for eddy currents. In each image, a diffusion tensor model was fitted and used to calculate fractional anisotropy (FA) in each voxel. A linear rigid-body registration was computed between each B0 image and the native-space MPRAGE image, concatenated with the MPRAGE-to-MNI transformation and an interpolation into 2-mm isotropic space, and applied to the FA image. The resulting MNI-space FA images were then averaged across DTI runs for each individual (see\nFigure 2A\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFigure 2:\nData collected in the present study.\nA:\nDiffusion Tensor Imaging scans were collected in order to produce maps of Fractional Anisotropy (FA), a measure of white matter integrity. An FA map is shown for one example subject.\nB:\nFA was assessed in each of many different a priori white matter tracts. Each tract is shown in a different color.\nC:\nResting-state fMRI scans were collected, and data were averaged within each of 333 a priori parcels on the cortex.\nD:\nTemporal correlations were computed between all parcel timecourses to produce a functional connectivity value between each pair of parcels. A matrix illustrating the strength of functional connectivity between each parcel pair is shown for a single subject. The matrix is ordered by the known network organization of this parcel set (compare colored blocks on axes to parcel colors in C).\nE:\nFor each subject, functional connectivity values from D were averaged across all unique within-network connections, as illustrated here in white.\nWhite matter integrity calculation:\nFor each subject, we calculated mean FA across all of the canonical white matter tracts in the Johns Hopkins University white matter tract atlas\n79\n, masked by each individual subject\u2019s white matter segmentation. This atlas includes 48 discrete tracts; our DTI scans provided coverage for 38 of these tracts (the remainder being in the brainstem). We also calculated mean FA in each of these specific tracts.\nFunctional MRI data\nFMRI preprocessing:\nFunctional data were preprocessed using FSL tools and in-house Matlab scripts. All runs underwent correction of slice timing effects and calculation of within-run correction for head movement. Linear rigid-body registrations were calculated from each run to the most representative run (calculated as the run with maximal spatial correlation to all other runs). A linear warp was calculated from the most representative mean image to the native volumetric MPRAGE using the boundary-based registration method\n80\n. These within-run, across-run, representative run-to-MPRAGE, and MPRAGE-to-MNI transformations were concatenated with an interpolation into 3-mm isotropic space and applied to each volume. The resulting MNI-space fMRI runs were intensity-normalized to a whole brain mode value of 1000.\nAdditional preprocessing steps to reduce spurious variance were executed as recommended in\n81\n,\n82\n. First, temporal masks were created to flag and censor motion-contaminated frames. Motion contaminated volumes were identified by frame-by-frame displacement (FD, described in\n83\n). Several subjects had a high-frequency artifact in the motion estimates, primarily in the phase encode direction, that did not appear to reflect biological movement. Similar effects have previously been observed in data from the Human Connectome Project\n84\n,\n85\n. We thus filtered the FD timecourses to retain effects occurring below 0.1 Hz. Frames with filtered FD > .04mm were flagged as motion-contaminated, following\n76\n. Across all subjects, these masks censored 23.7% \u00b1 17.9% (range: 1.5% \u2013 66.8%) of the data; on average, subjects retained 2420 \u00b1 1174 volumes (range: 515 \u2013 4943). Neither the percent of data lost nor the total number of frames retained differed by TBI status (\nTable 1\n).\nAfter computing these temporal masks, data were processed with the following steps: (i) demeaning and detrending; (ii) concatenation across runs; (iii), multiple regression of nuisance signals including: whole brain signal, white matter signal, top principal components explaining 75% of the variance in ventricular signal, run identity, session identity, and motion regressors derived by Volterra expansion\n86\n, with censored data ignored during beta estimation; (iv) interpolation across censored frames\n83\n,\n87\n; and (v) band-pass filtering (0.009 Hz < f < 0.08 Hz). Censored frames were then excised for all subsequent analyses.\nTo visually assess noise levels in the fMRI data, and to assess the efficacy of the motion censoring and nuisance regression procedures, we constructed \u201cgrayplots\u201d of this data, following\n84\n. Briefly, signal strength at every timepoint was calculated from a random sample of voxels within the cortical gray matter ribbon, both before and after motion censoring/nuisance regression. These strengths were plotted as a time x voxels matrix for each subject and visually examined for evidence of global artifact. This examination revealed that all subjects exhibited large global signal fluctuations which were effectively eliminated by the motion censoring and nuisance regression procedures (see\nSupplemental Figures 1\n\u2013\n3\n).\nThe fMRI volumetric timeseries were then sampled to each subject\u2019s left and right-hemisphere cortical surfaces using the ribbon-constrained sampling procedure\n88\nin Connectome Workbench 1.0\n72\n. Surface-space timecourses were deformed and resampled to the 32k fs_LR surface. This surface data was combined with volumetric subcortical gray matter and cerebellar data into the CIFTI format. Finally, the resting-state timecourses were smoothed with geodesic 2D (for surface data) and Euclidean 3D (for volumetric data) Gaussian kernels (FWHM = 6mm).\nResting state functional connectivity calculation:\nTo evaluate RSFC between brain regions, we employed a previously-published parcellation of human cortex\n89\n. For each subject, cortical vertex timecourses were averaged within each parcel to produce a parcel average timecourse. Connectivity relationships between parcels were calculated by cross-correlating the timecourses of all parcels against each other; the resulting correlation values were Fisher Z-transformed to improve normality. This resulted in a parcel x parcel connectivity matrix of Z(r) values for each subject (see\nFigure 2D\nfor an example).\nThese parcels are known to be organized into 14 discrete networks (\nFigure 2C\n). RSFC within these networks is most likely to represent networked area-to-area brain communication. To obtain a summary RSFC measure of these strong within-network functional connections, we calculated the average functional connectivity across all within-network parcel-to-parcel connections (\nFigure 2E\n), excluding all parcels in low-signal regions (ventral temporal and orbitofrontal cortex) that do not have known network identities (gray areas in\nFigure 2C\n).\nNotably, neither the whole-brain FA nor the within-network RSFC measures appeared to be influenced by potential residual (uncontrolled) effects of in-scanner motion, as neither the percent of frames lost to motion nor the average FD in retained frames was associated with either measure (all ps > .15;\nSupplemental Figure 4\n).\n\nReliability of FA and RSFC measures\nWe examined how collection of increasing amounts of data improved the within-subject reliability of FA and RSFC measures. This approach followed the iterative split-half reliability analyses described in\n63\n,\n65\n.\nFA:\nFor each subject, the DTI sessions were randomly split into two approximately equal subsets of sessions. Mean FA values were calculated in each of the 38 a priori tracts (see above) using all data in one of the subsets (the smaller subset, if the total number of sessions was odd). A varying number of sessions (1\u20133, when possible) was randomly selected from the other subset, and mean FA values were calculated in each of the a priori tracts using this data. The split-data similarity of FA values was calculated as the correlation of tract FA values in the two data subsets. This procedure was repeated in each subject for all possible combinatorial iterations of sessions.\nRSFC:\nFor each subject, the RSFC sessions were randomly split into two equal subsets of sessions. A parcel-to-parcel connectivity matrix (see above) was calculated from all data in one of the data subsets (the smaller subset, if the total number of sessions was odd). A varying amount of data (ranging from 2.5 minutes to 100 minutes after motion censoring, when possible) was randomly selected from the other subset. This data was contiguous within sessions but did not necessarily include temporally adjacent sessions. A connectivity matrix was calculated for this data. The similarity of the matrices from the two subsets was calculated as the correlation of Z(r) values in the upper triangle of the matrices. To obtain robust estimates of this split-half similarity, this procedure was iterated 1000 times for each subject and for each quantity of data tested, with a different random selection of data in each iteration.\n\nStatistical analysis of relationships between TBI, whole-brain white matter integrity, whole-brain functional connectivity, and PTSD\nWe examined 1) whether TBI is related to FA; 2) whether TBI is related to RSFC, and whether that relationship is mediated by effects of FA; and 3) whether TBI is related to PTSD symptoms, and whether that effect is mediated by effects of FA and/or RSFC. To accomplish this, we conducted the following statistical tests (all 2-tailed, with significance criterion set at p<.05):\nTBI vs PTSD:\nWe used a one-way ANOVA and a Pearson\u2019s correlation, respectively, to test whether TBI status\u2014i.e., the severity of the worst TBI event reported (none, mild, moderate)\u2014or the total number of lifetime TBIs (in individuals with at least one TBI) is related to PCL-5 score.\nTBI vs FA:\nWe used a one-way ANOVA and a Pearson\u2019s correlation, respectively, to test whether TBI status or number of lifetime TBIs is related to mean FA values across all white matter tracts.\nTBI vs RSFC:\nWe used a one-way ANOVA and a Pearson\u2019s correlation, respectively, to test whether TBI status or number of lifetime TBIs influenced mean RSFC strength.\nFA vs RSFC, and mediation effects of FA on TBI-RSFC relationships:\nWe conducted a Pearson correlation to test whether mean FA was associated with mean RSFC strength. We then conducted an ANCOVA and a partial correlation to test how TBI status and number, respectively, are related to RSFC when accounting for FA.\nFA/RSFC vs PTSD, and mediation effects of FA/RSFC on TBI-PTSD relationships:\nWe conducted Pearson\u2019s correlations to test whether mean FA and/or mean RSFC strength were each associated with PCL-5 scores, as well as a multiple regression to test whether they were associated with PCL-5 scores in combination. For each significant relationship between TBI-FA/RSFC and between FA/RSFC and PCL-5, we conducted an ANCOVA/partial correlation (as appropriate) testing how TBI status/number is related to PCL-5 when accounting for FA/RSFC."

    "Methods": "Collectively, a total of 33 age and sex-matched rats were used for all experiments, includingn=\u200923 for telemetric monitoring (n=\u20093 na\u00efve + vehicle,n=\u20093 na\u00efve + RAP,n=\u20097 SCI + vehicle,n=\u200910 SCI + RAP) andn=\u200910 for Western blot analysis (n=\u20092 na\u00efve,n=\u20092 10 days post-injury [DPI],n=\u20092 21 DPI,n=\u20092 21 DPI + CRD,n=\u20092 21 DPI + CRD + RAP).\n\nCardiophysiological monitoring\nAll animal housing conditions, surgical procedures, and post-operative care were conducted according to the University of Kentucky Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the National Institutes of Health animal care guidelines. As described in detail,\n30\n,\n31\nseven days before SCI, na\u00efve anesthetized (2% isoflurane) 3 to 3.5 month old female Wistar rats (\u223c275\u2009g,\nn\n=\u200923) were implanted with telemetric blood pressure transmitters (model HD-S10, Data Sciences International, Inc., St. Paul, MN) into the descending aorta. The probes were secured to the abdominal wall with silk sutures before closing the skin with 3-0 polyglactin sutures and surgical staples. Animals were then treated post-operatively, as described below. Blood pressure was monitored 24/7 (500\u2009Hz sampling rate) using the Dataquest A.R.T. acquisition system (Data Sciences International, Inc., St. Paul, MN) beginning two days pre-injury through four weeks post-injury. Rats were single-housed, with each cage placed directly on top of its corresponding data receiver plate (model RPC-1, Data Sciences International, Inc., St. Paul, MN).\nCaptured recordings were binned into 24-h segments for analysis of daily blood pressure, heart rate (HR), and spontaneous AD (sAD). As described previously in detail,\n31\nsAD was analyzed using a custom algorithm written and implemented in Matlab software (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA). Briefly, this algorithm simultaneously processes 24-h MAP and HR traces for instances where a rise in MAP of 10\u2009mm Hg or more above baseline is accompanied by a decrease in HR of at least 10 beats per minute (BPM). While this algorithm does not require such events to be sustained above baseline for a specific duration, it does require the rise in MAP over baseline to occur within a 35-sec window. The MAP rises that were accompanied by tachycardia (an increase in HR) were not included in these detections. From the computer automated AD event detections, a single human observer then manually eliminated false-positive results stemming from technical artifacts that can arise during normal rat movements and during planned CRD procedures.\n\nSpinal cord transections\nOne week after telemetry probe implantation, 17 of 23 rats undergoing cardiophysiological monitoring were designated for the SCI groups. These randomly selected telemetry rats were anesthetized (ketamine, 80\u2009mg/kg; xylazine 7\u2009mg/kg intraperitoneally [IP]) and underwent a T3 laminectomy before complete transection of the T4 spinal cord (T4Tx) using a scalpel blade, as described previously.\n16\n,\n31\nIn addition, 8 of 10 non-telemetered rats from the Western blot cohort were designated for T4Tx to examine the effect of RAP treatment on mTOR activity after SCI. Altogether, a total of 25 rats underwent T4Tx, including\nn\n=\u200917 for telemetry experiments and\nn\n=\u20098 for Western blot experiments.\nTwo independent observers confirmed complete spinal cord transection of each rat based on full separation of the rostral and caudal stumps. Immediately afterward, gelfoam was placed into the transection site to achieve hemostasis, and the overlying muscles were sutured with 3-0 polyglactin before stapling the skin with wound clips (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL).\n\nPost-operative care\nAll rats that underwent ketamine/xylazine anesthesia received IP injections of yohimbine (3.2\u2009mg/kg Lloyd Laboratories, Shenandoah, IA) to reverse the effects of xylazine. Injured rats were then housed one per cage with food and water\nad libitum\n. A heating pad was placed between each cage and its corresponding data receiver plate for the duration of the study period. Immediately post-operation, rats were administered 10\u2009mL of lactated Ringer solution subcutaneously (SC). Post-surgical pain management was achieved with twice daily buprenorphine HCl injections (0.03\u2009mg/kg SC; Reckitt-Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc., Richmond, VA) for three days. All rats received two daily injections of the antibiotic cefazolin (33.3\u2009mg/kg SC; WG Critical Care, LLC, Paramus, NJ) for five days after operation, and injured rats received twice daily manual bladder expression for two to three weeks or until they regained spontaneous bladder voiding reflexes without signs of urinary tract infection.\n\nRAP administration and CRD\nAll rats were weighed before injections to ensure accurate drug dosage throughout the study period. Rapamycin (3\u2009mg/kg, LC Labs, Woburn, MA) or vehicle (4% ethanol, 5% polyethylene glycol-400, 5% polysorbate-80 in 0.1M phosphate buffered saline [PBS]) was injected IP immediately after injury and then every other day until euthanasia at 10 and 21 DPI for the Western blot cohort, or 28 DPI for telemetered rats. In rodent SCI models, RAP has been administered at 6\u2009mg/kg every other day,\n32\n3\u2009mg/kg daily,\n33\nor 1\u2009mg/kg daily.\n34\nWe chose a 3\u2009mg/kg alternate day dosage based on optimal effectiveness in blocking mTOR signaling.\n35\nMoreover, we found that this dosage attenuates mTOR activity in the spinal cord after T4Tx, as assessed by phosphorylation of the downstream S6 ribosomal protein (\nFig. 1\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nEffects of rapamycin (RAP) treatment on mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity after spinal cord injury (SCI). Western blot analysis showed elevated mTOR activity after both SCI and colorectal distension (CRD) at 21 days post-injury (DPI), but prolonged treatment with RAP (3\u2009mg/kg intraperitoneally, every other day) suppressed mTOR activity in the lumbosacral spinal cord. The ratio of phosphorylated-S6 ribosomal protein to total S6 is used as a downstream indicator of mTOR activity. As a loading control, \u03b1-tubulin was used, and values are expressed relative to na\u00efve control values. Vertical grey lines separate lanes of groups not assessed (i.e., other days post-injury with no changes). Statistical analysis was not performed because of the low sample size (\nn\n=\u20092 per group). Symbols are means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation.\nOn days 14, 21, and 28 post-SCI, na\u00efve and injured rats undergoing telemetric monitoring underwent two consecutive trials of CRD using a balloon-tipped catheter (Swan-Ganz, model# 111F7, Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) inserted 2\u2009cm into the rectum and secured to the tail with surgical tape, as described.\n31\nIn addition, non-telemetered Western blot rats designated for SCI + CRD similarly underwent two consecutive CRD trials at 21 DPI before euthanasia and tissue collection. After catheterization, rats were placed into cylindrical plastic restrainers (Cat # 51335, Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL) to prevent them from tampering with the catheter. All rats were then left in a quiet and dark environment to acclimate to the catheter and restrainer for 30\u2009min before balloon inflation and CRD measurements.\nDuring each CRD trial, the balloon was inflated with 2\u2009mL of air for 60\u2009sec, followed by a 10-min rest interval. Using the Dataquest A.R.T. Acquisition software, \u201cevent markers\u201d were placed at the beginning and end of each CRD trial trace to demarcate CRD-induced cardiovascular changes. Immediately after the second CRD trial at 28 DPI, a final session of prolonged, intermittent CRD was initiated to induce c-Fos expression as described.\n17\nBriefly, this procedure lasted 90\u2009min with 30-sec inflation periods separated by 60-sec rest periods. With this paradigm, a total of 60 rounds of catheter inflation were performed. For all CRD trials, the balloon catheter was fully inflated with 2\u2009mL of air within 5\u2009sec.\nFor measurements of CRD-induced changes in blood pressure and HR, the raw pulsatile arterial pressure data were averaged every 2\u2009sec and converted into MAP traces for analysis in the Dataquest A.R.T. Analysis software. The inter-beat interval was derived from the pulsatile arterial pressure waveform and converted to BPM to generate a separate heart rate (HR) trace. For each trial, the absolute MAP and HR values achieved during CRD stimulation were measured by averaging all data points within the 60-sec window of balloon inflation. In addition, pre-CRD baseline MAP and HR values were generated by averaging all data points within the 30-sec window immediately before the balloon inflation event marker, and CRD-induced changes in MAP and HR were then calculated as the difference between the respective 30-sec baselines and the values achieved during CRD. At each time-point (14, 21, 28 DPI), the values of the two replicate CRD trials were averaged for each rat in the data analyses.\n\nWestern blot analysis\nFor the cohort of age and sex-matched Wistar rats (\nn\n=\u200910) used for Western blotting, the L6-S2 spinal cord segment was rapidly dissected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, after CO\n2\neuthanasia and decapitation. Samples were mechanically homogenized in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer with 5\u2009mm sodium fluoride and protease inhibitors (Cat# 11836153001, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) added to preserve protein phosphorylation status and maintain total protein integrity; 1\u2009mL of RIPA buffer was added per gram of tissue to manually grind samples in a dounce homogenizer before brief (3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009sec) ultrasonic homogenization.\nThe Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Cat# 23225, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to estimate the total protein concentration of each sample, and 20\u2009\u03bcg of total protein from each spinal cord sample were suspended in Laemmli buffer under reducing conditions (5% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) and then separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS\u2013PAGE) using 4-20% Criterion TGX pre-cast gels (Cat# 5671094, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using the Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Cat# 1704150, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with non-fat dry milk (5% in tris-buffered saline/Tween20 [TBST]) for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Blocked membranes were then incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight in primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer. After primary incubation, membranes were washed for 3\u2009\u00d7\u200920\u2009min in TBST before incubating for 1\u2009h at room temperature in secondary antibody diluted in blocking buffer. Excess secondary antibody was then removed by washing for 3\u2009\u00d7\u200920\u2009min in TBST.\nImmunolabeled membranes were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham ECL Advance Western Blotting Detection Kit, GE Healthcare, UK) and imaged with the ChemiDoc MP system (Bio-Rad). Quantification was then performed with ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Washington, DC) by plotting individual lanes and quantifying the area under the curve.\n25\n,\n36\nAntibodies were used according to manufacturer data sheets: pS6 (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology # 2215), S6 (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology # 5G10), \u03b1-tubulin (mouse monoclonal 1:10,000; Abcam #ab7291), horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated goat-anti-rabbit (1:5000; Jackson Immunoresearch Cat# 111-035-144), HRP conjugated goat-anti-mouse (1:5000; Jackson Immunoresearch Cat#115035166). All lanes were normalized to their respective \u03b1-tubulin loading control, and fold-changes were expressed relative to na\u00efve values.\n\nTissue fixation and processing\nAt 28 DPI, all rats undergoing cardiophysiological monitoring were euthanatized within 10\u2009min after the 90-min CRD protocol with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (Fatal Plus, Vortex Pharmaceuticals, Dearborn, MI) before perfusion transcardially with 0.1\u2009M PBS, pH 7.4, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS.\n16\nA 3-cm segment of cord measured from the conus medullaris was dissected and the dura mater carefully removed before post-fixing in 4% PFA for 4\u2009h and storing overnight in 0.1M PB at 4\u00b0C. Tissue was then cryopreserved with 20% sucrose in 0.1M PBS solution with 0.002% sodium azide at 4\u00b0C until all cords had sunk to the bottom of their container.\nSpinal cords were embedded in a mixture of gum tragacanth (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 20% sucrose in 0.1M PBS by evenly aligning 4\u20136 cords side by side within plastic cryomolds that were then snap frozen in \u221240\u00b0C acetone and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until sectioning on a cryostat (Microm Laborgerate, Walldorf, Germany). Frozen tissue blocks were sectioned in the transverse plane at a thickness of 20\u2009\u03bcm, and every fifth section (100\u2009\u03bcm spacing) was mounted onto one of three series of 10 slides (Superfrost, Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), consecutively (i.e., 1\u201310 thoracolumbar; 1a\u201310a lumbar; 1b\u201310b lumbosacral). Up to 15 consecutive rows of cryosections from each block were placed onto each of 10 slides in all three series. In this manner, 0.5\u2009mm separation is represented by two slides separated by five within the series of 10 processed for histological analysis (i.e., slides 1 and 6, 1a and 6a, 1b and 6b). All slides were stored at \u221220\u00b0C until used for histological staining.\n\nImmunohistochemistry and microscopy\nMounted slides were removed from the freezer to thaw at room temperature for 30\u2009min before a series of 3\u2009\u00d7\u200910-min washes in 0.1M PBS with gentle agitation to rehydrate tissue and remove excess embedding media. They were then pre-incubated in blocking buffer consisting of 0.1M PBS containing 0.3% Triton-X and 5% normal goat serum. Tissue was then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C in blocking buffer containing rabbit-anti-CGRP 35.3 (\u03bcg/mL; Sigma #C8198) and mouse-anti-c-Fos (2\u2009\u03bcg/mL; Encor Biotechnology #MCA-2H2). After primary antibody incubation, slides were washed 3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009min in 0.1M PBS. Next, slides were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in blocking buffer containing goat-anti-rabbit conjugated to Alexa-488 (4\u2009\u03bcg/mL; Life Technologies #A11008) or biotinylated goat-anti-mouse (7.5\u2009\u03bcg/mL; Vector #BA9200).\nThe following day, slides were washed 3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009min in 0.1M PBS, and c-Fos sections were shielded from light and incubated for another 4\u2009h at room temperature with Texas Red conjugated streptavidin (3.33\u2009\u03bcg/mL, Vector #SA-5006) in 0.1M PBS. All slides were washed 3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009min in 0.1M PBS before cover-slipping with Vectashield mounting media (Vector #H-1000) containing 5\u2009\u03bcM Hoechts dye (#H3570, Thermo Fisher) to stain nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid. All images acquired for both CGRP and c-Fos quantification were captured using an Olympus BX51 microscope paired with an Olympus Magnafire digital camera (Melville, NY). Image exposure times were kept constant to help maintain a consistent level of background staining.\n\nDensitometric analyses\nFor both c-Fos and CGRP densitometry analyses in the thoracic and lumbosacral cord, five serial coronal sections (1\u2009mm spacing) centered on each of the three levels evaluated (T5/T6, T13/L1, and L6/S1 segments) were used for each rat. For c-Fos quantification, densitometry was performed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). All 24-bit red, green, blue (RGB) photomicrographs were converted into eight-bit black and white images, and the regions of interest (ROI) included the entire right dorsal horn for the L6/S1 level or the dorsal gray commissure for T5/T6 and T13/L1 levels (see\nFig. 6\n). Thresholds for each c-Fos ROI were identified manually by a single experimenter based on the lowest pixel value above which c-Fos+ nuclei were included, and final values were expressed in arbitrary units.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 6.\nRepresentative images of c-Fos immunostaining in cross sections from the T5/T6, T13/L1 and L6/S1 spinal segments of vehicle-treated na\u00efve (\nA,C,E\n) and spinal cord injury (SCI) (\nB,D,F\n) rats after prolonged, intermittent colorectal distension (CRD). The regions of interest used for quantification are delineated by yellow dashed lines in A, C, E. The c-Fos immunoreactivity was increased after SCI + CRD compared with na\u00efve + CRD throughout the dorsal gray commissure (DGC) in thoracic levels (A\u2013D) and dorsal horn of lumbosacral segments (E,F).

    "Methods": "TBI in rats (constrained impact acceleration)\nAll procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee of the University of Pecs Medical School and the National Scientific Ethical Committee on Animal Experimentation, Budapest Hungary in accordance with the Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines. Wistar\u2013Kyoto (WKY) rats (male, 300\u2013350\u2009g) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) and were used for all experiments. Severe impact acceleration diffuse brain injury was induced by Marmarou's well-characterized weight drop model.\n32\nIn brief, with the animals under isoflurane (2%) anesthesia, the skull was exposed by a midline incision between lambda and bregma, and a steel disc was fixed with dental acrylic on the skull. A 450\u2009g cylindrical weight was dropped from 1.5\u2009m onto the disc, causing severe diffuse TBI to the animals. Mortality rate was \u223c15%. MCAs were isolated from animals who survived at 2 and 24\u2009h after trauma for further studies.\n\nPressure-induced responses of isolated MCAs and pharmacological studies\nWe assessed myogenic responses of isolated MCAs to stepwise increases of intraluminal pressure using pressure myography in control rats and in rats 2 (\nn\n=\u20095) and 24\u2009h (\nn\n=\u20095) after severe TBI, based on studies by Golding and colleagues\n18\nin a controlled cortical impact model. In brief, rats were anesthetized and decapitated, and the brains were removed. MCA segments were isolated using microsurgical instruments under an operating microscope, as previously described.\n33\n,\n34\nThe MCA segments were transferred into an organ chamber filled with oxygenated physiological Krebs' solution (21% O\n2\n, 5% CO\n2\n, 75% N\n2\n; 37\u00b0C), and mounted onto two glass micropipettes and pressurized to 80\u2009mm Hg. The hydrodynamic resistance of the micropipettes was matched, and the inflow and outflow pressures were controlled and measured by a pressure servo-control system (Living Systems Instrumentation, Burlington, VT). Inner vascular diameter was assessed with a custom-built videomicroscope system and continuously recorded using a computerized data acquisition system, as reported.\n15\n,\n16\nAll vessels were allowed to stabilize their pressure-induced tone for 60\u2009min. Myogenic responses were obtained by assessing changes in vascular diameter in response to stepwise increases (20\u2009mm Hg steps, for 5\u2009min each) in intraluminal pressure (from 0 to 140\u2009mm Hg). In order to scavenge mitochondrial ROS we administered the mitochondrial antioxidant mitoTEMPO (3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n\u22128\nmol/L,\nn\n=\u20095) into the vessel chamber, and reassessed myogenic responses after 30\u2009min.\nIn a different series of experiments, the decomposition of vascular hydrogen peroxide (H\n2\nO\n2\n) into water and oxygen was catalyzed by the administration of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-catalase (CAT) (120\u2009U/mL,\nn\n=\u20095) onto the vessels for 30\u2009min, and myogenic responses of MCAs were repeated. To test the role BK\nCa\nand TRPV4 channels in the attenuated myogenic constriction of MCAs after TBI, pressure-induced responses of MCAs were obtained in the presence of paxilline (a specific blocker of BK\nCa\nchannels, 10\n\u22126\nmol/L for 20\u2009min,\nn\n=\u20095) and the specific TRPV4 blocker HC 067047 (0.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n\u22126\nmol/L for 20\u2009min,\nn\n=\u20095). To test whether H\n2\nO\n2\nactivates BK\nCa\nand TRPV4 channels, we induced dose-dependent dilation of MCAs in response to H\n2\nO\n2\nin the presence of paxilline (Pax) and HC 067047. To examine whether TRPV4 channels initiate dilation of MCAs through BK\nCa\n, we obtained dose-dependent dilation of vessels by the TRPV4-agonist GSK1016790A in the absence and presence of Pax. All drugs were purchased from SigmaAldrich Hungary (Budapest, Hungary). At the end of each experiment, the pressure-passive diameter curves were obtained in maximally dilated MCAs in the presence of nifedipine. Diameter responses at each pressure step are shown as the percentage of the corresponding passive diameter value at 80\u2009mm Hg. In a separate series of experiments, basilar arteries (BA) were isolated from the same control and TBI rats from which the MCAs were used, and constrictor responses to the thromboxane analogue U46619 were determined in a wire myograph (Danish Myo Technology, Aarhus, Denmark), as previously described.\n35\nIn brief, rings were cut out of the BA and were mounted on 40\u2009\u03bcm stainless steel wires in myograph chambers for measurement of isometric tension. The vessels were superfused with Krebs buffer solution (118\u2009mM NaCl, 4.7\u2009mM KCl, 1.5\u2009mM CaCl\n2\n, 25\u2009mM NaHCO\n3\n, 1.1\u2009mM MgSO\n4\n, 1.2\u2009mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, and 5.6\u2009mM glucose; at 37\u00b0C; gassed with 95% air and 5% CO\n2\n). Optimal passive tension (as determined from the vascular length\u2013tension relationship) was applied for 1\u2009h (equilibration period) and then contraction to U46619 (from 10\n\u22128\nto 10\n\u22125\nmol/L,\nn\n=\u20095) was obtained. Contraction is expressed as the percent of the maximally relaxed rings in the presence of nimodipine.\n\nMeasurement of vascular H\n2\nO\n2\nproduction: CM-H\n2\nDCFDA staining and confocal microscopy\nIn order to detect cerebrovascular H\n2\nO\n2\nproduction after TBI, we used the cell-permeant oxidative fluorescent indicator dye CM-H\n2\nDCFDA (5 [and 6]- chloromethyl-2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate-acetyl ester, SigmaAldrich Hungary, Budapest, Hungary) and confocal microscopy, as previously reported. In brief, MCAs of control rats and rats 24\u2009h after TBI were freshly isolated with microsurgical instruments, placed in wells filled with oxygenated Krebs' buffer and incubated at 37\u00b0C with CM-H\n2\nDCFDA (5\u2009\u03bcM, at 37\u00b0C for 10\u2009min).\n36\nThen, the vessel samples were washed five times in warm oxygenated Krebs' buffer, and placed on slides covered by glass covers. A laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus Fluoview FV1000) was used to visualize CM-H\n2\nDCFDA fluorescence of the vessels. Fluorescence intensity is expressed as fold change compared with control vessels. In a different series of experiments, we repeated the above protocols in the presence of CAT (120\u2009U/mL for 20\u2009min,\nn\n=\u20095 for each group).\n\nQuantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)\nA quantitative real-time RT-PCR technique was used to analyze the mRNA expression of KCNMA1 and KCNMB1 (\u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits of BK\nCa\nchannels, respectively) and TRPV4 in isolated cerebral arteries of control and TBI rats (\nn\n=\u20095 in each group). Briefly, total RNA was isolated with the Pure Link\n\u2122\nRNA Mini Kit (Life Sciences, Carlsbad CA). Vascular samples were homogenized, and RNA was purified by ethanol treatment and eluted from the membrane. The total amount of RNA was determined by using NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific, Waltham MA). High Capacity cDNA kit was applied (Applied Biosystems, Foster City CA) to perform cDNA synthesis. For gene expression analysis, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using SensiFast SYBR Green reagent (BioLine, Luckenwalde, Germany). Amplifications were run on ABI StepOnePlus system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City CA). StepOne software was used to analyze gene expressions, which was normalized to peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPiA) as a reference gene. The primer sequences are shown in\nTable 1\n. The amplification of PCR products was calculated according to the 2\n-\u0394\u0394Ct\nmethod.\n37\nTable 1.\nPrimers\nForward\nReverse\nPPiA\nGCAGACAAAGTTCCAAAGACAG\nCCATTATGGCGTGTGAAGTC\nKCNMA1\nCTTGCGGTTTATTGCAGCCA\nACAGACACAAACACGGGAGG\nKCNMB1\nGTGGAGAGAAACCATCTGCCA\nCCATCACCAGCTTCTTCCCC\nTRPV4\nAAGCCGATATGAGGCGACAG\nTGGTGTTCTCTCGGGTGTTG\nOpen in a separate window\n\nIsolation of cerebral VSMCs\nExperiments were performed on WKY rats housed in the Animal Care Facility at the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC), which is approved by the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. They had free access to food and water throughout the study. All protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of UMMC.\nThe rats were euthanized using 4% isoflurane. MCAs were microdissected and digested in a low calcium dissociation solution containing (in mM): 145\u2009NaCl, 4\u2009KCl, 1\u2009MgCl\n2\n, 10 HEPES, 0.05\u2009CaCl\n2\nand 10 glucose (pH 7.4). Vessels were cut into small pieces, spun down at 1000\u2009rpm for 1\u2009min, and incubated in the dissociation solution containing papain (50\u2009U or 2\u2009mg/mL; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and dithiothreitol (2\u2009mg/mL) for 10\u201315\u2009min 37\n\u00b0\nC in a water bath. The partially digested vessels were spun down at 1000\u2009rpm for 1\u2009min, and the pellet was washed and resuspended in fresh dissociation solution containing albumin (1\u2009mg/mL) collagenase (250 units/mL or 2\u2009mg/mL), and incubated for 10\u201315\u2009min at 37\n\u00b0\nC in a water bath. VSMCs were released into the media by gentle pipetting of the digested tissue. The supernatant was collected, and the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000\u2009rpm for 1\u2009min. The cells were resuspended in a low Ca\n2+\ndissociation solution and maintained at 4\u00b0C. Patch-clamp experiments were completed within 4\u2009h after isolation of the cells (two to three smooth muscle cells from four rats were studied in each group [8\u201312 cells/group]).\n\nWhole cell patch clamp on VSMCs\nBK channel currents were recorded from VSMCs using a whole cell patch-clamp mode at room temperature (22\u201323\u00b0C). The bath solution contained (in mM): 130\u2009NaCl, 5\u2009KCl, 1.8\u2009CaCl\n2\n, 1\u2009MgCl\n2\n, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose (pH 7.4). The pipettes were filled with a solution containing: 130\u2009K gluconate, 30\u2009KCl, 10\u2009NaCl, 1\u2009MgCl\n2\n, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.2). The concentrations of EGTA and Ca\n2+\nin the pipette solution were adjusted to obtain cytosolic free Ca\n2+\nconcentrations of 100\u2009nM as determined using WinMAXC software written by C. Patton (Stanford University Pacific Grove, CA). The pipettes were pulled from 1.5\u2009mm borosilicate glass capillaries using a two stage micropipette puller (model P-97; Sutter Instrument, San Rafael, CA) and heat polished using a microforge. The pipettes had tip resistances of 2\u20138\u2009M\u03a9. After the tip of a pipette was positioned on a cell, a 5\u201320\u2009G\u03a9 seal was formed, and the membrane was ruptured by gentle suction using a glass syringe. An Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) was used to clamp the pipette potential and to record whole cell currents. Outward membrane K\n+\ncurrents were elicited by a series of 20\u2009mV voltage steps (from \u221260 to +120\u2009mV) from a holding potential of \u221240\u2009mV. The amplifier output signal was filtered at 2\u2009kHz using an eight-pole Bessel filter. The currents were acquired using p-CLAMP software (version 10, Axon Instruments) at a rate of 10\u2009kHz, and stored on the hard disk of a computer for off-line analysis. Data analysis was performed using Clampfit software (version 10.0, Axon Instruments). Peak current amplitudes were determined from the average of 5\u201310 trials. Membrane capacitance (in pF) was determined from the average of 30 currents measured in response to a 5\u2009mV pulse. Peak currents (in pA) were expressed as current density (pA/pF) to normalize for differences in the size of the VSMCs. H\n2\nO\n2\n(10\u03bcM), Pax 100\u2009nM), and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) (1\u2009mM) were applied to the bath solution to activate and inhibit BK and TRPV4 channels, respectively.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData were analyzed by Student's\nt\ntest for paired observations or ANOVA followed by Tukey's posth-oc test for multiple comparisons, as appropriate. A\np\nvalue <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.E.M."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAnimal care and experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the European Communities Council Directive of November 24, 1986 (86/609/EEC). Experimental protocols were approved by the Northern Stockholm Laboratory Animal Review Board. All studies were performed on male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (Scanbur, Sweden) 250\u2013280\u2009g, housed at the Karolinska University Hospital (Stockholm, Sweden) in polystyrene cages containing aspen wood shavings, and with free access to water and standard rodent chow and regulated 12\u2009h light\u2013dark cycles. All procedures and housing throughout the study were at room temperature (21\u00b0C\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C) with normal air humidity.\n\nExperimental groups\nA total of 75 male rats were used in this study and were randomized by drawing numbers. They were divided into a na\u00efve group with animals without TBI, a control group that received NaCl after trauma, and a treatment group that received EPO after trauma. The naive group (\nn\n=\u200915) was further divided in groups of five to be used in different experiments. The NaCl or EPO groups (\nn\n=\u200930/group), were further randomized to be euthanized after 1 day or 4 days (\nn\n=\u20095/group/day) in three different experimental settings.\n\nDrug and dose\nEPO (recombinant human Erythropoietin, Eprex, 4000 IU/ml, Janssen-Cilag, France) was administered intraperitoneally 30\u2009min after trauma, and thereafter once daily in a dose of 5000 IU/kg throughout the study. Animals in the control group received an identical volume of saline (isotonic NaCl 0.9%, Fresenius Kabi, Sweden) intraperitoneally.\n\nTBI model\nAfter randomization to either the na\u00efve or the TBI group, the TBI rats were anesthetized by intramuscular injections of 0.15\u2009mL of Hypnorm\n\u00ae\n(10\u2009mg/mL fluanisone and 0.315\u2009mg/mL fentanyl citrate; Janssen Pharmaceutical, Beerse, Belgium) and 0.2\u2009mL Dormicum\n\u00ae\n(midazolam, 1\u2009mg/mL, F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Before skin incision, 0.1\u2009mL of Marcain-Adrenalin\n\u00ae\n(bupivacaine 5\u2009mg/mL and adrenaline 5\u2009\u03bcg/mL, Astra Zeneca, S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje, Sweden) was injected subcutaneously in the sagittal midline of the skull. The rats were placed in a stereotactic frame. Eye-gel (Fucithalmic\u00ae) applied for eye protection and isotonic saline (NaCl 9mg/mL) were used to clean and rinse the scalp wound throughout the experiment. Under aseptic conditions, a craniotomy (2\u2009mm in diameter) was drilled under microscopic guidance at a point 2\u20133\u2009mm posterior and 2\u20132.5\u2009mm lateral to the right side of bregma. A standardized parietal contusion was produced by a weight-drop model after Feeny that has been further developed in our laboratory.\n25\n,\n26\nA weight of 24\u2009g was dropped from a height of 7\u2009cm on a 1.8\u2009mm diameter piston that was set to allow for a maximal tissue compression of 3\u2009mm. The craniotomy was not resealed. Spontaneous ventilation was monitored by pulse oximetry (Datex-Ohmeda, Helsinki, Finland), and oxygen was supplied through a facemask to keep oxygen saturation above 90%. The body temperature was kept at 37.5\u201338\u00b0C by means of a feedback-regulated heating pad. Heart rate and respiratory rate were continuously observed and within physiological range throughout the experimental period (\nTable 1\n). The skin was sutured using Vicryl 4-0 (Ethicon, Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ) and the animals were allowed to recover under at heating lamp with an extra supply of oxygen. The TBI animals showed no deficit in motor, balance, or sensory function during the post-traumatic phase, and they showed normal grooming and feeding behavior.\nTable\n1.\nPhysiological Data during Operation\nGroup\nNaive\nControl\nEPO\nHeart rate\n351\u2009\u00b1\u200911\n359\u2009\u00b1\u200910\n360\u2009\u00b1\u20097\nRespiratory rate\n80\u2009\u00b1\u20092\n85\u2009\u00b1\u20093\n83\u2009\u00b1\u20095\nSaturation\n94\u2009\u00b1\u20093\n95\u2009\u00b1\u20091\n94\u2009\u00b1\u20092\nTemperature (\u00b0C)\n37.5\u201338\n37.5\u201338\n37.5\u201338\nBody weight (g)\n258\u2009\u00b1\u20095\n252\u2009\u00b1\u20094\n255\u2009\u00b1\u20093\nOpen in a separate window\nEPO, erythropoietin.\n\nEuthanasia\nAnimals intended for immunohistochemistry were anaesthetized and euthanized by transcardial perfusion. All other animals were anaesthetized as described, and then immediately killed by decapitation.\n\nMRI\nMRI of the brain (Na\u00efve\nn\n=\u20095, Control/EPO 1 and 4 days\nn\n=\u20095/day/group) was performed at 1 day and 4 days post-injury. Animals were re-anaesthetized with the same doses of midazolam and Hypnorm. After intubation\n27\nwith a16 gauge intravenous catheter (45\u2009mm length, 20\u2009mm hub, 1.7\u2009mm internal diameter [ID]), anaesthesia was maintained with 1.5\u20132% isoflurane, and animals were mechanically ventilated with a small animal ventilator SAR-830P (Stoelting Co, Chicago, IL). The ventilator was set at a tidal volume of 8\u2009mL/kg and a respiratory rate of 40 breaths/min. Rectal temperature was maintained between 36.5\u00b0C and 37.5\u00b0C by using a feedback-regulated heating pad. The eyes were lubricated and covered to prevent dehydration. MRI was performed with a Bruker Biospec 4.7 T scanner (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) fitted with a 12\u2009cm ID self-shielded gradient system (max. gradient strength 200 mT/m). A 38\u2009mm diameter head coil birdcage was used for imaging. Qualitative T2-weighted images were obtained using a rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE)\n28\n(repetition time [TR]\u2009=\u20092500\u2009ms; effective echo time (TE)\u2009=\u200930\u2009ms; RARE factor\u2009=\u20098; field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u20093.5\u2009\u00d7\u20093.5\u2009cm; matrix 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256) five contiguous slices of 1\u2009mm, two averages.\nAt the center of the lesion, a 1.5\u2009mm thick diffusion-weighted image was taken. In order to reach an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio without dramatically increasing the acquisition time, a 128\u2009\u00d7\u200964 matrix for FOV\u2009=\u20093.5\u2009\u00d7\u20093.5\u2009cm was used. Diffusion images were obtained using a pulsed gradient stimulated echo sequence with six diffusion weighting factor bs\u2009=\u200939.049, 93.557, 274.708, 401.350, 665.853, 2391.773\u2009sec/mm\n2\n. The diffusion-sensitizing gradient was placed only along the direction of the slice selection gradient (i.e., rostrocaudally).\n\nMRI: Midline shifts (MLS)\nMLS were determined on T2-weighted images with the use of analysis software ImageJ\u00ae 1.48v (Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, U. S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). After optical adjustment of contrast and brightness, the distance between the outer border of the cortex and the middle of the third ventricle was measured from the ipsilateral (I) and contralateral (C) sides. MLS was calculated using the equation MLS\u2009=\u2009(I-C)/2.\n\nMRI: Edema analysis\nApparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were calculated by ImageJ and the use of MRI Analysis Calculator, a plugin provided for free by Karl Schmidt. Further analysis was performed in the region of interest (ROI), with ROIs being placed in the perilesional cortex area, and at the same site in the contralateral hemisphere. Assessments of both MLS and ADC were performed blinded by one investigator, and calculated as mean of three repeated measurements. Repeated analysis with >2 weeks' separation did not show any statistical significant difference.\n\nImmunohistochemistry: Immunoglobulin (Ig)G staining protocol\nTranscardial perfusion was performed (Na\u00efve\nn\n=\u20095, Control/EPO 1 and 4 days\nn\n=\u20095/day/group) with cooled saline followed by cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.15\u2009M phosphate buffer (pH 7.3\u20137.4). Brains were removed and post-fixed for 90\u2009min in the same fixative followed by wash overnight in 0.15\u2009M phosphate buffer with 17% (w/v) sucrose at 4\u00b0C, thereafter snap frozen in isopentane and stored at \u221270\u00b0C. Whole brain sections 14\u2009\u03bcm were cut horizontally through the length of the contusion using a Leica cryostat, and then thaw mounted onto Super Frost/Plus object glasses, dried at room temperature for 1\u20132\u2009h and stored at \u221220\u00b0C prior to use.\nThe sections were incubated in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 30\u2009min to quench endogenous peroxidase. Before incubation with a primary antibody, blocking serum was used to prevent nonspecific conjugate binding. An avidin-biotin blocking step was then performed with Vectastain Elite avidin-biotinylated enzyme complex (ABC) peroxidase kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) to prevent nonspecific conjugate binding to endogenous biotinylated proteins. Sections were then incubated with primary anti-IgG antibody overnight at +4\u00b0C. In negative controls (data not shown) slides were incubated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). After washing, the indirect peroxidase method was used for detection of the primary antibodies. Biotin-conjugated donkey anti-goat immunoglobulin was used as conjugate. Sections were incubated with a standard ABC kit, and the bound peroxidase was detected via incubation with a 3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate kit. Sections were then dehydrated and mounted with DPX (Distrene 80, di-butyl phthalate, xylene, BDH Laboratory Supplies Pool, UK).\n\nImmunohistochemistry: IgG analysis\nStained sections were scanned with a Nikon Super Coolscan 4000 ED (32 bit, 4000\u2009dpi, standard red, green blue [sRGB]) and saved as TIF images. After adjustment of contrast and brightness in ImageJ, parameters then remained unchanged through the series, and the pictures were converted to grayscale. Three ROIs of the same size were placed in representative areas in both hemispheres in three consecutive sections per animal, and the mean staining intensity for each animal was calculated. We chose to measure the monochromatic intensity of the IgG signal rather than the area, as the dissemination of IgG could be affected unevenly by local factors; for example, edema. We analyzed the contralateral side in all sections, both within groups, between groups, and against sections from na\u00efve animals without any statistical differences in staining intensity. To diminish potential effects of small differences in staining, corresponding areas in the contralateral hemisphere were used for signal normalization, and the results were presented as ipsilateral/contralateral values (\u201cipsi/contra\u201d).\n\nImmunohistofluorescence: Staining protocol\nThe brains for immunohistofluorescence analysis (Naive\nn\n=\u20095, Control/EPO 1 and 4 days\nn\n=\u20095/day/group) were quickly removed, snap frozen in isopentane, and stored at \u221270\u00b0C. Whole brain 14\u2009\u03bcm cryosections were cut coronally through the center of the impact using a Leica cryostat (CM 3000, Leica Instruments GmbH, Nussloch, Germany). The sections were thaw mounted onto Super Frost/Plus object glasses (Menzel\u2013Gl\u00e4zer, Braunschweig, Germany) dried at room temperature for 1\u20132\u2009h, and stored at \u221220\u00b0C prior to analysis.\nPrior to staining, the sections were dried at room temperature for 30\u2009min, rehydrated in PBS, and fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10\u2009min and then rinsed in PBS. Treatment for 60\u2009min with blocking serum (PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.3% triton X-100) was used to prevent nonspecific conjugate binding to the primary antibodies. Primary antibodies (anti- zona occludens 1 [ZO-1] or anti-aquaporin [AQP]4) were diluted in blocking serum and added for incubation overnight at +4\u00b0C either in solitude or in mixtures. Sections were washed in PBS, incubated for 1\u2009h with secondary antibodies, washed again, and cover-slipped with ProLong Gold anti-fade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Negative control staining with omitted primary antibody, or with depletion of the AQP4 primary antibody by an excess of the specific peptide (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), did not result in any detectable labelling.\n\nImmunohistofluorescence: Analysis of AQP4 and ZO-1\nFluorescent microscope images were acquired on a Vslide\n\u00ae\nslide scanning microscope (MetaSystems, Alltlussheim, Germany). Whole microscope slides were scanned at\u2009\u00d7\u20092.5 to adjust focus and to generate a tissue map. Focus and tissue depth were detected based on the DAPI signal. Upper half of brains were scanned using\u2009\u00d7\u200910 objective. Images were stitched together to generate large three channel fluorescence images with microscopic resolution. Acquired images were extracted as TIF files using the software Metaviewer\u00ae (MetaSystems, Alltlussheim, Germany).\n\nImmunohistofluorescence: Quantification of AQP4 and ZO-1\nImageJ was used to analyze antibody labelling in the cortical area. Three quadrant ROIs of 550\u2009\u03bcm width were manually placed in the medial part of the perilesional area in the cortex, and in the corresponding area on the contralateral side. The thresholds were manually set to each individual antibody, but were then kept fixed throughout the experiment. The staining was automatically quantified with batch processing, using an ImageJ macro (created by us) with thresholding and background subtraction. Three ROIs per section and three sections per animal were used to generate a mean value per animal. All sections for each experiment were stained at the same time, to minimize differences between different staining sessions. Contralateral hemisphere was used for signal normalization, and the results presented as ipsilateral/contralateral values (\u201cipsi/contra\u201d). In control experiments, multiple localizations were tested to evaluate that the selected ROIs in both hemispheres were representative, and that the areas in the ipsilateral side represented viable tissue. Selected areas were analyzed at a higher magnification (60\u2009\u00d7\u2009) to ensure that the tissue morphology appeared intact according to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes, number of nuclei, and the density of blood vessels (data not shown). Any increase of GFAP immunoreactivity within the ROI was taken as an indication that astrocytes in the area were viable. To ascertain that control areas in the contralateral side did not differ from corresponding areas in naive animals, the values of ADC, AQP4, ZO1, GFAP, and IgG were analyzed and found not to differ.\n\nStatistical analysis\nEvaluation of data was performed by an observer blinded for the randomization data. Intraobserver variability was calculated after three measurements, each separated by two weeks for the first five measurements in all settings. No statistical differences between the observations were found, with a variability of 3\u20137%, depending on the type of measurement. Statistical analysis was performed using a two sided Student's\nt\ntest. All data were normally distributed.\nP\nvalues <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Calculations were performed using SPSS 20 (IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY) and graphs were made using Prism 6.02 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Data are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD."

    "Methods": "Surgical creation of injuries\nAll procedures on animals followed a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Miami Miller, School of Medicine. Adult female Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (weight 225\u2013250\u2009g) received injuries while anesthetized with isoflurane (1.5\u20132% in oxygen) delivered through a facemask. A heating blanket responding to a signal from a rectal thermistor maintained the body temperature at 37\u00b0C. A laminectomy revealed spinal cervical segment C5, and an Infinite Horizon Impactor device (Precision Systems & Instrumentation, LLC, Lexington, KY) produced a midline contusion injury with a set force of 200 or 250 kdyn and no dwell time, propelled at a velocity of 1\u2009mm/sec with a contact diameter of 2.5\u2009mm. These forces are known to produce mild (200 kdyn) or moderate (250 kdyn) injuries.\n26\nAfter injury, the dissected muscle layers were sutured and the skin was closed with wound clips. Animals recovered on a 37\u00b0C heating blanket. The opioid buprenorphine (0.01\u2009mg/kg bid, subcutaneous) was given over 3 days for analgesia, and the antibiotic gentamycin (0.01\u2009mg/kg b.i.d., subcutaneous) was given over 7 days to prevent infection. Bladder volume was checked daily; manual emptying was not necessary for more than 3 days, consistent with previous findings with this injury model.\n26\n\nStimulator design and implantation\nA self-powered wireless stimulator, described in detail elsewhere,\n27\nwas implanted in the NRM or PAG. The stimulator was enclosed in a cuboid epoxy capsule, from which protruded a cathodal microelectrode and a bare stainless steel wire anode. Most capsules were 15\u2009mm long, 8\u2009mm wide, and 4\u2009mm high. Some longer and taller capsules (18\u2009mm long, 8\u2009mm wide, 6\u2009mm high) were used in one experimental series (series 3) to contain larger batteries and modified circuitry, which allowed longer lifetimes and variable pulse amplitudes (programmable up to 70\u2009\u03bcA in 10\u2009\u03bcA steps). The tungsten microelectrodes (AM Systems Inc., Sequim, WA; model 573210) were of 0.5\u2009M\u03a9 nominal impedance and shortened to reach the stereotaxic target of the NRM or PAG while leaving 1\u2009mm clearance between the capsule and skull. All stimulators signaled their program status by emitting width-modulated infrared pulses detected by a handheld receiver box. Readings were taken at least once a day. Relevant parameters (clock time, pulse width or amplitude, active or inactive status) were controllable with magnetic pulses applied nearby.\nImplantation of the stimulator and electrodes took place on the day of injury or at various later times. The rats were anesthetized with isoflurane as described, and their heads were positioned in a stereotaxic holder. A small hole (\u22481\u2009mm diameter) was drilled in the dorsal surface of the skull for microelectrode access. Target coordinates with respect to the interaural line in the flat-skull plane for the NRM were 0\u2009mm lateral, 2.3\u2009mm caudal, and 0\u2009mm dorsal, and for the PAG they were 0.7\u2009mm lateral, 1.2\u2009mm rostral, and 4\u2009mm dorsal. Two small stainless steel screws were driven into the skull just rostral and caudal to the implanted capsule. The wire forming the anode was wrapped around the rostral screw to make a firm electrical contact. Screws, capsule and exposed electrode wires were covered in rapidly hardening poly-methyl-methacrylate cement that adhered to the skull. When the studied animals awoke from surgery, untoward acute reactions to the stimulation, such as overt twitches or aversive behavior, were absent.\n\nExperimental series and groups\nFour series of experiment were performed, in which injured rats were assigned randomly to stimulated or control (nonstimulated) groups. Series 1\u20133 targeted the PAG, and series 4 targeted the NRM. The programmed stimulation always consisted of 8\u2009Hz trains of 1\u2009ms rectangular cathodal pulses, automatically given daily over 12 daylight hours in 10\u2009min cycles (5\u2009min on, 5\u2009min off), with no stimulation given for 12 night-time hours. The amplitude of the constant-current stimulus was 30\u2009\u03bcA in series 1, 2, and 4, and 70\u2009\u03bcA in series 3.\nWith regard to the timing of interventions, stimulation in series 1 and 4 was commenced within hours or days of the injury (acute injury), whereas in series 2 and 3, stimulation began \u22657 weeks after injury (chronic injury). Specifically, stimulation was started within a few hours of injury in series 1, 7\u20138 or 12 weeks after injury in series 2, 7 weeks after injury in series 3, and 1\u20132 days after injury in series 4. Weeks are numbered here so that week 1 starts on the day of injury (day 0). The planned duration of stimulation was 6 days in series 1, 3 weeks in series 2, 5 weeks in series 3, and 2.5 weeks in series 4. Euthanasia followed by histological analysis was planned for 6 weeks after injury (series 1), 18\u201319 weeks after injury (series 2), 13 weeks after injury (series 3), and 8 weeks after injury (series 4). Control rats received identical injuries and surgeries, but their stimulators were left inactive. Additional groups received neither an injury nor a stimulator implant (intact rats), to provide normal data for variables that could only be measured once (usually terminally).\nAfter stimulation for the designated number of days, devices were inactivated. When infrared signals could not be detected in daily readings, stimulation was assumed to have stopped as a result of battery failure, and stoppage was assured by applying the inactivating pattern of magnetic pulses. Animals were assigned to the stimulated group if the infrared signal disappeared more than halfway through the planned duration of treatment, and to the nonstimulated group if failure occurred within 24\u2009h. Rats stimulated for other durations were excluded from further analysis. Measured times and injury forces, as opposed to planned values, are presented as means in\nTable 1\n, along with a listing of the outcome variables examined for each group.\nTable\n1.\nExperimental Groups: Their Treatments and Outcome Measures\nSeries, group\nn\nStim.\nTarget\nStim. start\na\n(days\nb\n)\nStim. duration (days\nb\n)\nSurvival\na\n(days\nb\n)\nContusion injury (force, kdyn\nb\n)\nOutcome measures\n1, Stim\n10\nYes\nPAG\n0.1\n7.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\n38.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2\n210\u2009\u00b1\u20092.3\nCV\n1, Control\n8\nNo\nPAG\n-\n-\n38.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5\n206\u2009\u00b1\u20092.5\nCV\n2, Early\n5\nYes\nPAG\n47.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3\n22.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7\n125.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6\n208\u2009\u00b1\u20092.3\nCV\n2, Late\n5\nYes\nPAG\n81.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6\n23.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8\n123.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8\n209\u2009\u00b1\u20092.9\nCV\n2, Control\n8\nNo\nPAG\n-\n-\n206\u2009\u00b1\u20092.6\nCV\n3, Stim\n12\nYes\nPAG\n46.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.0\n34.7\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2\n94.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2\n263\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9\nGE, serum\n3, Control\n10\nNo\nPAG\n-\n-\n98.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8\n266\u2009\u00b1\u20093.5\nGE, serum\n4, Stim\n11\nYes\nNRM\n1.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2\n17.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5\n57.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\n262\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4\nGE, CV\n4, Control\n13\nNo\nNRM\n-\n-\n59.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7\n262\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4\nGE, CV\nOpen in a separate window\na\nFrom time of injury.\nb\nMean \u00b1s.e.m.\nStim, stimulation; PAG, periaqueductal gray; NRM, nucleus raphe magnus; CV, cardiovascular; GE, gastric emptying.\nVarious weekly motor tests relevant to cervical injuries (locomotion on a catwalk, hanging by forelimbs, forelimb grip strength, and stability on an inclined plane) were conducted identically on treated rats and their controls. In addition, whole body plethysmography measurements of breathing were performed weekly. Findings from these tests will form the subject of a future article.\n\nBlood pressure and heart rate measurements\nPressor responses indicative of AD were evaluated by a modified version of several published protocols.\n28\n,\n29\nRats were anesthetized with 50\u2009mg/kg ketamine plus 10\u2009mg/kg xylazine (both intraperitoneal). A cannula containing heparinized saline was inserted into a common carotid artery and was connected to a transducer for monitoring blood pressure (Stoelting Co., catalog number 50110); this device was calibrated before testing on each rat. The upper rectum and adjacent colon were distended for 100\u2009sec by rapidly injecting a 4\u2009mL volume of air into a balloon catheter. This procedure was repeated three to five times at intervals of \u22658\u2009min (\nFig. 1\n). To examine pressor responses to cutaneous noxious stimulation, a spring-loaded, serrated clip applied a constant-force (10 kdyn) to each paw in turn for a period of 1\u2009min at intervals of \u22653\u2009min. The peak in mean arterial pressure (MAP) that occurred either during the rectal or cutaneous stimulus or during the subsequent 1\u2009min was subtracted from the resting value. In a small number of cases, the MAP declined monotonically, in which case the nadir was similarly analyzed and included in group averages. The resting MAP or heart rate was calculated as an average over the 20\u2009sec immediately before the start of noxious stimulation. Changes in heart rate were measured in 10\u2009sec periods centered on the MAP peak (or nadir), and subtracted from the rate prevailing in the 10\u2009sec before the noxious stimulus.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExamples of pressor responses measured through a cannula in a common carotid artery during 100\u2009sec of rectal distension. The output of the pressure transducer was digitized at 130 samples per second then plotted as a 250 point moving average covering 1.9\u2009sec, which included five to eight cardiac cycles. Each graph shows three consecutive tests, plotted in blue (first test), red (second test), and green (third test). The purple horizontal bar between 50 and 150\u2009sec indicates the period of distension. Representative animals from all tested injured groups, as detailed in\nTable 1\n, are shown.\n\nGastric emptying\nGastrointestinal motility was assessed by slightly modified published protocols.\n30\u201332\nAfter a 24\u2009h fasting period, awake rats were fed by gavage a 1.5\u2009mL volume of 0.5\u2009mg/mL Phenol Red (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in 5% glucose solution. Fifteen minutes later, an overdose of ketamine and xylazine (120\u2009mg/kg +20\u2009mg/kg) was followed by surgical removal of the gastrointestinal tract via laparotomy. The stomach was clamped at the cardia and pylorus, and the terminal ileum was also clamped. The small intestine was divided into duodenum (\u223c 40%), jejunum (\u223c 30%), and ileum (\u223c30%). The volumes of these four extracted tissues were measured by fluid displacement and then homogenized for 30\u2009sec. After 20\u2009min to allow for settling of solids, the fluid was centrifuged for 10\u2009min at 2800\u2009rpm. Proteins in 5\u2009mL of the resulting supernatant were precipitated with 0.5\u2009mL of trichloroacetic acid (20% w/v) and then centrifuged for 20\u2009min at 2800\u2009rpm. The final supernatant (3\u2009mL) was added to 4ml of 0.5\u2009N NaOH. Samples (50\u2009\u03bcL) were plated in quadruplicate in a 96 well microplate, along with a dilution series (0.5\u20130.0002\u2009mg/mL) to generate a standard linear curve. Absorbance at 560\u2009nm was measured by a microplate spectrophotometer (SpectraMax M5, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The mass of the recovered phenol red was calculated from the absorbance, the dilution curve, and the original tissue volume.\n\nSerum analysis\nSerum was collected from each individual on week 0 (pre-injury), week 7 (pre-implantation), and week 14 (post-stimulation or control). The tip of the tail was first coated in local anesthetic cream, and then, \u223c3\u2009min later, the tail was dipped in warm water (40\u00b0C) to cause vasodilation. A cut was made 0.1\u20130.2\u2009cm from the tip of the tail using a sterile scalpel blade. Blood was collected from the wound, and then pressure was applied to stop the bleeding. The blood was allowed to clot at room temperature for 20\u2009min. It was centrifuged at 4\u00b0C in a plastic gel serum separator Capiject Tubes (Terumo, 3T-MLHG) for 10\u2009min at 2500\u2009rpm. The serum portion was collected and quickly stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Serum insulin was assayed by an ELISA kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, catalog item ERINS), with quantification performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. A standard blood panel assay was provided by the veterinary clinical laboratory at the University of Miami, including the following substances of interest: glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (crea), amylase, calcium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, aspartate transaminase (AST), aspartate aminotransferase (ALT), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), and total bilirubin.\n\nHistology\nAnimals were euthanatized with intraperitoneal ketamine (120\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (dosage 20\u2009mg/kg) and perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde. Spinal cords were carefully extracted, post-fixed overnight in paraformaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin. A length of spinal cord, 2.5\u20137.5\u2009mm below the injury, was cut in coronal sections (12\u2009\u03bcm). Some sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Others were immunostained with anti-CGRP (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany). Specimens were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the primary anti-CGRP antibody (1:200) and then incubated at room temperature for 2.5\u2009h with secondary donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Alexa Fluor 488, 1:250, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For triple labeling, anti-NeuN (1:500, MAB377 Millipore) was present with the anti-CGRP, and revealed by donkey anti-mouse antibody (Alexa Fluor 594, 1:250, Invitrogen), and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector Labs) was included in the mounting medium. Images of CGRP staining were acquired with a UPLSAPI 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009NA 0.40 objective on an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope using identical image-acquisition parameters. Three serial sections 240\u2009\u03bcm apart from approximately the first thoracic segment were analyzed for color thresholds with the open-source platform Fiji.\n33\nCGRP expression was quantified in laminae I and II of the dorsal horn in terms of staining density, after subtraction of background density measured in a 50\u2009\u00d7\u200950\u2009\u03bcm area of tissue with no immunoexpression.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis employed the SPSS software package (v. 24, IBM), applying a significance level of\np\n<\u20090.05 in two sided tests. For the cardiovascular variables, gastric emptying and CGRP density, a one way ANOVA was conducted within each tested series on nonstimulated (injured), stimulated (injured), and intact groups. The ANOVA was followed by post-hoc comparison of the intact and stimulated groups against the nonstimulated group using Dunnett's test. Each substance assayed in serum was subjected to one way univariate ANOVA, followed by repeated contrast (k-matrix) analysis of consecutive groups: week 0, week 7, week 14 nonstimulated, and week 14 stimulated. The observed power (1-\u00df) was calculated from the type II error rate (\u00df) for \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05, along with the effect size (partial \u03b7\n2\n). Detailed statistical results with ANOVA are presented in the figures and their legends. Mortality rates were obtained by the Kaplan\u2013Meier method."

All animals were housed under controlled environmental conditions and allowed food and water\nad libitum\n. Adult, male, Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) ranging in weight from 350 to 480\u2009g were anesthetized (4% isoflurane), intubated and ventilated (2.0% isoflurane) in O\n2\n/room air (80:20) using a volume ventilator (Small Animal Ventilator, Harvard Apparatus, Inc., Holliston, MA). Core body temperature was monitored using a rectal telethermometer (Thermalert Monitoring Thermometer, Physitemp Instruments, Inc., Clifton, NJ) and maintained within normal limits using a thermostatically controlled water blanket (Mul-T-Pad Temperature Therapy Pad, Gaymar Industries, Inc., Orchard Park, NY). After intubation, the scalp was shaved, foam plugs were placed in each ear, and the animal was secured on the specimen tray with Velcro\n\u00ae\nstraps in a transverse prone position with the head supported at right angles to the direction of the shockwave by a leather sling suspended between two supports. When the specimen tray was placed in the ABS, only the rat's head was exposed to the shockwave (\nFig. 1B\n). After the rat was secured to the specimen tray, the isoflurane was temporarily discontinued, the ventilator hoses were detached but the rat remained intubated, the specimen tray was locked into the ABS and, at the return of a withdrawal reflex to paw pinch, the rat was subjected to bTBI (19.6\u2009psi \u00b11.8, 135\u2009kPa \u00b112.4) or sham bTBI. Shock-wave overpressures had a mean rise time of 0.37\u2009ms \u00b10.006 and a duration of 3.50\u2009ms \u00b10.063, calculated using the slope and y-intercept formula. After injury, the animal was removed from the ABS, the duration of suppression of the righting reflex was recorded, the animal was reconnected to the ventilator, and anesthesia with isoflurane was resumed. For all sham animals, the preparatory procedure previously stated was followed, but the rat was not subjected to bTBI. Rats were intubated and mechanically ventilated for the measurements of relative cerebral perfusion to maintain constant anesthetic levels. For the sake of consistency and to make the separate experiments as similar as possible, all rats were intubated and ventilated.\n\nMeasurements of MCA diameters\nThirty or sixty mintes after ABS bTBI (\nn\n=\u20096/group) or sham (\nn\n=\u20096/group) injury, the isoflurane level was increased to 4% for a minimum of 5\u2009min, the rat was decapitated, the brain was removed, and MCA segments were collected and mounted in an arteriograph (Living Systems Instrumentation, Inc., Burlington, VT)\n52\n,\n59\nwithin 15\u201320\u2009min of harvest by an investigator blinded to the experimental group. The arterial segment was bathed in physiologic salt solution composed of 130\u2009mM NaCl, 4.7\u2009mM KCl, 7\u2009mM MgSO\n4\n, 1.17\u2009mM H\n2\nO, 5\u2009mM glucose, 1.5\u2009mM CaCl\n2,\nand 15\u2009mM NaHCO\n3\nmaintained at 37\u00b0C and equilibrated for 60\u2009min with intravascular pressure set at 50\u2009mm Hg. The MCA segments were viewed using an inverted microscope equipped with a video camera and video scaler. Dilator responses were confirmed by decreasing intravascular pressure in 20\u2009mmHg increments with a 10\u2009min equilibration period at each level before the diameter was measured.\n\nMeasurements of relative cerebral perfusion using LDF\nRats were anesthetized, intubated, and ventilated as described, and a tail artery was cannulated with polyethylene (10) tubing. The animal was placed in a stereotaxic frame and the scalp shaved. The midline scalp was incised, reflected and a .25 in. (0.6\u2009cm) portion of the skull lateral to the midline over the frontal-parietal cortex thinned using an air-cooled dental drill. A fiberoptic needle probe was positioned over the thinned area away from large blood vessels, and shielded from external light. Baseline cerebral perfusion and MAP were measured, the LDF probe was removed, the edges of the scalp were sutured, foam plugs were placed into each ear, and the animal was removed from the stereotaxic frame and secured on the ABS specimen tray. Anesthesia was temporarily discontinued and, immediately after the return of a withdrawal reflex to paw pinch, the rat was subjected to ABS bTBI (\nn\n=\u200912) or sham (\nn\n=\u200910) injury as described. Immediately after injury, the animal was removed from the ABS and reconnected to the ventilator, anesthesia was resumed (2.0% isoflurane), the animal was re-secured to the stereotaxic frame, the were sutures cut, the scalp was reflected, and the LDF needle probe was repositioned over the same thinned skull area. A temperature probe was placed deep into the temporalis muscle. Cerebral perfusion and arterial blood pressure recordings were continued for 2\u2009h post-injury. Relative cerebral perfusion was calculated and expressed as a percent of pre-bTBI baseline. Cerebral vascular resistance was calculated from MAP and cerebral perfusion (cerebral vascular resistance\u2009=\u2009MAP/LDF).\n\nTechnical considerations-LDF\nLaser Doppler perfusion measurements are expressed as a percentage of baseline values. Ideally, the LDF probe remains in the same location for the duration of the measurements. However, in our studies, baseline LDF measurements were recorded and the rats were removed from the stereotaxic frame, subjected to ABS bTBI or sham injury, and then returned to the stereotaxic frame. Although we attempted to replace the probe in exactly the same location from which the baseline measurements were made, we may have been unable to do so in some cases. In order to compensate for the possibility of misplaced probes in both the sham and bTBI groups, we excluded all animals in which the first measurement after the probe was replaced (5\u2009min post-blast time point), which yielded LDF values 20% higher or lower than baseline in the absence of comparable changes in MAP (five sham rats and three bTBI rats were excluded). However, it is important to note that relative cerebral perfusion was significantly (\np\n<\u20090.02, bTBI vs. sham) reduced by mild bTBI even if all animals were included in the calculations of relative cerebral perfusion. Additionally, it is possible that thinning of the skull for LDF measurements may have compromised skull integrity, thus contributing to injury induction/severity. However, the scalp covering the thinned area was tightly sutured before administration of blast injury. We observed no evidence of skull fracture in the rats subjected to bTBI. Although some minor surface blood was observed under the thinned skull in 4 out of the 12 rats subjected to bTBI, no hemorrhage was observed in 8 of the 12.\n\nHistopathology\nRats were subjected to ABS bTBI (\nn\n=\u20096/group) or sham (\nn\n=\u20096/group) injury, the duration of suppression of the righting reflex was measured, and 24 or 48\u2009h later, the rats were anesthetized with 4.0% isoflurane for a minimum of 5\u2009min and decapitated. The brains were removed and immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at -80\u00b0C. The brains were sectioned (10\u2009\u03bcm) on a cryostat (Leica CM1860, Leica Biosystems, Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL) and every 25th section was mounted on microscope slides (Fisherbrand\u2122 Superfrost\u2122 Plus slides, Fisher Scientific Co., Pittsburgh, PA). Sections were immersed in 75% ethanol for 1\u2009min, in Milli-Q\n\u00ae\nH\n2\nO for 1\u2009min. and in cresyl violet for 15\u201320\u2009sec at room temperature. Sections then were washed in Milli-Q H\n2\nO twice for 30\u2009sec each then immersed in FJC (0.0001% in Milli-Q H\n2\nO with 0.1% acetic acid vehicle) for 4\u2009min. Sections were removed from the FJC and washed in Milli-Q H\n2\nO three separate times for 1\u2009min each, in 95% ethanol for 30\u2009sec, and then in 100% ethanol for 30\u2009sec. Lastly, sections were immersed in xylene twice for 3\u2009min each, then allowed to air dry overnight in a darkened fume hood. Two investigators, who were blinded to the experimental groups, counted 30 slides with two sections mounted on each slide (an average of 60 brain sections for each animal). Ten sections (five slides) were taken from the region corresponding to the frontal lobe, 40 sections (20 slides) were taken from the parietal/temporal lobe region/s, and 10 sections (five slides) were taken from the occipital lobe/cerebellum region. FJC-positive cells in each section were viewed using an imaging system monitor connected to an Olympus BX51 research system microscope (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) using a filter system suitable for visualizing fluorescein or fluorescein isothiocyanate. FJC-positive cells were summed across all sections for each individual region. The mean of the two investigators' counts was calculated to get a total mean count for each whole brain. Some sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to determine whether mild bTBI resulted in histological evidence of injury (e.g. intraparenchymal hemorrhage, ventricular enlargement).\n\nTechnical considerations-histopathology\nAlthough FJ is widely used to stain injured and/or dying neuronal cells,\n60\u201364\nthere is evidence that FJ-positive cells may be injured but not necessarily dying,\n65\nand FJ may stain non-neural cells (e.g., activated microglia, astrocytes) under circumstances in which it is combined with specific markers for detection of glial fibrillary acidic protein or activated CD68 microglia.\n66\n\nAssessment of behavioral and cognitive function\nEach animal was randomly assigned to receive ABS bTBI (\nn\n=\u200910) or sham (\nn\n=\u200910) injury, trained on beam walk\n67\u201369\nand beam balance\n67\n,\n68\n,\n70\ntasks the day before bTBI or sham injury and on the day of blasting prior to injury, subsequently tested on the beam walk and beam balance tasks on post-injury days 1\u20135, and then tested on the Morris water maze (MWM) task on post-injury days 11\u201315. The beam walk task involved training rats to traverse an \u223c3\u2009ft. (1\u2009m) long, 1\u2009in. (2.5\u2009cm) wide solid pine beam with a darkened goal box attached at the far end and a lamp and white noise generator as an aversive stimulus at the starting end. Dulled nails (1.75\u2009in. [4.4\u2009cm] length) acting as distracting obstacle pegs were alternately staggered near the edges along the beam to provide some negotiation difficulty. The time required for the animal to reach the goal box from the starting point was recorded for three successive trials. For the beam balance task, rats are trained to balance on a plywood beam \u223c1\u2009ft. (0.3\u2009m) in length and .5 in. (1.3\u2009cm) wide that is open ended, with a whiteboard barrier on the other end. Each animal was scored on its ability to balance on the beam for 60\u2009sec on three separate trials. The MWM task\n71\u201374\nutilized a white, circular pool 6\u2009ft. (2\u2009m) in diameter filled to a depth of \u223c2.5\u2009ft.) (0.8\u2009m), which contained a transparent goal platform (4.5 in. [11.4\u2009cm] diameter) located just below the water's surface. External cues consisting of arrows and rectangles are attached to each of the four walls in the testing room for spatial reference. Each animal received four pairs of timed trials per day, for 5 consecutive days. For each pair of trials, the entry point and platform locations were randomized, while visual cues located on the walls of the testing chamber remained constant throughout each day. For each trial, the animal was placed in the maze facing the pool wall and given 120\u2009sec to locate and climb onto the hidden platform. If the animal was not able to locate the platform by the allotted time at the end of the first trial, it was placed on the platform for 30\u2009sec before being returned to the start position for the second trial. Between the pairs of timed trials, the animals were kept in a heated warming box. During the 4\u2009min interval between pairs of trials, both the start position and the goal location were changed. Movement within the maze was recorded with a video camera, a video scanning unit, and the SMART tracking computer software (San Diego Instruments, Inc., San Diego, CA).\n\nEffects of ONOO\n\u2212\nscavenger administration on relative cerebral perfusion using LDF\nRats were prepared for measurements of relative cerebral perfusion and MAP as described. Anesnthesia was discontinued following baseline LDF and MAP measurements and, immediately after the return of a withdrawal reflex to paw pinch, the rats were subjected to ABS bTBI (\nn\n=\u20098), ABS bTBI + PenME treatment (\nn\n=\u20098), or sham (\nn\n=\u20098) injury. Immediately after injury, anesthesia (2.0% isoflurane) was resumed, the rat was returned to the stereotaxic frame, the scalp reflected, and the LDF needle probe was repositioned over the thinned skull. A temporal temperature probe was then placed deep into the temporalis muscle. Five minutes post-bTBI, 10\u2009mg/kg of PenME was administered in 0.1\u2009mL saline vehicle through the cannulated tail vein. Measurements of cerebral perfusion and arterial blood pressure were continued for 2\u2009h post-bTBI. Relative cerebral perfusion was calculated and expressed as a percent of pre-bTBI baseline. Cerebral vascular resistance was calculated from MAP and related cerebral perfusion (cerebral vascular resistance\u2009=\u2009MAP/LDF).\n\nTechnical considerations-ONOO\n\u2212\nscavenger administration\nPen is a stoichiometric scavenger that, through a series of proton transfer reactions, inactivates ONOO\n\u2212\nby converting it to the reactive nitrogen species peroxynitrous acid and then to nitro-penicillamine and water.\n48\nUsing a radioimmunoassay that measured the protection of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from ONOO\n\u2212\n, Althaus and colleagues\n75\nreported that Pen was the most effective of the 10 ONOO\n\u2212\nscavengers that they tested (e.g., cystoamino, cysteine, cysteine methyl ester, cystoamino methyl ester, Pen). Whereas Pen has limited blood\u2013 brain barrier permeability and acts intravascularly, PenME is a lipophilic, blood\u2013brain barrier permeable ONOO\n\u2212\nscavenger that can act extravascularly.\n48\nThe dose of PenME was selected based on a previous report that 10\u2009mg/kg produced dose-related improvements in early neurological recovery.\n48\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 5 software, (GraphPad software version 5.00, San Diego, CA). The response to changes in intravascular pressure was assessed by calculating percent change from baseline (100\u2009mm Hg) for each level of intra-arterial pressure (80, 60, 40, and 20\u2009mm Hg). Unpaired Student's\nt\ntests were used to evaluate differences between the bTBI and sham group baselines. Differences in MCA dilator responses between bTBI and sham groups were assessed using a repeated one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) Dunnett's multiple comparisons test and a Bartlett's test for equal variance. Relative cerebral perfusion, MAP, and cerebral vascular resistance data in both the untreated and PenME-treated studies were analyzed using unpaired Student's\nt\ntests and two-way ANOVA after calculating percent change from baseline for each respective parameter. For the whole brain analysis, the numbers of FJC-positive cells counted by two investigators blinded to group (i.e., sham vs. bTBI) were averaged for each of the four groups (24 and 48\u2009h sham, 24 and 48\u2009h bTBI). Means for the whole brain cells counts between the 24 and 48\u2009h sham and bTBI groups were compared using one way ANOVAs. For the regional analysis, the numbers of FJC-positive cells counted by the two investigators were averaged for each region (frontal, parietal/temporal, and occipital) in each of the four groups. The numbers of FJC-positive cells in the frontal, parietal/temporal, and occipital regions 24 and 48\u2009hr post-bTBI were compared using two way ANOVAs followed by post-hoc testing used to identify significant differences among injury groups and regions. A repeated measure two way ANOVA was performed on the differences in the MWM latencies to the goal platform between the first and second trials of each successive day between the two groups as a whole. Because beam balance scores were ordinal, those data were analyzed using the Mann\u2013Whitney test.\nBecause of the reduction in statistical power that results from repeated testing, comparisons at each specific pressure time point in the MCA experiments (e.g., between 100 and 80 or between 60 and 40) or between individual days between the two groups in the beam walk, beam balance, and MWM trials (e.g., between days 1 and 5 or days 12 and 14) were not conducted. Significance was accepted at the\np\n\u2264\u20090.05 level. All data in the text, table, and figures are expressed as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard errors of the means."

    "Methods": "Materials\nGalantamine hydrobromide was purchased from Tocris (Bristol, UK). Antibodies against von Willebrand factor (vWF; catalog no.: F3520; 1:3000) were bought from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), Claudin-5 (catalog no.: 35-2500; 1:500) from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA), glutamic acid decarboxylase 67\u2009kDa (GAD67; catalog no.: MAB5406; 1:1000) from Millipore (Billerica, MA), and doublecortin (catalog no.: 4604; 1:1000) from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were purchased from Envigo (Houston, TX). Animals were housed under temperature-controlled conditions with a 12-h light/dark cycle and\nad libitum\naccess to water and food. Animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Welfare Committee and were in compliance with the National Institute of Health's (NIH) Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\nControlled cortical impact injury\nAn electromagnetic controlled cortical impact (CCI) device was used to cause moderate brain injury as has been previously described.\n24\n,\n25\nMale Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (275\u2013300\u2009g) were anesthetized with isoflurane, and a cranietomy (6-mm diameter) was made over the right parietal cortex. Injury consisted of a single impact at 5.0\u2009m/sec, 2.5\u2009mm deformation to the right parietal cortex. Sham animals were anesthetized and received an incision, but not the craniotomy or impact. Acute neurological responses (i.e., suppression of pain reflexes, righting response) were monitored immediately after the injury to ensure comparability across injuries. Body temperature was monitored and maintained at 37\u00b0C using a Deltatherm heating blanket attached to a rectal thermometer. After injury, animals were allowed to recover in a warmed chamber before being returned to their home cages. Male C57BL/6 mice were used for BBB permeability assays and immunohistological evaluation of cerebral vasculature. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and a craniotomy (5.0\u2009mm) performed on the right cranial vault midway between lambda and bregma. A single impact at 3.0\u2009m/sec, 1.0\u2009mm deformation to the right parietal cortex was delivered to cause brain injury.\n\nDrug preparation and administration\nGalantamine hydrobromide was solubilized in sterile saline. Previous reports have indicated that the plasma half-life of galantamine is 7\u2009h (in humans), with the recommended doses for use in AD patients being 8\u201312\u2009mg, given twice a day. In rats, the half-life has been determined to be 3.5\u2009h (in males) and approximately 2\u2009h in mice.\n26\n,\n27\nThe doses chosen for these studies (3\u2009mg/kg in mice, 1\u2009mg/kg in rats) were based on the human dose range, after correction for body-surface-area differences (human/rat\u2009=\u20091:6.2; human/mouse\u2009=\u20091:12.3\n28\n). Because of its relatively shorter half-life in mice compared to rats, we administered 3\u2009mg/kg in order to extend its duration of effectiveness. Drug (or vehicle) was initially administered (intravenously; i.v.) 30\u2009min post-injury, with an additional dose given approximately 7\u2009h later. Additional doses were given twice-daily for 3 additional days, or until time of euthanasia. Although we have not directly measured the blood concentration of galantamine, it is anticipated that administration of two doses a day (separated by 7\u2009h) would result in two short-lived peaks.\n\nMeasurement of blood\u2013brain barrier permeability\nBBB permeability was assessed by measuring the extravasation of Evans Blue dye as described previously.\n25\n,\n29\nTwenty-four hours after CCI injury, animals were anesthetized and Evans Blue (3% in saline) was injected slowly through the jugular vein (4\u2009mL/kg) and allowed to circulate for 1.5\u2009h. After the circulation period, animals were given an overdose of pentobarbital (100\u2009mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were removed, and ipsilateral hemispheres were incubated in 0.5\u2009mL of formamide at 55\u00b0C for 24\u2009h. After incubation, the formamide solution was cleared by centrifugation at 20,000\ng\nfor 20\u2009min. The supernatant was collected, and the optical density at 620\u2009nm was measured to determine the relative amount of dye in each sample. A standard curve was simultaneously generated to confirm the linearity of the recorded values.\n\nImmunohistochemistry and fluorescence quantification\nFor assessment of BBB components, animals were euthanized 24\u2009h post-injury, then brains were removed and quickly frozen in \u221280\u00b0C isopentane. Thirty-micron-thick coronal sections were prepared and mounted directly on gelatin-subbed slides. After air drying, the sections were fixed with 100% methanol for 20\u2009min at \u221220\u00b0C and then rinsed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 0.25% Triton X-100 (TBS-TX) for 20\u2009min. The sections were blocked in 5% goat serum in TBS-TX at room temperature for 1\u2009h followed by incubation with primary antibodies in 2.5% goat serum in TBS-TX at 4\u00b0C for 24\u2009h and then with species-specific secondary antibodies in 2.5% goat serum in TBS-TX for 3\u2009h at room temperature. Fluorescence intensity was quantified as described previously.\n25\n,\n30\nBriefly, images of immunofluorescence were captured using a Zeiss Axiovert S100 microscope through a Zeiss EC Plan-Neofluar 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009/0.5 lens and a MicroFIRE camera. The parameters used for image acquisition (including laser power, iris size, brightness, offset, etc.) were adjusted to minimize the background and optimize the signal using a tissue section from an injured animal. These parameters were then kept constant across all subsequent groups. ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD) was used to quantify the fluorescence intensity. Fluorescent images from three nonoverlapping regions in the ipsilateral cortex (0.5\u2009mm from injury core) from each section, and two sections from each animal (\nn\n=\u20095 mice/group), were captured and quantified\n\nImmunohistochemistry and cell counts\nFor assessing neuronal nuclei (NeuN), GAD67, and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), rats were overdosed 1 month post-injury with sodium pentobarbital (100\u2009mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with PBS followed by 4% PFA. For assessing doublecortin immunoreactivity, rats were euthanized as described above on day 3 post-injury. Brains were removed, post-fixed overnight in perfusant, then cryoprotected in a 30% sucrose solution. Cryosections (40-\u03bcm thickness) spanning the rostral-caudal extent of the hippocampus were prepared. Free-floating sections were incubated overnight in primary antibody (0.5\u20131.0\u2009\u03bcg/mL) in TBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 2.5% normal goat serum. After extensive washing, immunoreactivity was detected using species-specific secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa Fluors. A blind counting methodology was employed for determination of GAD67-positive inhibitory neurons in the hilus of the ipsilateral hippocampus. Every 10th section through the ipsilateral dorsal hippocampus was processed for GAD67 immunoreactivity as described above. Positive cells within the hilus were counted using the optical dissector technique (Stereo Investigator; MicroBrightField Bioscience, Williston, VT).\n31\nCells in the outermost planes of focus (5\u2009\u03bcm) were omitted to avoid counting cell caps. The number of GAD67-labeled neurons in approximately 20 computer-chosen areas within the hilus was scored for each section. The counting frame was 108\u2009\u00d7\u2009108\u2009\u03bcm. The size of the counting frame, and the number of grid sections, was determined based on preliminary cell counts. The number of GAD67-labeled cells/mm\n2\nfor each section was obtained from the estimated cells divided by the contour area. The number of cells/mm\n2\nfor each animal (\nn\n=\u20094 rats/group) was calculated as the average of the number of cells/mm\n2\nfrom each section examined. For counting doublecortin-positive newborn neurons, coded slides were counted by two independent observers who were blind to the treatment groups. Doublecortin-positive cells implanted in the dentate gyrus were counted and the lengths of the dentate gyrus measured. The number of cells/mm were calculated from three sections for each animal (\nn\n=\u20094/group).\n\nBlood collection and plasma preparation\nAt 24\u2009h and 6 days, animals were overdosed with sodium pentobarbital. Once the animal failed to respond to tail and foot pinch, the heart was exposed and blood was collected by cardiac puncture using a 16-Ga needle attached to a 3-mL syringe. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid was added as the anticoagulant. Platelet-poor plasma was prepared by centrifuging the blood at 1000\ng\nfor 10\u2009min to remove the erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets. The supernatant solution was removed and centrifuged again at 10,000\ng\nfor 10\u2009min to generate a platelet-poor plasma fraction. Plasma was aliquoted and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until needed.\n\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assays\nRat plasma and tissue interleukin (IL)-1\u00df levels were assessed using sandwich-style enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs; Quantikine IL-1\u00df assay; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The range of the standards was based on the vendors' instructions and on our previous experience with these techniques. The concentrations of each sample (assayed in triplicate) were calculated by comparison to the appropriate reference standard curve. For tissue extracts (prepared in assay buffer provided in the ELISA kit), a microBCA (bicinchoninic acid) assay was performed to determine protein concentration. ELISA results were normalized to the total protein amount in the sample.\n\nWestern blots\nHigh-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) levels in serum were assayed using western blots as previously described.\n32\nBriefly, equal volumes of plasma (50\u2009\u03bcL) were centrifuged on an Ultracel 100K Amicon centrifugal filter for 15\u2009min at 14,000\ng\n. The flow-through was collected, 10\u2009\u03bcL of which was boiled in gel load buffer and separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), membranes were stained with Ponceau S and imaged. Membranes were then blocked in 5% BSA in TBS overnight at room temperature, then incubated in anti-HMGB1 antibodies (0.5\u2009\u03bcg/mL) for 3\u2009h followed by extensive washing and incubation in an horseradish peroxidase\u2013conjugated secondary antibody. Immunoreactivity was detected using a chemiluminescence substrate (SuperSignal West Pico; Life Technologies, Woburn, MA) followed by imaging and quantification using a LiCor\nC-Digit\nimager. Immunoreactive signals were normalized by two different methods. The protein concentration of the flow-through from the 100K Amicon centrifugal filter was determined by a microBCA assay, and the HMGB-1 immunoreactive signals were normalized by the relative protein amount in each sample. In addition, to account for potential transfer problems, the optical density of the stained proteins (<50\u2009kDa) within each lane of the Ponceau-stained membrane was quantified and used to normalize HMGB-1 immunoreactivity.\n\nQuantitative polymerase chain reaction for microglial phenotype markers\nCortical tissue in the penumbra region of the brain injured animals (or sham-operated controls) was removed and sonicated in Trizol (Invitrogen) and total RNA was extracted. A 1-\u03bcg sample of total RNA was reverse transcribed using the SuperScript\n\u00ae\nVILO\n\u2122\ncomplementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis kit (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The level of expression of each target mRNA was quantified by amplification of the cDNA in triplicate using a CFX Connect\n\u2122\nReal-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers and dual-labeled fluorescent probes were purchased from Bio-Rad (Prime PCR Assay\n\u2122\n). The amplification protocol consisted of one cycle at 95\u00b0C for 3\u2009min followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 10\u2009sec and pre-determined annealing temperature (described below) for 30\u2009sec. A single amplified product was confirmed by melt curve analysis. The annealing temperature was pre-determined for each primer set in the range from 58\u00b0C to 62\u00b0C. For quantification, a standard curve was generated for each amplification using increasing concentration of the pooled cDNA from the injured animals to determine the linear range and amplification efficiency. The threshold cycle of each sample was fitted to the standard curve to calculate the relative DNA abundance in the sample. The amplification efficiency was within 80\u2013100%, and the regression coefficient\nR\n2\nwas >0.90.\n\nAssessment of recognition memory\nRecognition memory was assessed using the novel object recognition (NOR) task. The NOR task relies on the behavior that a rat will spend more time exploring a novel object than it does an object with which it is familiar.\n33\nIn this task, animals were pre-exposed to a testing chamber (100\u2009\u00d7\u2009100\u2009cm box) twice-daily for 2 days. After the habituation period, two identical objects were introduced and the rat was allowed to explore them for a period of 10\u2009min. Twenty-four hours later, the rat was placed back into the training chamber, with one of the familiar objects replaced by a novel object that had a different shape but was the same color and relative size. The time spent exploring the novel and familiar objects was recorded during a 4-min testing session. The difference in time spent exploring the novel object versus the familiar one was used as a measure of recognition memory.\n\nAssessment of spatial learning and memory\nRats were tested for their spatial learning and memory using the standard hidden platform version of the Morris water maze.\n34\u201337\nBeginning on day 14 post-injury, animals were given four training trials per day (with an intertrial interval of 4\u2009min) for 6 days. If the animal failed to locate the platform within 60\u2009sec on any given trial, it was led there by the experimenter. Twenty-four hours after the last day of training, spatial memory was tested by removing the platform from the water maze and allowing the animals to search for a period of 60\u2009sec. Time to first platform crossing and number of platform crossings were recorded and used as indices of memory. After the completion of the memory test, reversal learning was assessed by placing the platform back into the tank at a position 180 degrees from its previous location. Rats were given four training trials with the platform in the new location to assess their cognitive flexibility. Movement within the maze was monitored using a video camera linked to tracking software (EthoVision; Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, the Netherlands).\n\nContext fear conditioning\nBeginning on day 28 post-injury, rats were trained in a one-trial fear-conditioning task. Rats were placed in the training chamber and allowed to freely explore their surroundings for a period of 2.5\u2009min. Freezing behavior was monitored (in 2-sec increments) throughout the 2.5-min period by an observer blind to the injury status of the animals. A 2-sec, 0.7-mA footshock was then delivered. Thirty seconds after the footshock, the rats were removed from the training chamber and returned to their home cage. Twenty-four hours later, context-specific fear memory was tested by placing the animal back in the training chamber for a period of 3\u2009min and scoring freezing behavior.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe number of animals used for each experiment was determined using a power analysis and based upon our experience with the techniques/tests utilized. Statistical comparisons were carried out using the statistics package within SigmaPlot (version 11.0; Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA). Data were subjected to a Shapiro-Wilk normality test to ensure a normal distribution and an equal variance test. Two group comparisons at a single time point (Evans Blue dye extravasation, immunohistochemistry, and probe trial data) was statistically tested using a Student's two-tailed\nt\n-test for unpaired variables. Two group comparisons across time (e.g., water maze learning, inflammation markers) were statistically evaluated using repeated-measures two-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs). Novel object recognition was evaluated within groups (e.g., novel vs. familiar) using a two-tailed Student's\nt\n-test for paired variables. All data were analyzed using raw recorded data, before transformation into percent control for presentation. Data were considered significant at\np\n<\u20090.05 and presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean."

Informed consent was obtained from all subjects, and the protocol was approved by the University of British Columbia Clinical Research Ethics Board, and adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki.\nFor both urodynamics and penile vibrostimulation, blood pressure was recorded every minute on the right arm using an automated sphygmomanometer (DinamapV100; GE Medical Systems, Fairfield, CT), using a fitted cuff. Three supine measurements were taken before the procedure and averaged to determine baseline supine blood pressure. Beat-by-beat blood pressure and CBF were measured as described previously.\n17\n,\n23\nUrodynamic assessments\nBefore urodynamics, a urinary dipstick test confirmed the absence of infection. Urodynamics occurred between 0800 and 1200\u2009h in a temperature-controlled room (21\u00b0C) according to established standards.\n24\nCystometry was performed by a double-lumen catheter (6 Fr, Laborie, Canada) with continuous filling of sterile water (37\u00b0C) at a fixed rate of 30\u2009mL/min. Abdominal pressure was measured with an intrarectal balloon catheter (10 Fr, Laborie, Canada). Pelvic floor electromyography (EMG) (Aquarius TT, Laborie Model 94-R03-BT, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) was recorded using surface EMG. Filling was stopped if any of the following conditions were observed: (1) reported sensation of fullness; (2) spontaneous urine leakage; (3) intravesical pressure \u226540\u2009cm H\n2\nO; (4) infused volume reached 500\u2009mL; or (5) sustained systolic blood pressure \u2265180\u2009mm Hg or intolerable AD symptoms (e.g., severe goose bumps, sweating, headache, perceived head pressure pulsations that were not present previously, etc.).\nPenile vibrostimulation for sperm retrieval\nPenile vibrostimulation was applied by a physician experienced in penile vibrostimulation using one or more handheld vibrators (Ferti Care, Multicept, Rungsted, Denmark) placed about the glans penis to induce ejaculation. An amplitude of 1.0\u20133.5\u2009mm with a frequency of 70\u2013100\u2009Hz was used. Vibration was performed for a maximum of 3\u2009min, followed by a pause of 1\u2009min before the cycle was repeated until ejaculation was achieved.\nClinical cardiovascular and cerebrovascular assessments\nThe following were sampled at 1000\u2009Hz using an analog-to-digital converter (Powerlab/16SP ML 795; ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO) interfaced with data acquisition software (LabChart8; ADInstruments): beat-by-beat blood pressure via finger photoplethysmography (Finometer PRO; Finapres Medicine Systems, Amsterdam, Netherlands), electrocardiogram (ML132; ADInstruments) on the left side, and blood velocity in the left middle cerebral artery (ST3 Transcranial Doppler, Spencer Technologies, Redmond, WA). The middle cerebral artery was insonated using a 2\u2009MHz probe mounted on the temporal bone and a fitted headstrap. The middle cerebral artery (MCA) was insonated at a depth of 45\u201355\u2009mm and confirmed using ipsilateral common carotid artery compression.\nThe autonomic dysreflexia was defined by a \u226520\u2009mm Hg in increase in systolic blood pressure and confirmed by a physician with expertise in this condition (AVK). Mean arterial blood pressure was calculated as ([2*diastolic blood pressure]+[systolic blood pressure])/3 while mean CBF velocity was calculated by ([2*minimum flow velocity]+[peak flow velocity]) /3. Together a scientist and clinician with expertise in autonomic dysreflexia identified at least three heart beats corresponding to maximum blood pressure (typically three beats) during AD were extracted to calculate the peak change in blood pressure and CBF.\n\nPre-clinical model\nEthical approval\nAll procedures were conducted in strict accordance with the Canadian Council for Animal Care. Ethics approval was granted by the University of British Columbia.\nExperimental protocol\nSurgery and animal care were conducted according to standard procedures in our laboratory to perform a complete spinal transection at the T3 spinal segment.\n25\nFour male rats (age\u2009=\u2009nine weeks, mass\u2009=\u2009250\u2013350\u2009g; Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) were used initially to develop the translational model of transient hypertension and ensuing cerebral hyperperfusion. Next, using this model, 50 male rats (identical age, strain, and supplier) were randomly assigned either (\nFig. 1d\n): SCI (T3-SCI;\nn\n=\u200925), or SCI with AD (T3-SCI+AD; n\u2009=\u200925). Two weeks after SCI, repetitive AD induced by colorectal distension (explained below) was initiated for four weeks in the T3-SCI+AD group, which is analogous to two years of human life.\n21\nSix weeks after SCI, both groups underwent MRI assessment and were then sacrificed for a range of vascular assessments spanning pressure myography, histology, and molecular biology. All outcome assessments and analysis were performed by blinded personnel.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nDeveloping a clinically relevant pre-clinical model of transient cerebral hyperperfusion secondary to autonomic dysreflexia.

(\nd\n) Timeline of experiments. Colorectal distention began 14 days post-SCI. Sample sizes: pressure myography (SCI\nn\n=\u200913, SCI and colorectal distension\nn\n=\u200915); immunohistochemistry (SCI\nn\n=\u20096, SCI and colorectal distension\nn\n=\u20095); quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (SCI\nn\n=\u20096, SCI and colorectal distension\nn\n=\u20096); magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (SCI\nn\n=\u20097, SCI and colorectal distension\nn\n=\u20095). Outcome measures took place after four weeks of colorectal distension and included pressure myography, MRI, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and qPCR. MA, middle cerebral artery.\nPre-clinical spinal cord transection\nAnimals received prophylactic enrofloxacin (Baytril; 10\u2009mg kg\n\u22121\n, subcutaneously [SC], Associated Veterinary Purchasing [AVP], Langley, Canada) for three days before the SCI surgical procedure. On the day of operation, enrofloxacin (10\u2009mg kg\n\u22121\n, SC), buprenorphine (Temgesic; 0.02\u2009mg kg\n\u22121\n, SC, McGill University), and ketoprofen (Anafen, 5\u2009mg kg\n\u22121\n, SC, AVP) were administered pre\u2010operatively. Rats were anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (70\u2009mg kg\n\u22121\n, intraperitoneally [IP]; Vetalar; AVP) and dexmedetomidine (0.25\u2009mg kg\n\u22121\n, IP; Domitor; AVP).\nA dorsal midline incision was made in the superficial muscle overlying the C8\u2013T3 vertebrae. The dura was opened at the T2\u2013T3 intervertebral gap, and the spinal cord was completely transected using microscissors. Complete transection was confirmed by two surgeons via visual separation of the rostral and caudal spinal cord stumps, and Gelfoam (Pharmacia & Upjohn Company, Pfizer, New York) was placed between the stumps to achieve hemostasis. The muscle and skin were closed with 4\u20130 Vicryl and 4\u20130 Prolene sutures, respectively.\nAnimals received warmed lactated Ringer solution (5\u2009mL, SC) and recovered in a temperature\u2010controlled environment (Animal Intensive Care Unit, Los Angeles, CA, USA), after being administered atipamezole (1mg kg\n\u22121\n, SC, AVP) for reversal of dexmedetomidine. Enrofloxacin (10\u2009mg\u2009kg\n\u22121\n, SC), buprenorphine (0.02\u2009mg\u2009 kg\u22121, SC) and ketoprofen (5\u2009mg\u2009kg\n\u22121\n, SC) were administered once a day for three days post-operatively. The bladder was expressed manually three to four times daily until spontaneous voiding returned (about 10 days post\u2010injury). All assessments and analyses were completed blinded of each condition/group using a secret animal coding system known only to the project lead. Five animals did not survive the SCI transection procedure. Male animals were used because they represent the majority of SCI.\n26\nUltrasound evaluation of middle cerebral artery blood flow with concurrent blood pressure during acute AD/transient hypertension induced by colorectal distension\nAfter being anesthetized with urethane (1.5\u20132.5\u2009g/kg), a calibrated blood pressure catheter (SPR-869, Millar), was implanted in the right femoral artery and was advanced into the right common iliac artery. Further, a 20\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009mm section of the crown of the skull was removed, with care to not pierce the dura. Blood pressure recordings were collected and recorded concurrent to the ultrasound recordings by being input through analog to the ultrasound device (Vevo 3100; Visual Sonics, Inc., a subsidiary of Sonosite, Bothell, WA).\nA balloon tip of a Swan-Ganz catheter (10\u2009mm in length) was inserted 2\u2009cm rectally, according to standard procedures to induce transient hypertension secondary to AD.\n27\nFor this, the balloon was infused with 1.0\u20132.0\u2009mL of air for 60\u2009sec. Three uninjured rats of the same age had transient hypertension induced by bolus injections of 0.05\u20130.2\u2009mL (50\u2009\u03bcg/mL) phenylephrine (because colorectal distension does not lead to transient hypertension in uninjured rats) through the tail vein, which was cannulated with a 26-gage butterfly needle.\nDuring scanning, the rat was fixed to a customized scanning platform (Visual Sonics), which was heated to maintain body temperature, while the ultrasound probe (MX250, 24\u2009MHz, Visual Sonics) was aligned to the frontal plane and moved rostrally and caudally; color Doppler was applied to aid in localization of the middle cerebral artery during B-mode imaging (inset\nFig. 1b\n) as described previously.\n17\nThe ultrasound frequency was 16\u2009MHz, while the pulsed repetition frequency was set to 4\u2009kHz. The Doppler sample volume was placed at a depth of 8\u201311\u2009mm, with Doppler angle set to less than 60 degrees. If we deviated from this for optimization, then these settings were kept consistent throughout the hyperemia. Baseline values and maximum increase in CBF were extracted, along with the corresponding blood pressures. Mean arterial pressure was calculated by\u2009=\u2009([2*diastolic blood pressure]+[systolic blood pressure])/3 while mean CBF velocity was calculated by\u2009=\u2009([2*minimum flow velocity]+[peak flow velocity])/3.\nRepetitive colorectal distension to induce AD\nAt 14 days post-SCI, the T3-SCI+AD group underwent six successive bouts of AD that we have demonstrated leads to transient hypertension, five days/week for four weeks, each of 10\u2009min duration. In short, the balloon tip catheter was inserted identically as described above\n;\nhowever, in this case inflation was maintained for 10\u2009min.\n27\nPressure myography\nSeven weeks after injury, T3-SCI and T3-SCI+AD rats were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane and euthanized by decapitation after exsanguinations for\nex vivo\npressure myography studies. The MCA function and structure were assessed by pressure myography (Living Systems, St. Albans, VT) as described previously.\n25\nBriefly, we analyzed MCA spontaneous myogenic tone generation and structural and mechanical properties.\nA 5\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm section of brain tissue containing the MCA was removed and placed in Ca\n2+\n-free physiological salt solution (PSS) at 4\u00b0C, with 1% bovine serum albumin. A branch-free segment of the MCA was mounted on two glass micropipettes in a pressure myograph (Danish Myo Technology, Aarhus, Denmark). The MCAs were equilibrated at 80\u2009mm Hg in PSS containing (in mmol) 141.9 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.12 KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 1.7 MgSO\n4\n\u00b77H\n2\nO, 2.8 CaCl\n2\n, 10 HEPES, 5 dextrose, and 0.5 EDTA (pH 7.4) until development of spontaneous myogenic tone, which was calculated using the following formula: %tone\u2009=\u2009(1 \u2212 [active lumen diameter/passive lumen diameter])\u2009\u00d7\u2009100. Passive structure was assessed in calcium-free PSS containing 2\u2009mmol/L EGTA, and intraluminal pressure was increased from 3 to 180\u2009mmHg in 20-mm Hg increments. The wall-to-lumen ratio and circumferential wall stress were calculated.\n25\nPassive distensibility was calculated as described previously.\n25\nThe elastic modulus (\u03b2-coefficient) was calculated from the stress/strain curves using an exponential model (y\u2009=\u2009ae\n\u03b2x\n), where \u03b2 is the slope of the curve and is directly correlated to vascular stiffness.\nReactivity of the MCA\nEndothelial function in the MCA was assessed by extraluminal perfusion of carbachol in a pressure myograph. A branch-free segment of the MCA was isolated and mounted between two glass cannulas in a pressure myograph chamber, which was then placed in an inverted microscope coupled to a camera. The MCA was then bathed in PSS, pressurized at 80\u2009mm Hg to generate spontaneous myogenic tone. Increasing concentrations of carbachol (10\n\u221210\nM to 10\n\u22125\nM) were then added to the bath. After thorough wash with calcium PSS, a single dose of 5-HT (Sigma: H9523) was added (10\n\u22125\nM) to the bath. Changes in MCA diameter were recorded using the MyoView software (Danish Myo Technology, Aarhus, Denmark).\nImmunohistochemical analyses\nBriefly, the MCAs sections were thoroughly washed in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and 0.01\u2009M PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBST), followed by a 1\u2009h incubation in 10% normal donkey serum in PBST. Sections were then incubated with the primary antibodies listed in\nTable 1\novernight at room temperature. Subsequently, sections were washed in PBST and incubated accordingly with Alexa\u2122-fluor 488 donkey [I_AAP1] anti-mouse (1:1000; Molecular Probes\n\u00a9\n) or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (1:1000; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1\u2009h. Finally, all the sections were washed, mounted with Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories Inc.) and observed in laser confocal AxioImager.Z2 Zeiss\n\u00a9\nLSM 800 microscope using identical exposure times, scanning speeds, gains, and pinhole values. The intensity of immunoreactivity of morphological assessment of MCAs was assessed using the Fiji Software (based on ImageJ,\nhttp://fiji.sc/Downloads#Fiji\n).\nTable\n1.\nList of Primary Antibodies Used for Morphological Assessment of Middle Cerebral Arteries\nPrimary antibody\nAntibody concentration\nReference\nRabbit \u03b1 Collagen I\n1:500\nAbcam, (ab34710); USA\nMouse \u03b1 Collagen III\n1:300\nAbcam, (ab6310); USA\nRabbit \u03b1 Elastin\n1:200\nMillipore, (AB2039); USA\nRabbit \u03b1 SMA\n1:400\nAbcam, (ab5694); USA\nOpen in a separate window\nSMA, smooth muscle actin.\nTyrosine hydroxylase (TH) analysis of MCAs whole mounts\nA small segment of the MCA vessel was used to determine TH expression (1:1000; anti-rabbit; Millipore; ref: AB152) by immunofluorescence. For this, the vessel was placed in a small Eppendorf tube and the immunoreaction proceeded as described above. Finally, the vessel was placed in a glass microscope slide, mounted with Prolong Gold\n\u00a9\nmounting medium (Molecular Probes\n\u00a9\n) and observed in the confocal microscope. The intensity of immunoreactivity of morphological assessment of MCAs was assessed using the Fiji Software (based on ImageJ). Staining intensity for each animal was determined from the middle third of the MCA.\nMorphological assessment of MCA\nA segment of the MCA from each animal of different experimental groups was embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) freezing medium. Transverse 10\u2009\u03bcm sections were cut on a cryostat microtome, collected in Superfrost Plus slides, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until further processing. The morphological assessment of MCAs was determined by immunofluorescence using the primary antibodies listed in\nTable 1\n.\nMolecular biology assessment of the MCA\nTotal RNA was extracted from the MCA using the ribonucleic acid (RNA) Micro Kit (Purelink; Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. For the MCA tissue, the Rotor-Stator Protocol was used, and the TRIzol\n\u00ae\nReagent Protocol was used for the aorta tissue. The concentration and purity of the extracted RNA were checked by measuring the optical densities at 260 and 280\u2009nm. Total RNA (2.5\u2009\u03bcg) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using Invitrogen\n\u2122\nSuperScript\n\u2122\nVILO\n\u2122\nmastermix (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA), and following the manufacturer's guidelines. Template cDNA was mixed with this mastermix, and the expression of genes involved in proinflammatory and profibrosis was studied using 96-well PCR array plates (MicroAMP\n\u00ae\nFast Optical 96-Well Reaction Plate with Barcode (0.1\u2009mL), 4346906, Applied Biosystems). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed on an Applied Biosystems ViiATM 7 Real-Time PCR System machine using the following PCR cycling conditions: 50\u00b0C for 2\u2009min, and 95\u00b0C for 10\u2009min, and 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15\u2009sec and 50\u00b0C for 1\u2009min. The gene expression fold change relative to the control was calculated using the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT method.\nCBF\nMRI was used to estimate CBF with the arterial spin labeling (ASL) technique. In brief, ASL tags the magnetization of inflowing blood by spin inversion, which modifies the overall signal of a downstream brain slice by an amount proportional to the amount of incoming labeled blood. The resultant CBF describes the amount of arterial blood delivered to the imaging slice within the transit time of the experiment. Experiments were performed on a pre-clinical 7 Tesla MRI scanner (Bruker Biospec 70/30 USR, Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany) using a quadrature volume transmit coil and four-channel receive phased-array. Body temperature was maintained by heated air and rectal temperature probe. The animal was maintained under 2% isoflurane anesthesia on a ventilator (Harvard Apparatus Inspira ASV) at 60\u201380 breaths per minute with expired CO\n2\nmeasured with a Physiosuite capnograph (Kent Scientific) and respiration rate measured by a pressure sensor on the chest.\nMultiple inversion recovery echo-planar imaging (EPI) scans were acquired to provide calibration data (tissue T1, inversion efficiency, and proton density) for ASL scans (recovery time\u2009=\u200910\u2009sec, echo time (TE)\u2009=\u200911.47\u2009ms, 22 inversion times between 30\u20138000\u2009ms spaced geometrically, field of view\u2009=\u200940\u2009\u00d7\u200940\u2009mm, matrix\u2009=\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200964, slice thickness\u2009=\u20092\u2009mm, nine slices, single shot). FAIR-EPI with a pre-saturation preparation was used to acquire the ASL data at three inversion times to allow correction for variable transit times (inversion times\u2009=\u2009600, 800, 1000\u2009ms, single-shot readout, TE\u2009=\u200910.5\u2009ms, recovery time after pre-saturation\u2009=\u20091.1\u2009sec, same geometry as calibration scans, GRAPPA factor\u2009=\u20092, partial-FT acceleration\u2009=\u20091.5, imaging time\u2009=\u200910\u2009min 6\u2009sec).\nStatistical analyses\nThe relationship between blood pressure and CBF in humans and rats was evaluated using the Pearson linear correlation. Spontaneous myogenic tone generation, 5-HT constriction, passive structure at 80\u2009mm Hg, and immunohistochemistry data were analyzed by the Student\nt\ntest or a nonparametric alternative. Concentration-response curves for carbachol were analyzed further by nonlinear regression (Hill equation) to calculate logEC\n50\nand logECmax. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). The difference between means was considered statistically significant when\np\n<\u20090.05. Data are shown as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean."

    "Methods": "Mild fluid percussion injury surgery\nExperimental procedures complied with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the University of Miami Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were maintained on a 12/12\u2009h light-dark cycle and had free access to food and water. Surgical and temperature controls were prospectively randomized and animals were assessed by individuals who were blinded to the experimental groups. Power analysis was conducted to determine the number of animals needed to detect a 10% difference in biochemical indicators of microglial and macrophage phenotype as well as RT-PCR results.\nTwenty-four hours prior to surgery adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (2\u20134 months old; Charles Rivers Laboratories, MA) were surgically prepared for mFPI as previously described.\n40\n,\n41\nBriefly, anesthesia was induced with 3% isoflurane, 70% nitrous oxide, and 30% oxygen, and animals were maintained via nose cone at 0.5\u20131% isoflurane, 70% nitrous oxide, and 30% oxygen. A 4.8-mm craniotomy (\u22123.8\u2009mm bregma, 2.5\u2009mm lateral) was prepared over the right parietal cortex and an 18-gauge syringe hub was secured to the craniotomy window with cyanoacrylic adhesive. After recovery for 24\u2009h during which time the animals were fasted and provided water\nad libitum\n, animals were re-anesthetized with 70% nitrous oxide, 1\u20133% isoflurane, and 30% oxygen; intubated; and mechanically ventilated (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL). A catheter was placed in the tail artery to monitor arterial blood pressure, and arterial blood samples were used to calculate blood gases (pO\n2\nand pCO\n2\n) and blood pH. Animals were stabilized and physiological parameters were monitored prior to temperature manipulation and post-TBI beginning at 20\u2009min then hourly for the surgery duration. After stabilization of physiological parameters, animals received mTBI (1.4\u20131.6 atm, or sham surgery). During the 4 h post-TBI monitoring period, the intubated animals' blood gas measurements were maintained at normal physiological levels by ventilator adjustments. Buprenorphine 0.03\u2009mg/kg was administered subcutaneously after injury.\nBeginning 15\u2009min prior to the brain injury, the brain and body temperature of the animal was elevated to a mildly hyperthermic level (39\u00b0C) or kept at a normothermic level (37\u00b0C) for 4\u2009h as previously described.\n40\nThis temperature protocol was used to mimic the clinical condition of increased ambient temperatures combined with high levels of physical activity leading to a restricted period of elevated brain temperature at and following the time of brain injury. This experimental protocol would therefore not necessarily replicate a clinical situation where an individual was acclimated or sustained longer periods of mild hyperthermia either prior to or following TBI.\n61\nRectal temperature was used to monitor core temperatures and a thermistor probe was placed into the temporalis muscle as an indirect measure of brain temperature. Two automatic feedback heating lamps were placed over the animal's head and body to regulate brain and core temperature. Animals were also maintained at normothermia or mild hyperthermia temperatures for 4\u2009h post-injury. Sham-operated animals received identical surgical and temperature manipulations as in mTBI animals but were not injured. Sham animals were maintained for 4\u2009h at normothermia or hyperthermia during the surgery. Na\u00efve animals underwent no surgical manipulation.\n\nFlow cytometry\nThe methods that were used for the phenotype analysis by flow cytometry have recently been described.\n60\nFlow cytometry was performed to differentiate surveillant microglia from activated microglia and macrophages. At 24\u2009h after TBI, animals were perfused with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and ipsilateral parietal cortex and hippocampus were dissected for analysis. This early time period was selected based on previous data indicating that the 24 hr period would be appropriate to assess early activation patterns.\n60\nSingle cell suspensions were made by passage through a 70-\u03bcm cell strainer (Falcon, Madison, WI), lysed with ammonium-chloride-potassium (ACK) buffer (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), and stained with live/dead reagent (Life Technologies). Following a non-specific block with CD16/CD32 antibody, cells were incubated with fluorescent antibodies for surface markers CD11b (v450, BD Horizon, San Jose, CA), which binds to neutrophils and myeloid cells but not lymphocytes (BD Horizon), and CD45 (Alexa 647, Biolegend, San Diego, CA) to separate microglia (CD11b+, CD45\nlow\n) and infiltrating leukocyte (CD11b+, CD45\nhigh\n) populations. CD45 is expressed on all hemotopoietic cells except erythrocytes and platelets (BioLegend). Cells were also incubated with RP1 (PE, BD Horizons) to identify granulocytes, but lymphocytes or monocytes do not express RP1 (BD Pharmingen).\nAfter fixing and permeabilization, cells were incubated with antibodies for iNOS (FITC, eBioscience, San Diego, CA) and arginase (PE, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) to separate those activated cells that display either the M1 (iNOS+) or M2 (Arg+) phenotype as analyzed on a flow cytometer (BD FACSDiva LSRII) using Kaluza\n\u00ae\nsoftware (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) for analysis. Cell populations were gated to include only live cells, and standard forward and side scatter gating were used in the analysis. Further, CD11b, CD45, iNOS, and arginase populations of cells were gated using the appropriate isotype controls to separate positively labeled cells from the negative population. All samples were also incubated with isotype controls for each antibody. Experimental groups analyzed for iNOS and arginase included na\u00efve, sham normothermic (37\u00b0C), sham hyperthermic (4\u2009h, 39\u00b0C), TBI normothermic, and TBI hyperthermic with a survival time of 24\u2009h.\n\nWestern blot\nWestern blot analysis was performed to assess the effect of mTBI with hyperthermia on the expression of ICAM-1 (intracellular adhesion molecule-1/CD54) and CD18 (integrin beta2). Specimens from the cerebral cortex were obtained and 15\u2009\u03bcg of total protein from normothermia- or hyperthermia-treated animals (\nn\n=\u20095/group) 24\u2009h after mTBI were loaded onto acrylamide gradient gels 4\u201315% (Bio-Rad) along with a protein ladder (Bio-Rad) and run for 1.5\u20132\u2009h at 90V. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes and blocked with standard block for 30\u2009min. Incubation with primary anti-rat ICAM-1 (R&D Systems #MAB141011, 1:400 dilution) and CD18 (Abcam #MEM-148, 1:400 dilution) were conducted at 4\u00b0C overnight followed by incubation with anti-rat mouse secondary (Cell Signaling #7076, 1:1000) horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked antibody. Detection was done using LumiGLO\n\u00ae\n(Cell Signaling) as per manufacturer's instructions. All blots were normalized to actin control at 1:10,000 (Sigma #A5441).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nAt 3 days post-TBI normothermic, hyperthermic, or sham surgery animals (\nn\n=\u20095 per group) were re-anesthetized and transcardially perfused with saline (80\u2009mL) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (4\u00b0C, 350\u2009mL). The brains were placed in 30% sucrose in PBS and sectioned (30\u2009\u03bcm) with a sliding microtome (Leica SM2000R) followed by cryoprotection. Serial sections spaced 400\u2009\u03bcm apart were immunostained with Iba1 (ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1, Waco) or \u03b2-APP (amyloid precursor protein, Millipore). After antigen retrieval in citrate buffer in a steamer for 20\u2009min, sections were incubated with primary antibody for Iba1 (1:100) or \u03b2-APP (1:100) in PBS with 4% normal goat serum overnight at 4\u00b0C. After washing in PBS + Tween, sections were incubated with secondary biotinylated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit (Waco) for 2\u2009h room temperature (RT) followed by ABC (avidin/biotin complex, Vectashield) for 1.5\u2009h RT. Sections were stained with DAB (3,3-diaminobenzidine-peroxidase (Sigma) and analyzed on an Olympus microscope (Olympus BX51) using Stereo Investigator\n\u00ae\nsoftware version 9.10.2 (MicroBrightfield, Inc.).\nFive bregma levels (\u22122.8 to \u22124.8) were analyzed. Iba1-positive microglia and \u03b2-APP profiles were also evaluated by an investigator blinded to the experimental groups to assess patterns of microglial activation including surveillant, reactive, and ameboid using an established classification strategy as well as DAI within the external capsule, respectively.\n62\n,\n63\nThe parietal cortex overlying the contusion area was contoured at 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009, and a counting grid of 800\u2009\u00d7\u2009800\u2009\u03bcm was placed over the contoured parietal cortex. Using a 120\u2009\u00d7\u2009120\u2009\u03bcm counting frame, Iba1-positive cells were counted in 30\u201340 randomly placed sampling sites with a 63\u2009\u00d7\u20091.4 numerical aperture objective. Similar procedures were used for the \u03b2-APP analysis within the external capsule.\n\nGene expression arrays\nRibonucleic acid (RNA; 0.5\u2009\u03bcg) from normothermia- or hyperthermia-treated mTBI cortical samples 24\u2009h after injury were pooled (\nn\n=\u20094\u20135), reverse transcribed, and analyzed using TaqMan (Applied Biosystems, #4414212) rat arrays, a 96-well platform that contains primers for inflammatory genes. Those genes that showed more than a 2-fold change in expression were used for further quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) studies.\n\nRT-PCR\nReal-time RT-PCR was performed on ipsilateral cortex and hippocampus from TBI normothermia and TBI hyperthermia (4\u2009h) animals. Contralateral cortex or hippocampus from normothermic animals were used as the control. Four hour and 24 h survival (\nn\n=\u20095/group) animal groups were assessed for several genes associated with M1 or M2 microglia/macrophage phenotypes, as well as genes associated with leukocyte/macrophage recruitment. Tissue was fresh frozen after decapitation and RNA was extracted using the Direct-zol\u2122 (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) kit. After quantification of RNA concentration, equal amounts (0.5\u2009\u03bcg) of RNA were reverse transcribed using the RT2 First Strand Kit (SABioscience, Frederick, MD), which includes a genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) removal step. Real-time qPCR was conducted using Sybr green dye and gene-specific primers (SA Biosciences) performed on the Applied Biosystems 7300 Real Time platform (Foster City, CA). Primers for markers of M1 phenotype included interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and M2 phenotype YM1. RT-PCR was done for ICAM-1 as well as the monocyte chemoattractant chemokine ligand 2 (Ccl2, formally known as monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, MCP1) as well. Ccl2 recruits monocytes, memory T cells, and dendritic cells to the sites of inflammation produced by either tissue injury or infection.\n64\nRT-PCR was also conducted on alpha-2 macroglobulin (A2M), a protease inhibitor and cytokine transporter. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used to normalize samples that were run in triplicate, and relative expression levels were analyzed using the 2\n-ddCt\nmethod.\n\nStatistical analysis\nFlow cytometry, western blot, immunohistochemistry, and RT-PCR data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc comparison. Data are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM)."

    "Methods": "Traumatic brain injury\nAll procedures were approved by the Washington University Animal Studies Committee (Protocol 2014003) and are consistent with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of animals. Animals were housed 5/cage and had free access to water and food with 12-h light/dark cycle. Forty C57BL/6J 5-week-old male mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) weighing 15\u201322.5\u2009g were used (\nFig. 1\n). Two mice were excluded because of excessive brain swelling after craniectomy. Fourteen mice underwent sham injury, and 24 mice underwent CCI as previously described.\n11\n,\n23\nBriefly, mice were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane at induction, followed by maintenance at 2% isoflurane for the duration of the procedure. Buprenorphine (50\u2009\u03bcg/kg subcutaneously s.c.) was administered before scalp incision. The head was shaved and head holders were used to stabilize the head within the stereotaxic frame (MyNeurolab, St. Louis, MO). Then, a single 5-mm craniectomy was performed by an electric drill on the left lateral side of the skull centered 2.7\u2009mm lateral from the midline and 3\u2009mm anterior to lambda. Animals were randomized to sham or injury after craniectomy using a computer-generated numbers randomization. For injured animals, the 3-mm electromagnetic impactor tip was then aligned with the craniectomy site at 1.2\u2009mm left of midline, 1.5\u2009mm anterior to the lambda suture. The impact was then delivered at 2\u2009mm depth (velocity 5\u2009m/s, dwell time 100\u2009ms). The head holders were released immediately after the injury. All animals then received a loose fitting plastic cap secured over the craniectomy with Vetbond (3M, St. Paul, MN). The skin was closed with interrupted sutures and treated with antibiotic ointment before removing the mouse from anesthesia and allowing recovery on a warming pad. Two mice died immediately post-CCI.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExperimental cohort design. All animals underwent craniectomy and were excluded from the study if brain swelling after the procedure was excessive. Animals were randomized to sham or CCI using a computer-generated numbers randomization. Twenty-four hours post-surgery, animals were randomized to 60\u2009min of normoxemia or hypoxemia. Behavioral assessments followed by histological analysis were performed at 6 months. CCI, controlled cortical impact.\n\nDelayed hypoxemia\nOne day after sham surgery or CCI, animals were randomized to normoxemia (room air) or hypoxemia (8% O\n2\n, 4% CO\n2\n) for 60\u2009min. A mixture of N\n2\n, O\n2\n, and CO\n2\nwas utilized to maintain normocarbic hypoxemia.\n11\nWe have previously demonstrated that these conditions produce normocarbic hypoxemia in awake mice 24\u2009h post-CCI or sham surgery.\n11\nDuring normoxemia or hypoxemia, animals were placed in fresh cages with littermates randomized to the same treatment arm. All animals were subjected to identical transport and handling regardless of group assignment. Animals randomized to hypoxemia were placed in a Coy Labs Hypoxia Chamber (6\u2032\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2032\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u2032; Coy Laboratory, Grass Lake, MI), fitted with airlock, oxygen sensor, carbon dioxide sensor, and gas controllers.\n\nBehavioral tests\nAnimals underwent behavioral testing 6 months after sham surgery or CCI. All tests were conducted by an experimenter blinded to group assignment. The order of tests was social interaction, Morris water maze, then tail suspension. All testing was performed during the first 4\u2009h of the light cycle.\n\nSocial interaction\nThe social interaction test was adapted and modified from previous reports.\n21\n,\n24\nAnimals were individually housed for at least 1\u2009h in the testing room for acclimation before testing. A 5-week-old male stimulus mouse was introduced for a 5-min observation period. A juvenile mouse was used to decrease the risk of aggressive behavior during the test period. Stimulus mice were used for no more than five social interaction sessions with a minimum time interval of 30\u2009min between each session. A blinded observer scored interaction initiated by the test mouse, excluding interaction initiated by the stimulus mouse. Behaviors scored as interaction include sniffing with the nose within 1\u2009cm of the stimulus mouse (including nose, body, and anogenital area), pawing and climbing on the stimulus mouse, and following within 2\u2009cm of the stimulus mouse.\n\nMorris water maze\nA platform 11\u2009cm in diameter and a pool 109\u2009cm in diameter in a testing room with set visual cues were used as previously described.\n23\nAnimals were tested in two cohorts of 20 to maximize accuracy and ensure consistent latency times between trials. Each animal underwent four trials per day for 3 days of visible platform training, in order to control for differences in swim speed and visual acuity. No trial lasted more than 60\u2009sec, and the animal was allowed to remain on the platform for 30\u2009sec after completing the trial. After 3 days of rest, each animal underwent four trials per day for 5 days of hidden platform training. The visual cues were reset before hidden platform training. The platform was moved to a different quadrant and hidden slightly below the waterline after the water had been made opaque using nontoxic white tempera paint. On the final day, the platform was removed from the pool after the completion of hidden platform trials, and a 30-sec probe trial was conducted.\n\nTail suspension\nThe tail suspension test was adapted from previous investigations.\n21\n,\n25\nEach animal was suspended with tape from a horizontal rod elevated 30\u2009cm above a clean cage for 6\u2009min. To prevent mice from climbing their tails, a cardstock paper cone was placed around the tail before suspension. The cones were 4.5\u2009cm in diameter and 5.5\u2009cm tall. A new cone was used for each mouse. A blinded observer recorded the total time each mouse was immobile during the 6-min testing period. Immobility included motionless time as well as passive swinging caused by momentum from movement.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nMice were killed under isoflurane anesthesia by transcardial perfusion with 0.3% heparin in phosphate-buffered saline. Whole brains were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48\u2009h, followed by equilibration in 30% sucrose for at least 48\u2009h before sectioning. Serial 50-\u03bcm-thick coronal slices were cut on a freezing microtome starting with the appearance of a complete corpus callosum and caudally to bregma \u22123.08\u2009mm. Sets of 12 sections spaced every 300\u2009\u03bcm were mounted on glass slides and used for immunohistochemical studies.\nStaining was performed on free-floating sections washed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) between applications of primary and secondary antibodies. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked by incubating the tissue in TBS +0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 10\u2009min. Normal goat serum (3%) in TBS with 0.25% Triton X (TBS-X) was used to block nonspecific staining for all antibodies. Slices were then incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with one of the following primary antibodies: polyclonal rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; Dako North America, Carpinteria, CA) at a concentration of 1:1000, polyclonal rabbit anti-neuronal nuclei (NeuN; EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) at a concentration of 1:4000, or polyclonal rabbit anti-ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1; Wako Chemicals USA, Richmond, VA) at a concentration of 1:1000. Biotinylated goat antirabbit secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in TBS-X were used at a 1:1000 concentration to detect bound primary antibodies. Colorization was achieved using the Vectastain ABC Elite Kit (Vector Laboratories) followed by the application of 3-3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).\n\nQuantification of immunohistochemistry\nExtent of tissue loss in the ipsilateral hemisphere for each animal was quantified using images of NeuN-stained slices acquired using Hamamatsu NanoZoomer 2.0-HT System (Hamamatsu Corporation, Middlesex, NJ). Tissue loss in the injured hemisphere was calculated as a percentage of the tissue volume in the contralateral hemisphere as described by others.\n26\nFor GFAP measurements, 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009images of the ipsilateral corpus callosum and external capsule were obtained using the NanoZoomer. Using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD), files were converted to 32-bit images, and positive signal on each image was selected using the Max Entropy auto thresholding method. Regions of interest (ROIs) began with the most anterior slice containing hippocampal dentate gyrus and ended with the most posterior section containing corpus callosum fibers that cross the midline, yielding three to four sections for analysis per animal. The midline served as the medial boundary for the ROI, and the lateral boundary was formed by drawing a horizontal line between the ventral hippocampus and dorsal thalamus in each section. Total area of ROIs and area of positive thresholding from each slice were calculated and summed to determine total percent area of positive GFAP staining.\nStereological analysis was performed using StereoInvestigator software (version 8.2; MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT). Assessments were made by an investigator blinded to group assignment. The optical fractionator function was used to quantify target markers per cubic millimeter of tissue. For quantification of hippocampal neuronal loss in the CA3 region, a grid size of 250\u2009\u00d7\u2009250\u2009\u03bcm, a counting frame of 40\u2009\u00d7\u200940\u2009\u03bcm, and a dissector height of 15\u2009\u03bcm with a guard zone of 5\u2009\u03bcm were used for all quantifications, resulting in 3% of the ROIs being randomly sampled. All ROIs were traced at 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification, and markers were counted at 60\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification.\nFor stereological quantification of Iba1-positive cells, the optical fractionator function was again used, with a grid size of 180\u2009\u00d7\u2009180\u2009\u03bcm and a counting frame of 80\u2009\u00d7\u200980\u2009\u03bcm. The ROI began with the most anterior slice containing hippocampal dentate gyrus and ended with the most posterior section containing corpus callosum fibers that cross midline, which yielded three to four sections for analysis per animal. The midline served as the medial boundary for the ROI, whereas the lateral boundary was formed by drawing a horizontal line between the ventral hippocampus and dorsal thalamus in each coronal section. Gunderson's coefficients of error were <0.1 for all stereological quantifications. All post-processing and automated quantification algorithms are freely available upon request.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data were analyzed using Statistica (version 12; Dell Inc., Tulsa, OK). Data results are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation. There was no evidence for significant deviations from normal distribution (\np\n>\u20090.05 by Shapiro-Wilk tests). Data were analyzed with two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures, where necessary, followed by Tukey's tests for multiple comparisons with a significance level of\np\n<\u20090.05. Effect size between CCI and CCI\u2009+\u2009H was calculated utilizing Cohen's\nd\n.\n27"

    "Methods": "Primary cortical neuron cultures and siRNA transfection\nPrimary cortical neurons were obtained from the cortex of gestational day 18 C57BL/6 mouse embryos (E18) according to published protocols.\n29\nDissected cells were plated on 6- or 24-well plates (five hemispheres/plate, \u223c2.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n5\ncells/plate) pre-coated with poly-D-lysine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and laminin (Sigma). The cells were maintained as a monolayer in 2\u2009mL Neurobasal media with B-27 serum-free culture supplement and L-glutamine (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher, NY) until time of experiments. Cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C, 5\u2009\u03bcM) was added on days 5\u20136\nin vitro\n(DIV) to halt proliferation of glial cells for a nearly pure neuronal population.\nSmall interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection was carried out according to the Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) user manual. The required amount of \u03b2-catenin siRNA (1\u2009\u03bcM; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) and Lipofectamine 2000 was diluted and mixed together in Opti-MEM I (Gibco, ThermoFisher, NY) for 10\u2009min to allow for liposome formation. Cortical neurons (DIV 10\u201311) were then incubated with liposomes for 40\u2009h. A control group was incubated with liposomes containing non-targeting siRNA (NT-siRNA, Invitrogen). After transfection, cells were washed with complete neuronal media, followed by exposure to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD).\n\nOxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and cell death assessment\nOGD, an\nin vitro\nmodel well-established to induce autophagy, was performed in DIV 12\u201313 cortical cultures.\n30\n,\n31\nIn the OGD groups, media was exchanged for a physiological buffer solution lacking glucose (120\u2009mM NaCl, 25\u2009mM Tris-HCl, 5.4\u2009mM KCl, 1.8\u2009mM CaCl\n2\n, pH to 7.4 with NaOH). Cells were then incubated in a calibrated hypoxia chamber perfused with 5% CO\n2\nand balanced nitrogen for a final ambient oxygen level of 0.2% for 3.5\u2009h. Oxygen level was established, maintained, and monitored by the ProOx 360 sensor (Biospherix, NY). After 3.5\u2009h, cells were returned to the normal oxygen condition (20% O2), and the existing OGD media was diluted by half with oxygenated complete neuronal culture media. During OGD, cortical neurons were incubated with either recombinant Wnt3a (100\u2009ng/mL, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), or Wnt3a plus XAV-939 (10\u2009\u03bcM, Sigma). After 40\u2009h, release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the medium was detected using an LDH-based cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche, Nutley, NJ), according to the user manual. Briefly, 50\u2009\u03bcL medium and 50\u2009\u03bcL mixture of reagent A and B were co-incubated for 30\u2009min and then absorbance (492\u2009nm) was detected using a spectrophotometer (Sunrise Instruments, LLC, Hebron, NH). Full kill neuronal cultures were treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 to generate the upper limit for normalization (normalized to be 100% absorbance).\n\nControlled cortical impact (CCI) TBI model of the mouse\nCCI was induced in mice as previously described.\n32\nC57BL/6 mice (8\u201312 week old, 160 total) were housed in standard cages with a 12-h light/dark cycle and had access to food and water\nad libitum\n. The animal protocol was approved by the Emory University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), in compliance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines. For TBI surgery, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (3% induction, 1.5% maintenance) and placed on a stereotaxic frame. After a midline skin incision, a 3.5-mm circular craniotomy was performed midway between the lambda and bregma, 2.0\u2009mm to the right of the central suture using an electric microdrill (Dremel, Mount Prospect, IL). During the craniotomy, mice were excluded from the study if the dura mater was breached. CCI was induced with an electric impact device using a steel cylindrical flat impact tip. In this study, we used a PCI3000 precision cortical impactor (Hatteras Instruments, Cary, NC) and a 2.8-mm diameter impact tip (velocity\u2009=\u20093.0\u2009m/sec, depth\u2009=\u20090.5\u2009mm, and contact duration\u2009=\u2009150\u2009msec). Body temperature was maintained during surgery by a feedback-controlled homeothermic blanket (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). After the injury, the skin was sealed using Vetbond (3M, St. Paul, MN), and mice were allowed to recover in a humidity- and temperature-controlled incubator (Thermocare, Incline Village, NV). Sham animals received the craniotomy, but no impact was applied.\n\nIntranasal drug administration\nIntranasal administration is a well-established non-invasive route for drug administration to the brain and allows for permeation of proteins and even cells across the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB).\n26\u201328\nRecombinant Wnt3a protein (R&D Systems) was reconstituted at 10\u2009ng/\u03bcL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Prior to the injection, the solution was diluted to 2\u2009ng/\u03bcL with 0.9% saline. All injections were delivered intranasally. Starting at 1\u2009h following the injury, injections were administered daily for 7 days. For each injection, the mouse was scruffed by the ears and inverted to expose the nostrils. A 25\u2009\u03bcL Hamilton syringe was used to administer 5\u2009\u03bcL of either Wnt3a (2\u2009ng/\u03bcL) or 0.9% saline into alternating nostrils, starting with the left, and repeating for 5 injections, for a total of 25\u2009\u03bcL injections/day (total of 50\u2009ng Wnt3a injected/day).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nImmunohistochemistry procedures were carried out to measure proliferation as previously described.\n32\nMice were euthanized by CO\n2\n(3\u2009L/min) and sacrificed by decapitation. Brains were removed and frozen using Tissue-Tek optimal cutting temperature compound (VWR International, Radnor, PA) and kept overnight in a \u221280\u00b0C freezer. Brain tissue was then sliced into 10\u2009\u03bcm-thick coronal sections using a cryostat vibratome (Leica CM 1950; Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). Sections were dried on a slide warmer for 30\u2009min, fixed with 10% formalin buffer, and followed by a methanol fix for 15\u2009min. The sections were then denatured using 2\u2009N hydrochloric acid in 37\u00b0C, and washed with 0.1-M borate buffer (11:9 ratio of 0.2\u2009M boric acid and 0.05\u2009M Borax) and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X 100 solution for 5\u2009min. All slides were washed 3 times with PBS (5\u2009min each) after each step. Tissue sections were blocked with 1% fish gelatin (Sigma) in PBS for 1\u2009h at room temperature, then incubated with the primary antibody against Beclin-1 (1:200, BD, East Rutherford, NJ), LC3-II (1:200, Cell Signaling), BrdU (1:400; ABD Serotec, Raleigh, NC), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1; 1:200; Millipore, Billerica, MA), and/or neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN, 1:300; Millipore) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The next day, the slides were washed 3 times with PBS for 5\u2009min, then reacted with the secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor\u00ae488 goat anti-mouse (1:300; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rat (1:300; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) or Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (1:400; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 90\u2009min at room temperature. After 3 washes with PBS, nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (1:20,000; Molecular Probes) for 5\u2009min as a counterstain, then mounted with Vectashield fluorescent mounting medium (Vector Laboratory, Burlingame, CA), and coverslipped for microscopy and image analysis.\n\nTerminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining\nA TUNEL assay kit was used to examine cell death by detecting fragmented DNA in 10-\u03bcM-thick coronal fresh frozen sections as described previously.\n33\nAfter fixation (10% buffered formalin for 10\u2009min and then ethanol:acetic acid (2:1) solution for 5\u2009min) and permeabilization (0.2% Triton X-100 solution), brain sections were incubated in the equilibration buffer for 10\u2009min. Recombinant terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (rTdT) and nucleotide mixture were then added on the slide at 37\u00b0C for 60\u2009min in the dark. Reactions were terminated by 2X SSC solution for 15\u2009min. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (1:20,000; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 5\u2009min.\n\nNissl staining and contusion volume quantification\nContusion volume was quantified using volumetric Nissl staining analysis as previously described.\n32\nThe brains were collected at 2 days post-injury, and 10-\u03bcm-thick coronal sections were taken using the cryostat vibratome, with 200-\u03bcm separation between each section. The sections were then treated with a 1:1 mixture of 10% formalin and acetic acid, followed by staining with the working solution comprised of a buffer solution (94:6 ratio of sodium acetate and acetic acid) and cresyl violet at a ratio of 5:1. Sections were scanned and imported into ImageJ for area and total volume quantification. For each section, the contusion area was demarcated and normalized using an imported image of a standard ruler. Volumetric analysis was carried out using the Cavalieri method:\nwhere\nis the average contusion area for each animal, t is the section thickness (200\u2009\u03bcm), and k is the number of sections.\n34\nTo account for edema and hemorrhage, hemispheric tissue loss was calculated by the following equation:\n\nWestern blot analysis\nWestern blot analysis was used to detect the activation of the canonical Wnt pathway, as well as for factors involved in apoptosis, BBB disruption, and neurovascular regeneration. Western blot was carried out using the protocols as outlined previously.\n33\nAnimals were sacrificed at day 2 or day 14 after TBI. The peri-injury cortical tissue was isolated and lysed in a buffer containing 0.02\u2009M Na\n4\nP2O7, 10\u2009mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100\u2009mM NaCl, 1\u2009mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 1% Triton, 1\u2009mM EGTA, 2\u2009mM Na3VO\n4\n, and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 15,000\ng\nfor 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. Protein concentration was determined with a bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). Equivalent amounts of total protein were separated by molecular weight on an SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel, and then transferred to a PVDF membrane. The blot was incubated in 5% BSA for 1\u2009h and then treated with primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight.\nThe primary antibodies used and the dilutions for each were rat anti-Wnt3a antibody (R&D Systems) at 1:400, mouse anti-\u03b2-catenin antibody (R&D Systems) at 1:1000, rabbit anti-cleaved caspase 3 antibody (Cell Signaling) at 1:400, rabbit anti-Bcl-2 (Cell Signaling) at 1:1000, rabbit anti-matrix metalloproteinases 9 (MMP-9) antibody (Millipore) at 1:2500, rabbit anti-MMP-2 antibody (Millipore) at 1:2500, rabbit anti-glial-derived growth factor (GDNF) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:1000, and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody (Sigma) at 1:5000. After washing with TBST, membranes were incubated with AP-conjugated or HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) for 2\u2009h at room temperature. After final washing with TBST, the signals were detected with bromochloroidolyl-phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium (BCIP/NBP) solution (Sigma) or film. Signal intensity was measured by ImageJ (NIH) and normalized to the actin signal intensity.\n\nAdhesive removal test for sensorimotor functions\nThe adhesive removal test is a sensitive assay for sensorimotor deficits\n32\n,\n35\nPrior to the injury, mice were trained to remove a quarter-circle adhesive tape (Genesee Scientific, San Diego, CA) from alternating forelimb paws. The training was repeated 3 times for each paw for 3 days. Two latencies were recorded: 1) latency to contact, which indicated the time the mouse took to recognize and demonstrate the conviction to remove the adhesive, and 2) latency to removal. The maximum recording latency was 180\u2009sec. Mice that were unable to rapidly remove the adhesive (<10\u2009sec) after the training period were excluded from behavior testing. Following the injury, the adhesive removal task was performed at 3, 7, 10, and 14 days post-injury. The latencies were scored with the experimenter blinded to the treatment conditions. Animals were randomly assigned to each group prior to the injury, with an\nn\n=\u20095 for the sham group,\nn\n=\u20098 for the TBI + saline group, and\nn\n=\u20098 for the TBI + Wnt3a group.\n\nRotarod test for locomotor function\nThe rotarod test is sensitive for deficits in gross motor skills and motor coordination.\n36\nMice are placed onto a spinning cylindrical beam (Ugo Basile, Italy) that accelerated from 4\u2009rpm to 40\u2009rpm over the course of 5\u2009min. Prior to the injury, mice were trained on the rotarod, and animals that were unable to remain on the beam for 5\u2009min after the training period were excluded from future testing. Following the injury, the rotarod test was performed at 1, 2, 3, 7, and 10 days post-injury. Animals were randomly assigned to a group prior to the injury, with\nn\n=\u20096 for sham,\nn\n=\u200912 for TBI + saline, and\nn\n=\u200911 for TBI + Wnt3a.\n\nStatistical analysis\nGraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) was used for statistical analysis and graphic presentation. Student's two-tailed\nt\ntest was used for comparison of two experimental groups. For multiple comparisons, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used, followed by Bonferroni's correction. For repeated measurements, two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's correction was used. Significance was defined to be a\np\nvalue \u22640.05.

    "Methods": "Study design and setting\nThis was a county-wide, prospective study at five EMS agencies and 11 hospitals in Northern California. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained at all study sites.\nThe study was conducted primarily in Sacramento County, which encompasses 994 square miles and has a resident population of 1,418,788 of which 158,551 (11%) are 65 years and older (2010 census). Sacramento County is served by 5 EMS agencies that respond to 95% of the 9-1-1 call responses for the county. Over 2700 emergency personnel are certified or accredited by the Sacramento County EMS Agency, including approximately 250 mobile intensive care nurses, 1050 paramedics and 1,400 emergency medical technicians. These five EMS agencies transport patients to 11 general acute care hospitals that have a cumulative capacity of approximately 240 ED beds and 3400 inpatient beds. Nine hospitals are located within Sacramento County and two are located in the adjacent Placer County. We included these two out-of-county acute care hospitals because Sacramento County EMS agencies routinely transport patients to these two hospitals and do so under the guidance of the Sacramento County Trauma Triage Tool (\nSupplementary Fig. 1\n; see online supplementary material at http:www.liebertpub.com) that was adapted from the most recent field triage guidelines (2011).\n3\nOf these 11 hospitals, one is a Level 1 adult trauma center, three are designated as Level 2 adult trauma centers, and seven are non-trauma centers. We did not direct clinical management at any of the participating EMS agencies or hospitals.\n\nStudy participants\nWe included patients 55 years and older with head trauma who were transported to a hospital by the participating EMS agencies from August 1, 2015 to September 30, 2016. Age 55 years and older was chosen as our study population based on the current field triage definition of older adults.\n3\nWe excluded patients transferred by EMS from another receiving facility (interfacility transport), patients transported to a non-participating hospital, and patients with penetrating head trauma. We also excluded patients for whom we were unable to link hospital data to EMS data.\n\nMeasurements\nEMS providers completed an electronic or paper standardized data collection form that included questions on anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet use, initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, and indication for transport to Level 1 or 2 trauma center. Anticoagulant use included warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. Antiplatelet use included aspirin, clopidogrel, ticlodipine, prasugrel, dipyridamole, cilostazol, and tigagrelor. We designed and modified the data collection form using input from EMS providers, EMS health information managers, emergency medicine physicians, and trauma surgeons. The data collection form was pilot tested with EMS providers and modified prior to the start of the study. EMS providers at all agencies were provided web-based training modules on the objectives of the study and instructions for data collection form completion prior to the start of the study and periodically during the enrollment period.\nEMS records were linked to hospital records using name, date of birth, and date of EMS transport. Trained research coordinators abstracted additional data variables from EMS and hospital electronic medical records. EMS variables included mechanism of injury, history of vomiting, headache, loss of consciousness, amnesia, or seizure after head injury, reported dementia, reported intoxication, vital signs during transport (pulse rate, systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate), GCS score, evidence of trauma above the clavicles, transport characteristics (date of transport, EMS agency, level of transport, level of EMS provider, receiving hospital), and the presence of physiological, anatomical, and mechanism of injury field triage criteria (based on the documentation of the presence or absence of explicit criteria).\n3\nED and hospital variables included patient demographics, pre-injury anticoagulant or antiplatelet use, serum laboratory results (platelet count, international normalized ratio [INR]), cranial CT results, ED and hospital interventions, Abbreviated Injury Score and Injury Severity Score for hospitalized patients, and ED and hospital disposition. Isolated head injury was defined as an Abbreviated Injury Score <3 in all non-head body regions.\n21\nCranial CT imaging and hospital admission were conducted at the discretion of the patients' treating physicians.\nA formal coding manual that defined all variables was developed. Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at the University of California Davis.\n22\nREDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web-based application designed to support data capture for research studies. Electronic data collection forms were pilot tested prior to data abstraction.\nWe conducted an enrollment audit on patients who were eligible but not enrolled (failures of the study screening process) during EMS evaluation to assess for enrollment bias. EMS data including age, gender, initial EMS GCS score, and anticoagulant or antiplatelet use were collected on the missed eligible patients.\n\nOutcomes\nOur primary outcome measure was the presence of tICH on initial cranial CT imaging in the ED based on radiologist interpretation. Our secondary outcome measure was a composite outcome measure of neurosurgery or death due to trauma during hospitalization. Neurosurgery included craniotomy, craniectomy, or placement of an intracranial pressure monitor. This secondary outcome measure was adapted based on prior consensus-based recommendations for trauma center need.\n23\n\nStatistical analysis\nWe formatted the data and recoded the variables using STATA 13.1 statistical software (STATA Corp., College Station, TX). Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study population. Non-normal interval data were reported with medians and quartiles 1 (Q1) and 3 (Q3). We compared the incidence of primary and secondary outcome measures in patients with and without anticoagulant or antiplatelet use. We also compared the incidence of outcome measures across specific anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication groups including: warfarin alone, direct oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, oredoxaban) alone, aspirin alone, other antiplatelet medications (clopidogrel, ticlodipine, prasugrel, dipyridimole, cilostazol, or tigagrelor), concomitant anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications (more than one anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication), and no anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication.\nTen independent predictor variables (age 80 years or older [ideal cutpoint based on receiver operating curve], male sex, an abnormal initial EMS GCS score [GCS score <15], a mechanism of injury other than a fall from standing height or less, a history of loss of consciousness or amnesia, anticoagulant or antiplatelet use, evidence of trauma above the clavicles, a history of vomiting, a history of headache, and the presence of physiological, anatomical, or mechanism of injury trauma triage criteria [Step 1 to 3 criteria,\nFig. 1\n]) were defined\na priori\nand entered into a random-effects multivariate logistic regression model to account for random variation. Significance was defined as a\np\nvalue <0.05 and the results of the multi-variate logistic regression model were presented as adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). To identify the ideal cutpoint for age, we explored various age cutpoints using a receiver operating curve for non-parametric data and chose the cutpoint that maximized sensitivity and specificity (Youden Index).\n24\nWe used complete-case analysis to handle missing data due to the infrequency of missing data (<1%)\n25\nand model fit was evaluated using the c-statistic.\n26\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nGuidelines for field triage of injured patients\u2014United States, 2011. *The upper limit of respiratory rate in infants is >29 breaths per min to maintain a higher level of overtriage for infants.\n\u2020\nTrauma centers are designated Level 1\u20134. A Level 1 center has the greatest amount of resources and personnel for care of the injured patient and provides regional leadership in education, research, and prevention programs. A Level 2 facility offers similar resources to a Level 1 facility, possibly differing only in continuous availability of certain subspecialties or sufficient prevention, education, and research activities for Level 1 designation; Level 2 facilities are not required to be resident or fellow education centers. A Level 3 center is capable of assessment, resuscitation, and emergency surgery, with severely injured patients being transferred to a Level 1 or 2 facility. A Level 4 trauma center is capable of providing 24-h physician coverage, resuscitation, and stabilization to injured patients before transfer to a facility that provides a higher level of trauma care.\n\u00a7\nAny injury noted in Step Two or mechanism identified in Step Three triggers a \u201cyes\u201d response.\n\u00b6\nAge <15 years. **Intrusion refers to interior compartment intrusion, as opposed to deformation, which refers to exterior damage.\n\u2020\u2020\nIncludes pedestrians or bicyclists thrown or run over by a motor vehicle or those with estimated impact >20\u2009mph with a motor vehicle.\n\u00a7\u00a7\nLocal or regional protocols should be used to determine the most appropriate level of trauma center within the defined trauma system; need not be the highest-level trauma center.\n\u00b6\u00b6\nAge >55 years. ***Patients with both burns and concomitant trauma for whom the burn injury poses the greatest risk for morbidity and mortality should be transferred to a burn center. If the non-burn trauma presents a greater immediate risk, the patient may be stabilized in a trauma center and then transferred to a burn center.\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\nPatients who do not meet any of the triage criteria in Steps One through Four should be transported to the most appropriate medical facility as outlined in local EMS protocols.\nWe used binary recursive partitioning to derive a set of triage criteria using Classification and Regression Trees (CART) software (Salford Systems, San Diego, CA).\n27\nWe forced Steps 1 to 3 criteria to be the initial node and used the Ginni splitting function to set the misclassification cost for missing a patient with a tICH at 20:1. This represents the cost of misclassifying 20 patients who did not have a tICH for one patient who did have a tICH.\nWe evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of different sets of triage criteria including: (a) Steps 1 to 3 criteria only, (b) Steps 1 to 3 criteria\nand\nanticoagulant or antiplatelet use, (c) actual transport to a trauma center, (d) actual transport\nand\nanticoagulant or antiplatelet use, (e) Steps 1 to 3 criteria\nand\nmulti-variate logistic regression risk factors, and (f) Steps 1 to 3 criteria\nand\nbinary recursive partitioning risk factors to identify tICH and the composite outcome measure of in-hospital neurosurgery or death to trauma. Triage criteria (e) and (f) included variables that were significant in the multi-variate logistic regression and binary recursive partitioning analyses respectively.\nTo evaluate for the possibility that medications were not accurately ascertained or that patients were not compliant with their medications, we conducted a sensitivity analysis evaluating warfarin use\nand\nan INR level 2.0 or higher as a risk factor in the adjusted analysis. We also compared the baseline characteristics of patients with and without anticoagulant or antiplatelet use to evaluate for differences between the two groups. Based on prior data that evaluated a similar patient population, we estimated that collecting 12 months of data would generate a sufficiently large sample of patients with anticoagulant or antiplatelet use to ensure adequate precision of analyses.\n28"

    "Methods": "Subject recruitment\nA total of 43 pediatric subjects including 23 TD subjects between 6 and 17 years of age (11.94\u2009\u00b1\u20093.26 [mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation {SD}]; 13 females and 10 males) with no evidence of spinal cord pathology and 20 subjects with chronic SCI (10 subjects with cervical injury and 10 with thoracic injury) between 7 and 16 years of age (11.28\u2009\u00b1\u20093.00 [mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD]; 9 females and 11 males) were recruited. Subjects and parents provided written assent and consent of the institutional review board approved protocol. The inclusion criteria used for subjects with SCI were: Subjects had stable SCI as evidenced by no neurological change in the past 3 months and were at least 6 months post-SCI. A range of the time after initial SCI is 1.4\u201317.0 years (7.33\u2009\u00b1\u20094.30). All subjects underwent a complete ISNCSCI examination on the same day as the MRI scan.\n3\nSeverity of injury was determined according the AIS.\n3\nOf the subjects with SCI, there were 8 patients classified as AIS A (complete SCI), 2 with AIS B (sensory incomplete), and 6 with AIS D (sensory and motor incomplete). Unfortunately, 4 patients were unable to complete the ISNCSCI and therefore did not receive an AIS category because of age, low motivation, autonomic dysfunction, or lack of understanding of the instructions.\nTable 1\ndetails the age at the time of study, age at the time of injury, time after initial SCI, and level and severity of injury for the SCI subjects.\nTable\n1.\nDemographic and Clinical Characteristics of the SCI Patients\nSubject\nAge at the time of study\nAge at the time of injury\nTime after initial SCI\nLevel of injury-based ISNCSCI\nSeverity of injury-based AIS\nSCI1\n9.25\n1.75\n7.50\nC6\nB\nSCI2\n15.18\n12.33\n2.85\nT10\nB\nSCI3\n10.01\n4.00\n6.01\nC5\nD\nSCI4\n11.14\n4.75\n6.39\nC6\nA\nSCI5\n15.16\n12.00\n3.16\nL2\nUnable to determine\nSCI6\n11.07\n1.50\n9.57\nT4\nA\nSCI7\n9.44\n8.25\n1.19\nT9\nA\nSCI8\n8.08\n3.67\n4.41\nC1\nD\nSCI9\n13.74\n0.50\n13.24\nC5\nD\nSCI10\n8.10\n2.08\n6.02\nC8\nA\nSCI11\n15.74\n12.00\n3.74\nT9\nA\nSCI12\n12.40\n1.42\n10.98\nC1\nD\nSCI13\n12.63\n1.58\n11.05\nUnable to determine\n(thoracic SCI)\nUnable to determine\nSCI14\n12.71\n8.42\n4.29\nT12\nA\nSCI15\n8.05\n3.42\n4.63\nUnable to determine\n(thoracic SCI)\nA\nSCI16\n8.68\n0.67\n8.01\nUnable to determine\n(cervical SCI)\nUnable to determine\nSCI17\n15.00\n13.85\n1.42\nC8\nA\nSCI18\n7.04\n1.33\n5.71\nL2\nD\nSCI19\n7.17\n0 (at birth)\n7.17\nUnable to determine\n(thoracic SCI)\nUnable to determine\nSCI20\n14.91\n13.08\n1.83\nT4\nD\nOpen in a separate window\nSCI, spinal cord injury; ISNCSCI, International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury; AIS, American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale.\n\nImage acquisition\nThe MRI scans were performed using a 3.0 Tesla Siemens Verio MR scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) with four-channel neck matrix and eight-channel spine array. 2D RF reduced FOV diffusion tensor images were collected axially in the same anatomical location prescribed for the T2-weighted images to cover the entire spinal cord using two overlapping slabs (\nFig. 1\n). Reduced FOV DTI scan parameters were: number of directions\u2009=\u200920; b\u2009=\u2009800\u2009s/mm\n2\n; voxel size\u2009=\u20090.8\u2009\u00d7\u20090.8\u2009\u00d7\u20096.0\u2009mm\n3\n; matrix size\u2009=\u200936\u2009\u00d7\u2009208; axial slices\u2009=\u200940; repetition time TR\u2009=\u20097900\u2009ms; echo time TE\u2009=\u200911 0ms; number of averages\u2009=\u20093; and acquisition time\u2009=\u200916.98\u2009min (to collect both slabs). Cardiac gating and respiratory compensation were not used in this study because this would increase acquisition time, which is not desirable in pediatric imaging. Also, anesthesia was not administrated to the subjects in this study.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nCross-sectional image of the spinal cord acquired from the MRI scanner; T2 W-GRE image (left) and FA map reconstructed from raw DTI dataset (right).

Unfortunately, in pediatric imaging, these techniques increase scanning time, which may result in a lack of patience and cooperation by patients.\n17\n,\n27\u201329\nAlthough the implementation of the 2D RF diffusion sequence helped to mitigate image contamination attributed to these effects, motion correction was performed to further enhance tensor estimation accuracy.\n17\nDiffusion-weighted images were aligned with the average reference image (b0) using a rigid body registration algorithm and a normalized mutual information cost function using an in-house software developed in Matlab (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA).\n17\n,\n28\u201330\n\nDiffusion tensor estimation\nAfter data acquisition and preprocessing, a robust estimation of tensor by outlier rejection (RESTORE) technique was applied to generate DTI maps, including fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). This method uses iteratively reweighted least-squares regression to identify potential outliers and subsequently exclude them. The final fit is performed with the remaining data points using the constant weights that appropriately describe the errors introduced by Gaussian distributed noise. This method eliminates the need for identifying corrupted images manually and automatically detects spatially localized outliers that would be easily missed by visual inspection.\n31\n\nGeneration of fiber tracts (tractography)\nFiber tracts were assigned for each seed (voxel) belonging to the WM of every slice to generate whole spinal cord tracts. A specific threshold was set to include WM and exclude CSF and GM (\nFig. 2\n). These tracts were then restricted to the user defined regions of interest (ROIs) placed at each intervertebral disk level and at the mid-vertebral body level of the cervical and thoracic spinal cord (approximately 40 ROIs).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nSagittal reconstruction of FA color maps of 2 overlapping slabs (\nA\nand\nC\n).

It is known that GM and CSF have lower FA values than WM.\n29\nTo construct only WM tracts, FA thresholds were set for both TD and SCI cases at 40\u201350% of the average FA value.\n29\nThe streamline-based deterministic method traces pathways from a seed (voxel) by following the primary eigenvector from one voxel to the next by knowing the propagation direction, length, and step of each propagation. A tract is terminated when it reaches a voxel with FA values lower than a predefined threshold followed by estimation of the turning angle of the fiber orientation predefined by an angular threshold (e.g., 70 degrees).\n29\n\nManual region of interest definition\nTo measure DTI and DTT at each intervertebral disk level and at the mid-vertebral body level of the cervical and thoracic spinal cord, ROIs were drawn manually on each FA map. These ROIs included both the GM and WM of the spinal cord and excluded the border, or edge, of the cord (approximately 1\u20132 voxels from outer margin of the cord) to avoid the effects of partial volume artifacts that occur at the cord/CSF interface (\nFig. 3\n). This procedure was followed throughout at each intervertebral disk level and at the mid-vertebral body level of the cervical and thoracic spinal cord, being anatomically localized by an independent board-certified neuroradiologist, in all subjects. These levels are: C1, mid-dens, base dens, mid-C2, C2\u2013C3, mid-C3 (upper cervical cord); C3\u2013C4, mid-C4, C4\u2013C5, mid-C5 (middle cervical cord); C5\u2013C6, mid-C6, C6\u2013C7, mid-C7, C7\u2013T1 (lower cervical cord); mid-T1, T1\u2013T2, mid-T2, T2\u2013T3, mid-T3, T3\u2013T4, mid-T4, T4\u2013T5 (upper thoracic cord); mid-T5, T5\u2013T6, mid-T6, T6\u2013T7, mid-T7, T7\u2013T8, mid-T8, T8\u2013T9 (middle thoracic cord); mid-T9, T9\u2013T10, mid-T10, T10\u2013T11, mid-T11, T11\u2013T12, mid-T12, T12\u2013L1, mid-L1 (lower thoracic cord).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nIllustration of placement of ROIs on FA map after being anatomically localized by level by a board certified neuroradiologist.

Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\n\nStatistical anlysis\nUpon definition of whole-cord ROIs, statistical analysis was performed between subjects with SCI and TD control groups. A comprehensive data table was created containing information of DTI and DTT measures (\nTables 2\u20134\n). Mean and SD of each measure for every subject along the entire spinal cord were calculated. These measures then were compared between TD and SCI subjects based on standard least squared linear regression model and restricted maximum likelihood method (JMP Pro 13.0 software). This model was constructed looking at group differences by assuming ROI level and groups (controls/patients) composition as the fixed effects and subjects as the random effects. The same statistical analysis was also performed when investigating diffusion changes above (for thoracic injuries) and below (for cervical injuries) between TD and SCI subjects.\nTable\n2.\nAveraged DTI and DTT Quantitative Measures of the Whole Cord of Controls and Patients with SCI Along Entire Spinal Cord (Cervical and Thoracic)\nFeatures\nTD\nMean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD\nSCI\nMean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD\nProb>|t|\nFA\n0.46\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11\n0.37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09\n<0.0001\nMD (10\n\u20133\nmm\n2\n/s)\n0.94\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09\n1.01\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08\n0.12\nLength of tracts (mm)\n55.21\u2009\u00b1\u200930.18\n43.28\u2009\u00b1\u200918.56\n0.08\nTract density\n405.93\u2009\u00b1\u2009243.84\n268.90\u2009\u00b1\u2009270.34\n<0.0001\nOpen in a separate window\nDTI, diffusion tensor imaging; DTT, diffusion tensor tractography; SCI, spinal cord injury; FA, fractional anisotropy; MD, mean diffusivity; TD, typically developing; SD, standard deviation.\nTable\n3.\nAveraged DTI and DTT Parameters of the Whole Cord of Controls and Patients with Cervical SCI Along Entire Cervical Spinal Cord\nFeatures\nTD\nMean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD\nBIR\nMean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD\nProb>|t|\nFA\n0.45\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12\n0.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08\n<0.0001\nMD (10\n\u20133\nmm\n2\n/s)\n0.86\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09\n0.94\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07\n0.2\nLength of tracts (mm)\n57.71\u2009\u00b1\u20096.58\n42.02\u2009\u00b1\u200915.98\n0.95\nTract density\n323.76\u2009\u00b1\u2009207.33\n148.25\u2009\u00b1\u2009100.51\n<0.0001\nOpen in a separate window\nDTI, diffusion tensor imaging; DTT, diffusion tensor tractography; SCI, spinal cord injury; FA, fractional anisotropy; MD, mean diffusivity; TD, typically developing; BIR, below injury region; SD, standard deviation.\nTable\n4.\nAveraged DTI and DTT Parameters of the Whole Cord of Controls and Patients with Thoracic SCI Along Entire Thoracic Spinal Cord\nFeatures\nTD\nMean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD\nAIR\nMean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD\nProb>|t|\nFA\n0.47\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09\n0.41\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11\n0.62\nMD (10\n\u20133\nmm\n2\n/s)\n1.04\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08\n1.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07\n0.5\nLength of tracts (mm)\n51.67\u2009\u00b1\u200916.95\n48.04\u2009\u00b1\u200923.9\n0.6\nTract density\n522.31\u2009\u00b1\u2009244.57\n497.24\u2009\u00b1\u2009405.49\n0.004\nOpen in a separate window\nDTI, diffusion tensor imaging; DTT, diffusion tensor tractography; SCI, spinal cord injury; FA, fractional anisotropy; MD, mean diffusivity; TD, typically developing; AIR, above injury region; SD, standard deviation.\nA\np\nvalue of 0.05 was used throughout to determine statistical significance."

    "Methods": "Young adult female rats (Sprague-Dawley; Harlan) approximately 12 weeks old were maintained on a 12:12 light/dark cycle with food and water freely available. All surgical interventions and post-operative animal care were performed in accordance with theGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals(National Research Council) and were approved by the Indiana University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nSpinal cord contusion and hormone treatment\nRats were anesthetized by injection of ketamine (61.5\u2009mg/kg)/xylazine (8.6\u2009mg/kg), intraperitoneally. A T9 laminectomy was performed to expose the underlying thoracic spinal cord segment(s), and animals received a severe (a 10\u2009g weight dropped from a height of 25\u2009mm) contusion injury using an NYU impactor. Spinal cord injury at the T9 vertebra (T10-11 spinal cord) was intended to preserve central pattern generators at L1-2 required for locomotor function and the relevant motoneurons for our analysis. The muscle and skin were then closed in layers using 5-0 suture and stainless steel wound clips, respectively. Post-operative care followed previous protocols.\n43\n,\n44\nImmediately following contusion injury, rats were implanted with subcutaneous Silastic capsules (3.18\u2009mm O.D., 1.57\u2009mm I.D.)\n45\nthat were either empty (\u201cSCI\u201d) or filled with hormones. One group of injured rats were implanted with dihydrotestosterone (5\u03b1-androstan-17\u03b2 -ol-3-one; Steraloids, Newport, RI; 30\u2009mm; \u201cSCI+D\u201d). Such implants produce plasma titers of dihydrotestosterone in the normal physiological range, and have previously been demonstrated to reduce motoneuron atrophy induced by the death of neighboring motoneurons.\n30\n,\n34\nAlternatively, some injured rats were implanted with estradiol [1,3,5(10)-estratrien-3, 17\u03b2-diol; Steraloids; 10% in cholesterol; 10\u2009mm; \u201cSCI+E\u201d]. Such implants generate serum levels of estradiol similar to the average peak estradiol levels in intact cycling females in the proestrous phase,\n46\n,\n47\ncompletely prevent the effect of ovariectomy on uterine weight,\n48\nand reduce motoneuron atrophy induced by the death of neighboring motoneurons.\n34\nAnother group of injured rats was implanted with both dihydrotestosterone and estradiol capsules (\u201cSCI+E+D\u201d). The implant design and use followed those of Smith and colleagues,\n45\nwho demonstrated empirically that desired plasma levels of hormone are established within 1\u2009h of implantation, and remain constant through durations of treatment similar to that used in this study (4 weeks; see below). An additional group of age-matched, sham-injured females served as normal controls. Because some of the animals in the study (overall\nn\n=\u200947) were not included in all analyses due to technical or histological failure, group sizes for each analysis are reported individually below.\n\nLocomotor behavior\nThe Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale\n49\nwas used to assess hindlimb locomotor recovery. BBB testing was performed weekly up to 4 weeks after SCI according to our standard protocol.\n50\nBriefly, animals (SCI,\nn\n=\u20095; SCI+E,\nn\n=\u20097; SCI+D,\nn\n=\u20098; SCI+E+D,\nn\n=\u20096) were allowed to freely roam in an open field (diameter: 42 inches) and observed for 4\u2009min by two trained observers lacking knowledge of the experimental groups. The scores were assigned on a scale of 0-21, which is based on movements including joint movement, hindlimb movements, stepping, forelimb and hindlimb coordination, trunk position and stability, paw placement, and tail position.\n\nMetabolic cage test\nAt 3 weeks after SCI, measurement of micturition patterns was performed using metabolic cages according to methods described previously.\n51\nBriefly, animals (SCI,\nn\n=\u20095; SCI+E,\nn\n=\u20097; SCI+D,\nn\n=\u20097; SCI+E+D,\nn\n=\u20095; an additional group of normal animals served as na\u00efve controls,\nn\n=\u20098) were placed in a metabolic cage (Braintree Scientific, Braintree, MA) for measurement of voiding patterns. The voided urine was collected by a computerized system to record micturition volume and frequency. Animals were kept in this cage for 16\u2009h with ample water and food during the period of urine collection and measurement. The micturition pattern analysis included void frequency (voids/h) and void volume (mL/void). The total volume of expelled urine was not included because of variations in water intake between individual animals.\n\nHistological and histochemical processing\nFour weeks after injury, a length of time sufficient to observe SCI-induced effects on motoneuron morphology,\n20\n,\n21\nanimals were re-anesthetized, and the left vastus lateralis muscle of the quadriceps was exposed and injected with horseradish peroxidase conjugated to the cholera toxin B subunit (BHRP; 2\u2009\u03bcL, 0.2%; List Biological, Inc.). BHRP labeling permits population-level quantitative analysis of motoneuron somal and dendritic morphologies.\n52\n,\n53\nForty-eight hours after BHRP injection, a period that ensures optimal labeling of motoneurons,\n52\n,\n53\nanimals were weighed, re-anesthetized, and were then perfused intracardially with saline followed by cold fixative (1% paraformaldehyde/1.25% glutaraldehyde).\n\nLesion reconstruction\nTo assess potential effects on lesion volume and tissue sparing, spinal cords were carefully dissected to preserve the surrounding dura mater, and 15\u2009mm thoracic spinal cord segments including the lesion epicenter were removed, post-fixed overnight in the same fixative as used for perfusion, and transferred to sucrose phosphate buffer (30% w/v, pH 7.4). Thoracic segments were then embedded in gelatin, frozen, and sectioned transversely at 40\u2009\u03bcm; alternate sections were collected into two series, and mounted on gelatin-coated slides. One series was stained for myelin using Luxol fast blue and the other series was stained with cresyl violet and eosin for assessing lesion and spared tissue volume as described previously.\n20\nThe cross-sectional areas of lesion or spared white and gray matter for each animal (SCI,\nn\n=\u200911; SCI+E,\nn\n=\u20097; SCI+D,\nn\n=\u20098; SCI+E+D,\nn\n=\u20096) were measured in sections located 400\u2009\u03bcm apart and spanning the entire rostrocaudal extent of the lesion using a video-based morphometry system (Stereo Investigator; MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT) at a final magnification of 202\u2009\u00d7\u2009. An unbiased estimation of the percentage of spared tissue was calculated using the Cavalieri method.\n54\nThe total volume of spared white and gray matter was calculated by summing their individual subvolumes.\n55\nIndividual subvolumes of spared tissue were calculated by multiplying the cross-sectional area\nA\n\u00d7\nd\n, where\nd\nrepresents the distance between sections (400\u2009\u03bcm). Septae or fibrous bands of tissue observed within and/or spanning areas of cystic cavitation were not considered to represent spared tissue. The percent total volume of spared white and gray matter was calculated by dividing the total volume of spared white and gray matter by the total tissue volume of the corresponding region (\u2009\u00d7\u2009100), respectively. Estimation of total and percent total lesion volume (which included areas of cavitation and fibrosis) was determined using identical procedures.\n\nMotoneuron number and morphology\nThe vastus lateralis muscle is innervated by motoneurons located in column 3 of the lateral motor column in the L2 spinal segment.\n56\u201358\nFollowing perfusion, the lumbar portion of the spinal cord of each animal (sham,\nn\n=\u20097; SCI,\nn\n=\u200911; SCI+E,\nn\n=\u20096; SCI+D,\nn\n=\u20096; SCI+E+D,\nn\n=\u20096) was removed, post-fixed 5\u2009h in the same fixative as used for perfusion, then transferred to sucrose phosphate buffer (10% w/v, pH 7.4) overnight for cryoprotection. Spinal cords were then embedded in gelatin, frozen, and sectioned transversely at 40\u2009\u03bcm; all sections were collected into four alternate series. One series was stained with thionin for use in cell counts. For visualization of BHRP, the three remaining series were immediately reacted using a modified tetramethyl benzidine protocol,\n59\nmounted on gelatin-coated slides, and counterstained with thionin.\n\nMotoneuron counts\nTo assess potential effects on motoneuron loss after SCI, counts of motoneurons in the quadriceps motor pool were performed. Motoneurons innervating the quadriceps muscles do not form a discrete nucleus, but instead are contained within the large continuous populations of motoneurons located within the lateral motor column. Thus, to identify the appropriate area within the lateral motor column for motoneuron counts in the unreacted series, we used a method similar to that of Byers and colleagues.\n20\nBriefly, for each animal, the range of sections in which motoneurons labeled with BHRP after injection into the vastus lateralis muscle were present in the reacted series was identified, then motoneuron counts were performed in the appropriate matching sections in the unreacted series. For each animal, estimates of the total number of motoneurons in the left and right lateral motor columns were obtained using the optical dissector method as previously described.\n31\nCounts were made at 937.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009under brightfield illumination. Motoneurons are easily recognizable as large, darkly staining, multipolar cells. A counting frame (110\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u200980\u2009\u03bcm) was moved systematically throughout an area of each ventral horn (approximately 500\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u2009500\u2009\u03bcm, defined by the actual distribution of BHRP-labeled somata from all of the animals used in the study) in each section within the identified range. Only motoneurons in which there was a clear nucleus and nucleolus were counted, provided they did not contact the forbidden lines of the counting frame; motoneuron nucleoli were counted as they appeared while focusing through the z axis, and nucleoli in the first focal plane (i.e., \u201ctops\u201d) were excluded to avoid double counting. The length of the dissector was approximately 16\u2009\u03bcm, which was adequate for visualizing nucleoli in multiple focal planes. Motoneuron counts were derived from a mean of 7.8 sections spaced 480\u2009\u03bcm apart and distributed uniformly through the entire rostrocaudal extent of the quadriceps motoneuron pool range. This sampling scheme produced an overall average estimated coefficient of error of 0.09. Cell counts for each animal were corrected for the proportion of sections sampled.\nUsing similar methods, the number of BHRP-labeled motoneurons was assessed in all sections of the reacted series through the entire rostrocaudal extent of their distribution for all animals. Counts of labeled quadriceps motoneurons were made under brightfield illumination, where somata could be visualized and cytoplasmic inclusion of BHRP reaction product confirmed.\n\nSoma area\nTo assess potential atrophic changes in motoneurons after SCI, soma areas were measured. The area of quadriceps motoneuron somata was assessed in at least one set of alternate sections (160\u2009\u03bcm apart) using the Nucleator method.\n60\nA set of four rays emanating from a point randomly chosen within each BHRP-labeled motoneuron soma was drawn and oriented randomly. Soma areas of an average of 22.4 motoneurons were measured for each animal using Stereo Investigator at a final magnification of 780\u2009\u00d7\u2009. The overall average estimated coefficient of error was 0.02. Soma areas within each animal were then averaged for statistical analysis.\n\nDendritic length\nTo assess potential atrophic changes in motoneurons after SCI, dendritic lengths and distributions were measured. For each animal, dendritic lengths in a single representative set of alternate sections were measured under darkfield illumination. Beginning with the first section in which BHRP-labeled fibers were present, labeling through the entire rostrocaudal extent of the quadriceps motoneuron dendritic field was assessed in every third section (480\u2009\u03bcm apart) in three dimensions using a computer-based morphometry system (Neurolucida; MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT) at a final magnification of 250\u2009\u00d7\u2009. No attempt was made to identify BHRP-labeled fibers as either dendrites or axons. Average dendritic length per labeled motoneuron was estimated by summing the measured dendritic lengths of the series of sections, multiplying by three to correct for sampling, then dividing by the total number of labeled motoneurons in that series. This method does not attempt to assess the actual total dendritic length of labeled motoneurons,\n61\nbut has been shown to be a sensitive and reliable indicator of changes in dendritic morphology in normal development,\n52\n,\n62\n,\n63\nafter changes in dendritic interactions\n62\nand afferent input,\n12\n,\n64\n,\n65\nand after injury\n28\u201332\nincluding SCI.\n20\n,\n21\n\nDendritic distribution\nTo assess potential redistributions of dendrites across treatment groups, for each animal the composite dendritic arbor created in the length analysis was divided using a set of axes oriented radially around the center of the collective labeled somata. These axes divided the spinal cord into 12 bins of 30\u00b0 each. The portion of each animal's dendritic arbor per labeled motoneuron contained within each location was then determined. This method provides a sensitive measure of dendritic redistribution in response to changes in dendritic interactions,\n62\nafferent input,\n12\n,\n64\nand SCI.\n20\n\nDendritic extent\nThe comparability of BHRP labeling across groups was assessed by quantifying both the rostrocaudal and the radial extent of quadriceps motoneuron dendritic arbors. The rostrocaudal extent of the dendritic arbor was determined by recording the rostrocaudal distance spanned by quadriceps motoneuron dendrites for each animal. The maximal radial extent of the arbor in the transverse plane also was measured for each animal, using the same radial axes and resultant 30\u00b0 bins used for the dendritic distribution analysis. For each bin, the linear distance between the center of the quadriceps motor pool and the most distal BHRP-filled process was measured. Radial dendritic extent is independent of overall dendritic length and reflects the maximal linear distance (in the transverse plane) of BHRP transport to the most distal dendritic processes.\n\nMuscle fiber morphology\nTo assess potential atrophic changes in muscle after SCI, the target musculature of the quadriceps motoneurons also was examined (sham,\nn\n=\u20097; SCI,\nn\n=\u200911; SCI+E,\nn\n=\u20097; SCI+D,\nn\n=\u20098; SCI+E+D,\nn\n=\u20096). The right vastus lateralis muscles were removed immediately after perfusion, weighed, post-fixed overnight in the same fixative as used for perfusion, and then transferred to sucrose phosphate buffer (10% w/v, pH 7.4). Muscles were then rinsed in distilled water and flash-frozen in 2-methylbutane. Segments from the middle of the body of the muscle were then sectioned (45\u2009\u03bcm) on a cryostat at \u221220\u00b0C transversely for examination of muscle fiber cross-sectional area and thaw-mounted onto glass slides. Muscle fiber cross-sectional area, a correlate of muscle strength, was assessed after staining with Milligan's trichrome stain. Cross-sectional muscle fiber areas were measured under brightfield illumination using Stereo Investigator at a final magnification of 510\u2009\u00d7\u2009. Muscle fiber cross-sectional areas were derived from five sections spaced 450\u2009\u03bcm apart and distributed uniformly through the muscle segment. A counting frame (200\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u2009200\u2009\u03bcm) was placed randomly over each section and the cross-sectional area of muscle fibers falling within the area of interest was measured using the Nucleator method.\n60\nTo obtain accurate measures of muscle fiber cross-sectional area, only\nen face\nprofiles were traced. An average of 41.4 muscle fibers was measured for each animal. This sampling scheme produced an overall average estimated coefficient of error of 0.01. Fiber areas within each animal were then averaged for statistical analysis.\nAll data were analyzed by analyses of variance (ANOVAs; one-way or repeated measures as appropriate) followed by\npost hoc\nanalyses using Fisher's least significant difference (LSD). Digital light micrographs were obtained using an MDS 290 digital camera system (Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, NY). Brightness and contrast of these images were adjusted in Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA)."

    "Methods": "Participants\nParticipants were recruited through posted flyers in athletic facilities, physical therapy clinics, hospitals, concussion clinics, community notice boards, and cafes around the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area. All participants with chronic mTBI had self-reported complaints of imbalance as determined from a nonzero symptom score for balance problems on the SCAT3 symptom inventory\n20\nand a diagnosed mTBI >3 months before the testing session. For the purposes of this study, mTBI was defined and classified using the criteria from the United States Department of Defense: no CT scan, or a normal CT scan if obtained, loss of consciousness not exceeding 30\u2009min, alteration of consciousness/mental state up to 24\u2009h, and post-traumatic amnesia not exceeding one day.\n21\nThe mechanism of injury was not restricted. All diagnoses of mTBI were confirmed by an Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) physician.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria were defined by Fino and coworkers.\n19\nTo be included in the study, participants (1) were between 21 and 50 years old, (2) had minimal cognitive impairment as assessed by the Short Blessed test, and (3) had either a diagnosis of mTBI with persisting symptoms for more than three months post-injury for the chronic mTBI group or no history of mTBI or brain injury within the past year for the control group. Exclusion criteria included: any other neurological illness or major surgical procedure that could explain balance deficits; moderate to severe substance abuse; significant pain during testing; pregnancy; history of balance complaints, peripheral vestibular pathology, or oculomotor deficits before the mTBI; hearing loss no worse than 60 dB HL (PTA 0.5\u20133\u2009kHz); or inability to abstain from medications that might impair balance. All participants were required to abstain from medications that could impair their balance or gait for at least 24\u2009h before testing, including sedating antihistamines, benzodiazepines, sedatives, narcotic pain medications, and alcohol. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were evaluated by research assistants over the phone or in-person before enrolling participants. Recruitment procedures and experimental protocols were approved by the OHSU and Veterans Affairs Portland Health Care System (VAPORHCS) joint Institutional Review Board.\n\nProcedures\nThe full protocol for this study is described by Fino and coworkers\n19\n; specific components pertaining to the present study are presented here in further detail.\nSymptoms were assessed at the beginning of testing using the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI). The NSI total symptom score was divided into four subscores based on the domain of the reported symptom: somatosensory score (headache, nausea, vision problems, sensitivity to light, sensitivity to noise, numbness/tingling, change in taste/smell), affective score (fatigue, sleep, anxiety, depression, irritability, frustration), cognitive score (concentration/distraction, forgetfulness, difficulty making decisions, slowed thinking), and vestibular score (dizziness, imbalance, coordination).\n22\nSymptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were assessed using the appropriate civilian or military version of the PTSD Checklist, depending of the veteran-status of the participant, to control for the potential mediation between PTSD and physical health.\n23\nParticipants then were instrumented with five inertial sensors (Opals, APDM, Inc., Portland, OR), one on each foot, over the lumbar spine, sternum, and on the forehead. Only data from the lumbar spine, sternum, and forehead sensors are presented here. Before the turning protocol, participants completed several balance and gait tests as part of a larger study, including a self-paced walk eight times down and back between two lines spaced 13 meters apart in a quiet hallway. Straight, self-selected gait speed was extracted from the straight sections of this long walk using MobilityLab (Software version 2, Analysis version 3, APDM, Inc. Portland, OR) for comparison purposes. Other protocols and data pertaining to the straight walking protocol are not presented in this initial analysis of turning.\nParticipants were introduced to a marked course containing four 45-degree turns, four 90-degree turns, and two 135-degree turns specifically designed for this study (\nFig. 1\n). The course was designed to feature a variety of turns at angles common in everyday ambulation. Participants were led through the course by a research assistant before following the course on their own for a minimum of two laps or until they were familiar with the walking pattern. After the familiarization, the participants walked around the course for 12 continuous laps at their self-selected pace.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nTurning course marked with arrows including four 45-degree turns, four 90-degree turns, and two 135-degree turns. Two 45-degree turns (x) were excluded, leaving eight total turns per lap.\nAfter completing 12 laps at the comfortable pace, participants were instructed to walk \u201cas fast as possible without running or jogging\u201d around the course. The participants completed a minimum of two laps at the fast walking pace to familiarize themselves with the course at the new pace. Participants then walked at their fast pace around the course for four continuous laps. Data were recorded from the inertial sensors at 128\u2009Hz.\nAs peripheral vestibular\n12\n,\n24\nand oculomotor\n25\n,\n26\ndysfunction is common after mTBI, each participant also completed clinical oculomotor and vestibular tests of saccadic latency, smooth pursuit, gaze fixation, convergence, calorics, head impulse, cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMP), and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (oVEMP) at least one day before mobility testing. These clinical oculomotor and vestibular tests were used to provide further descriptive characteristics of each participant.\n\nAnalysis\nFor each trial, raw data were extracted from the inertial sensors, and angular velocities were filtered using a 1.5\u2009Hz, fourth order phaseless low-pass Butterworth filter. The continuous data were segmented into 12 laps and the peak velocity of each turn. Two 45-degree turns were excluded from the analysis because a clearly defined peak velocity was not present across all participants (\nFig. 1\n). All turns from the first and final lap were excluded from the analysis, leaving 10 laps of eight analyzed turns at normal walking speed. For the fast walking trials, only the final lap was excluded, leaving three laps of eight analyzed turns.\nFor each turn, the magnitude and time of the peak angular velocity of the head and pelvis, relative to the global reference frame, were extracted. For each participant and at each speed, the peak angular velocities were averaged across turns of the same angle. Peak velocity timing (PVT) was defined as the difference in time between peak velocities of head and trunk (HT-PVT) or head and pelvis (HP-PVT) for each turn (\nFig. 2\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nExample angular velocity traces of the head (top), trunk (middle), and pelvis (bottom). The peak angular velocity for each turn is indicated with a filled marker. The head-to-trunk and head-to-pelvis peak velocity timings (HT-PVT and HP-PVT, respectively) are indicated by the temporal difference between the peak velocities at each turn.\nThe PVT differs from traditionally defined reorientation timing in that it measures the coordination of angular velocities, rather than angular displacements or time of turn onset. A positive PVT indicates the peak velocity of the head that occurred before the peak velocity of the trunk or pelvis, with more positive values indicating greater separation between the peak head and peak trunk or pelvis angular velocities. Similarly, a negative PVT indicates the peak velocity of the head that occurred after the peak velocity of the trunk or pelvis. Larger PVT magnitudes, regardless of direction, indicate the head reorientations are less coupled with the reorientations of the trunk or pelvis. The HT-PVT and HP-PVT were each averaged across turns of the same angle. The variability of HT- and HP-PVT was determined from the standard deviation across all turns of the same speed. The average time to complete each lap was also calculated and recorded.\n\nStatistical analysis\nTwo-sample independent\nt\ntests compared the symptom scores, age, body mass index (BMI), and average lap time and gait speed between groups. To test whether the peak angular velocity of the head, peak angular velocity of the pelvis, or the HT- or HP-PVT differed between persons with chronic mTBI and controls, we fit a linear mixed model for each outcome. Each linear mixed model was adjusted for group, average lap time, turning angle, age, BMI, and with a random intercept for each subject. To test whether the persons with chronic mTBI had more variable HT- or HP-PVT compared with controls, linear regression models were fit for the variability of HT- and HP-PVT and adjusted for group, average lap time, age, and BMI.\nTo compare the relationship of peak angular velocity of the head, peak angular velocity of the pelvis, HT- or HP-PVT to symptom severity, we fit four linear mixed models per outcome. Each model was adjusted for one of the NSI symptom subscores: somatosensory score, affective score, cognitive score, and vestibular score. Each model was also adjusted for potential confounders of time since injury, age, BMI, and PTSD symptom score, turning angle, and included a random intercept for each subject. To similarly compare the relationship between HT-PVT, HP-PVT variability, average lap time, or straight gait speed to symptom severity, four linear regression models were fit for each outcome and adjusted for one of the NSI symptom subscores and potential confounders of time since injury, age, BMI, and PTSD symptom score.\nTo assess whether individuals with chronic mTBI increased reorientation velocities as much as the control group,\npost hoc\nlinear mixed models were fit for peak angular velocity of the head, trunk, and pelvis, and for average lap time. Each model was adjusted for group, speed, group*speed, and a random intercept for each subject. Turn angle was included as a covariate for peak head, trunk, and pelvis angular velocity.\nAll analyses were performed in MATLAB R2016a (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA). Statistical analyses were performed with the MATLAB R2016a Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox using a two-sided significance level of 0.05."

    "Methods": "Participants\nThe present multi-site study was conducted through the NCAA-DoD CARE Consortium Advanced Research Core (ARC). Sponsored by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), CARE is a large, national study of the natural history of concussion and post-injury recovery in military service academy (MSA) cadets and NCAA student-athletes.\n40\nParticipants for the DTI study were recruited from three ARC sites where multi-modal MRI studies were performed. The three sites include University of North Carolina (UNC), University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), and Virginia Tech (VT). Participating athletes account for approximately 48\u201375% of eligible football players at the three ARC sites. Among the participating football players, 30 sustained acute concussion and were recruited for the imaging study. Contact-sport controls (\nn\n=\u200928) were matched to concussed athletes on variables of age, sex, education, number of previous concussion, and estimated pre-morbid level of verbal intellectual functioning (i.e., Wechsler Test of Adult Reading [WTAR\n42\n]).

The tests were performed on all enrolled athletes at baseline (pre-season), and for athletes diagnosed with concussion, the measures were repeated 24\u201348\u2009h post-injury. The matched contact-sport controls received the same clinical assessments at similar time points. Clinical assessment measures included the SCAT\n4\nto assess symptom severity, BSI\n5\nto assess psychological distress, the SAC\n6\nto assess cognition, and the BESS\n7\nto assess postural stability. The BSI instrument can be further divided into three subcategories: BSI-soma for physical symptoms, BSI-anxiety, and BSI-depression to evaluate mood disorders. Thus, a total of eight clinical measures were compared between the concussed group and contact-sport control group, and were correlated with the DTI metrics.\n\nImaging protocol\nThe concussed athletes and their matched teammates underwent MRI scans within 24\u201348\u2009h post-injury. The DTI scans were acquired on Siemens MAGNETOM 3T Tim Trio (VT, UNC, and UCLA) or 3T Prisma (UNC and UCLA) scanners across the three ARC sites with a 12CH (VT) or 32CH (UNC and UCLA) receiver-only head coil. A single-shot echo planar imaging sequence with a twice-refocused spin echo was used. The diffusion-encoding scheme consisted of 30 directions at b-value of 1000\u2009s/mm\n2\nand 8 b\n0\n(b-value\u2009=\u20090\u2009s/mm\n2\n). One of the b\n0\nvolumes was acquired with a reversed phase-encoding direction. Other MRI parameters were echo time/repetition time\u2009=\u200998/7900\u2009ms, field of view\u2009=\u2009243\u2009mm, matrix size\u2009=\u200990\u2009\u00d7\u200990, whole-brain coverage of 60 slices with slice thickness of 2.7\u2009mm, and isotropic resolution of 2.7\u2009mm. Care has been taken to ensure diffusion MRI signal's quality and stability. Phantom studies were performed for quality control and assurance with a FBRIN gel phantom, and for evaluation of reproducibility and reliability with two traveling human phantoms. In addition, we have examined the DTI metrics' stability on matched non-contact-sport controls (\nSupplementary Fig. S1\n) (see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n) and on categorized DTI results (\nSupplementary Fig. S2\n) (see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). We observed no obvious outliers that require advanced data harmonization approaches other than controlling site and scanner differences in general linear regression models described below in the\nStatistical analysis\nsubsection. A complete description of the MRI protocols and QA/QC procedures are available in a previous work\n40\nand in a submitted manuscript by Nencka and colleagues.\n88\n\nImage processing\nImage processing included pre-processing followed by computation of DTI metrics. Diffusion-weighted images were first denoised using the local principal component analysis (LPCA) approach.\n43\nWith a pair of reverse-phase\u2013encoded b\n0\nimages as reference, diffusion-weighted images were then corrected for motion, eddy current artifacts, and static-field geometric distortion using the\neddy_openmp\ncommand provided in the FMRIB Software Library (FSL).\n44\nUsing an in-house Matlab script, the transformation matrices output from the\neddy_openmp\ncommand were used to rotate the corresponding diffusion-weighting directions to match the rotation of the brain image during the motion-correction procedure. After image pre-processing, DTI metrics (FA, AD, RD, and MD) were computed voxelwise\n16\nwith a linear fitting algorithm using the FSL\ndtifit\ncommand (\nFig. 1\n). Brain images of DTI metrics were transformed to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using Advanced Neuroimaging Tools (ANTs) nonlinear registration.\n45\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nAveraged maps of the DTI metrics for the 58 subjects in MNI standard space. The DTI metrics include fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and mean diffusivity (MD). The gray scale is 0\u20133*10\n\u22126\nmm\n2\n/s for diffusivities and is 0\u20131 for FA. DTI, diffusion tensor imaging; MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute.\n\nTract-based spatial statistic analysis\nTo minimize partial volume effects arising from finite imaging resolution, in the standard MNI space, a common whole-brain while matter skeleton was extracted using the FSL toolbox, tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS).\n46\nThe white matter skeleton included only voxels that are in the center of white-matter tracts and excluded edge voxels that may be contaminated with signals from nearby gray matter or CSF. Within the white matter skeleton, nonparametric permutation-based statistics used in TBSS (i.e., the\nrandomise\ncommand) was used for voxelwise statistical analysis. A threshold-free cluster enhancement\n47\nand 5000 permutations\n48\nwere used in this study. White matter voxels were deemed significant if\np\n<\u20090.05 after being adjusted for multiple comparisons by controlling family-wise error rate (FWER) within the white matter voxels. The general regression models used in TBSS were adjusted for site and scanner differences. Using TBSS, we tested: 1) between-group differences in DTI metrics and 2) within-group correlations between DTI metrics and clinical outcome measures.\n\nPost-hoc region-of-interest analysis\nEach of the TBSS regression analyses produced significant white matter voxels. These voxels were collected as ROIs in which means of DTI metrics were computed for each subject. Rather than to determine significance, the purpose of the post-hoc ROI analysis is to produce aggregate results over the significant white matter voxels for illustration. For between-group differences, a box plot was used with subjects' means plotted according to their group membership. For within-group correlations, a scatter plot was used with subjects' means plotted against their neuropsychological outcome measures. Further, post-hoc regression analyses allow us to retrieve correlation coefficients (\u03c1) at the ROI level. Anatomical interpretation of significant white matter was based on the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) white matter atlas provided in FSL\n49\n(\nTable 3\n;\nSupplementary Fig. S3\n) (see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). In particular, TBSS-significant white matter was superimposed with the JHU 48 white mater labels, and the percentage of voxels counts was summarized in a color-coded matrix.\nTable\n3.\nJHU White Matter Labels and Acronyms\nACR\nAnterior corona radiata\nPCR\nPosterior corona radiata\nALIC\nAnterior limb of internal capsule\nPCT\nPontine crossing tract\nBCC\nBody of corpus callosum\nPLIC\nPosterior limb of internal capsule\nCGC\nCingulum (cingulate gyrus)\nPTR\nPosterior thalamic radiation\nCGH\nCingulum (hippocampus)\nRLIC\nRetro-lenticular part of IC\nCP\nCerebral peduncle\nSCC\nSplenium of corpus callosum\nCST\nCorticospinal tract\nSCP\nSuperior cerebellar peduncle\nEC\nExternal capsule\nSCR\nSuperior corona radiata\nFx\nFornix (body of fornix)\nSFO\nSuperior fronto-occipital fasciculus\nFx-ST\nFornix/stria terminals\nSLF\nSuperior longitudinal fasciculus\nGCC\nGenu of corpus callosum\nSS\nSagittal stratum\nICP\nInferior cerebellar peduncle\nTAP\nTapatum\nMCP\nMiddle cerebellar peduncle\nUNC\nUncinate fasciculus\nML\nMedial lemniscus\nOpen in a separate window\nJHU, Johns Hopkins University white matter atlas provided in FSL\n{Oishi, 2008 #1545}\n.\n\nStatistical analysis\nFor between-group comparisons, clinical outcome measures were analyzed with a two-tailed Student's\nt\n-test using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS; version 24; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). A value of\np\n<\u20090.05 was deemed significant. TBSS regression analyses used general linear models to test between-group differences in DTI metrics and correlations between the four DTI metrics and eight clinical measures. To adjust skewness in distributions of some of the clinical scores, a logarithmic transformation was performed before correlating with DTI metrics. Tests involving clinical measures were adjusted for pre-season baseline scores, and tests involving DTI metrics were adjusted for site and MRI scanner differences."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nAdults between ages 18 and 55 years were consented and enrolled under an institutional review board\u2013approved protocol (\nClinicalTrials.gov\nNCT01762475). Inclusion criteria for TBI subjects included TBI 6 months to 10 years prior with Glasgow Coma Score between 3 and 12, post-traumatic amnesia >24\u2009h, or TBI-related neuroimaging abnormality (computed tomography [CT] or MRI). Exclusionary criteria included any penetrating TBI, pre-existing disabling neurologic or psychiatric disorder, pregnancy, or unstable pulmonary or vascular disorder. Gender- and age-matched individuals with no history of TBI, pre-existing disabling neurological or psychiatric disorders, or pregnancy were enrolled as healthy controls (HC).\n\nMRI imaging\nMRI was performed on a Siemens Biograph mMR, fully integrated 3 Tesla MRI/PET. T1 Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo (MPRAGE), susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI), T2- gradient echo sequences, diffusion weighted imaging, Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), pulsed arterial spin labeling (ASL) and MRI-BOLD sequences were acquired on each subject.\nFLAIR images were acquired with the following parameters: repetition time/echo time (TR/TE)\u2009=\u20099090/112\u2009msec, inversion time (TI)\u2009=\u20092450\u2009msec, slice thickness\u2009=\u20093.0\u2009mm. ASL images were acquired using a pulsed sequence with the PICORE Q2TIPS labeling scheme. The following parameters were established for the acquisition of 111 2D-EPI volumes: TR/TE\u2009=\u20092700/15\u2009msec, TI1/TI2\u2009=\u2009700/1800\u2009msec.\nEach participant underwent MRI-BOLD sequences with CVR hypercapnia measurements according to the methods developed previously.\n37\n,\n38\nShort CO\n2\nchallenges are similar to longer challenges in healthy volunteers,\n37\nand while shorter challenges have not yet been studied in TBI, the shorter challenge is able to reliably detect CVR deficit in a chronic neurodegenerative condition, Alzheimer disease.\n38\nHypercapnia was induced via a Douglas bag alternating between a flow of room air and 5% CO\n2\nmixed with room air every minute for 7\u2009min total while the MRI-BOLD images were acquired. End-tidal CO\n2\n(EtCO\n2\n) was measured continuously using a capnograph (Smith Medical, Model 9004). These conditions (5% CO\n2\nfor no longer than 1\u2009min at a time) did not result in significant changes in mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate or oxygen saturation.\n39\nThe sequence's parameters were TR/TE\u2009=\u20092,000/25\u2009msec, flip angle\u2009=\u200980\u00b0, field of view\u2009=\u2009220\u2009\u00d7\u2009220\u2009mm\n2\n, matrix\u2009=\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200964, 36 slices, thickness\u2009=\u20093.6\u2009mm, no gap between slices, 210 volumes.\n\nData processing\nASL\nImage data analyses were performed with the Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM12) and ASL data processing toolbox. The control and label ASL images were realigned and resliced to correct for head motion. They were smoothed using an isotropic Gaussian kernel with a 4\u2009mm full-width at half-maximum. CBF images were reconstructed using the ASL Data Processing Toolbox: ASLtbx.\nCVR\nVoxel-by-voxel CVR maps were calculated based on a linear regression between BOLD signal time courses and the vascular input function. At baseline, the mean (standard deviation [SD]) EtCO\n2\nvalue is 39.9 (1.6) mm Hg and rise to 49 (1.2) mm Hg. The BOLD response signal is delayed from the EtCO\n2\n(\nFig. 1\n) which corresponds to the time needed for the blood to travel between the lungs to the cerebrovascular network. The EtCO\n2\ntime delay is individually corrected to achieve the maximum correlation between the two measures. We processed CVR data using a general linear model, with the EtCO\n2\ntime course as the regressor to generate CVR maps (in the units of % BOLD change/mm Hg CO\n2\nchange, %/mm Hg) for each subject. Images were spatially realigned and re-sliced to correct for head motion with SPM (realign and re-slice toolbox). We monitored six parameters (x, y, z translation and pitch, toll and yaw) to assure correct co-registration. The full method is previously described by Lu and colleagues.\n40\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nTime course of end-tidal CO\n2\n(EtCO\n2\n) and blood oxygen level\u2013dependent (BOLD) signal in the thalamus and average among the 15 healthy controls. The BOLD signal follows the EtCO\n2\ndata with a temporal delay of approximately 15\u2009sec.\nThe CVR, CBF, and FLAIR images were each co-registered with the MPRAGE images using SPM12. The CBF and CVR individual voxel intensity images were transformed into histograms, characterized by the mean and median. The individual images (CBF and CVR) were also segmented into white/gray matter and CSF. CVR and CBF maps were normalized into a Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) brain template for group comparisons. For each patient, we computed a z-score map to characterize individual-level regional abnormalities. We used the normalized images to perform a voxel-by-voxel statistical parametric analysis to evaluate local abnormalities in individual's CBF and CVR, compared with a pool of HC. We define an abnormal voxel as any voxel with a z-score smaller than a specified threshold and belonging to a cluster size of at least 20 voxels. An abnormal voxel belongs to a specific cluster if one of its 26 neighbors is also an abnormal voxel.\n\nNeurobehavioral assessments\nA psychometrist administered a battery of neuropsychological tests and neurobehavioral symptom surveys selected from the TBI Common Data Elements. They included: learning portions of the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), Word Reading subtest of the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT), Trail Making Test (TMT) Parts A and B, Digit Symbol and Symbol Search subsets of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV), the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), and the Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire. Raw scores on the CVLT, WRAT, TMT, and WAIS-IV were normalized for age and education.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe statistical analysis was done under Matlab statistical toolbox, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for standard normal distribution. If one dataset rejected the null hypothesis at 5% significance level, we performed a Spearman rank order correlation. Otherwise, we performed Pearson linear correlation. The correlation coefficient is associated with a\np\nvalue testing the hypothesis of no correlation. The statistical analysis of independent samples was done with two independent\nt\n-tests when the samples were normally distributed and with Mann-Whitney U-test otherwise."

We used two different hESC lines, and 2\u20133 separate neural inductions per line, giving us 3\u20135 repeats for each experiment.\n\nSample collection and storage\nSamples (60\u2009\u03bcL) were taken from each well culture supernatant at the given time points. Five baseline samples were taken before adding any cytokine. Further samples were taken at 1\u2009h, 24\u2009h, and 72\u2009h after addition of the respective cytokine (\nn\n=\u20093 per time point). When performing the experiments, seeding density was 100,000 cells per well of a 24-well plate. Samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until analysis.\n\nCytokine analysis\nThe cell culture supernatants from three wells for each experimental condition were analyzed in duplicate wells using the Milliplex\n\u2122\nMultiAnalyte Profiling (MAP) Human Cytokine/Chemokine 42 analyte pre-mixed kit (Millipore Corp, St. Louis, MO) using the manufacturer's instructions as described previously.\n23\nThe plates were read on a Luminex 200 analyzer (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX) running STarStation software (Applied Cytometry Systems, Sheffield, UK). Cytokine concentrations were calculated by reference to an eight-point five-parameter logistic standard curve for each cytokine.\n\nImmunocytochemistry\nNeurons were differentiated on poly-D-lysine/laminin coated glass coverslips. These were fixed with 4% fresh paraformaldehyde for 20\u2009min at room temperature before being washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Samples were then blocked for 1\u2009h at room temperature with 0.3% Triton/ PBS/5% goat serum before being incubated overnight with primary antibody in 0.2% Triton/PBS/2% goat serum at 4\u00b0C. After three washes in PBS, secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 488 or 555, 1:1000) in PBS/Hoechst (1:4000) was next applied for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Primary antibodies used included \u03b2-III tubulin (1:500; Sigma- Aldrich), orthodenticle homeobox 1 (OTX1), REELIN, T-Box Brain 1 [TBR1] (1:50; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank [DSHB], Iowa City), Forkhead Box G1 (FOXG1) (1:100; Abcam), Synapsin (1:500; Calbiochem), microtubule associated protein 2ab (MAP2ab) (1:500; Sigma-Aldrich), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (1:500; Sigma-Aldrich) and glutamate (1:500; Sigma-Aldrich).\n\nClinical cytokine data from patients with TBI\nWe extracted data from two previously published studies from our group describing the temporal profiles and concentrations of cytokines from patients with severe TBI.\n8\n,\n24\nIn a pilot trial of IL-1 receptor antagonist treatment for TBI, we used brain cytokine concentrations from the placebo group.\n24\nDemographic data for all patients are available in\nSupplementary Table 1\n(see online supplementary material at\nftp.liebertpub.com\n), including age, sex, admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and head computed tomography (CT) verifiable injury as defined by Marshall CT classification (Grade II\u2013IV\u2009=\u2009diffuse and Grade VI\u2009=\u2009focal).\n25\nAs described in detail in the previous studies,\n8\n,\n24\npatients were monitored for approximately five consecutive days, and cytokine samples were pooled from 6-h periods. While there was some disparity in commencement of monitoring after the traumatic ictus, all data have been corrected to the time of injury to enable comparison with the\nin vitro\nexperiments.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe effect of each of the added cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF) on the measured cytokines (42 cytokine panel) was analyzed using a two-way mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) (to compare concentrations of each cytokine analyzed). The time at which the sample was taken (\u201cTime\u201d; 0 (baseline levels), 1\u2009h, 24\u2009h, 72\u2009h) was used as the repeated measure (within subject) variable. The concentration of added cytokine (\u201cConcentration\u201d; untreated, and four concentrations of added cytokine in\nTable 1\n) was used as the independent (between subject) variable. No assumptions were made about sphericity of the data, and the more conservative Greenhouse-Geisser method was used to determine the F-ratio significance value for the effect of Time and the interaction of time and concentration (\u201cTime*Concentration\u201d). The conventional ANOVA F-ratio significance value was used for the independent variable \u201cConcentration.\u201d For those cytokines in which the ANOVA significance value was <0.05,\npost hoc\ntests were used to explore the nature of this contrast.\nTests of contrast within \u201cTime\u201d and the interaction of \u201cTime*Concentration\u201d were tested against three potential models: linear, quadratic, and cubic. The model with the most stringent\np\nvalue is quoted. In cases where the\np\nvalues are identical, the relevant models are listed. In the case of Concentration, the Bonferroni multiple comparison test was used to determine significance values between each of the added concentrations.\nIn a separate analysis, we have compared the effects of the three added cytokines in a multivariate ANOVA in which the dependent variables were the measured cytokines at three time points (i.e., cytokine measured at 1\u2009h, cytokine measured at 24\u2009h, and cytokine measured at 72\u2009h) and the independent variable was the cytokine added (No cytokine added, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF). In this case, the data from the control wells with untreated are not incorporated into the series of concentrations but are compared as a separate group: \u201cuntreated.\u201d For the F-ratios and\npost hoc\ntests described above, a\np\nvalue of \u22640.05 has been used throughout.\nDescriptively, we compared the temporal profiles of cytokine release as well as concentrations\nin vivo\nfrom a previous study and compared them with our results.\n8\n,\n24"

    "Methods": "Control dogs\nClinically normal, adult dogs were recruited prospectively to establish normal values for quantitative DTI analysis performed using the same protocol on the same magnet as dogs with SCI. Informed consent was obtained, and examinations were conducted in accordance with the North Carolina State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol #15-150-O). All dogs had to have a normal neurological examination and no history of neurological disease.\n\nCase selection\nDogs were recruited prospectively from the patient pool of the Canine Spinal Cord Injury Program at the North Carolina State University (NCSU) College of Veterinary Medicine and via trial advertisement online (\nhttps://cvm.ncsu.edu/research/labs/clinical-sciences/canine-spinal-cord-injury/\n,\nwww.dodgerslist.com\n). Previous open field gait score (OFS) data from a comparable population (based on inclusion criteria) were used to determine that 20 dogs would allow detection of a three-point difference in mean OFS between dogs with and without intact translesional fibers with a power of 90%. Given the lack of preliminary DTI data, we aimed to enroll a minimum of 20 dogs.\nTo be included, dogs must have been between one and 12 years of age, suffered an acute, clinically complete (hindlimb paralysis with loss of pain perception) thoracolumbar SCI, and demonstrated an incomplete recovery at least three months after injury characterized by chronic motor deficits and severely reduced to absent hindlimb and tail pain perception (with or without urinary and fecal incontinence). Prior advanced imaging (computed tomography or MRI) at the time of injury, or definitive diagnosis were not required for inclusion. Exclusion criteria included implants that could generate MRI artifact, comorbidities precluding general anesthesia, and aggression or anxiety preventing gait analysis and handling.\nData collection on each dog included signalment, diagnosis, lesion location, duration of injury (interval from acute injury to imaging), and prior treatment of the SCI. Previous therapy including participation in interventional clinical trials were noted but not utilized as exclusion criteria for the purposes of this study. Informed consent was obtained for all animals, and examinations were conducted in accordance with the NCSU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol #15-004-01).\nGeneral neurologic and gait evaluation\nAll dogs underwent a neurological examination including standard evaluation of gait, proprioception, spinal reflexes, and pain perception. More extensive gait analysis consisted of walking each dog on a nonslip surface for approximately 3\u20135\u2009min. All examinations were videotaped. Gait was categorized as ambulatory (able to take at least 10 consecutive weight bearing steps unassisted), or not and quantified using an ordinal gait scale (open field score, OFS, ranging from 0\u201312).\n26\n,\n27\nOFS greater than 4 corresponds to taking weight bearing steps more than 10% of the time.\nImaging acquisition and processing\nAll dogs (cases and controls) were anesthetized and scanned in dorsal recumbency. Pre-medication consisted of intravenous (IV) dexmedetomidine (Dexdomitor, Orion Pharma, Espoo, Finland) 1\u20134\u2009\u03bcg/kg and IV butorphanol (Torbugesic, Zoetis, Kalamazoo, MI) 0.1\u20130.2\u2009mg/kg followed by propofol induction (PropoFlo 10\u2009mg/mL, Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) and inhaled isoflurane for maintenance (VET ONE Fluriso, MWI, Boise, ID).\nAll MRIs were performed using a 1.5T scanner (Symphony; Siemens Medical Solutions USA Inc., Malvern, PA) using circularly polarized spine array and body array flex coils with acquisition of standard transverse and sagittal sequences (T1W pre- and post-contrast, T2W, STIR, half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE)) of the thoracolumbar spinal cord.\n28\nAdditional sequences utilized in some, but not all, dogs included proton density and GRE/T2*.\nDTI was obtained for the same region in the transverse plane using a protocol adapted from Jones and associates\n29\nwith 35 diffusion directions with a scan time of approximately 5\u2009min (\nTable 1\n). Five B0 nondiffusion weighted images were acquired with diffusion weighted scans, and an unprocessed, transverse diffusion-weighted image is presented in\nFigure 1\n. Signal to noise ratio (SNR) was calculated on the raw diffusion weighted images (b\u2009=\u20091000\u2009s/mm\n2\n) by creating a region of interest (ROI) in the region with highest intensity and one in the background. SNR was defined as the ratio of the mean of the highest intensity values to the standard deviation (SD) of the background values. Post-processing of the diffusion data consisted of conversion from DICOMs to 4D image volumes using MRI Convert and storage in NIfTI format. A diffusion tensor model was fitted to these images using Diffusion Toolkit (\nhttp://trackvis.org/dtk/\n), providing a matrix-valued tensor for each voxel that was used to compute standard indices.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExample of an unprocessed, transverse diffusion-weighted image.

Post-processed DTI images were imported into Mango (\nhttp://ric.uthscsa.edu/mango/\n) to outline ROI on which quantitative analyses were then performed. In cases, ROI were hand drawn using B0 nondiffusion weighted transverse images at the lesion epicenter as well as one to two vertebral segments cranial and caudal to the visible extent of the lesion in normal-appearing areas on conventional MRI (T2W images). Each ROI was composed of the two-dimensional cross-sectional area of spinal cord on three consecutive slices to create a volume of tissue for analysis. Care was taken when drawing ROI to exclude extramedullary structures including cerebrospinal fluid and epidural fat.\nQuantitative analysis consisted of calculation of FA and MD for each ROI constructed (cranial, lesion epicenter, caudal). Average FA and MD were calculated on corresponding ROI in controls to generate normal canine values along the thoracolumbar spinal cord using this protocol and to allow comparison to cases. Qualitative analysis consisted of generating maps of the orientation of tensors across all voxels. These tensor maps were used to perform tractography using TrackVis (\nhttp://trackvis.org\n) in which fiber tracts reflecting axonal connections were generated by tracing adjacent tensors with similar directions. Tractography provided a visual representation of the spinal cord and was assessed visually for continuity of white matter tracts across the lesion. Tractography was also performed in controls.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAnalyses were performed using Jmp 12 Pro (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Summary statistics for continuous data (FA and MD values, OFS) were reported as mean and SD if distributed normally or median and range if not using the Wilk-Shapiro test for normality. Translesional fibers were noted to be present or absent based on tractography. The FA and MD values were compared between cases and controls using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Among cases, a model was constructed that incorporated age (categorical, \u2264 or >5 years old) and duration of injury (continuous, in months) as covariates with OFS. Using this model, relationships between FA or MD and OFS were investigated by performing an analysis of covariance. The association between the presence of translesional fibers and OFS was evaluated by Wilcoxon rank sum. A\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered significant with adjusted\np\nvalues calculated to account for multiple comparisons using the Holm correction calculator."

    "Methods": "Animals and pharmaceuticals\nThirty-one adult male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (240\u2013400\u2009g) were used for this set of experiments. Rats were assigned to four groups: sham-vehicle (\nn\n=\u20095), sham-HupA (\nn\n=\u20096), TBI-vehicle (\nn\n=\u20095), and TBI-HupA (\nn\n=\u20096). Nine additional rats were used only for baseline recording. Animals were kept in standard cages with\nad libitum\nwater and food supply in a climate-controlled facility on a 12-h light/dark cycle. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Boston Children's Hospital and in accord with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\nThe following stock concentrations were used in the current experiments: urethane (0.2\u2009g/mL); HupA (1\u2009mg/mL); and pentobarbital (50\u2009mg/mL). HupA (99% pure; Biscayne Neurotherapeutics, Inc., Miami, FL) was dissolved in normal saline. An equal volume of normal saline was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) to the vehicle controls.\n\nFluid percussion injury\nRats were anesthetized with isoflurane (4% for induction, 2% for maintenance) before their heads were secured on the stereotactic frame. After making a 1-cm sterile midline incision, a circular 4-mm burr hole was drilled on the left posterior parietal bone, adjacent to the temporal bone and the lambdoid suture. Fluid percussion injury (FPI), modified per our previously published protocol, was induced with a fluid percussion device (AmScien Instruments, Henrico, VA).\n22\nA percussion wave of 4.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\u2009atm was delivered to the exposed dura. Rats were closely observed after FPI for the duration of apnea. Animals with less than 10\u2009sec of apnea were excluded from the study. For sham injury, a sterile incision was made and the posterior parietal bone was lightly scratched with the drill bit in a circular fashion without turning the drill on, but no craniectomy was performed.\nAfter surgical wound closure, animals were injected with urethane (1.2\u2009g/kg, i.p.) for long-term anesthesia and buprenorphine (0.1\u2009mg/kg, subcutaneously) for analgesia. Urethane was injected in 2 equal doses separated by 25\u2009min.\n\nPaired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation\nAnesthetized animals were mounted on the stereotactic frame and focal single TMS pulses were applied over the left motor cortex by a customized 70-mm figure-8 coil (40\u2009mm external diameter of each lobe) using Magstim 200 magnetic stimulators (Magstim, Wales, UK). The coil positioning and motor threshold (MT) determination were adapted from the methods described in our lab.\n23\nAfter obtaining the MT of the right brachioradialis muscle, 15 pairs of TMS pulses with 100-ms interstimulus intervals were applied at 120% MT every 20\u2009sec over 5\u2009min. Immediately after the last pair, 0.6\u2009mg/kg i.p. of HupA or saline was injected 90\u2009min post-FPI. Then, six blocks of resting (10\u2009min) and EMG recording (5\u2009min) for a total of 90\u2009min followed the injection. We previously demonstrated that 0.6\u2009mg/kg of HupA increases GABAergic transmission in uninjured rats.\n4\nIn those experiments, higher HupA doses caused cholinergic side effects (i.e., hypersalivation and muscle fasciculations), which interfered with data acquisition. We therfore used 0.6\u2009mg/kg of HupA in our experiments.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData were analyzed using STATISTICA (version 10; StatSoft, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) and SAS software (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) with the significance level of\np\n<\u20090.05. The contralateral brachioradialis MEPs were recorded for every ppTMS. Log transform of the test/conditioning MEP values were used to avoid floor effect. Hence, lower values correspond to greater cortical inhibition. We hereby present the log values as the percent cortical inhibition, that is, \u22120.25 is 25% cortical inhibition. Seven sets of MEPs were averaged for every time point (baseline, 15, 30, 45,60, 75, and 90\u2009min).\nppTMS measures among groups were compared by repeated-measures analysis of variance, with factors GROUP and TIME. To compare the baseline values for sham (\nn\n=\u200913) and verum (\nn\n=\u200918) injury groups, the Mann-Whitney U test was used. The best fit polynomial curves were generated by Microsoft Excel (2013; Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA), and the abscissas of their vertices were calculated from the quadratic polynomial equations. The time to maximum effect for each animal was compared with the Mann-Whitney U test. The chi-squared test was used to compare the cortical inhibition ratios.\nWe also built a longitudinal model using a linear mixed-effects regression model with random intercept, slope of time, and slope of time\n2\nterms to account for within-subject correlations. The model included linear and quadratic effects of time and their interactions with group to differentiate the trajectories of two groups. This model allowed us to compare the patterns in which the curves reached their peak and returned to their baseline. The final model selection was made using Akaike information criterion."

    "Methods": "Participants\nFifteen adolescents, ages 13 to 17, with SRC were recruited from clinical encounters (e.g., concussion clinic) and enrolled in this study. Inclusion criteria for the concussion group included: presence of a recent concussion (a witnessed blow to the head or body that occurred during organized sport participation with subsequent onset of at least two concussion-induced symptoms), loss of consciousness (when present) of 15\u2009min or fewer\nand\npost-traumatic amnesia of 24\u2009h or fewer, and Glasgow Coma Scores from emergency department admission (when available) of 13 to 15. Exclusion criteria for the concussion group included: history of chronic medical disorder, current inpatient hospitalization, current use of narcotic pain medicine, history of moderate or severe TBI, or history of mTBI without return to baseline. Fifteen never-concussed adolescent athletes, ages 13 \u2013 17, were also recruited using flyers, word-of-mouth, and radio advertisements and enrolled in this study. Exclusion criteria for the control group included a history of TBI, including concussion. None of the participants within the SRC or control group met criteria for pre-injury behavioral or educational diagnoses based on structured parent interview. The Johns Hopkins Medicine Institutional Review Board approved this study, written informed consent was obtained from a parent or legal guardian, and assent was acquired from adolescent participants.\n\nImaging acquisition and processing\nImaging was performed on a 3T MR system (Philips Medical System, Best, The Netherlands) using the body coil for transmission and an eight-channel head coil for reception. A 4.5-min T1-based magnetization-prepared, rapid acquisition gradient echo (T1-MPRAGE) image was first acquired for anatomical reference and spatial normalization using the following parameters: 150 axial slices, voxel size 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm\n3\n, matrix\u2009=\u2009224\u2009\u00d7\u2009224, field of view\u2009=\u2009224\u2009\u00d7\u2009180, time to repeat/echo time\u2009=\u20098.1\u2009msec/3.7\u2009msec. Pseudo-continuous ASL (PCASL) was then used to obtain estimates of resting CBF.\n18\n,\n19\nThirty-five control and label pairs of images were acquired with the following parameters: labeling duration\u2009=\u20091650\u2009msec, post-labeling delay\u2009=\u20091525\u2009msec, time to repeat/echo time\u2009=\u20094000\u2009msec/12\u2009msec, flip angle\u2009=\u200990 degrees, matrix size\u2009=\u200980\u2009\u00d7\u200980, voxel size\u2009=\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20097\u2009mm\n3\n, 17 slices, no gap, and duration\u2009=\u2009288\u2009sec.\nThe PCASL data were processed to generate CBF maps using the fully automated ASL-MRICloud tool.\n18\n,\n19\nThe ASL-MRICloud is a cloud-based tool for ASL data analysis under the infrastructure of\nMRICloud.org\n20\n,\n21\nand follows the quantification model described in the ASL white paper.\n22\nIn the automated pipeline, T1-MPRAGE was used to normalize the CBF maps into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. Anatomic ROIs, generated from the T1-based brain segmentation tool under\nmricloud.org\ninfrastructure\n20\nwere applied to yield structure-based CBF values. Considering the baseline differences across imaging sessions and across subjects, rCBF images and ROI values, normalized by the whole-brain average, were used for further analysis.\n\nStudy procedure\nAdolescents with SRC were evaluated at two time points. Neuroimaging data were acquired from 12 of the 15 eligible adolescents at Visit 1 (mean: 8.8 days post-injury; standard deviation [SD]: 3.4); two participants did not complete neuroimaging because of scanner malfunction, and one participant did not complete neuroimaging because of scheduling constraints. Neuroimaging data were acquired from 14 of the 15 eligible adolescents at Visit 2 (mean: 43.2 days post-injury; SD: 12.5), because one participant did not return for testing. Controls participants were evaluated at a single time point.\n\nCluster-based analysis\nThe Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12) second-level analyses were used to evaluate between-group differences in rCBF. Each participant's rCBF map was used in independent sample\nt\ntests to evaluate differences at Visit 1 between the SRC group and controls and at Visit 2 between the SRC group and controls. The voxel-level threshold was established at\np\n<\u20090.001, and family-wise error (FWE) correction was used for multiple comparisons at a cluster-level threshold of\np\n<\u20090.05.\n\nROI-based analysis\nThe MNI coordinates of the peak activated voxel, where cluster-level between-group differences were observed, were entered into the Wake Forest University Pickatlas toolbox\n23\n,\n24\nto identify the corresponding anatomic structures, using the Automated Anatomical Labeling Atlas.\n25\nRelative CBF values from these anatomic ROIs were entered into\nt\ntests in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) to evaluate differences between the SRC group and controls and to evaluate differences between time points within the SRC group. Control analyses, Pearson correlations, and analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs), were also completed in SPSS to ensure that neither age nor sex was influencing group differences.\n\nSymptom and rCBF analyses\nThe self-reported symptoms from the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT\n\u00ae\n:\nwww.impacttest.com\n.) fall into four categories: physical, emotional, cognitive, and sleep-related symptoms. Both the SRC group and control group were asked to report symptoms on the ImPACT.\n\u00ae\nWe divided the SRC group into a high symptom or low symptom subgroup by using the median number of symptoms in each symptom category at Visit 1 and a symptoms present or symptoms absent subgroup at Visit 2.\nFor Visit 1, participants with a symptom count greater than or equal to the median were included in the high symptom subgroup while those with a symptom count less than the median were included in the low symptom subgroup. For Visit 2, because many participants reported no symptoms in symptom categories, those who were still reporting symptoms were included into the symptoms present subgroup (individuals with one or more symptoms) and those with no reported symptoms were included in the symptoms absent subgroup. Between-group differences in rCBF were then evaluated with univariate ANCOVAs (to account for age) using a model threshold of\np\n\u2264\u20090.003 (calculated by\np\n=\u20090.05 divided by 16, the total number of ANCOVA analyses) and Bonferroni corrected pairwise comparisons."

The HPLC system was composed of Waters 1525 binary HPLC pump, Waters 2998 photodiode array detector, and a Shodex C18 column (Showa Denko America, New York, NY). The mobile phase was water:acetonitrile (60:40). The injection volume was 20\u2009\u03bcL and run time was 6\u2009min. The loading efficiency was calculated as:\nWe also evaluated the stability of Rm-PgP solution. Rm was loaded into PgP micelle solution as described above and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 6 weeks. Each week, solutions containing Rm-PgP were sampled and filtered with 0.2\u2009\u03bcm syringe filter to remove released precipitated Rm and then Rm amount was measured by HPLC as described above. The % Rm retained was calculated as:\n\nParticle size of Rm-PgP nanoparticles\nTo evaluate the effect of Rm loading, the particle size of PgP micellar nanoparticles and Rm-PgP (1\u2009mg Rm loaded in 1\u2009mg/mL PgP) micellar nanoparticles was measured by dynamic light scattering using a 90 Plus Particle Size Analyzer (Brookhaven Instruments Corporation, Holtzville, NY).\n\nRat cerebellar granule neurons isolation and culture\nPrimary cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) were isolated from 3-day post-natal (P3) Sprague Dawley rat pups. The pups were first euthanized by decapitation and the cerebella excised and placed into L-15 dissection medium. The meninges of each cerebella were removed, the tissue minced, and digested in 0.25% Trypsin in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution for 10\u2009min. Full culture medium (BME with 33\u2009mM D-glucose, potassium chloride 20\u2009mM, glutamine 2\u2009mM, penicillin/streptomycin 50\u2009\u03bcg/mL, and 10% fetal bovine serum) with 0.1% DNase was added and the digested tissue centrifuged at 1100\u2009g for 7\u2009min. After removal of the supernatant and addition of fresh culture medium, the tissue was triturated with a fire polished glass Pasteur pipet. The dissociated cells were plated at 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n5\ncells/mL in 12 well-plates that were previously coated with 0.1% poly-L-lysine overnight at 37\u00b0C followed by 10\u2009\u03bcg/mL laminin solution for 2\u2009h at 37\u00b0C. To prevent glial cell contamination and maintain purity of the CGN culture, half the media volume was exchanged after 2 days and 1\u2009\u03bcM AraC (Sigma Aldrich) added. Subsequently, half of the media volume was replaced every 2 days using full media without AraC. After 5 days incubation, the CGN cultures were used to evaluate the effect of Rm-PgP.\n\nEffect of Rm-PgP on cAMP and neurite length of CGNs cultured in hypoxia condition\nin vitro\nTo evaluate the effect of Rm-PgP on cAMP level and neuronal survival\nin vitro\n, P3 rat CGNs were cultured in hypoxia condition as an\nin vitro\nspinal injury model. CGNs were cultured under normoxia condition (normal atmosphere with 5% added CO\n2\n) for 5 days, then transferred to a hypoxia chamber (StemCell Technologies) with an atmosphere of 95% N\n2\nand 5% CO\n2\n. After 24\u2009h incubation, experimental wells were treated with Rm-PgP (10\u2009\u03bcg Rm/well). Free Rm dissolved in DMSO (Rm-DMSO, 10\u2009\u03bcg Rm/well); PgP without Rm (10\u2009\u03bcg PgP/well) was used for comparison, and untreated CGNs were used as a negative control. The cells were incubated an additional 24\u2009h in hypoxia condition and then lysed for measurement of cAMP level or fixed for neurite length evaluation. CGNs maintained through the culture period under normoxia condition were used as a positive control.\n\ncAMP measurement\nTo evaluate the effect of Rm-PgP treatment on the cAMP level of CGN cells cultured in hypoxia condition, a Mouse/Rat cAMP Parameter Assay Kit (R&D Systems) was used to evaluate the cAMP concentration of collected cell lysates according to manufacturer's instructions. Culture medium was replaced with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and CGNs were removed by scraping on ice, collected, and centrifuged. The PBS supernatant was removed and the cells re-suspended in 0.1N HCl/cell lysis buffer 5 at approximately 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n7\ncells/100\u2009uL. Following lysis, the samples were centrifuged at 600\u2009g for 10\u2009min to remove cell debris. The supernatant was collected and neutralized using 1N NaOH prior to 2-fold dilution with Calibrator Diluent RD5-55. Streptavidin-coated plates were incubated with biotinylated mouse monoclonal antibodies to cAMP, washed, and incubated with cAMP conjugate (cAMP conjugated to horse radish peroxidase) and sampled for 2\u2009h at room temperature. After washing thoroughly, substrate solution was added and incubated for 30\u2009min. The reaction was halted using an acidic stop solution and then the absorbance was measured at 450\u2009nm and 570\u2009nm. Optical density values at 570\u2009nm were subtracted from the values at 450\u2009nm to correct for background. The cAMP levels from three separate wells were averaged for each biological replicate (\nn\n=\u20093) and data presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM).\n\nNeurite length measurement\nCGNs were fixed with ice cold methanol for 5\u2009min and then rinsed with staining media (PBS with 5% bovine growth serum) and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X solution. The cells were incubated with monoclonal anti-beta-III tubulin (1:250) for 2\u2009h at room temperature, washed, and incubated for 1\u2009h with DyLight\n\u00ae\n488-conjugated secondary antibody (1:250). The wells were then digitally imaged using an Axiovert 200 inverted epifluorescent microscope (Zeiss). After imaging, the neurite lengths of CGN cells for each group (Rm-PgP, Rm-DMSO, PgP, untreated in hypoxia, and normoxia) were measured using ImageJ software for three biological replicates (\nn\n=\u20093/experiment) and data presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM.\n\nGeneration of rat compression SCI model\nAll surgical procedures and post-operative care were conducted according to National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animal (NIH publication No. 86-23, revised 1996) and under the supervision of the Clemson University Animal Research Committee (approved animal protocol no. AUP2014-012). The rat clip comprssion SCI model was generated as previously described by Gwak and colleagues.\n38\nSprague Dawley rats (male; 200\u2009g) were anesthetized under isoflurane gas, their backs shaved, and the surgical sites cleaned with chlorohexidine, betadine solution, and sterile water. To produce the injury, a 4-cm long longitudinal incision was made on the dorsal side over the mid-thoracic region revealing the spinal column. The T9 spinous process was identified and removed using orthopedic bone cutters, then the ligamentum flavum was removed to expose the intervertebral space. A vascular clip was placed on the dorsal T9 spinal cord and compressed for 10\u2009min. Following injury, the paraspinal muscles were closed with 4-0 vicryl suture and the skin was closed with surgical clip. After surgery, animals were warmed by heating blanket for recovery. Animals received cefazolin (40\u2009mg/kg; Hikma Pharmaceuticals) and buprenorphine (0.01\u2009mg/kg; Hospira Inc.) for 2 weeks after surgery and bladders were manually expressed three times daily.\n\nRetention of locally injected DiR-loaded PgP in the SCI lesion site\nWe first evaluated whether the drug-loaded PgP nanoparticles would remain in the spinal cord injury lesion after local injection or diffuse away from the injury site. The hydrophobic fluorescent dye DiR was loaded in the PgP micelle nanoparticle solution for visualization. DiR was dissolved in acetone and then added into a PgP (1\u2009mg/mL; water) solution (final concentration of 25\u2009\u03bcg DiR/mL). The acetone was evaporated overnight and then the solution was filtered with a 0.2\u2009\u03bcm syringe filter to remove precipitated DiR. After compression SCI, 10\u2009\u03bcL of DiR-PgP solution was injected into the injury site using a 26\u2009G Hamilton syringe (Hamilton\n\u00ae\n, Reno, NV). At 2, 4, 6, 24, 72, and 120\u2009h post-injection, the animals were anesthetized under isoflurane gas and imaged by a live animal fluorescence imaging system (IVIS Luminar XR; Caliper Life Sciences). At 2, 6, 24, 72, and 120\u2009h post-imaging, animals were euthanized using carbon dioxide and the spinal cord was excised (1.5\u2009cm-long piece from the center of the injury) for\nex vivo\nimaging using an IVIS Luminar XR.\n\nEffect of Rm-PgP on cAMP level in rat compression SCI model\nAfter spinal cord compression injury, 10\u2009\u03bcL Rm-PgP (10\u2009\u03bcg Rm) was injected immediately after injury into the injured dorsal T9 spinal cord using a 26-gauge Hamilton syringe. Untreated SCI and sham animal groups were used as controls. At 1, 2, 3, and 7 days post-injury, animals were sacrificed with CO\n2\noverdose and spinal cords (0.5\u2009cm-long piece from the center of the injury) were harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. For cAMP analysis, the tissue samples were weighed individually, then homogenized in 0.1N HCl/lysis buffer 5 solution at a 1/5 (w/v) ratio. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000\u2009g for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C and the supernatant was removed, neutralized with 0.1N NaOH, and then diluted 2-fold with Diluent RD5-55. Measurement of cAMP concentration was performed in the manner previously described for\nin vitro\nsamples.\n\nEffect of Rm-PgP on secondary injury in rat compression SCI model\nTo evaluate the effect of Rm-PgP treatment on apoptosis in SCI lesion site, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed using an ApopTag\n\u00ae\nPlus Fluorescein In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit. At 3 days after injury and Rm-PgP injection, the rats were anesthetized by isoflurane gas and sacrificed by cardiac perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4). The spinal cords were excised (0.5\u2009cm on either side of the injury site) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution. The fixed tissue was embedded in O.C.T. compound, sectioned longitudinally at 10\u2009\u03bcm thickness, and mounted onto positively charged glass slides. Sections approximately 30\u2009\u03bcm and 60\u2009\u03bcm lateral from the lesion epicenter (total\nn\n=\u200918 sections/group; three rats/group, six sections/rat) were stained using the ApopTag\n\u00ae\nKit and nuclei were counterstained by 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Images of the entire stained sample were captured at 50\u2009\u00d7\u2009using an AZ100 fluorescent microscope (Nikon Instruments) and the images were stitched together using Photoshop software. Additional images were obtained at 400\u2009\u00d7\u2009from the lesion epicenter and 2\u2009mm and 4\u2009mm rostral and caudal from the epicenter. The number of TUNEL and DAPI+ cells were counted for each image area using Photoshop software, and the percentage of TUNEL+ cells per DAPI+ cells were calculated. Sham animals and untreated SCI animals were used for comparison.\nTo further characterize the effect of Rm-PgP treatment on secondary injury related and apoptosis, immunohistochemical staining was performed for Bax, a pro-apoptotic marker related to permeability of the mitochondrial membrane and release of cytochrome-c, and Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic marker associated with homeostasis of the mitochondrial membrane. Sections approximately 30\u2009\u03bcm and 60\u2009\u03bcm lateral from the lesion epicenter (total\nn\n=\u2009nine sections/group; three rats/group, three sections/rat) were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-Bax (1:200; sc-23959) and rabbit polyclonal anti-Bcl-2 (1:200; sc-492), washed, and incubated with anti-mouse Cy3-conjugated (1:200; ab97035; Abcam) and AlexaFluor 488 (1:2000, A11008, Life Technologies). Sections were digitally imaged and the numbers of Bax+ and Bcl-2+ cells were counted and a ratio of Bcl-2+/Bax+ cells was calculated. Sham animals and untreated SCI animals were used for comparison.\nTo evaluate effect of Rm-PgP treatment on the inflammatory response in the SCI lesion, immunohistochemical staining for ED1 was performed on spinal cord sections from 3-day post-injury samples. Sections approximately 30\u2009\u03bcm and 60\u2009\u03bcm lateral from the lesion epicenter (total\nn\n=\u200918 sections/group; three rats/group, six sections/rat) were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-ED1 antibodies (1:200; MAB1435) for active microglia/macrophages, washed, and incubated with Cy3-conjugated secondary (1:200; ab97035; Abcam). Sections were digitally imaged as described above and the number of ED1 and DAPI+ cells were counted using Photoshop software. Cells were determined as ED1+ when the DAPI stained nucleus was completely surrounded by ED1 specific staining.\n\nStatistical analysis\nQuantitative data are presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM. The statistical significance was analyzed between groups by a Student's\nt\n-test. A\np\nvalue of less than 0.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "Participants\nThe sample was derived from participants in Project Head to Head, which enrolled patients from the ED at a tertiary care hospital that also serves as southeastern Wisconsin's only level I trauma center. Participants were enrolled from September 2012 to May 2014. They completed informed consent prior to their first evaluation and were paid $210 for their time and effort in completing the assessments. All testing procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Medical College of Wisconsin.\nIn order to identify eligible research subjects, we conducted a prospective chart review of every patient treated and released from the ED. Patients in the age range of interest (see Inclusion Criteria) who were exposed to a common cause of mTBI\n2\nwere screened in real time. Eligible causes of injury included falls, motor vehicle-traffic (MVT) crashes, assaults, and being struck by/against an object. Using 4579 charts that were screened in real time based on age and chief complaint, 2670 patients appeared eligible based on the electronic medical record review, 1058 were approached in the ED, 331 consented to be contacted with further study information, and 181 provided informed consent to participate in the study (98 of whom met criteria for mTBI, and 83 who were enrolled as trauma controls). Of these, one subject did not complete any assessment procedures, two were withdrawn after the first assessment when it was discovered that they met exclusion criteria (neurological disorder and positive head CT), and 12 were excluded because of evidence of poor effort on neurocognitive testing (see Data Analyses), yielding a final sample for analysis of 162 (89 mTBI, 73 controls). The study sample was similar in demographics to the larger population of eligible ED patients screened for inclusion in the study. In particular, the eligible patient population was 53.6% female with a mean age 29.49 years, and was distributed by cause of injury in the following manner: 73.1% MVT, 16.0% fall, 6.8% assault, and 4.1% struck by/against an object; the enrolled sample was 54.9% female with a mean age of 29.64 years, and was distributed by injury cause as follows: 63.0% MVT, 28.4% fall, 2.5% assault, and 6.2% struck/by against an object.\n\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nInclusion criteria for participation were age 18\u201345 (the age range of interest to the study sponsor), initial Glasgow Coma Scale score 13\u201315, loss of consciousness (LOC) <30\u2009min, post-traumatic amnesia <24\u2009h, absence of acute intracranial findings on brain imaging (if performed), proficiency in English, and the ability to present to the initial assessment within 72\u2009h of injury. Subjects were excluded if they had an injury that precluded participation in the study protocol (e.g., hand injury that prevented use of a computer mouse), current diagnosis of a psychotic disorder, history or clinical suspicion of other conditions (e.g., epilepsy, stroke, dementia) known to cause cognitive dysfunction, or a history of moderate or severe TBI. Early in the study, we also excluded individuals with a current diagnosis of a mood or anxiety disorder and required subjects to present to the initial assessment within 24\u2009h of injury. These criteria were relaxed in September 2013, because of suboptimal enrollment. In particular, individuals with a mood or anxiety disorder were allowed to enroll if they reported having been stable on any treatment (e.g., medication) for at least 3 months.\nSubjects assigned to the mTBI group were required to meet the definition of mTBI specified by the study sponsor, the United States Department of Defense: \u201cmTBI is defined as an injury to the brain resulting from an external force and/or acceleration/deceleration mechanism from an event such as a blast, fall, direct impact, or motor vehicle accident which causes an alteration in mental status typically resulting in the temporally related onset of symptoms such as headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness/balance problems, fatigue, insomnia/sleep disturbances, drowsiness, sensitivity to light/noise, blurred vision, difficulty remembering, and/or difficulty concentrating.\u201d\n49\nSubjects assigned to the control group had injuries other than mTBI and were excluded if they reported having had a concussion within the last 6 months.\n\nAssessment protocol\nParticipants were assessed within 72\u2009h of injury and at \u223c8, 15, and 45\u2009d post-injury. Mean (SD) time from injury to follow-up was 39.03 (21.62) h, 7.94 (1.16)\u2009d, 14.63 (1.54)\u2009d, and 43.94 (3.93)\u2009d for the 72\u2009h and the 8-, 15-, and 45-day time points, respectively. Tests were individually proctored by a research assistant in a quiet setting, nearly always with only one participant being examined at a time. The first assessment began with a one-on-one interview of contact information, demographics, and health history information followed by a neuropsychological assessment battery. Follow-up assessments began with an interview about subjects' recoveries followed by the same neuropsychological assessment battery. In order to reduce the burden on participants to travel to assessments, day 8 follow-up appointments were completed via phone and only involved assessment of recovery and Sport Concussion Assessment Tool, 3rd edition (SCAT3) symptom ratings.\nThe neuropsychological assessment battery consisted of, in order: Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR) (first assessment only);\n50\na computerized neurocognitive test (CNT); Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC)\n51\nSCAT3 symptom checklist;\n52\na second CNT, Green's Medical Symptom Validity Test (MSVT);\n53\nSatisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS);\n54\nBrief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18);\n55\nand the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS).\n56\nEach subject took two of three CNTs: Automatic Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM v. 4.3; Vista Life Sciences), Defense Automated Neurobehavioral Assessment (DANA) (United States Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery [BUMED]), and Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT, Online version; ImPACT Applications Inc.). CNT pairs were filled sequentially during the course of the study with order of administration counterbalanced across participants. These measures are described in prior publications from this study.\n57\u201360\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe primary outcome measure of interest was self-reported duration of post-concussive symptoms (in days). Potential predictors of symptom duration were extracted from the measures collected at the first (72\u2009h) assessment. Twelve subjects with suspect effort (determined by failure of one or more indices of the MSVT at this visit) were excluded from analyses, resulting in 162 subjects included in analyses. Self-reported symptom measures (SCAT3, BSI-18, SWLS, PTSD Checklist \u2013 Civilian Version [PCL-C]) and performance variables (WTAR, SAC, ANAM, DANA, and ImPACT measures) were standardized to facilitate comparisons of recovery hazards.\nTime to recovery was evaluated using a Cox proportional hazards model. Categories with low frequencies (\u201cother\u201d race category, \u201cother/unknown\u201d insurance type, learning disability, psychiatric disorder, non-migraine headache history, assault and struck by/against mechanisms of injury) were excluded from analysis. Most subjects (88.3%) could not complete the foam-surface trials of the BESS examination because of polytrauma or symptom severity; 53.1% (\nn\n=\u200986) completed the firm-surface trials (i.e., modified BESS, [mBESS]). Therefore, only mBESS score was entered as a predictor. For all models, we verified that the proportional hazards assumption was met (the mBESS score needed to be dichotomized at its median to meet this assumption). Because self-reported litigation status violated the assumption, stratified (on litigation) proportional hazard models were applied to account for nonproportionality of hazards associated with litigation.\nInitial analyses revealed distinct patterns of findings for two subsets of mTBI subjects: those with and without LOC. For this reason, the analyses presented here used a variable injury group with three levels (mTBI with LOC, mTBI without LOC, and trauma control). Because of the large number of models being estimated, \u03b1 was set to 0.01 to reduce the chances of false discoveries. Initial analyses explored single-predictor (unadjusted) models, after which multi-predictor models were fitted with any predictor with\np\n<\u20090.10 in an unadjusted model considered for each multi-predictor model. To maximize statistical power for all inferences and because the\nn\navailable for each CNT was lower than the total sample size, multivariate analyses examined the effect of each CNT (ANAM, DANA, ImPACT) variable through interactions with having taken that CNT. However, in order to verify the stability of inferences across methods, complete case analysis was also performed on the smaller data set where data from each CNT were available. Finally, as described subsequently, a set of logistic regression analyses were conducted on the major predictors identified in the Cox models to explore the predictive value of litigation status and to provide intuitive metrics of model accuracy."

    "Methods": "This study was part of the Diagnosing and Evaluating Traumatic Encephalopathy using Clinical Tests (DETECT) project, funded by the National Institutes of Health (R01 NS 078337). The main goal of this project is to develop biomarkers for thein vivodiagnosis of CTE. Details of this project and its protocol are described elsewhere.11,14,26,27The study and related procedures were approved by the Boston University Medical Center Institutional Review Board and by the Partners Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before enrollment.\n\nParticipants\nNinety-six former professional football players were included in the DETECT project. Study participants met the following inclusion criteria based on the DETECT study protocol: male, 40\u201369 years of age and a minimum of 12 years of organized football experience with at least two years of active participation in the NFL. Moreover, all participants had complaints of cognitive, mood, and behavioral symptoms for at least six months before participation, based on self-report. Potential participants with contraindications for MRI or lumbar puncture, history or diagnosis of any central nervous system disease, and English as a second language were excluded.\nAs part of DETECT, participants underwent a comprehensive assessment that included neurological as well as psychiatric examination, neuropsychological testing, standardized mood and behavior questionnaires, neuroimaging, a lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and genetic testing. The present study examines only imaging data and neuropsychological and mood and behavior measures.\nAmong the 96 enrolled subjects, 10 participants were excluded because of missing T1-weighted MRI data or poor data quality. Thus, a final sample size of 86 former NFL players was analyzed in this study (mean age: 54.9\u2009\u00b1\u20097.9 years\n)\n. For 75 former NFL players, both neurobehavioral and imaging data were available.\n\nExposure variables\nThe AFE and total years of play\nThe age participants started playing organized tackle football and the total number of years they played tackle football were reported. Both were treated as continuous variables.\n\nMRI data acquisition\nAll neuroimaging data were acquired on a 3-Tesla MRI Scanner (Verio, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) with a 32-channel head array and the Syngo MR-B17 software suite. We acquired neuroimaging data on the 3-Tesla MRI Scanner with a 32-channel head array and the Syngo MR-B17 software suite. T1-weighted images were acquired with a three dimensional magnetization-prepared-rapid-gradient-echo sequence (MPRAGE): repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u20091800\u2009msec, echo time (TE)\u2009=\u20093.36\u2009msec, voxel size\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm\n3\n, acquisition matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, flip angle\u2009=\u20097 degrees.\n\nImage processing\nImage data format was converted from DICOM to Nifti and visually inspected for quality. T1-weighted images were aligned and centered. Afterward, the T1-weighted images were automatically segmented using FreeSurfer 5.3 (\nhttp://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/\n, Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Charlestown, MA) resulting in a segmentation of the deep gray matter structures (including the thalamus) as well as a parcellation of the cortex.\n28\u201330\nThe quality of the obtained FreeSurfer segmentation and parcellation was then visually assessed. An estimated total intracranial volume was automatically calculated for each participant using FreeSurfer. Finally, bilateral thalamic volume was calculated based on the FreeSurfer label maps of the thalamus in each hemisphere (\nFig. 1\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nA three-dimensional reconstruction of the thalamus as region of interest. The model was created from one randomly selected person using the model maker module of Slicer 4.5. Blue\u2009=\u2009thalamus. The model is shown from four different views on a para-mid axial, sagittal, and coronal slice and is superimposed on the individual T1-weighted image. The label map as basis for the three-dimensional model was not modified for the image creation.\n\nNeurobehavioral outcomes: cognition, mood, and behavior\nA set of standardized assessments was administered to examine cognitive function as well as mood and behavior.\nCognitive function\nParticipants completed the following measures of cognition: Trail Making Test A and B (TMT)\n31\n; Digit Symbol Coding from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - Revised (WAIS-R)\n32\n; Digit Span from the WAIS \u2013 R\n32\n; Wisconsin Card Sorting Test\n33\n; Animal Naming,\n30\nControlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT)\n34\n; Color-Word Interference Subtest from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS)\n35\n; Boston Qualitative Scoring System (BQSS) for the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF)\n36\n; and the Story Learning, List Learning, Map Reading, and Naming Tests from the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB).\n37\nAll tests were administered by a trained research assistant under the supervision of a licensed clinical neuropsychologist. All tests were double-scored by a second trained research assistant.\nMood and behavior\nThe following self-report measures were used to assess mood and behavior: Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES),\n38\nBarratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11),\n39\nBeck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II),\n40\nBeck Hopelessness Scale (BHS),\n41\nBehavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning - Adult Version (BRIEF-A),\n42\nBrown-Goodwin Lifetime History of Aggression (LHA),\n43\nCenter for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression Scale (CES-D),\n44\nand the Buss-Durkee Inventory.\n45\nThe Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS)\n46\nand the Modified Scale for Suicidal Ideation\n47\nwere administered using a semi-structured interview by either a licensed psychiatrist or clinical psychologist.\nRaw data from the neurobehavioral measures were converted to age-, gender-, and education-corrected standardized scores, when available. Next, on the basis of conceptual and empirical grounds, we generated four factor scores from the outcome measures using principal component analyses. Alosco and coworkers\n48\nprovide a detailed account of our method for creating these factors. The factors and their constituent measures are as follows: Factor 1\u2014Mood and Behavior: AES, BDI-II, BHS, BIS-11, BRIEF-A Behavioral Regulation Index, CES-D, HDRS, LHA; Factor 2\u2014Attention and Psychomotor Speed: COWAT, DKEFS Color Word Interference (Inhibition/Switching score), TMT A and B, and Digit Symbol; Factor 3\u2014Verbal Memory: NAB Story Learning (Phrase Unit Immediate and Delayed Recall scores) and NAB List Learning (Short and Long Delayed Recall scores); and Factor 4\u2014Visual Memory: BQSS (Immediate Presence and Accuracy, and Delayed Presence and Accuracy scores).\n\nStatistical analyses\nWe used Statistical Analysis System (SAS version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc., North Carolina) for all statistical analyses. Results of our inferential tests with a\np\nvalue below 0.05 were reported as statistically significant. Both the mixed effects regression analyses exploring the relation between volume and exposure as well as the analyses investigating the association between volume and neurobehavioral factor scores were controlled for age, body mass index (BMI), and estimated total intracranial volume, adjusting for correlation of bilateral regions of interest. Moreover, the analyses exploring the relation between AFE and volume were adjusted for total years of play. Therefore, all presented results account for the positive relationship between AFE and total years of play.\nTo minimize variance, we employed a bootstrapping method.\n49\nSpecifically, we resampled 500 replicates with replacement, each with a size equal to the original sample, and we reran the mixed effect-regression model across all replicates. The resulting confidence intervals were calculated using bias-adjustment correction.\n50\nWe used the Mahalanobis distance to identify any extreme observations, but no outliers were found. Further, the variance was not found to increase with AFE. Similarly, we explored the associations between volume and the standardized neurobehavioral factor scores using mixed-effects regression models for all 75 participants with complete neurobehavioral and imaging data. We also computed partial correlations, adjusting for age, BMI, estimated total intracranial volume, and years of education."

    "Methods": "SCI\nA total of 56 adult female Long-Evans rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) weighing 225\u2013250\u2009g at the time of surgery were used in this study. Animals were maintained under environmentally controlled conditions and subjected to a 12\u2009h/12\u2009h light/dark cycle with food and water provided\nad libitum\nand acclimatized to the facility for seven days before starting the experiments. All procedure and handling techniques were in strict accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\nAnimals were randomized into one of four treatment groups (\nn\n=\u200914 per group, vehicle and three doses of NIM811) and then subjected to a spinal cord contusion injury using the Infinite Horizon (IH) Impactor device (Precision Systems & Instrumentation, Lexington, KY) by surgeons blinded to the treatment conditions. Briefly, rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (Nembutal 40\u2009mg/kg intraperitoneally, Abbott Laboratories), and the fur overlying the vertebral column shaved and a dorsal laminectomy performed at the tenth thoracic vertebra level (T10) to expose the spinal cord. The vertebral column was then stabilized by clamping the rostral T9 and caudal T11 vertebral bodies, so that the spinal cord remained in a horizontal plane.\nAll animals received a 200\u2009kdyn (impact force) spinal cord contusion using the IH impactor device at the T10 level. This injury force results in a moderate to severe contusion injury in female rats in this weight range.\n47\nImmediately after injury, the muscles and the incision site were sutured in layers, and all animals injected subcutaneously with 10\u2009mL sterile saline and intramuscularly with cefazolin 30\u2009mg/kg. Animals were then placed on a 37\u00b0C heating pad until they recovered fully from the anesthesia. Post-operative care included cefazolin injections twice a day for one week and the manual expression of bladders twice a day until reflexive voiding returned or the animal was euthanized.\n\nNIM811 administration\nNIM811 (a gift from Novartis) was administered orally as a microemulsion solution. A stock solution was made up the day of surgery by first mixing 100\u2009mg of NIM811 in 0.45\u2009L of cremaphor EL (Sigma). The resulting emulsion was then mixed with 0.4\u2009mL of corn oil (Sigma) and brought up to 1.0\u2009mL with ethanol (final stock concentration of 10%). Just before administration, the stock solution was diluted with saline into three separate vials to generate working concentrations of 10, 20, or 40\u2009mg/mL. The same solution minus NIM811 was used as vehicle. The vials were coded and the working solutions or vehicle administered using oral gavage at 1, 12, and 24\u2009h after surgery by an individual who was unaware of the vial contents.\n\nOpen-field locomotor activity\nOpen field locomotor activity was conducted using the 21 point Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) scale,\n48\nwhich is used to examine a number of conditions, including; (1) behavioral changes as a consequence of pharmacological treatments, (2) lesion severity, and (3) changes in recovery as far as 6\u20138 weeks post-injury.\n49\nAnimals were placed in an open field apparatus that consists of a circular molded plastic pool with a diameter of 90\u2009cm and a wall height of 7\u2009cm. The animals were exposed to the open field apparatus every day for 5\u2009min over a period of five days before surgery to acclimate to the apparatus. At three and seven days after injury, and then once a week thereafter, the animals were scored in the open field for a period of 4\u2009min by two examiners who were blinded to the treatment conditions.\n\nThermal hyperalgesia\nThe Hargreaves method, using an infrared plantar device (Harvard Apparatus), was used to test the effects of NIM811 treatment on recovery from below-level (hindpaw) thermal hyperalgesia after SCI. Rats were placed in a glass-bottomed Plexiglas chamber (unrestrained) every day for 15\u2009min over a period of five days to allow for acclimatization to the device. On the day before surgery, animals were placed in the same Plexiglas chamber for a period of 15\u2009min, and a moveable infrared beam was used to generate a heat source (50\u201352\u00b0C) on the plantar surface of the hindpaw. The latency (in seconds) to paw withdrawal was determined and used as the pre-injury baseline score.\nEach animal received a total of five trials with a 3\u2009min delay between each trial. The longest and shortest latencies were discarded, and the remaining three latencies scores averaged. A 30\u2009sec shutoff of the thermal stimulus was observed if no paw withdrawal occurred. The SCI animals were tested at 28 and 42 days after injury and the data expressed as percent change relative to pre-injury baseline scores. The person testing the animals on this task was blinded to the treatment conditions.\n\nBladder function\nManual expression of bladders was conducted twice a day until micturition returned or the study end-point. The post-injury time point at which animals exhibited three consecutive days of reflexive control of bladder function was identified for each animal and recorded. A group mean was calculated for each treatment condition and the data expressed as the number of days post-injury to reach reflexive control of bladder function. The person responsible for the post-operative care of the animals was unaware of the treatment conditions.\n\nTissue sparing\nAt the study end-point, rats were deeply anesthetized intraperitoneally with 100\u2009mg/kg sodium pentobarbital (Nembutal; Abbott Laboratories) and transcardially perfused with 100\u2009mL of cold 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) followed by 400\u2009mL of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The laminectomy site was reexposed, and methylene blue dye was used to mark the T10 segment, which corresponds to the injury epicenter. A laminectomy was performed from T6 to L1 to expose the spinal cord.\nEach spinal cord was transected caudally at the L1 spinal root and rostrally at the T6 spinal root. The 20\u2009cm segment of spinal cord was removed from the vertebral column and fixed 1\u2009h in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4\u00b0C and then cryoprotected for 48\u2009h in 20% sucrose in PBS at 4\u00b0C. The rostral ends of four spinal cords (one from each treatment group) were evenly aligned and placed side by side into plastic cryomolds containing tissue-freezing medium (Triangle Biomedical Sciences, Durham, NC) and the entire mold snap-frozen in cold acetone (kept on dry ice) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until sectioned on a cryostat (Microm Laborgerate, Walldorf, Germany). Serial 20\u2009\u03bcm thick cryosections, separated by 80\u2009\u03bcm (discarded), were mounted on 10 sequential pre-coated slides (Superfrost/Plus microscope slides, Fisher Scientific). Slides were then stored at \u221220\u00b0C until stained for histological analysis of the lesion epicenter and length of injury.\nA modified eriochrome cyanine (EC) staining protocol for myelin was used to differentiate between white and gray matter so that the amount of spared tissue at the injury epicenter could be calculated in sections from all groups. Briefly, air-dried sections were cleared in a graded series of ethanol and then rehydrated. Sections were then placed in a solution containing 0.4% FeCl\n3\nand 0.16% EC (Sigma) in 0.5% aqueous H\n2\nSO\n4\nfor 10\u2009min at room temperature. Excess stain was removed from the sections by washing in running tap water for 10\u2009min and then differentiated for 2\u2009min in 0.5% aqueous NH\n4\nOH. The reaction was terminated by rinsing the sections in distilled water followed by dehydration in a graded series of ethanol. The sections were then cleared and coverslipped with Permount.\nStained tissue sections were subsequently examined using a Zeiss AxioPlan microscope. Myelin staining was examined under brightfield, and images corresponding to the injury length and epicenter were captured with a Zeiss AxioCam color digital camera. All images were captured at the same lighting condition and magnification. Photomicrographs of each section were viewed with SCION Image software (NIH) and the outer border of the entire section traced (tissue + lesion). Next, the lesion was outlined, followed by any areas of intact gray matter. The area of white matter spared in each section was calculated by subtracting the area of the lesion plus remaining gray matter from the area of the entire section. The percent of spared tissue at the injury epicenter as well as the amount (mm\n2\n) of white matter present throughout the rostral-caudal extent of the injury was calculated.\n41\n,\n50\nThe lesion epicenter was designated as the section containing the largest central core lesion with the least myelin-stained tissue. The lesion extent was determined as the most rostral-caudal sections in which gross morphological changes were no longer observed with EC staining.\n51\nThe area of normal appearing tissue was divided by the cross-sectional area and multiplied by 100 to obtain the percent spared tissue. An examiner who was blinded to the treatment groups conducted the histological analysis.\n\nStatistical analyses\nAll data are reported as group means and standard errors of the mean for the different treatment groups (normality and homogeneity of variance were assumed). The data from the BBB open field locomotor task was analyzed using a repeated measures two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Tukey/Kramer\npost hoc\ntest when appropriate. The Hargreaves behavioral test and recovery of bladder function were analyzed using a two-way (treatment group\u2009\u00d7\u2009days post-injury) ANOVA followed by a Tukey/Kramer\npost hoc\ntest. Tissue sparing at the injury epicenter was analyzed using a one-way ANOVA with Tukey/Kramer\npost hoc\ntest. Analysis of the extent of white matter sparing across the different groups was performed using a two-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni-Dunn\npost hoc\ntest with corrections for multiple comparisons. In all analyses, a value of\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered to be statistically significant."

    "Methods": "This review is being prepared as a \u201cliving systematic review,\u201d initiated in the context of the CENTER-TBI project (www.center-tbi.eu).10\u201312Following a predefined protocol registered on the PROSPERO database (registration number CRD42016048154), we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.13\n\nInformation sources\nWe searched Ovid MEDLINE\n\u00ae\n(1946 to October 2016), OVID Embase (1980 to October 2016), OVID Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) Reviews (October 2016) and Cochrane Library (October 2016) for relevant studies. The search strategies used can be found in the\nsupplementary Appendix\n(see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n).\nFor possible ongoing trials and studies, we searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (searched November 2016) and\nClinicalTrials.gov\nregistry (searched November 2016). Update searches will be run every 3 months after publication, to identify new studies for inclusion in this living systematic review.\nAdditional studies were identified by reviewing the reference lists of published clinical trials and relevant narratives as well as systematic reviews. Abstracts from relevant scientific meetings were also examined, and experts in the field were consulted for any further studies.\nCitations were uploaded into a web-based systematic review program (Covidence, Alfred Health Melbourne, Australia) (\nhttp://www.covidence.org/\n).\n\nStudy selection\nTwo reviewers independently reviewed the title and abstract of each citation identified by the search strategy. In the second stage, the full text was reviewed and eligible studies selected. Any disagreement between the two authors was resolved through discussion, or where necessary, arbitration by a third party. Studies were included if the article met the prespecified list of eligibility criteria: studies enrolling adult patients presenting to the ED with a history of possible brain injury complying with any authors' definition of mTBI; report of the admission head CT findings; at least one quantitative measurement of the circulating biomarkers of interest (S100B, GFAP, NSE, UCH-L1, tau, and neurofilament proteins) on admission; and relevant accuracy data.\nWe included studies containing mixed populations; that is, participants with moderate and severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Score [GCS] <13) or pediatric populations. Studies were included irrespective of their geographic location and language of publication. We excluded studies using non-quantitative methods to assess biomarker concentrations (e.g., Western blot or explorative proteomics). Studies with small cohorts (< 50 participants) were excluded, given the high likelihood of their being underpowered and therefore impacting the reliability of findings.\n\nData extraction and assessment of methodological quality\nTwo reviewers independently extracted data using a standardized data abstraction form. We abstracted relevant information related to the study design, patient characteristics (demographic and clinical data, including indices of injury severity, presence of extracerebral injuries and polytrauma, and CT findings) and biomarker characteristics (concentrations, sampling time, cutoffs, and statistical levels of diagnostic accuracy [sensitivity and specificity]), analytical aspects of biomarker testing, and study limitations. Details regarding the definition of mTBI and CT abnormality were also extracted.\nIn the case of multiple studies from the same research group, authors were contacted to ensure that there was no overlap in patient populations. We also contacted authors for clarification of study sample, missing data, or ambiguity in the cutoffs used. If biomarker measurements were taken at multiple time points, we used the sample on admission for analysis.\nThe methodological quality of the included studies was independently assessed by two reviewers using a modified version of the tool for quality assessment of studies of diagnostic accuracy included in systematic reviews (QUADAS-2),\n14\nas recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion or arbitration by a third reviewer.\n\nStatistical analysis and data synthesis\nThe analysis includes a structured narrative synthesis. We constructed evidentiary tables identifying the results pertinent to diagnostic capabilities of the different biomarkers (detection of intracranial lesions as assessed by CT) and study characteristics for all included studies. We conducted exploratory analyses by plotting estimates of sensitivity and specificity from each study on forest plots and in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space.\nWhere adequate data were available, we performed meta-analyses for each biomarker, to summarize data and obtain more precise estimates of diagnostic performance. For studies with diverse thresholds, we meta-analyzed pairs of sensitivity and specificity using the hierarchical summary ROC (HSROC) model, which allows for the possibility of variation in threshold between studies, and also accounts for variation among studies and any potential correlation between sensitivity and specificity.\n15\nFor these analyses, we used the NLMIXED procedure in SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute 2011, Cary, NC). For studies that reported data at common prespecified cutoff values, we calculated the pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity (clinically interpretable), by undertaking a random effects bivariate regression approach.\n16\nWe explored heterogeneity through visual examination of the forest plot and the SROC plot for each biomarker. However, as there were insufficient studies, lack of individual data, and/or important variation across studies with simultaneous presence of factors with potentially diverging effects on biomarker accuracy estimates, we did not perform meta-regression (by including each potential source of heterogeneity as a covariate in the bivariate model) as planned.\nSensitivity analyses were performed to check the robustness of the results. We used Cook's distance to identify particularly influential studies, and checked for outliers using scatter plots of the standardized predicted random effects. Then, the robustness of the results was checked by refitting the model excluding any outliers and very influential studies. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted to investigate the impact on biomarker performance of studies including mixed populations, bias in the selection of participants, high prevalence of abnormal CT findings, and different definitions of TBI as assessed by CT.\nData processing and statistical analyses were conducted using Review Manager version 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark) and STATA version 13.0 (StataCorp, Colleage Station, TX) including the user written commands METANDI and MIDAS.\n\nQuality of the evidence\nThe Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE)\n17\napproach was used to assess the overall quality of evidence of the included biomarker tests. The results were summarized using GRADEPro software (Version 3.2, 2008)."

    "Methods": "Four individuals all sustained motor-complete cervical injury (C5 American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale [AIS]-B; C5 AIS-B; C5 AIS-A; C6 AIS-A) whereas the fifth was motor complete at the T2 level AIS-A (1 female), all occurring at least 3 years before the assessments. All participants were between 23 and 32 years of age and instructed to prepare for the testing day as previously described,20and provided written informed consent in accord with the University of California, Los Angeles (Los Angeles, CA) Institutional Review Board, who approved this study. Participants were tested over a 1-h protocol that consisted of at least 15\u2009min of resting in the supine position, while being outfitted with assessment equipment, followed by at least 10\u2009min of supine rest, which preceded a progressive orthostatic challenge that has been previously described and shown to be a reliable test of OH.21\n\nParticipants were asked to rank their symptoms of nausea/dizziness 1\u201310 (10 being most severe) each minute of the test. After BP decreased sufficiently to clinically indicate OH (i.e., a 20\u2009mm Hg decrease in systolic BP), transcutaneous stimulation was applied using a self-adhesive electrode with a diameter of 30\u2009mm (ValueTrode) placed on the skin between TVII and TVIII spinous processes (approximately corresponding to the T8 spinal segment) at the midline over the vertebral column as a cathode, and two 5\u2009\u00d7\u20099\u2009cm self-adhesive electrodes (ValueTrode) located symmetrically on the skin over the iliac crests as anodes. The stimulation was delivered at 30\u2009Hz as monophasic, 1-ms pulses, to provide afferent input to the region of the spinal cord where sympathetic preganglionic neuron cell bodies are located.7The current was increased from 10\u2009mA until BP was normalized, up to a maximum 70\u2009mA, and maintained for at least 1\u2009min. Electromyography (EMG) of the lower-limb skeletal muscles was also recorded to confirm that skeletal muscle contractions were not occurring and therefore the pressor responses were not attributed to the skeletal muscle pump of the venous vasculature.22Bipolar surface electrodes placed bilaterally on the vastus lateralis (VL), rectus femoris (RF), and medial hamstrings (MH), tibialis anterior (TA), soleus (SOL), and medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscles with fixed interelectrode distance of 20\u2009mm. The EMG signals were differentially amplified using the PowerLab System (PowerLab; ADInstruments, Dunedin, New Zealand) with a band-pass filter of 10\u2009Hz to 1\u2009kHz. The EMG data were digitized at a sampling rate of 4000\u2009Hz.\n\nFor each participant, brachial BP was measured (Dinamap, General Electric Pro 300V2; General Electric Tampa, FL) on the left brachial artery each minute throughout the protocol. Beat by beat blood flow velocity in the middle and posterior cerebral arteries (MCA, PCA; Transcranial Doppler, Spencer Technologies, Redmond, WA) and BP (Finometer PRO; Finapres Medicine Systems, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) were recorded and collected as previously described.20Systolic and diastolic BP (SBP, DBP), as well as peak MCA blood velocity and PCA blood velocity (MCAv, PCAv) and minimum MCAv/PCAv, were then extracted from three time points: 1) supine rest (at least 10\u201315\u2009sec of continuous resting data); 2) the three heart beats corresponding to minimum BP during the orthostatic challenge; and 3) during 10\u201315\u2009sec of stable BP during transcutaneous stimulation. From these values, mean arterial pressure (MAP) as (2*DBP+SBP)/3 and mean MCAv/PCAv as (2*MCAv/PCAv minimum+MCAv/PCAv maximum)/3 were calculated. Stroke volume, cardiac output, and cardiac contractility (dP/dt) were calculated from the BP waveform with the Modelflow method, incorporating age, sex, height, and weight (BeatScope 1.0 software; TNO TPD Biomedical Instrumentation, Milan, Italy).23Cardiac output (Q) was calculated as stroke volume (SV)*heart rate (HR). Total peripheral resistance (TPR) was calculated as MAP/Q. All hemodynamic variables were assessed using a one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni contrast tests between time points (supine, orthostatic challenge, and orthostatic challenge with stimulation). Significance was seta prioriatp<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Design and population\nThis prospective controlled cohort study enrolled a convenience sample adult patients with severe TBI from March 2007 to August 2011 presenting to two Level 1 trauma centers: Shands Hospital at University of Florida in Gainesville Florida and Ben Taub General Hospital (Baylor College of Medicine) in Houston, Texas. Patients met inclusion criteria if they were \u226518 years old with a non-penetrating head injury and had a GCS score <8 requiring the placement of an intraventricular catheter (IVC). Patients were excluded if they had a history of pre-existing end-stage organ disease or severe psychiatric illness. All patients had a CT scan done as part of their routine evaluation per hospital protocol.\n\nBiomarker sampling and analysis\nCSF samples were obtained at 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 192, 216, and 240\u2009h following TBI by collection from the IVC reservoir that had been emptied 1\u2009h prior to collection. Samples were then stored on ice for up to 12\u2009h before being centrifuged and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C as 1\u2009mL serum aliquots for future analysis at Banyan Biomarkers Inc. (Alachua, FL). Samples were measured using a standard MAP-2 sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) protocol reported in a previous study.\n7\nMAP-2 sandwich ELISA was performed using 10\u2009uL CSF for quantitative determination. Mouse MAb anti-MAP2A/2B (clone M13, Zymed #13-1500) was used as capture antibody (5\u2009\u03bcg/well) to coat the plate. Biofluid samples (10\u2009\u03bcL CSF or recombinant antigen as GST-fusion protein with residue 1078-1551 of MAP-2 at 0.10 \u2013 6.67\u2009ng/mL) were added with diluent (100\u2009uL total) to microtiter plate wells. After 2-h incubation and washing, HRP-labeled mouse monoclonal anti-MAP-2 (clone AP20; BD Bioscience; #552320) antibody was added. After washing, plates were developed with substrate solution Ultra-TMB ELISA (Pierce# 34028), stopped with acidic solution and read at 450\u2009nm with a spectrophotometer (Molecular Device SpectraMax 190). The interassay and intra-assay CV were <15% within the assay dynamic range. The upper limit of detection was 22.320\u2009ng/mL, the lower limit of detection (LLoD) 0.054\u2009ng/mL and the imputed concentration for values lower than the LLoD was 0.027\u2009ng/mL, which was half of lowest level of the LLoD.\n\nOutcome measures\nWe compared CSF levels of MAP-2 in control and TBI patients at each of the specified time-points over 10 days post-injury. The relationship between level of MAP-2 and injury severity acutely was assessed using the GCS score, the initial CT findings using the Rotterdam CT score and the Marshall classification along with early and late mortality.\nControl subjects had a normal mental status at the time of enrollment and had no evidence of acute brain injury or hemodynamic instability (\nn\n=\u200921) and they required CSF drainage for other medical conditions such as for routine anesthetic or surgical management (e.g., endovascular aortic aneurysm stent repair, selected orthopedic procedures) performed via lumbar puncture, or for chronic hydrocephalus performed via shunt tapping. The GCS score\n16\n,\n17\nwas assessed immediately post-resuscitation (measured after ventriculostomy placement) and within 24\u2009h post-injury. The initial CT scan performed in the emergency department for each patient was reviewed by a single board-certified neuroradiologist blinded to the patient's clinical examination and outcome. The principal scoring system used in the CT interpretation was the Rotterdam CT score.\n18\nThe Rotterdam CT score was developed for prognostic purposes in TBI to determine the risk for mortality. It is based on CT findings of basal cistern compression, midline shift, presence of an epidural hematoma, and the presence of either intraventricular blood and/or traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. The secondary CT scoring system used the Marshall classification.\n19\nThis classification identifies six groups of patients with TBI based on morphological abnormalities (Diffuse Injury I-IV and mass lesions).\nBecause patients were unconscious upon eligibility determination, a 24-h waiver of consent was granted by the institutional review board. If informed consent could not be obtained from a patient's legally authorized representative within 24\u2009h, samples were discarded and the patient withdrawn from the study. The study was approved by the respective institutional review boards of the University of Florida and Baylor College of Medicine, as well as the University of Houston Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData were analyzed using descriptive statistics using means, standard deviations, medians, and interquartile ranges. Data were assessed for distribution and variance before any statistical analyses were performed. Statistical comparisons of biomarker levels between various groups (post-resuscitation GCS score, Rotterdam CT score, Marshall Classification, mortality, and Glasgow Outcome Score) were performed using the Mann-Whitney\nU\nand Kruskal-Wallis tests. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to explore the diagnostic ability of the biomarker to distinguish between uninjured controls and TBI patients and also to predict mortality at 2 weeks.

Hematoxylin and eosin stains were used to visualize overall tissue morphology, and wheat germ agglutinin with 4\u20326-diamidino-2-phenylindole to visualize muscle basal lamina and nuclei for measurements of fiber cross-sectional areas (FA) and centralized nuclei (CN;\nFig. 1\n).\n19\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nHematoxylin and eosin\u2013stained sections of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle (\nA, B;\ntop row) and soleus (Sol) muscle (\nC, D;\nbottom row) in Sham-injured mice (\nA, C;\nleft column) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) mice (\nB, D;\nright column).

    "Methods": "Patient population\nPatients were children injured between 2.5 and 15 years of age, recruited from two level 1 pediatric trauma centers, Primary Children's Hospital (PCH) in Salt Lake City, UT, and University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth). PCH is the sole level 1 pediatric trauma center in the Intermountain West and serves a five-state area. UTHealth serves the Houston metropolitan region and surrounding area. Children sustaining either TBI or OI were recruited from both the Emergency Department (ED) and inpatient units of both hospitals. Children were recruited from January 20, 2013, through September 30, 2015, in two ways: families either were approached in person in the ED or hospital (PCH and UTHealth) or contacted by telephone after review of ED logs (UTHealth). Children were recruited sequentially according to child age, injury type, and TBI severity to ensure adequate representation in all age and injury group strata. Child age groups (2.5 to 5 years; 6 to 11 years; 12 to <16 years) were chosen to reflect pre-school, school-age, and adolescent developmental stages. Children with severe developmental delay or severe psychiatric disorders, defined as requiring a self-contained educational program, were excluded because of the difficulty in measuring effect of injury. Institutional review board approval was obtained from both the University of Utah and UTHealth.\n\nDefinitions\nTraumatic brain injury group\nTBI was defined according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) 2002 report as an injury to the head with observed or reported decreased level of consciousness, amnesia, and/or neuropsychological abnormality or diagnosed intracranial lesion.\n8\nTBI severity was measured by the ED Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS).\n9\nTBI severity was divided into three categories: mild, moderate, and severe. Mild TBI was defined according to CDC and World Health Organization (WHO) definitions as a GCS score of 13 or higher upon presentation to healthcare with a GCS score of 15 at discharge or after 24\u2009h if hospitalized, and one or more focal signs including a period of transient confusion, loss of consciousness for 30\u2009min or less, post-traumatic amnesia for less than 24\u2009h, and/or transient neurological abnormalities.\n10\n,\n11\nChildren with mild TBI were subclassified as complicated mild or mild based on the presence or absence of an intracranial hemorrhage diagnosed on computed tomography (CT) scan. Moderate TBI was categorized as an ED GCS score of 9\u201312. Severe TBI was categorized as an ED GCS score of 3\u20138.\nOrthopedic injury comparison group\nChildren with an upper or lower extremity long bone fracture and no head injury were recruited contemporaneously with the TBI group. OI comparisons were used to isolate the effect of TBI from the effect of being injured, and to account for pre-injury differences among injured versus uninjured children. Injury severity was measured with the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS).\n12\nForty children with OI were recruited for each age group.\n\nData sources\nAs soon as possible after injury, parents or guardians (who we will refer to as parents) were asked to complete a survey that included family demographic information such as family composition, self-identified race and ethnicity, family income category, parental education and employment, and health insurance status. Parents completed pre-injury measures of child outcomes, family functioning, and social support. Follow-up assessments were collected at 3 and 12 months. For English-speaking families, pre-injury and follow-up assessments were completed in person, online, or by telephone. Spanish-speaking families were interviewed in person or by telephone by bilingual study coordinators.\nMedical records were abstracted for clinical and injury mechanism data by trained study coordinators using a standardized data abstraction form. Trauma registrars at each institution assigned the AIS scores. CT scans were performed for clinical indication only and were read by pediatric neuroradiologists at each site. CT reports were used to subclassify the mild TBI children.\n\nMeasures\nOutcomes\nWe chose three well-validated parent report measures recommended by the National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke common data elements for TBI to examine psychosocial and executive function outcomes.\n13\nStrengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ).\n14\nThe SDQ is a 25-item behavioral screening questionnaire for children age 4\u201317 years. The SDQ has five subscales: emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity, peer problems, and prosocial behavior. Items for each scale are summed to generate a score of 0\u201310. The first four subscales are added to calculate a total difficulties score (0\u201340) with higher numbers representing more problems. For the prosocial scale, higher numbers represent better outcomes. Test-retest reliability (r\u2009=\u20090.76) and internal consistency (Cronbach's \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.80) are adequate.\n15\nChild Behavior Checklist (CBCL).\n16\nThe CBCL is a parent report questionnaire assessing internalizing and externalizing behaviors. We used the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual\n(DSM) oriented ADHD, affective disorder, and anxiety disorder scales from both the 1.5\u20135 year and 6\u201318 year forms. Each subscale provides a T-score normed for age and sex. The CBCL has excellent test-retest reliability (r\u2009=\u20090.7\u20130.8) and internal consistency (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.90\u20130.94) at one year.\nBehavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF).\n17\nThe BRIEF, a parent rating of everyday executive skills involved in behavioral regulation and metacognition, has high test-retest reliability (0.82\u20130.88). We assessed the inhibit, emotional control, working memory, and plan/organize scales and the metacognition index. The BRIEF pre-school version (BRIEF-P) for children 1.5\u20135 years provides the same scales as well as inhibitory self-control and the emergent metacognitive index. T-scores are based on normative data for age and sex.\nFamily environment covariates\nPre-injury family function was assessed using the McMaster Family Assessment Device (FAD)\u2013General Functioning Scale.\n18\nThe FAD includes 12 items scored 1\u20134 with higher scores representing worse functioning. The Social Capital Index measures a person's connection to their community including perceptions of personal, family, neighborhood, and spiritual community support.\n19\nThe index provides a total score with higher scores representing more support. Families self-reported their income category by family size, from which their poverty level was calculated using federal norms.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll children with evaluable outcomes pre-injury and at either the 3- or 12-month time-point were included in the analysis. Due to small numbers of children with moderate TBI, the moderate and complicated mild groups were combined for modeling based on prior studies showing similar outcomes.\n20\nGeneralized linear mixed models, with an unstructured covariance matrix and using the Kenward-Roger approach for testing significance of fixed effects, were fit for each outcome using SAS PROC MIXED. Potentially clinically important covariates selected a priori were initially evaluated in a model controlling for pre-injury score, injury group, time, and injury group-by-time interaction. To develop the final reported models, a \u201cfull model\u201d including all candidate covariates with\np\n<\u20090.15 in initial screening and these same four factors was iteratively reduced by removal of covariates/factors (excluding pre-injury score and main effects of injury and time) with\np\n>\u20090.1."

    "Methods": "Study design\nThis was a prospective, pilot trial in which 8 participants serving as their own controls received multi-modal exercise conditioning and rehabilitation interventions. After screening, two baseline assessments (B1 and B2, separated by 2 weeks) were performed to examine day-to-day measurement variability. No interventions occurred between B1 and B2. Participants then underwent three, 4-week-long multi-modal training programs, each separated by a 1-week period of multiple body systems assessments (E1, E2, E3; for details, see\nSupplementary Table 1\n) (see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). This design was utilized because the effect of 12-week training periods were previously published for each training modality; however, little information was available regarding the timing of changes within a 12-week training period. Each participant was in the trial for 19 contiguous weeks; it took 9 months to complete all 8 participants (grouped into two cohorts).\n\nParticipants\nInclusion criteria were a trauma-induced SCI between T2 and T12; AIS grade A or B; a minimum of 1 year post-injury; and age 18\u201360 years. Criteria for exclusion included progressive SCI; absent or intolerable painful response to electrical stimulation; history of decubiti within the preceding 3 months; diagnosis of diabetes; history of medication for diabetes, high blood pressure, or dyslipidemia within the preceding 6 months; current fracture of the lower extremities, or stabilizing instruments in the legs that prevented full range of motion; hip, knee, and ankle joints unable to support weight bearing or limited in range of motion; and history of dizziness when upright. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants according to the protocol approved by the Human Subjects Research Office at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine (Miami, FL).\n\nInterventions\nBWSTT using a treadmill-based robotic gait orthosis (Lokomat; Hocoma Inc, Zurich, Switzerland) was performed two times per week on days opposing the upper extremity CRT and the lower extremity FES cycle training. The robotic orthosis was used in conjunction with a system that supports a portion of a participant's body weight, thereby reducing the load endured by the participant's legs. Training began with participants walking at a treadmill speed of 1.2\u2009km per hour. Body weight support was adjusted to allow as much lower extremity loading as possible while maintaining normal walking kinematics (i.e., avoiding toe drag during swing or excessive knee flexion during stance). The treadmill speed was increased by 2.5% each week (provided the increased speed did not elicit greater spasticity), and the most tolerable percentage of body weight support was provided.\nUpper extremity CRT sessions were performed three times per week on nonconsecutive days for approximately 30\u201345\u2009min per session. The CRT protocol was modeled after a previously published training paradigm,\n24\nexcept participants completed two, not three, cycles of the circuit during each training session. Participants performed two sets of 10 repetitions of each weightlifting maneuver, followed by 2\u2009min of arm cranking on a stationary machine. Weightlifting maneuvers included overhead press, horizontal row, vertical butterfly, triceps dips, latissimus pulldowns, and bicep curls.\nFES cycle training on a cycle ergometer (Restorative Therapies RT300; RTI, Inc., Baltimore, MD) was used for submaximal lower extremity conditioning. Participants remained in their wheelchair and had their feet secured in a fixed\u2010angle pedal orthosis. Distance from the ergometer was set to achieve a knee angle at 15 degrees when in fullest extension. Participants cycled for 15\u2009min three times weekly on nonconsecutive days using computer-sequenced electrical current having a frequency of 35\u2009Hz, a current amplitude of 100\u2013140 miliamperes (mA), and a pulse width of 350\u2009\u03bcsec. Resistance (torque) was initially set at 0.5 Newton\u2010meters (Nm), but was increased for succeeding sessions to 2.39 and 3.6\u2009Nm when the pedal cadence of 35\u2009rpm could be independently maintained by the participant without fatigue or assistance from a motor that was interfaced with the pedal gear.\n32\nFatigue was defined by the inability to maintain a pedal rate greater than 35\u2009rpm during peak current stimulation at 140\u2009mA.\n32\nAssistive pedaling was used for participants unable to sustain 15\u2009min of continuous cycling.\nParticipants were provided with the opportunity to participate in spotter-assisted, self-driven wheelchair skills training sessions two times a week. Each session included 20\u201340\u2009min of self-guided practice. Participants could opt out of WST as they desired. Spotting was provided by nonclinically trained study staff who had been trained on spotting techniques. Study staff were provided Dalhousie University's Wheelchair Skills Training Program (WSTP)\n\u00a9\nmanual\n44\nfor guidance on how to provide WST.\n\nAssessments\nPhysical examination and medical history\nAt screening, the ISNCSCI exam was performed and the NLI and AIS grade were determined.\n39\nA physical examination verified that participants had full range of motion in the lower extremities, lacked unhealed decubiti, and exhibited no evidence of bone or joint pathology that would negatively influence participation in the interventions. Radiographical images of the lower extremities were obtained to confirm the absence of fractures, joint abnormalities, and instrumentation. Brief medical history and demographic data were collected (\nTable 1\n).\nTable\n1.\nParticipant Characteristics\na\nParticipant\nBC01\nBC02\nBC03\nBC04\nBC05\nBC06\nBC07\nBC08\nNLI, AIS grade\nT10 B\nT8 B\nT8\u2009A\nT6\u2009A\nT5\u2009A\nT2 B\nT5 B\nT2\u2009A\nSex\nF\nM\nM\nF\nM\nM\nM\nM\nAge\n23\n52\n26\n47\n20\n28\n36\n19\nEtiology of injury\nMVA\nMVA\nFall\nMVA\nMVA\nMVA\nViolence\nMVA\nYPI\n2\n25\n1\n26\n5\n1.5\n21\n2\nRace\nCaucasian\nHispanic\nHispanic/AA\nCaucasian\nHispanic/AA\nAA\nCaucasian\nHispanic\nMarital\nMarried\nSingle\nSingle\nMarried\nSingle\nSingle\nMarried\nSingle\nEmployment\nUnemployed\nFull-time\nUnemployed\nFull-time\nFull-time\nUnemployed\nFull-time\nUnemployed\nChange from baseline to E3\nPGIC\n\u2191\u2191\u2191\n\u2191\u2191\u2191\n\u2191\u2191\n\u2191\n\u2191\u2191\n\u2191\u2191\n\u2191\n\u2191\u2191\u2191\nSCIM III\n\u2191\n\u2194\n\u2194\n\u2194\n\u2194\n\u2194\n\u2194\n\u2194\nPain\nN/A\n\u2194\n\u2194\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n\u2194\nN/A\nW/C skills capacity\n\u0394 in score\n\u0394 in category\n\u2194\n(+6.3%)\n\u2191\n(to above 75%)\n\u2194\n(\u22123.1%)\n\u2194\n(above 75%)\n\u2193\n(\u22127.8%)\n\u2193\n(to below 75%)\n\u2194\n(\u22123.1%)\n\u2194\n(below 75%)\n\u2194\n(0.1%)\n\u2194\n(above 75%)\n\u2193\n(\u22127.8%)\n\u2194\n(below 75%)\n\u2194\n(\u22123.1%)\n\u2194\n(above 75%)\n\u2193\n(\u221210.9%)\n\u2193\n(to below 75%)\nUE strength\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\u2191\nFitness category\n\u2194\n(Excellent)\n\u2191\n(Fair to average)\n\u2194\n(Average)\n\u2191\n(Fair to average)\n\u2191\n(Average to good)\n\u2194\n(Poor)\n\u2194\n(Good)\n\u2191\n(Poor to average)\nMAS\n\u2194\n(+1)\n\u2191\n(+2.5)\n\u2194\n\u2194\n\u2191\n\u2194\n(+1)\n\u2194\n(+1)\n\u2194\nSCATS\n\u2191\n\u2194\n\u2194\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\u2194\n\u2194\n\u2194\nFSE pendulum (degrees)\n\u2194\n(+7)\n\u2194\n(+2)\n\u2194\n(\u22128)\n\u2194\n(\u22124)\n\u2191\n(+33)\n\u2191\n(+20)\n\u2194\n(\u22128)\n\u2194\n(\u22125)\nSL H/M ratio\n\u2194\n\u2194\n\u2194\n\u2194\n\u2194\n\u2193\n\u2194\n\u2194\nSL H-depression\n\u2193\n\u2193\n\u2193\n\u2194\n\u2194\n\u2193\n\u2191\n\u2194\nSL F/M ratio\n\u2193\n\u2194\n\u2193\n\u2194\n\u2194\n\u2194\n\u2193\n\u2194\nTA F/M ratio\n\u2193\n\u2194\n\u2193\n\u2193\n\u2194\n\u2194\n\u2193\n\u2193\nOpen in a separate window\na\nIncluding neurological level of injury (NLI) and American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale (AIS) grade, sex, age, etiology of injury (motor vehicle accident\u2009=\u2009MVA), years post-injury (YPI), race (African American\u2009=\u2009AA), marital status, and employment status. Changes from baseline (average of baseline 1 [B1] and baseline 2 [B2]) to evaluation 3 (E3), including overall patient global impression of change (PGIC), spinal cord independence measure (SCIM) III total scores, wheelchair (W/C) skills capacity including change (\u0394) in score and category, upper extremity (UE) strength, fitness category, modified Ashworth scale (MAS), spinal cord assessment tool for spastic reflexes (SCATS), pendulum first swing excursion (FSE) of more spastic leg, soleus (SL) H/M ratio, SL H-depression, SL F/M ratio, and tibialis anterior (TA) F/M ratio.

Heart rate (HR) was measured by 12-lead electrocardiography using standard limb and precordial leads. Participants performed an arm-cycling exercise test, which mirrored previously published graded exercise tests (GXTs)\n24\n,\n45\nwith the exception of the workload increasing by 30 watts for each subsequent 3-min stage.\n24\nCriteria for terminating the test corresponded with American College of Sports Medicine guidelines (10th ed.) and included volitional fatigue or inability to maintain cadence at or above 55 revolutions per minute.\n46\nUpper extremity muscle strength\nMaximum upper extremity dynamic strength was assessed using an Equalizer 7000 Multi-Station Exercise System (Helm; Bozeman, MT) following a previously published protocol for testing isoinertial strength.\n24\nSix different weightlifting maneuvers (overhead press, horizontal row, vertical butterfly, triceps dips, latissimus pulldowns, and bicep curls) were tested once per assessment period. One repetition-maximum (1-RM) for each maneuver was calculated using the Mayhew regression equation.\n47\nWheelchair skills\nThe WST\n\u00a9\nfor Manual Wheelchair users, Version 4.2,\n48\nwas utilized to assess personal mobility skills.\n49\n,\n50\nThe 32 skills evaluated in the WST include indoor mobility skills (e.g., forward propulsion, backward propulsion, and turning) community mobility skills (taking wheelchair apart, level transfers, and gentle slope ramps), and advanced skills (e.g., wheelies, steep ramps, high curbs, and floor-to-chair transfers). According to published guidelines, each skill was scored as 0 (Fail), 1 (Pass with difficulty), or 2 (Pass) and a WST total score was calculated.\n50\nFor reporting purposes, participants were classed as low (WST total score \u226475%) or high skilled (WST total score >75%)\n35\nand a change in WST total score was considered meaningful at \u22657%.\n37\nChanges <7% were classed as \u2018no change\u201d (\u2194).\nCardiovascular function\nA progressive head-up tilt (HUT) test assessed variability in blood pressure and HR in response to changes in body position. Participants were transferred to a motorized table, placed in the supine position, and secured with Velcro straps. A manual blood pressure cuff was fitted on one arm, and a heart monitor (Polar CS600X; Polar Electro Inc., Lake Success, NY) was secured to the chest. The testing protocol used two, 10-min periods of supine rest, a 5-min period of 20-degree HUT, a 5-min period of 40-degree HUT, and a 10-min period of 60-degree HUT. HR data were monitored continuously, and blood pressure data were collected during the last 2\u2009min of each tilt period.\nBlood tests\nAntecubital venipuncture was performed to acquire fasting blood samples, followed by an oral glucose tolerance test. Serum collection and analysis techniques mirrored a previously published protocol.\n51\nlood sampling included an inflammatory panel testing C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6, in addition to lipid and glycemic panels.\n51\nLow-density lipoprotein was computed using the equation of Friedewald.\n52\nSpasticity measures\nBiomechanical/clinical\nClonus, flexor, and extensor spastic reflex activity was measured clinically using the Spinal Cord Assessment Tool for Spastic reflexes (SCATS).\n53\nBilateral scores were summed (range, 0\u201318) and reported as a composite score.\n54\nStretch reflex responses of the hamstring and quadriceps muscles was measured using the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS).\n55\n,\n56\nScores were determined bilaterally, summed (range, 0\u201320) and reported as a composite score.\n54\nSpastic activity in the quadriceps muscles in response to rapid, gravity-induced stretch was assessed using the pendulum test.\n57\nKinematic data related to the pendulum test were captured according to previously published protocols\n58\u201360\nusing a 60-Hz, eight-camera, three-dimensional motion capture system (Peak Motus\n\u00ae\nSoftware; Peak Performance, Centennial, CO). The examination table was positioned in the center of the capture area so that the length of the table was in the x-direction, and the participant was positioned in the supine position with the popliteal fossa 3 in beyond the end of the table. Reflective markers were placed on the greater trochanter, lateral knee, lateral malleolus, lateral calcaneus, and the metatarsal-phalangeal joint of the fifth toe. The knee of the tested limb was extended passively, and upon initiation of motion capture, the tested limb was released. The knee angle related to the first swing excursion (FSE) was identified using a custom script (MATLAB\n\u00ae\n; The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA). FSE for the more spastic leg was averaged over three trials.\nElectrophysiological\nEMG activity was recorded from soleus (SL), tibialis anterior (TA), rectus femoris (RF), and the biceps femoris (BF) muscle in the leg that participants reported was most prone to muscle spasms using electrodes placed 5\u2009cm apart (for further details, see Mayo and colleagues\n61\n). The peak-to-peak amplitude of the maximal compound action potential (M-wave) was measured for SL, TA, and RF in response to supramaximal stimulation (intensity \u223c20% beyond that which evoked a maximal response; 50- or 200-\u03bcs pulse width) of the tibial, common peroneal, and femoral nerves, respectively, as an indirect measure of muscle strength.\n62\nValues were normalized to uninjured data to show the amount of muscle atrophy.\n61\nThree physiological assessments of spasticity were made: 1) the SL maximal H-reflex to maximal M-wave ratio (H/M ratio), a measure of reflex excitability of the motoneurons; 2) SL H-reflex depression in response to 1\u2009Hz compared to 0.125-Hz stimulation of the tibial nerve, an indication of post-activation depression of the 1a-motoneuron synapse and one measure of spinal inhibition\n63\n; and 3) SL and TA F-wave to maximal M-wave area ratios (F/M area), a measure of motoneuron excitability.\n64\nEach participant was also asked to contract the SL, TA, RF, and BF muscles voluntarily for 3\u20135\u2009sec, in response to an auditory cue from a computer. Three attempts were made, 1\u2009min apart. No voluntary EMG was generated in any of the muscles, confirmation that all of these leg muscles were paralyzed completely by the SCI.\nDay-to-day variability was 8%, so differences that exceeded a +10% or \u221210% change from the baseline (M-waves) or a given scale (H/M ratio, H-reflex depression) were designated an increase or decrease in response to exercise, respectively. For example, a baseline H/M ratio of 0.5 had to reach \u22650.6 or \u22640.4 to indicate an increase or decrease attributed to exercise, respectively. Given that F/M area ratios rarely exceeded 0.10 but can reach 1.0, a 1% increase or decrease was considered a change attributed to exercise. Spearman rho correlations were analyzed for baseline physiological parameters and the differences in physiological parameters, clinical measures of spasticity (Pendulum, SCATS scores, and MAS measures for the side we used), and the global impression of change for spasticity at E3.\nPain and pain-related sensory function\nParticipants underwent a structured pain history interview based on the International SCI Pain Basic Dataset,\n65\nwhich contains core questions for up to three separate pain problems (worst, second worst, and third worst) specifically regarding the time frame \u201cpast week.\u201d Additionally, the severity of neuropathic pain symptoms were also assessed in face-to-face interviews using the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory.\n66\nParticipants were also asked: \u201cOverall, how hard is it for you to deal with your pain?\u201d on a scale from 0 to 10 (0\u2009=\u2009not hard at all; 10\u2009=\u2009extremely hard). This question was intended to give the participant the opportunity to rate his or her pain in a \u201cglobal\u201d sense, that is, to incorporate practical and emotional aspects of dealing with pain.\n41\nThe quantitative sensory testing assessment was designed to assess the integrity of dorsal column-medial lemniscus (mechanical stimuli) and anterolateral spinothalamic (noxious and thermal stimuli)-mediated function/dysfunction. Consistent with our previous protocols,\n67\nsensory thresholds were measured in painful and nonpainful areas in dermatomes both at- and below-level of injury. Dynamic mechanical allodynia, thermal allodynia, directional cutaneous kinesthesia, graphesthesia, and mechanical wind-up pain were measured, if present.\nSelf-reported function\nThe Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) Version III was used to measure functional mobility and independence.\n68\n,\n69\nTotal scores at B1 and B2 were averaged and reported as single baseline scores, which were compared to scores obtained at E3. An improvement of 4 points in overall score represented a \u201csmall significant improvement,\u201d whereas an improvement of 10 points was required to obtain a \u201csubstantial improvement.\u201d\n70\nThe International Spinal Cord Injury (ISCI) Lower Urinary Tract Function Basic Data Set was used to monitor bladder function,\n71\nand the ISCI Bowel Function Basic Data Set was used to monitor bowel function and daily bowel habits.\n72\nA 7-point Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale was utilized at the completion of the study to assess participants' subjective perceptions of overall change regarding strength, energy and endurance, spasticity, pain, sensation, wheelchair mobility, mood, bowel function, bladder function, and sleep.\n73\n\nStatistical analyses\nAll data were analyzed initially. Interim data at E1 and E2 were either unchanged and remained unchanged at E3 or were changing at E1, E2, and E3. As a result, a decision was made to present the data as the average of the two baselines (B1 and B2) compared to E3. Because of a small number of participants and a great variety of assessments, much of the data were only analyzed descriptively as described in the individual sections above.\nThe combined baselines versus E3 for VO\n2\npeak and the blood biomarkers were analyzed using a paired\nt\n-test. For the 1-RM strength measures, we converted the resistance to a percent score (relative to the combined baseline values), which was aggregated across all exercises before running the\nt\n-test. In this way, we negated the issue of overweighting exercises for larger muscle groups. For the blood pressure values during the HUT procedure, we ran a 2 (combined baselines vs. Evaluation 3) by 6 (tilt segments) analysis of variance with repeated measures. The post-hoc individual contrasts are without adjustment. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare differences between participants with chronic pain and those with no chronic pain because the values were not normally distributed. Associations between baseline physiological measures of spasticity and the differences in these physiological parameters, clinical measures of spasticity (pendulum, SCATS scores, and MAS measures for the side we used), and the global impression of change for spasticity at E3 were analyzed using Spearman rho correlations."

    "Methods": "Survey development\nThe ISCoS 2013 workshop identified the following key themes for international collaboration: 1) breaking down funding barriers; 2) improving communication and transparency; and 3) finding future innovative solutions for collaborations. Using these key themes, expert input, and a literature review of relevant studies, the authors developed a 50-question survey. The survey consisted of five parts: 1) current barriers to international collaboration; 2) current facilitators of international collaboration; 3) proposed initiatives to facilitate future international collaboration; 4) SCI-specific international standards and data sets; and 5) demographics and expertise of the participant. (For the complete survey, see the online\nSupplementary Material\nat\nwww.liebertpub.com\n). Parts 1, 2, and 3 included questions with five response options that ranged from \u201cstrongly agree\u201d to \u201cstrongly disagree.\u201d Participants who identified as having no experience with international collaborations were directed to skip part 1. Parts 4 and 5 of the survey included questions regarding the participants' use of the International SCI Standards and Data Sets and about their educational and research/clinical background, respectively. Many questions included a comments box for free text. The survey was tested for clarity by members of the research team. Three individuals with varying amounts of international expertise in conducting SCI research also piloted the survey and provided feedback.\n\nParticipants\nIndividuals were eligible to participate in the survey if they fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: 1) were 18 years or older at the time the survey was conducted; 2) had worked in either SCI clinical practice or SCI research; and 3) understood written English. Respondents were recruited through email invitations and newsletters sent to members, subscribers, collaborators and partners of various SCI organizations (e.g., Rick Hansen Institute; Ontario Neurotrauma Foundation; Institute for Safety, Compensation and Recovery Research; ISCoS). Flyers advertising the survey were also distributed at relevant conferences. Participants were offered the chance to be included in a draw for three $25.00 (CAD) gift certificates if they completed the survey. Ethical approval to conduct this study was obtained from the Veritas Independent Review Board.\n25\n\nData collection\nData collection was performed by the Mustel Group,\n26\na market research organization that specializes in online surveys. The survey data were collected using a web-based format. Materials were available in English. Demographic information and expertise (both with SCI and international collaborations) were monitored in an attempt to minimize any sampling biases and ensure representation from diverse backgrounds and regions.\n\nAnalysis\nData from the survey were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The top barriers, facilitators and initiatives were determined by adding together the percentage of participants who \u201csomewhat agree\u201d and \u201cstrongly agree.\u201d Barriers that were potentially modifiable by an international initiative (e.g., a new funding opportunity), in contrast to a barrier that is specific to a particular country (e.g., language, privacy regulations) and cannot be easily influenced by an international initiative from an external organization, were identified by the authors. The comments in parts 1, 2, and 3 were reviewed for each question. The comments in part 4 describing why participants did not use the International SCI Data Sets or Standards were grouped into the following categories: inaccessibility, capacity (e.g., personnel/funding/time constraints), lack of knowledge/training, unmet research needs, lack of opportunity, not relevant to their type of research, not part of their role in the study, unnecessary for their study, and \u201cother.\u201d The countries of residence of the participants were grouped into the following geographical regions: Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania."

    "Methods": "Study design\nThe primary objective of this study was to characterize the post-injury microglial/macrophage response to TBI at both acute and chronic time points in the presence or absence of wild-type human tau. Separate groups of hTau and B6 mice were used for acute and chronic studies. Each subject was randomized to the TBI or sham group following surgical preparation. A separate investigator blinded to experimental group performed subsequent data analysis. All subjects surviving to 3 or 135 DPI were included in data analysis, and no outliers were excluded.\n\nMice\nThe hTau mouse model of tauopathy was utilized to characterize recovery following TBI.\n15\nTwo-month-old hTau mice (mixed sex;\nn\n=\u200910\u201312 mice per group) maintained on the C67BL/6J genetic background were used for all studies. Age- and sex-matched B6 animals served as controls for all studies. Animals were housed at the Cleveland Clinic Biological Resources Unit. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Cleveland Clinic approved all animal procedures.\n\nSurgical preparation and injury\nAll surgical procedures were completed as previously described.\n25\nBriefly, 2-month-old hTau and B6 mice were anesthetized with a combination of ketamine (100\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg) before being placed in a stereotaxic frame. Bupivicaine (0.25%, 50 \u03bcl) was delivered subcutaneously before midline incision. A 3.0\u2009mm craniotomy was trephined over the right parietal cortex midway between bregma and lambda, leaving the dura intact. A modified Leur Lock syringe (3.0\u2009mm inside diameter) was placed over the exposed dura and held in place by cyanoacrylate adhesive. Mice were placed on a heating pad to recover following surgical preparation. Once animals regained normal ambulatory behavior, they were placed in their home cage overnight. Twenty-four hours after surgical preparation, all mice were anesthetized with the same combination of ketamine and xylazine and connected to the fluid percussion injury (FPI) device (Amscien Instruments, Richmond, VA). A moderate level FPI (mean\u2009=\u20091.0\u2009atm of extracranial pressure) was delivered to animals in the TBI group. Animals in the sham group were connected to the injury device; however, no fluid pulse was delivered. The syringe and adhesive were removed from the skull following FPI or sham injury, and the incision was sutured closed. All animals recovered on a heating pad before being placed in their home cages. Mice were euthanized at either 3 DPI or 135 DPI (1 week after completion of spatial memory testing in the water maze).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nHalf of the mice in each group (\nn\n=\u20095\u20136 per group) were deeply anesthetized with ketamine (100\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with ice cold 0.1\u2009mol/L sodium phosphate buffer at 3 DPI and 135 DPI. Whole brain samples were removed from the cranium and drop-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and stored at 4\u00b0C. Following cryoprotection in 30% sucrose/PBS, brains were embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound and subsequently cut into free floating 30\u2009\u03bcm coronal sections for neuropathological analysis. The following dilutions were used for primary antibodies: CD45 (Serotec) 1:500; F4/80 (Serotec) 1:500; CD68 (Abcam); AT180 (pThr231, Pierce); all incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to biotin (Vector Laboratories; 1:200). Sections incubated with Avidin/Biotinylated enzyme complex (ABC reagent, Vector Laboratories; for immunohistochemistry) reagent for 1\u2009h at room temperature following by 3-3\u2019-diaminobenzidine (DAB; Vector Laboratories) until a brown reaction was observed. Silver staining was performed on 30\u2009\u03bcm coronal brain sections using a commercially available FD NeuroSilver II kit according to manufacturer's instructions.\n\nIsolation of microglia and monocytes and flow cytometry\nAt 135 DPI, mice from each experimental group were deeply anesthetized with ketamine (100\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg) and transcaridally perfused with 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS). Brains were removed, chopped, and digested using the Macs Neural tissue dissociation kit (Miltenyl Biotec). Following a wash, digested tissue was resuspended in 30% Percoll and overlayed with 1\u2009mL of 10% fetal bovine serum in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-media. Samples were placed in a centrifuge for 15\u2009min at 800\ng\nwith no brake. Myelin and buffer were aspirated off the cells of interest, which settled at the bottom of the tube during centrifugation. Finally, the cells were resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS containing bovine serum albumin [BSA] and sodium azide)/Fc block for 5\u2009min at room temperature. The following antibodies were used for cell surface staining of isolated microglia and monocytes: anti-mouse CD45-APC (BioLegend, 1:500), anti-mouse CD11b-BV605 (BioLegend, 1:100), and anti-mouse Ly6C-FITC, 1:100). Flow cytometry was performed with a BD LSR Fortessa (BD Bioscience) and analyzed using FlowJo software (version 9.3.1, TreeStar, Inc. Ashland, OR).\n\nBehavioral assessment\nAll behavioral tests were completed as previously described.\n26\nRotarod\nBalance and coordination was assessed with a standard rotarod test (Rotamex, Columbus Instruments). All mice received baseline training before surgical preparation, and post-injury testing was completed at 1, 3, 6, 30, 60, and 90 DPI. Each testing day included three 5-min trials in which rod rotation increased from four rotations per minute (RPM) to 30 RPM. Average latency to fall was calculated for each testing day and compared between groups.\nY maze\nTime-dependent changes in spatial working memory were evaluated in the Y maze. Briefly, each mouse completed one 5-min trial at 7, 30, 60, and 90 DPI. Following placement in the center of the maze, a mouse had free access to all three arms. Total arm entries and spontaneous alternation among arms was recorded for each testing day and compared between groups.\nWater maze\nA standard version of the water maze was used to assess spatial learning and reference memory beginning 120 DPI. During visible platform training, animals were placed in the pool at one of four start locations and given 60\u2009sec to locate a visible goal platform that was placed in a new location for each trial. After 3 days of training, the water level was increased 2\u2009cm to \u201chide\u201d the goal platform, which then remained in the same location for 5 days of memory testing. Constant spatial cues around the pool served as guides for the animals to locate the submerged goal platform. Animals remained on the platform for 15\u2009sec after 60\u2009sec elapsed, or after they located the platform on their own. A single probe trial, in which the goal platform was removed, was completed at 129 DPI \u223c24\u2009h after the last memory trial. Mice were euthanized the following week at 135 DPI. All trials were analyzed with EthoVision XT (Noldus) video tracking software. Primary dependent variables of interest were latency to reach the goal platform, time spent in each quadrant, and swim speed. Swim pattern was subsequently analyzed by an experimenter blinded to experimental groups, and based on previously reported strategies that included identification of spatial, non-spatial, and circling search strategies.\n27\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analysis was completed with GraphPad Prism 6.07 or IBS SPSS Statistics 24. A mixed model factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate group differences. ANOVA with repeated measures was used to classify group differences in behavioral tests. The between-group factors were genotype and injury, and the within-group factor was day of testing. Main effects and interaction effects were considered. Two-tailed Students\nt\ntest was utilized for post-hoc comparison of the main effect(s) between B6 and hTau mice.\nt\ntest with Welch's correction was incorporated to address comparisons in which the two samples had unequal variances or an unequal number of samples. Statistical significance was determined at\np\n<\u20090.05. All data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM)."

    "Methods": "Population\nSubjects were identified from the University of Pittsburgh Brain Trauma Research Center (Pittsburgh, PA) following approval by the local institutional review board. Informed consent was obtained from the subjects' surrogates before data collection. Criteria for inclusion were: age 16 and older; Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8 or less in the absence of medications known to affect GCS; and external ventricular drain (EVD) placement. To diminish the risk for population stratification skewing results, only white subjects were included in the final analysis. Patients with penetrating trauma and those with previous neurological impairment were excluded. Two independent cohorts were identified to provide a cohort for discovery and replication. Cohorts were built by date of injury (separated by approximately 4 years) from the same clinical site. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores were collected by qualified neuropsychologists 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post-injury. The GOS ranges from 1 to 5, where a score of 1 corresponds to deceased, 2 corresponds to a patient in a persistent vegetative state, 3 corresponds to a patient with severe disability, 4 corresponds to a patient with minor disability, and 5 corresponds to little or no disability.\n14\nTo control for injury characteristics based on pathoanatomical data, computed tomography imaging data were reviewed for hemorrhage types associated with the injury. Patients were coded based on the presence or absence of one or more of the following: epidural hematoma; subdural hematoma; subarachnoid hemorrhage; intraparenchymal hemorrhage; intraventricular hemorrhage; and/or evidence of diffuse axonal injury.\n\nGenotyping\nDNA was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples taken from the EVD or from blood samples using a commercially available kit (Qiaamp kit; Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Genotyping for\nABCG2\nc.421C>A was performed with a TaqMan\u2122 allelic discrimination assay for the discovery cohort (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and a mix of TaqMan + Illumina Human Core Exome v1.2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) for the replication cohort. Genotype data quality were addressed by using technical replicates, blinded double calls of raw data, assessment for significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and compared with published genotype frequencies for the non-Finnish European population from the Broad Institute's gnomAD Browser.\n15\n\nStatistical analysis\nDemographic data for the discovery and replication cohorts were compared using the\nt\n-test, chi-square test, or Fisher's exact test. All genetic association studies were carried out using a dominant variant allele model (i.e., phenotype magnitude in CC < CA/AA). Subjects with missing hemorrhage-type data were coded with a dummy variable to account for the missing data while avoiding list-wise exclusion. To determine the association of\nABCG2\nc.421C>A with outcomes, GOS score was treated as an ordinal variable\n16\nand compared with mixed-effect multiple ordinal regression using the package Ordinal for R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).\n17\nThe assumption of proportionality of odds was tested by first dichotomizing GOS along four possible cut points [1|2-5, 1-2|3-5, 1-3|4-5, and 1-4|5], then controlled for age, sex, time, post-injury imaging determined hemorrhage types, and GCS with random effects of subjects with mixed-effects binomial logistic regression using the LME4 package for R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).\n18\nFinally, estimated 95% confidence intervals were compared for all coefficient estimates for each break point. The model was controlled for time post-injury, age, sex, time post-injury, imaging determined hemorrhage types, and GCS. Skewed continuous variables were log-transformed to improve model fit. Significance for random effects were determined with analysis of variance of a mixed model and a standard model excluding the random-effect variable. Results are presented as model parameters and odds ratios, where appropriate, which correspond to the odds of being in any higher GOS level. All statistical analyses were carried out using R software (v3.3.1; R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria)."

The AB persons were selected to match sex as well as approximate age and body type. All subjects provided written informed consent approved by the Emory University Institutional Review Board (IRB protocol IRB00044670) before study participation.

We excluded persons with brain injury or cognitive impairment impacting the ability to follow simple commands, progressive SCI, other concurrent severe medical conditions, or severe weight-bearing pain that limited walking ability.\nTable\n1.\nDemographical Information\nParticipants\nAge (y)\nSex\nLevel of injury\nYears since injury\nAssistive device\nLEMS (L/R)\nSS cadence (steps/min)\nNo AD Group\niSCI01 (AB02)\n56 (55)\nM\nC3\n19\nNone\n24/24\na\n93 (110)\niSCI02 (AB10)\n68 (58)\nM\nC4\n13\nNone\n23/20\n100 (100)\niSCI03 (AB05)\n41 (26)\nM\nC5\n1\nNone\n22/23\n111 (98)\niSCI04 (AB25)\n67 (63)\nM\nC6\n6\nNone\n25\na\n/25\n94 (112)\niSCI05 (AB23)\n20 (22)\nM\nC4\n2\nNone\n16/24\n74 (107)\niSCI06 (AB22)\n60 (54)\nM\nC6\n1.5\nNone\n25/24\n68 (95)\niSCI07 (AB11)\n37 (32)\nM\nC8\n20\nNone\n25/24\n110 (132)\nMean\n49.9 (44.3)\n8.9\n92.9 (107.7)\nAD Group\niSCI08 (AB03)\n31 (21)\nM\nC8\n12\nLofstrands\n11/12\n56 (112)\niSCI09 (AB08)\n41 (40)\nM\nC5\n16\nLofstrands\n12/23\n33 (127)\niSCI10 (AB14)\n58 (54)\nM\nC4\n40\nLofstrands\n20/21\n69 (118)\niSCI11 (AB18)\n47 (40)\nM\nC5\n31\nCane\n19/23\n76 (109)\niSCI12 (AB12)\n34 (34)\nF\nC6\n1\nLofstrands\n24/22\n66 (108)\niSCI13 (AB19)\n58 (56)\nM\nC4\n29\nRolling walker\n10/16\n41 (107)\niSCI14 (AB20)\n29 (33)\nF\nT4\n18\n4 wheel walker\n15/14\n64 (105)\niSCI15 (AB21)\n67 (72)\nM\nC5\n1\nLofstrands\n24\na\n/24\n36 (99)\nMean\n45.6 (43.8)\n18.5\n55.1 (110.6)\nOpen in a separate window\nLEMS, lower extremity motor score; SS, self-selected; iSCI, incompl\u00e8te spinal cord injury; AD, assistive device; C, cervical; T, thoracic.\na\nMore impaired leg.\n\nClinical assessments\nInjury severity, lower extremity strength and spasticity, and walking speed were assessed using standardized clinical measures. The AIS was used to categorize neurological injury level and completeness.\n24\nLower extremity strength was assessed using the Lower Extremity Motor Score (LEMS) from the AIS, and spasticity was measured using the Spinal Cord Assessment Tool for Spastic Reflexes (SCATS).\n25\nThe 10-Meter Walk Test (10MWT) was used to assess fast walking speed,\n26\nwith the average of three trials used for analyses. The SCI Functional Ambulation Inventory (SCI-FAI) was used to identify clinically observable gait deficits.\n27\nParticipants performed walking tests with the AD they typically used for community walking.\n\nEquipment\nSubjects walked over a 0.1\u2009m raised, level floor that included two embedded six-degrees-of-freedom force plates (AMTI OR6-7-2000; Advanced Mechanical Technology Inc., Watertown, MA) located equidistant from markers at either end of an 8\u2009m walkway.\n28\nA metronome placed approximately 2\u2009m from the walkway provided auditory cues for cadence matching. The GRFs were amplified using two AMTI signal conditioners (MSA-6, Gen-5). The AMTI MSA-6 used a two-pole, low-pass 1\u2009kHz filter, and the AMTI Gen-5 used a 1\u2009kHz anti-aliasing filter. The output of the amplifiers was then sampled at 2.5\u2009kHz by a 16 channel, 16\u2009bit analog-to-digital data converter (NI PCI-6289; National Instruments, Austin, TX) and collected using custom software in Matlab (Mathworks, Inc, Natick, MA).\n\nExperimental protocol\nTo examine the effects of iSCI on stance-phase force production during walking, we compared vertical and fore-aft GRFs and GRF modifications because of increased cadence between persons with iSCI and AB controls. Forces exerted by the more impaired limb (defined by LEMS) were recorded for persons with iSCI, and the same limb was recorded for their AB match. Subjects walked across the level walkway at self-selected (SS\nmet\n) and fast (F\nmet\n=\u2009115% of SS\nmet\n) cadences while listening to a metronome. Cadences matched the metronome within 7% (SS) and 8% (F) error for all subjects. In general, persons with iSCI (\nn\n=\u200913) showed significantly lower SS cadences (71.0\u2009\u00b1\u200922.2 steps/min) compared with AB controls (108.4\u2009\u00b1\u200910.4 steps/min) (\np\n<\u20090.001), especially when ambulating with an AD. The SS (\nn\n=\u200911, r\u2009=\u20090.79,\np\n=\u20090.004) and F (\nn\n=\u200911, r\u2009=\u20090.77,\np\n=\u20090.006) cadences were also highly correlated with walking speed (10MWT) in persons with iSCI. Details of the experimental setup for cadence-matching conditions have been published previously.\n13\nTo control for cadence and AD on GRF production, AB participants also performed additional trials at the SS cadence of their iSCI match (SS\ncadence\n), as well as the SS/F cadences of their iSCI match using the matching AD (SS\nmatch\n/F\nmatch\n) when applicable. A licensed physical therapist instructed AB controls on appropriate use of the AD to preserve the SCI-match gait pattern.\n13\nAB controls were provided up to 10 minutes of practice with the AD. The cadences performed by AB controls were comparable to their iSCI match during SS\nmatch\n(paired\nt\ntest of actual cadences walked,\nn\n=\u200913,\np\n=\u20090.49) and F\nmatch\n(\np\n=\u20090.63) conditions. The GRFs were collected across a minimum of three gait trials per cadence and AD condition. The order of prescribed cadence conditions (SS, F) was randomized between subjects to minimize order effects. There were significant differences between SS and F cadence conditions for persons with iSCI (SS\nmet\n=\u200971.0\u2009\u00b1\u200922.2 steps/min, F\nmet\n=\u200979.1\u2009\u00b1\u200925.2 steps/min,\np\n<\u20090.001), between SS and F cadences for AB controls (SS\nmet\n=\u2009107.8\u2009\u00b1\u20099.8 steps/min, F\nmet\n=\u2009119.6\u2009\u00b1\u200912.0 steps/min,\np\n<\u20090.001), and between SS and F iSCI-matched cadences for AB controls (SS\nmet\n=\u200974.1\u2009\u00b1\u200926.2 steps/min, F\nmet\n=\u200982.6\u2009\u00b1\u200927.9 step/min,\np\n<\u20090.001).\n\nGRF data analyses\nRaw GRF data were processed using custom code written in Matlab (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA). Stance phase was defined using vertical GRF data. Persons with iSCI, however, often walk with limited control of foot placement and exhibit shuffle gait or toe drag, resulting in GRF data features during swing phase in addition to stance phase. Thus, standard methods of determining stance phase from vertical GRF data do not work well on data with these swing-phase features. To characterize stance-phase GRFs in persons with iSCI, we developed a two-step stance phase cropping method (\nSupplementary Fig. 1\n; see online supplementary material at\nftp.liebertpub.com\n).\nIn the first step, we used a preliminary cropping window at 20% of maximum vertical GRF. This preliminary cropping avoids toe drag or other low force events that occur during swing phase. It also removes the heel strike and toe off events of normal gait, however. Thus, in a second step, we extended the first cropping window to include heel strike and toe off events in typical gait. To determine the expansion of the cropping window for step two, we used normative GRF data from our AB controls (SS\nmet\ncondition) and cropped the normative data using two methods: at 20% of maximum, and using a standard method at 5N.\n29\nIn comparing the two methods of cropping on the normative data, we found that, on average, heel strike defined by cropping using the 5N vertical GRF method occurred earlier by 4.25% of preliminary stance phase, and that toe off occurred later by 7.97% of preliminary stance phase.\nThus, in step two for all data (AB and iSCI), we expanded the preliminary cropping window by 4.25% of stance phase before 20% body weight during loading, and by 7.97% of stance phase after 20% body weight during unloading. Visual inspection of all cropped data confirmed that this algorithm defined stance phase appropriately, both for AB and iSCI subjects. Cropped stance-phase GRF data were digitally filtered with an eighth order, zero-lag, 100\u2009Hz low-pass Butterworth filter to remove high frequency noise before analysis and then normalized to the subject's body weight and stance phase duration.\nWe quantified fore-aft and vertical GRF profiles to compare stance-phase force production between groups and across cadence and AD conditions. Three variables were derived from fore-aft GRFs: transition point, braking impulse, and propulsive impulse (\nFig. 1A\n). The transition point was defined as the time point (% stance phase) that the force curve switches from negative (braking) to positive (propulsion), found by locating the most negative excursion of the fore-aft GRF, and stepping forward to the next zero crossing. Braking impulse was defined as the area under the negative force curve before the transition point. Propulsive impulse was defined as the area under the positive force curve after the transition point.\n6\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nGeneral methodology. (\nA\n) Depiction of measured fore-aft and (\nB\n) vertical (V) ground reaction forces.\nThree variables were also derived from vertical GRFs: V1\nMax\n, V2\nMax\n, and vertical modulation (\nFig. 1B\n). Maximum vertical loading during 0\u201339% stance phase (weight acceptance) defined V1\nMax\n. Maximum vertical loading during 61\u2013100% stance phase (push-off) defined V2\nMax\n.\n30\nWe quantified vertical GRF modulation as the difference between the average of V1\nMax\nand V2\nMax\n, and the minimal vertical loading between V1\nMax\nand V2\nMax\n. Vertical GRF modulation quantifies the range of vertical loading between weight acceptance and push-off, and represents the amount of vertical lift of a person's center of mass (COM) at midstance.\n31\nBased on visual inspection of the GRF profiles, fewer than 1% of gait trials (four of 401) were classified as outliers and removed from analyses. In one case, the data acquisition was not started in time, and the first half of the stance phase was not recorded. In three other cases, the contralateral foot or part of an AD likely may have touched the force plate during stance phase. One sample\nt\ntests confirmed that these three trials were outliers compared with other trials for that subject under the same walking condition (\np\n<\u20090.05 for at least one GRF parameter).\n\nStatistical analyses\nDescriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) were calculated for cadence and each GRF variable, and normality of the data was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Independent sample\nt\ntests or Mann-Whitney\nU\ntests were used to compare fore-aft and vertical GRF variables between persons with iSCI and AB controls (iSCI SS\nmet\nvs. AB SS\nmet\n,\nn\n=\u200915). Because use of an AD can change GRFs substantially, we also stratified iSCI participants into two groups: those who did use an AD to walk (\nn\n=\u20098) and those who did not (\nn\n=\u20097). While there were no differences in age and time post-SCI between groups (\np\n>\u20090.05), there were differences in self-selected walking cadence (independent sample\nt\ntest,\np\n=\u20090.001) and lower extremity strength (LEMS total score,\np\n=\u20090.02).\nWe used independent sample\nt\ntests or Mann-Whitney\nU\ntests for between-group comparisons (iSCI SS\nmet\nvs. AB SS\nmet\n, iSCI SS\nmet\nvs. AB SS\ncadence\n, iSCI SS\nmet\nvs. AB SS\nmatch\n), and paired sample\nt\ntests or Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests to examine GRF modifications across cadences (iSCI SS\nmet\nvs. iSCI F\nmet\n, AB SS\nmatch\nvs. AB F\nmatch\n) in these stratified groups. Linear regression analyses were also performed to examine the relationship between GRFs and clinical measures of strength, spasticity, and walking ability. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22 (IBM SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) with a significance level of\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "This study was approved by the Independent Review Board at the Penn State College of Medicine. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents or guardians of all children who served as subjects of the investigation and, when appropriate, assent from the subjects themselves was obtained.\n\nsTBI recruitment and sample collection\nThe CSF samples collected previously for a study of F\n2\n-isoprostane levels in children and adolescents with sTBI\n16\nwere utilized for a longitudinal characterization of CSF miRNA. Briefly, ventricular CSF samples collected from eight children with sTBI were selected at random for the current study. To remove sample selection bias, researchers were blind to participant characteristics before sample selection. The selected cohort included children ages 4\u201317 years with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) <8 and a clinically indicated extraventricular drain (EVD) for increased intracranial pressure after sTBI. Mechanisms of injury included fall and motor vehicle crash. CSF was extracted passively from each subject's EVD in a sterile fashion at three times after injury: day 1, day 4\u20137, and day 8\u201317. Age, sex, mechanism of injury, and times of collection were recorded for each subject (\nSupplementary Table 1\n; see online supplementary material at\nftp.liebertpub.com\n). Control CSF included 12 samples taken at one time point from three subjects (ages 1\u20138 years) undergoing clinically indicated spinal tap for epilepsy, or as part of a rule-out-sepsis protocol. All CSF was freshly aliquoted and frozen immediately at \u221280C. Samples did not undergo any freeze/thaw cycles and therefore remained frozen continuously from collection time until time of the present analysis.\n\nmTBI recruitment and sample collection\nSalivary miRNA profiles were investigated in subjects (age 5\u201321 years) with or without a clinical diagnosis of mTBI. The mTBI cohort included 61 children and adolescents presenting to the Penn State Hershey Medical Center for evaluation of mTBI within 14 days of initial injury. The 14-day cutoff was chosen based on previous investigations that suggested most clinical symptoms and biomarker profiles return to baseline within two weeks of concussion.\n17\nExclusion criteria for the mTBI group included GCS <12, clinical diagnosis of sTBI, penetrating head injury, skull fracture, intracranial bleed, or symptoms attributable to underlying psychological disorder (e.g., depression or anxiety). The control cohort included 19 children and adolescents presenting to the Penn State Hershey Medical Center Primary Pediatrics Clinic for a regularly scheduled well child visit. Exclusion criteria for this group included a history of concussion, ongoing rheumatological condition, or recent orthopedic injury. Subjects with periodontal disease, upper respiratory infection, seizure disorder, intellectual disability, history of migraine headaches, or drug/alcohol use disorder were excluded from both groups.\nSaliva samples were collected from each participant at the time of enrollment in a nonfasting state after an oral tap-water rinse through expectoration into an Oragene RE-100 saliva collection kit (DNA Genotek; Ottawa, Canada). Samples were shaken by hand 5\u201310 times and stored at room temperature for up to 10 days before transfer into a 4\n\u00b0\nC refrigerator. Because of circadian variations in miRNA levels, time of day was recorded for all saliva collections. There was no difference in average collection time between control and mTBI groups.\n\nMedical and demographic characteristics\nMedical and demographic information was collected from both mTBI and control participants, including: age, sex, race/ethnicity, height, weight, medical history, and medications (\nSupplementary Table 2\n; see online supplementary material at\nftp.liebertpub.com\n). Given the potential impact of underlying psychological conditions on mTBI symptom reports, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use was recorded for all participants. Food/medical allergies and dietary restrictions were also recorded to assess potential influence of oropharyngeal status on the salivary miRNA profile. The mTBI cohort reported history of concussions, details of current concussion (days since injury, mechanism, associated emesis, weakness, amnesia, fractures, or loss of consciousness), and time of last analgesic use (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory or acetaminophen). Finally, mTBI subjects and their parent/guardian completed an inventory of concussive symptoms using the child sport concussion assessment tool (SCAT-3).\n\nRNA processing and quantification\nThe CSF samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C and saliva samples were stored at \u221220\u00b0C before RNA extraction. RNA was extracted from saliva and CSF samples using a Norgen Circulating and Exosomal RNA Purification Kit (Norgen Biotek, Ontario, Canada) as we have reported previously.\n18\nSamples of saliva or CSF were combined with lysis buffer, Norgen Slurry C2 solution, and \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and vortexed for 15\u2009sec per manufacturer instructions. The solution was incubated at 60\u00b0C for 10\u2009min, before adding 3\u2009mL of 96% ethanol. Next, each sample was centrifuged for 30\u2009sec at 1000 rotations per minute, followed by an additional 60\u00b0C lysis step and ethanol incubation. Approximately 650\u2009\u03bcL of this mixture was centrifuged for 1\u2009min at 14,000 RPM. The minifilter spin column then underwent three washes for 1\u2009min at 14,000 RPM before a final two-step elution procedure: 2\u2009min at 2000 RPM, followed by 3\u2009min at 14,000 RPM. Final RNA concentrations were quantified with a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, and extracted RNA was stored at \u221280\u00b0C before sequencing. The RNA yield and quality were assessed with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer before library construction.\nSequencing of salivary RNA occurred at the Penn State Genomics Core Facility using a NEXTflex Small RNA-Seq Kit v3 (Bioo Scientific; Austin, TX), an Illumina HiSeq 2500 Instrument, and a targeted depth of three million reads per sample. The CSF RNA samples were sequenced at the SUNY Molecular Analysis Core at Upstate Medical University using an Illumina TruSeq Small RNA Sample Prep protocol (Illumina; San Diego, CA), an Illumina MiSeq instrument, and a targeted depth of three million reads per sample. Reads for all samples were aligned to the hg38 build of the human genome in Partek Flow (Partek; St. Louis, MO) using the SHRiMP2 aligner. Local alignment was performed with a match window length of 100% and gap open scores of \u2212255. Single best mapping was completed with a maximum of 10 hits per read and ungapped alignment. Total miRNA counts within each sample were quantified with miRBase precursor and mature-microRNA v21. Saliva samples with less than 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n3\ntotal counts were excluded from the final analysis, resulting in 60 mTBI and 18 control saliva samples.\nOnly miRNAs with raw read counts greater than 10 in at least 25% of samples were evaluated in the differential expression analysis for CSF and saliva, respectively. The miRNAs present in 25% of sTBI CSF samples and absent from all control CSF samples were also investigated as \u201cup-regulated\u201d miRNAs. Before statistical analysis, read counts were sum-normalized, mean-centered, and divided by the standard deviation of each variable. The data set supporting the results of this article will be made available in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe miRNAs with the greatest physiological relevance as concussion biomarkers were identified using a three-step procedure: (1) The miRNAs present only in sTBI CSF samples (absent in control CSF samples) or miRNAs with \u201caltered\u201d concentrations in sTBI CSF (measured as reads per million; RPM) were identified with a nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test with Benjamini Hochberg false detection rate (FDR) correction; (2) concentrations (RPM) of these miRNA targets were investigated in mTBI saliva samples (compared with control saliva) using a Wilcoxon rank sum test; (3) the miRNAs altered in both CSF and saliva TBI samples were examined for parallel up- or down-regulation relative to controls (\nFig. 1\n). For each step, \u201caltered\u201d miRNAs were those with raw\np\nvalue <0.05. The miRNAs of interest were inspected for longitudinal trends in both CSF and saliva concussion samples using a Spearman rank correlation metric (correlating miRNA concentrations with days since injury). The diagnostic accuracy of these biomarker prospects was assessed with a multivariate logistic regression analysis, and results were visualized with a receiver operating characteristic curve. To avoid \u201covermodeling\u201d of the dataset and to ensure that the miRNA biomarkers accurately differentiated control and mTBI subjects, we employed a secondary approach involving a 100-fold Monte-Carlo Cross Validation technique alongside a random 1/4 sample hold-out procedure in Metaboanalyst software.\n18\nRelationships between medical/demographic characteristics and salivary miRNAs of interest were examined with Spearman rank correlations. Analysis of medical and demographic data across mTBI and control groups was accomplished with a two-tailed Student\nt\ntest.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nMethodological pipeline for identifying accurate and physiologically relevant microribonucleic acid markers of concussion. sTBI, severe traumatic brain injury; GCS, Glasgow Coma Scale; mTBI, mild traumatic brain injury; RNA, ribonucleic acid;\n\nFunctional analysis\nThe miRNA biomarkers of mTBI underwent functional annotation analysis in DIANA mirPath v3 online software (\nhttp://snf-515788.vm.okeanos.grnet.gr/\n) using the microT-CDS algorithm to identify species-specific mRNA targets.\n19\nDIANA mirPath identified gene ontology (GO) categories with significant (FDR <0.05) target enrichment using a Fisher exact test.

    "Methods": "The parent study was a prospective trial performed at six trauma centers in Latin America wherein patients were randomized to ICP management based on monitored ICP versus treatment directed by the imaging and clinical examination (ICE) protocol.6Patients entered were those aged \u226513 years with closed-head injury who had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)7score of 3-8 on presentation to hospital or who deteriorated to that level within 48\u2009h of injury. Patients were excluded for GCS 3 with bilateral fixed and dilated pupils or injury otherwise considered non-survivable. All patients received standard intensive care unit (ICU)\u2013based supportive care, including mechanical ventilation, sedation, and analgesia, and aggressive resuscitation and management of general non-neurologic intensive care issues (Table 1). Protocol for all patients included computed tomography (CT) imaging at baseline, 48\u2009h, and 5\u20137 days. This study involves those patients randomized to the ICE protocol; therefore, that group and protocol will be detailed here. For details on the ICP-monitored group, please see the initial study.6\n\nThe ICE protocol was founded on pre-trial standard care at the three original hospitals (see above;Table 2andFig. 1). Excepting surgical mass lesions, imaging or clinical indications of SICH were treated first with scheduled hyperosmolar therapies, optional mild hyperventilation (partial pressure of carbon dioxide [PaCO2] 30-35\u2009mm Hg), and optional ventricular drainage. Neuroworsening,8continuing edema, or worsening clinical signs of SICH required treatment escalation, including consideration of high-dose barbiturates or decompressive craniectomy (Fig. 2).\n\nThe primary outcome was a composite9of 21 elements measuring survival, duration and level of consciousness, functional status and orientation measures at 3 months after injury, and functional and neuropsychological measures at 6 months after injury.6Trained investigators blinded to the intervention assessed outcomes. We also prospectively collected hourly clinical and treatment data in the ICU. We defined brain-specific treatments as those directed at SICH, including hyperosmotics, hyperventilation, pressors, etc., but excluding ventilation, sedation, and analgesia. We defined the duration of therapy as the days from injury until the last brain-specific treatment. We analyzed patients according to whether they survived more than 1 day beyond these treatments (brain-treatment survivors group). We integrated brain-specific treatments by summing the number of treatments delivered per hour over the treatment interval.\n\nStatistical analysis\nHypotheses were tested by blocked Wilcoxon tests,\n10\nwith blocking on stratification factors: site, severity (GCS 3-5 or Motor 1-2 if intubated vs. GCS 6-8 or Motor 3-5 if intubated) and age (< 40 vs. \u226540). Odds ratios and confidence intervals were obtained from logistic proportional odds models,\n11\naccounting for the same factors. All odds ratios were calculated so that numbers higher than unity reflect more favorable results with the ICP protocol and numbers lower than unity reflect more favorable results with the ICE protocol.\nThis study was approved by the University of Washington Institutional Review Board and Federal Wide Assurance\u2013approved ethics committees at all centers. Integra Life Sciences Corporation donated the ICP catheters and provided additional unrestricted support for this project. Integra had no role in study design or conduct, data analysis, or writing of associated manuscripts."

    "Methods": "Animals\nThe animal protocol was approved by the Bay Pines VA Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) and performed in accordance with all institutional, agency, and governmental Animal Welfare Regulations.\nMale CD-1 mice at three months of age and weighing between 31 and 34 g were obtained from Harlan Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN). They were housed three to four per cage in a 22\u00b0C \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C temperature controlled environment with a 12 h light/dark cycle. Food and water were available\nad libitum\n.\n\nClosed head injury\nMild TBI (mTBI) was induced using a concussive closed head injury weight drop model as described previously.\n6\nBriefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and placed on a sponge, which allows for impact and movement of the head to inflict a diffuse concussive injury.\n22\nThe injury apparatus was positioned directly over the head such that the inner diameter of the tube (13 mm) spanned the right hemisphere caudal to the eye and rostral to the ear. A 30 g (for repetitive injuries and the single injury dendritic analysis) or 50 g (for all other single injuries) cylindrical weight was dropped 80 cm through the length of the tube in injured mice (\nn\n= 19). Sham mice (\nn\n= 19) did not receive the weight drop portion of the procedure. This injury, which has been demonstrated to cause a mild injury,\n24\nwas repeated five times at 24 h intervals or just once (\nFig. 1A\n). Mice were allowed to recover from anesthesia in a heated chamber.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nTimeline for 1 \u00d7 and 5 \u00d7 injuries. Mice in the injury group received a single injury or five injuries 24 h apart (\nA\n). For the 1 \u00d7 injury, brains were harvested and analyzed for transactivation response deoxyribonucleic acid protein 43 (TDP-43) expression. For the 5 \u00d7 injury, brains were harvested at 3, 30, and 60 days post-injury for analysis. At 30 days post-injury, mice underwent rotarod testing to determine whether there were any observable motor deficits (\nB\n). No significant difference was observed with time spent on an accelerating rotarod (measuring motor and balance function) after repetitive injury compared with the sham-injured controls. mRNA, messenger ribonucleic acid.\n\nBehavioral tests\nA rotarod performance test was administered to a subset of mice (\nn\n= 5/group) at 30 days after the final injury or sham procedure to test motor skills. A Stoelting 57620 apparatus was used, consisting of a horizontally oriented dowel beginning at 5 rpm and slowly accelerating to 40 rpm. Mice were placed on the dowel, and the amount of time the mice were able to stay on the rod before falling off was measured. Mice were allowed three practice trials followed by a break of at least 30 min before beginning three recorded trials with three min of rest between each run.\n\nTissue collection\nMice were killed by cervical dislocation, and brain tissue was rapidly dissected while chilled on ice, then snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue was stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\n\nProtein analysis\nProteins were isolated from the ipsilateral (right) cortex and hippocampus using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). Protein concentration was quantified by bicinchoninic acid assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Proteins were separated on a 4\u201320% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel (Pierce), transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE), blocked with Odyssey Blocking Buffer (LI-COR Biosciences), and incubated with primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight. Controls lacking only the primary antibody were performed to make sure that bands visualized were specific.\nThe following day, membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorescent infrared (IR) dyes (LI-COR) for 1 h at 23\u00b0C, then scanned onto a LI-COR Odyssey IR Scanner and analyzed using Image Studio software (LI-COR). Primary antibodies used were: TARDBP (TDP-43) 1:1000 (10782-2-AP; Proteintech, Chicago, IL), LAMP-2A 1:500 (PA1-655; Thermo-Fisher, Waltham, MA), Apg7 1:1000 (AB133528, Abcam, Inc., Cambridge, MA), LC3b 1:1000 (AB63817, Abcam, Inc.), bone derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) 1:1000 (SC-546; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), Netrin-1 1:100 (AB26162; Abcam, Inc., Cambridge, MA), nerve growth factor (NGF) 1:500 (AB6199; Abcam, Inc.), and glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP] 1:1000 (AB5804; EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). Secondary antibodies used were: goat anti-rabbit IR dye 800 (926-32211; LI-COR) and goat anti-mouse IR dye 680 (926-68070; LI-COR).\n\nmRNA analysis\nFrozen tissue from the ipsilateral (right) cortex was homogenized in QIAzol Lysis Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), phase separated with chloroform, and RNA was precipitated with 70% ethanol. Purification of mRNA was performed using an RNeasy Mini Kit (74104; Qiagen) per the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The RNA concentration was determined by NanoDrop (Thermo-Scientific, Waltham, MA). Potential changes in mRNA levels were checked by qRT-PCR with QuantiTect SYBR reagents (BioRad, Hercules, CA), primers (for Lamp-2A, BDNF, Netrin-1, and NGF) from IDT (Coralville, IA), and a CFX Connect fluorescent thermocycler (Bio-Rad) according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.\n\nDendritic analysis\nAt 30 days after the final injury, mice were perfused with phosphate buffered saline followed by 10% neutral buffered formalin. Whole brains were removed and placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Formalin-fixed tissue blocks (2\u20133 mm thick in the coronal plane) incorporating the cortical samples were stained by the Rapid Golgi method and evaluated for the amount and distribution of dendritic branching by Sholl analysis and for the complexity of the dendritic arbor using branch point analysis as performed previously.\n27\nLocations were confirmed in each brain sample by comparing the coronal sections to the mouse brain atlas,\n28\nand measurements of Golgi stained neurons were made in regions including the parietal cortex, the dentate gyrus, and the striatum.\nBriefly, the fixed tissue blocks were placed initially in potassium dichromate and osmium tetroxide for approximately six days, transferred to 0.75% silver nitrate for approximately 40 h, dehydrated through ascending concentration of alcohol solutions and ethyl ether, infiltrated with ascending concentrations of nitrocellulose solutions (5%, 10%, 20%, 30%; 1\u20132 days each), placed in plastic molds, and hardened by exposure to chloroform vapors. Tissue sections were cut in the coronal plane at a thickness of 120 microns using an AO sliding microtome, cleared in alpha-terpineol, thoroughly rinsed with xylene, and mounted on slides with Permount. In all cases, Golgi stained neurons of a specific cell population that were randomly selected for dendritic analysis had to meet strict criteria: they had to be well impregnated; the branches could not be obscured by other neurons or their dendrites, glia, blood vessels, or undefined precipitate (an occasional staining by-product), and the soma had to be located in the middle third of the thickness of the section. Camera lucida drawings were prepared using Zeiss brightfield research microscopes equipped with long-working distance oil-immersion objective lenses and drawing tubes.\nAnalyses of the dendritic arbors were subdivided into two types: the Sholl analysis, which defined the amount and distribution of the dendritic arbor, including an estimate of the total dendritic length, and the dendritic branch point analysis that\u2014based on the number of branch points and dendritic bifurcations within the dendritic domain\u2014characterized the complexity of the arbor. In addition, the area of the soma of each neuron was measured using a digitizing tablet linked to the drawing tube of the microscope. There were 3\u20135 brains examined per group and at least five neurons from each brain were measured (nine neurons per brain when the group size was low). All data from the coded neurons were analyzed statistically with Prism software.\n\nStatistical analysis\nMean values are depicted \u00b1 standard deviation and were compared with the two tailed\nt\ntest or analysis of variance, as indicated in the legends, with\np\n< 0.05 indicating significance. For Sholl and branch point analyses, the Wilcoxon rank-sign test was used also to compare dendritic branching profiles of the two groups. When appropriate, an adjusted alpha level was used to account for multiple comparisons."

    "Methods": "Participants\nData from 44 right-handed participants were collected (mean age\u2009=\u200936.16; SD\u2009=\u200916.35) with informed consent. Information related to number of head injuries, approximate date, description of the event, and duration of symptoms (including duration of loss of consciousness (LOC) and post-traumatic amnesia) were obtained from all participants.\nIndividuals were assigned to the mTBI group if they met the following criteria: a diagnosis of mTBI by a medical professional and/or who had LOC <30\u2009min and/or who had a post-traumatic amnesia <24\u2009h. This screening assigned 22 subjects to the mTBI group. Stratification was done by time since injury controlling for age at injury, leading to 12 mTBI participants falling into the 1\u201310 year category (i.e., mTBI\n1\u201310\n). For comparison, 12 age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls were recruited. Ten mTBI participants were assigned to the 20\u201365 year category (i.e., mTBI\n20\u201365\n). For comparison, 10 age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls were recruited. One control participant's imaging data from the mTBI\n1\u201310\ncategory was not available and therefore removed from all analyses (i.e., healthy controls\nn\n=\u200921; mTBI\nn\n=\u200922; total\nN\n=\u200943). For both sets of comparisons, we confirmed that the mTBIs were representative of CRR-mTBIs based on a battery of neuropsychological tests.\n\nImage acquisition and pre-processing\nAll images were collected on a Siemens Trio 3 Tesla full body magnet, using a 12-channel birdcage head coil. Functional blood oxygenation level\u2013dependent (BOLD) images were acquired parallel to the anterior commissure\u2013posterior commissure (AC-PC) line with a T2-weighted echo-planar imaging sequence of 35 contiguous axial slices collected in ascending order (repetition time [TR]\u2009=\u20092000\u2009msec; echo time [TE]\u2009=\u200925\u2009msec; BOLD volumes\u2009=\u2009299; flip angle\u2009=\u200980\u00b0; field of view [FOV]\u2009=\u2009220\u2009\u00d7\u2009220\u2009mm; voxel size\u2009=\u20093.4\u2009\u00d7\u20093.4\u2009\u00d7\u20094.0\u2009mm). Structural images were acquired with a T1-weighted three-dimensional (3D) magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo imaging (MPRAGE) protocol of 192 contiguous sagittal slices collected in an ascending manner parallel to the AC-PC line (TR\u2009=\u20091900\u2009msec; TE\u2009=\u20092.26\u2009msec; flip angle\u2009=\u20099\u00b0; FOV\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256\u2009mm; voxel size\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm).\nFor each subject, two resting state scans were collected separately (2.5\u2009min each). Image-processing was carried out with FSL version 5.0.4 (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain's Software Library;\nwww.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl\n), AFNI,\n22\nand MATLAB (The MathWorks, Natick, MA). Structural analysis was performed with FreeSurfer (\nhttp://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu\n).\nThe following pre-processing steps were applied to each run: Raw DICOM images were converted to NIfTI format using FreeSurfer's\nmri_convert\ntool and reoriented to RPI orientation with FSL's\nfslorient\n. FSL's BET (Brain Extraction Technique) algorithm was then used to strip voxels containing non-brain tissue from the high-resolution T1 structural images.\n23\nNext, echo-planar imaging (EPI) data were motion corrected using AFNI's\n3dvolreg\nfunction, which produced six parameters of head motion. The motion-corrected EPI data were spatially smoothed using a full width at half maximum 6.0\u2009mm Gaussian kernel.\n\nResting state\nDuring resting state data collection, all participants were instructed to keep their eyes closed. The pre-processing steps for the resting state data were the same as those described above (see the\nImage acquisition and pre-processing\nsection). In addition, single-subject independent components analysis (ICA) was computed with FSL's MELODIC, an automated ICA procedure that was used to generate signal and noise components for each subject. Each component was visually inspected and manually classified as signal (components of interest) or noise (e.g., collection artifacts, signal of non-neural origin) by two independent raters based on recommendations by Kelly and colleagues.\n24\nTo remove confounding signals, such as those due to cardiac pulse or low frequency scanner drift, the images corrected for noise were bandpass filtered for frequencies below 0.008\u2009Hz and above 0.1\u2009Hz, using AFNI's\n3dBandpass\ntool. This band-pass filter also was applied to the six motion parameters mentioned above. The mean time series was then extracted from specific regions in deep white matter (retro-lenticular portion of the left internal capsule) and cerebrospinal fluid (left ventricle) and entered into the general linear model (GLM) as nuisance regressors.\n25\nThe residual time series from this analysis for each run were concatenated and kept in native functional space for seed-correlational analysis.\nBased on a previous study that explored functional connectivity in the mTBI population, we placed the seeds of the DMN within the rACC and PCC.\n20\nVoxel coordinates for each of these regions of interest (ROIs) matched those of Mayer and colleagues\n20\n(12-mm spheres in the rACC [MNI 0, 49, 9], and PCC [MNI 0, \u221247, 33]). The following analyses were performed for each ROI. The ROI was transformed to each participant's native space. For every individual, we conducted a whole\u2013brain functional connectivity analysis with the ROI by extracting its mean time series and using MATLAB to cross-correlate it with every other voxel in the brain. Cross-correlations were estimated as Pearson coefficients, which were then converted to subject-level z-score maps using Fisher's r-to-z transformation. These whole\u2013brain voxel-wise seed maps represented the co-fluctuations in amplitude of resting state BOLD signal in each voxel and the target ROI.\nAt the group level, each participant's Z-map was first warped to MNI space (linear warp) and then all Z-maps were concatenated. The resultant image file was input to a between-subject ordinary least-squares regression using FSL's\nflameo\n. Given our directional hypothesis that controls would show greater activation relative to both groups of mTBI, we identified two contrasts of interest. Our first contrast was the differential activation in the mTBI group with shorter time since injury (i.e., mTBI\n1\u201310\n) relative to controls, which we labeled as \u201cControl > mTBI\n1\u201310\n.\u201d Our second contrast was the differential activation in the mTBI group with longer time since injury (i.e., mTBI\n20\u201365\n) relative to controls, which we labeled as \u201cControl > mTBI\n20\u201365.\n\u201d Multiple comparisons were controlled by thresholding these contrast maps at Z\u2009>\u20092.33, with a cluster correction of\np\n<\u20090.05. Regions that were observed to be differentially activated were saved as masks for further study.\n25\nWe performed an ROI analysis using the generated masks for each participant (see below).\n\nVolumetric and thickness-based morphometry\nFreeSurfer (\nhttp://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu\n, Version 5.3) was used to automatically compute volumetric and surface-based morphometric measures of the brain. For the surface measurements, each participant's cortical surface was extracted from their 3D high-resolution T1 MPRAGE image to create gray and white matter surface models separately for each hemisphere. These models were represented by a tessellated triangular mesh that had been inflated to a sphere and registered to a spherical atlas. The vertices (or nodes) of each triangle were assigned an index, and each index was further identified by a two-dimensional (spherical) coordinate system. These indices were used to calculate various subject-level morphometric statistics such as cortical thickness, surface area, sulcal depth, and gyral height, as well as group-level comparisons on these measures. The Desikan-Killiany classification atlas was used to identify specific brain regions.\nVolumetric measurements were estimated by segmenting the brain into white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. Segmentation was done using voxel-wise intensity differences and a probabilistic anatomical brain atlas. The voxel-based intensity statistics were then used to compute volumetric measures as a percentage of each participant's intracranial volume, thus controlling for variation in individual skull size. These measures included total gray matter volume, total white matter volume, and total brain volume across hemispheres as well as volumes for each structure labeled by the Desikan-Killiany atlas (see Trefler and colleagues for a more detailed overview).\n26\nThickness and volume measurements were extracted from the ROI defined by a significant difference in DMN connectivity between both sets of comparisons.\n\nFractional anisotropy\nThe DTI data was pre-processed using the TORTOISE software (\nhttp://tortoisedti.nichd.nih.gov\n). The TORTOISE module DTIPrep was used to perform image/diffusion information check; padding/cropping of data; slice-wise, interlace-wise, and gradient-wise intensity and motion check; head motion; and Eddy current artifact correction. The command DIFF_PREP was used to register the data to the subject's native structural space. DIFF_CALC was then used to process the tensor images, using a non-linear tensor fitting. The resulting TI images (specifically the fractional anisotropy images) were fed into FSL's TBSS software (\nhttps://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/TBSS\n) for statistical analysis."

    "Methods": "Experimental animals\nOur experiments utilized an APP/PS1 transgenic rat model that homozygously expresses three human gene constructs: 1) APP 695 with the K670N/M671L mutation (rat synapsin-1 promoter); 2) APP minigene with the K670N/M671L and V717F mutations (platelet-derived growth factor \u03b2 promoter); and 3) PS1 with the M146V mutation (rat synapsin-1 promoter) on a Sprague\u2013Dawley background.\n24\nThe neuropathological characterization of these animals has previously been described in detail.\n24\u201326\nSparse parenchymal A\u03b2 plaques begin to appear between 7 and 9 months of age, and plaque density progressively increases with age in cortical and hippocampal regions. The A\u03b2 plaques in this model are primarily diffuse in nature, with a much smaller proportion of fibrillar plaques identified through thioflavin-S staining.\n25\n,\n26\nAnimals obtained from Cephalon Inc. (West Chester, PA) were bred and aged at the UCLA School of Medicine vivarium facility. Both male and female rats were used in this study (\nTable 1\n). All animals were housed under a 12-h light/dark cycle and had access to standard laboratory rat chow\nad libitum\n.

The animal was then placed on a surface against a vertical board. A CCI tip (5\u2009mm in diameter) was positioned at the skin surface at the center of impact and programmed to advance 8\u2009mm at 36 pounds per square inch to displace the head. This injury produces a brief apnea, delayed toe pinch response, and increased righting times without mortality or skull fractures.\n20\n,\n27\n,\n29\n,\n30\nWe sought to model the chronic effects of rTBI in adolescent APP/PS1 rats, because the greatest incidence of both single TBI and rTBI in clinical populations occurs in adolescents.\n31\nAlthough there are no exact guidelines for determining interspecies age equivalents for adolescence, we administered experimental mTBIs between post-natal day (PND) 35 and PND46 based on previously published developmental profiles. Sexual maturity is achieved between PND45 and PND60,\n32\nand cerebral glucose metabolism reaches 90% of adult values at PND35.\n33\nThe molecular composition of PND34\u201344 rat synapses reflects synaptic changes observed in human teenagers,\n34\nas do the increased risk-taking behaviors observed in PND28\u201345 rats.\n35\nAPP/PS1 rats from individual litters were randomly assigned to three groups. Group sizes of 10\u201315 animals each were determined by power analyses of preliminary immunohistochemical (IHC) data. The rTBI24 group received four repeat experimental mTBIs separated by 24-h intervals, the rTBI72 group received four repeat experimental mTBIs separated by 72-h intervals, and the sham group underwent a single induction of isoflurane anesthesia and positioning in the stereotaxic apparatus, but did not sustain any experimental mTBIs. The duration of each anesthesia exposure for injury induction and sham was 3\u2009min. Previous work from our group has shown that single and repeated isoflurane exposures of such brief durations in sham animals result in similar levels of regional glucose metabolism\n20\nand hormonal expression.\n29\n,\n30\nStudies that document cerebral consequences of isoflurane exposure have involved prolonged periods (\u22652\u20134\u2009h) of anesthesia.\n36\nNo mortality associated with the sham or mTBI injuries was observed in this study.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nAt 12 months of age, animals were injected with a lethal dose of pentobarbital (100\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneal) and perfused transcardially with a 10% sucrose solution, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were post-fixed overnight and cryoprotected in 20% sucrose before being frozen in methylbutane. Coronal sections (40\u2009\u03bcm) were blocked with 0.5% H\n2\nO\n2\n, then blocked with 2% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 before incubation in DAE antibody (rabbit polyclonal anti-A\u03b21-13\n37\n; 1:600 dilution; gift from Gregory M. Cole) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Sections were subsequently incubated for 1.5\u2009h in 1:500 biotinylated goat antirabbit secondary antibody (BA1000; Vector Laboratories), and developed with ABC and DAB reaction kits (Vector Laboratories). Sections were mounted, dehydrated, and cover-slipped before quantitative analysis. DAE labels both A\u03b240 and A\u03b242.\n37\nIn order to differentiate between A\u03b2 species, IHC was also performed using monoclonal mouse anti-A\u03b240 (MM32-13.1.1, 1:400; Anaspec, Fremont, CA) and anti-A\u03b242 (MM26-2.1.3, 1:5000; gift from Gregory M. Cole and Todd Golde) antibodies. Additional sections were also stained with thioflavin-S to label dense core A\u03b2 plaques.\n\nQuantification of \u03b2-amyloid plaque pathology\nExamination of A\u03b2 plaque deposition focused on two coronal planes: an anterior section (0.2\u2009mm anterior of bregma) and a posterior section underlying the injury site (3.3\u2009mm posterior of bregma). Images of these sections were captured at 5\u00d7 magnification. A blinded rater used ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda MD) to manually delineate A\u03b2 plaques in multiple regions of interest (ROIs) in the anterior (septal nucleus and frontal motor/sensory cortex) and posterior (retrosplenial cortex, parietal auditory/sensory cortex, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus) sections (\nFig. 1\n). The hippocampus was further subdivided into the CA1 stratum oriens (CA1-SO), CA1 dendritic fields (CA1-DF: stratum pyramidale, stratum radiatum, and stratum lacunosum-moleculare layers), and the dentate gyrus (DG). Plaque density measured as: 1) A\u03b2 staining area as a percentage of total ROI area; 2) number of total plaques per mm\n2\n; and 3) number of large plaques (>0.1\u2009mm\n2\n) per mm\n2\nwas quantified and compared by injury group and sex.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nRegions of interest in the coronal plane assessed for A\u03b2 plaque burden.

Figures adapted from Paxinos and Watson.\n25\nA\u03b2, \u03b2-amyloid.\nTechnical issues (i.e., tissue damage, staining artifacts, etc.) limited our ability to quantify A\u03b2 plaque pathology in individual ROIs from some animals in the rTBI24 and rTBI72 groups, resulting in different sample sizes for statistical comparisons of different regions. For the rTBI24 group, we were unable to obtain reliable bilateral measurements from selected animals for the entorhinal (\nn\n=\u20091), retrosplenial (\nn\n=\u20092), and parietal (\nn\n=\u20091) cortices.

Physiological and IHC endpoints were compared between injury groups using analysis of variance (ANOVA) or analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.

Patient 5 went through an additional 3 sessions (5 weeks of stimulation); the longer period was considered useful because of the low baseline motor score and advanced age. We delivered PAS to one hand and sham TMS combined with real PNS to the other hand. The stimulated hand was selected randomly (\nTable 2\n).

The first evaluation was done before, the second immediately after, and the third 1 month after the 4-week intervention (\nFig. 1\n). We calculated the differences between the first and second evaluation (change during 4-week stimulation), the second and third evaluation (change during the follow-up period), and the first and third evaluation (total change) for each muscle. The differences were averaged for the PAS and PNS hand of each patient, and the PAS-to-PNS ratio was counted from the averages (\nSupplementary Table 1\n).\nThe physiotherapist did not have access to the results of the previous evaluations. The muscles with a value of 5 before intervention (full strength) were not included in the analysis of the therapeutic effects.

In four patients, we analyzed the number of spasticity-related spikes from the electromyography (EMG) derived from MEP recordings. For each patient, 500-msec spontaneous EMG periods recorded immediately before the 15 TMS pulses, delivered with 3.3-sec intervals (altogether 7.5\u2009sec) were analyzed: from abductor pollicis brevis (APB), abductor digiti minimi (ADM), and brachioradialis (BR). The number of motor unit potentials exceeding the baseline EMG was calculated manually from the recordings. We ensured that the baseline was equal in all recordings.\n\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)\nWe administered TMS with an eXimia magnetic stimulator (Nexstim Ltd., Helsinki, Finland) with a figure-of-eight coil. The device incorporates a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based navigation system. Optimal stimulation sites for APB, ADM, and BR were defined by mapping the primary motor cortex. Spasticity-related EMG activity and movement artifacts resulting from the activation of off-target muscles with better-preserved innervation during mapping prevented an exact resting motor threshold (RMT) determination. Each patient was mapped at a wide range of stimulator output (SO) intensities; in muscles with an RMT over 100% SO we used muscle pre-activation, motor imagery, or both to elicit MEPs. High TMS intensities elicited MEPs from the muscles of interest more effectively, whereas at lower intensities, there were less movement artifacts. \u201cHot spots\u201d were determined as sites where MEPs were most consistently elicited at a wide range of intensities. For MEP latency determination, 15 TMS pulses were administered over the selected hot spot of each muscle. Sham TMS was performed with identical stimulation parameters by placing a 15-cm plastic separating block between the TMS coil and the patient's head.\n\nPeripheral nerve stimulation (PNS)\nPNS was given with a Dantec Keypoint\n\u00ae\nelectroneuromyography device (Natus Medical Inc., Pleasanton, CA) using surface electrodes (Neuroline 720; Ambu A/S, Ballerup, Denmark). We stimulated the median and ulnar nerves at the wrist, and radial nerve at the arm. For the photographs of the stimulation sites, please see the study by Shulga and colleagues.\n20\nIn radial nerve stimulation, the electrodes were manually pressed against the tissues to decrease the distance between the electrodes and the nerve; adequate stimulation was verified by observing the activation of the muscles innervated by the stimulated nerve. Stimulation intensity was individually adjusted for each nerve of each patient, and set to the minimum value reliably evoking the F-responses measured with single 1-msec pulses (see below). This was done to reliably ensure the activation of the motor fibers\n23\n(\nTable 2\n). PNS was administered in 50-Hz trains consisting of 6 biphasic 1-msec square wave pulses (that is, each train consisted of one pulse every 20\u2009msec during 100\u2009msec).\n20\nIn all patients, the stimulation elicited visible contractions of the muscles innervated by the stimulated nerves. All patients with well-preserved sensation (Patients 1\u20133 and 5) perceived PNS as unpleasant, especially during the first sessions. However, all patients quickly adapted to stimulation and tolerated it in subsequent sessions. Local skin anesthesia with EMLA\n23\nointment prior to stimulation was offered to patients; none of them wanted the anesthesia. No patients experienced autonomic dysreflexia symptoms during the stimulation.\n\nF-response measurements\nF-wave latencies, amplitudes, and persistence were determined from 10 F-responses recorded with the Dantec Keypoint\n\u00ae\ndevice (see above) using surface electrodes (Neuroline 720; Ambu A/S, Ballerup, Denmark). In stimulation we used 0.2-msec pulses at supramaximal intensity (i.e., increasing the intensity did not produce an additional increase in F-wave amplitude). The stimulating electrodes were placed as for PNS (see above). The recording electrodes were placed on APB for the median nerve, on ADM for the ulnar nerve, and on BR for the radial nerve. Thereafter, to individually select PNS intensity for each patient, we determined the minimal intensity eliciting detectable F-responses using single 1-msec pulses. During the measurements the temperature of the limb was >30\u00b0C.\n\nPAS/PNS-only sessions\nTMS and PNS were triggered by Presentation (Neurobehavioral Systems Inc., Albany, NY) software. PAS was given at 0.2\u2009Hz. The interstimulus interval (ISI) between TMS and PNS was determined individually for each patient on the basis of F-response and MEP latencies as described previously.\n20\n,\n23\n,\n25\nWe aimed at ISI\u2009=\u20090\u2009msec, that is, simultaneous arrival of TMS-evoked activation and the activation evoked by the first pulse of PNS train at the level of the corticospinal synapses of the cervical spinal cord. During PAS, we applied TMS at 100% SO, eliciting the highest possible amount of orthodromic volleys by a single TMS pulse.\n23\nHigh-intensity TMS pulses result in a high-frequency repetitive discharge of corticospinal neurons and this ensures multiple collisions of pre- and post-synaptic pulses at the spinal cord level.\n26\nFor sham TMS, we used 100% SO to ensure a similar noise level. Each 20-min PAS or PNS-only session comprised 240 PAS pulses or 240 PNS-only trains. During both PAS and PNS sessions, the patients were instructed to concentrate on the movement produced by the muscles innervated by the stimulated nerve. We hypothesized that motor imagery during PAS sessions lowers the RMT of the corresponding cortical representation area and thus increases the number of corticospinal volleys elicited by each TMS pulse. Each experimental session took 2\u2009h (PAS hand: 20\u2009min\u2009\u00d7\u20093 nerves and PNS hand: 20\u2009min\u2009\u00d7\u20093 nerves), excluding the time for preparation.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error. Statistical significance was assessed by Wilcoxon signed rank tests with IBM SPSS Statistics 22 software."

    "Methods": "Animals and surgical procedures\nStudies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Pittsburgh. The PND 17 male Sprague-Dawley rats (35\u201340\u2009g) were purchased from Harlan (Madison, WI) and allowed to acclimate for at least one week before injury. Animals were housed in litters with their dam in a temperature controlled room with lighting on a 12\u2009h day/night schedule with dams having access to standard chow and water\nad libitum\n.\nSeparate squadrons of rats were used for assessment of HMGB1 translocation (\nn\n=\u20093\u20134/group, 10 rats total), seven day immunohistochemical studies (\nn\n=\u20093/group, nine rats total), and functional outcome and 14 day histological assessment (\nn\n=\u200910\u201311/group, 32 rats total).\nThe CCI model of TBI was performed as described previously.\n23\nBriefly, animals were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and 2:1\u2009N\n2\nO/O\n2\nblend via nosecone, then placed in a modified stereotactic frame with ear bars to stabilize the head. Core temperature was maintained at 37.5\u201338\u00b0C measured via rectal temperature probe. A 6.5-mm diameter craniotomy was performed in the left parietal bone using a high-speed air drill. The injury was performed for all experiments using a 6-mm diameter impact tip, velocity of 4\u2009m/sec, depth of 2.5\u2009mm, and dwell time of 50\u2009msec. After CCI, the bone flap was replaced and secured with Koldmount dental cement (Vernon-Benshoff, Albany, NY). Shams received anesthesia and craniotomy without CCI. Pups were allowed to recover in a warmed cubicle and subsequently transferred back to their dams.\n\nMinocycline treatment\nRats were block randomized after CCI or sham injury to treatment with minocycline or vehicle. Animals randomized to treatment with minocycline (Sigma, St Louis, MO) received 0.9% saline 90\u2009mg/kg ip at 10\u2009min after injury and a second dose of 90\u2009mg/kg ip at 20\u2009h. Rats randomized to vehicle received an equal volume of 0.9% saline ip at the same time points.\n\nProtein fractionation and Western blotting\nAt 24\u2009h after injury, PND 17 rats were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with 50\u2009mL of heparinized saline. This time point was chosen to coincide with the peak period of HMGB1 translocation observed in other studies of brain injury.\n11\n,\n24\nThe hemisphere ipsilateral to injury was homogenized in a dounce homogenizer with lysis buffer containing 20\u2009mM HEPES (pH 7.8), 10\u2009mM NaCl, 1.5\u2009mM MgCl\n2\n, 1\u2009mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 1\u2009mM EGTA, 250\u2009mM sucrose, 1\u2009mM dithiothreitol, 1\u2009mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, and 2\u2009\u03bcg/mL aprotinin. The cytosolic fraction was isolated by differential centrifugation using standard technique. Briefly, samples were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 30\u2009min, then centrifuged at 3500\u2009rpm for 15\u2009min at 4\u00b0C to remove nuclei and cellular debris. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 48,000\u2009rpm for 17\u2009min at 4\u00b0C to remove the mitochondrial fraction. The supernatant, containing enriched cytosolic protein, was stored at \u221280\u00b0C for further analysis.\nImmunoblotting was performed using standard technique. Briefly, samples were thawed and 20\u2009\u03bcg aliquots, as determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay, were mixed with 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009Laemmli Sample Buffer (BioRad, Hercules, CA), heated at 95\u00b0C for 5\u2009min, loaded onto pre-cast TGX 12% gels (Bio-Rad), and proteins separated electrophoretically. Transfer onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (PVDF) (Millipore Immobilon, Cat#ISEQ00010, Bedford, MA) was performed at 100V for 75\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. The membrane was washed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; Bio-Rad)-0.1%-Tween-20 (TBST) and blocked 1\u2009h in TBST +5% blotting grade milk (TBS-T/milk).\nThe membrane was incubated with monoclonal primary antibody against HMGB1 (1:1000; MAB1690, R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN) in TBS-T/milk overnight at 4\u00b0C, washed, and then incubated in appropriate secondary antibody in TBS-T/milk for 2\u2009h at room temperature. Blots were incubated with Supersignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo Scientific, Cat#34095, Rockford, IL), imaged on BioRad Chemi Doc XRS+ imaging system, and band intensity analyzed by ImageLab software (Version 4.0, BioRad). The membrane was then stripped with Restore\n\u2122\nWestern Blot Stripping Buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) according to manufacturer instructions and reprobed for \u03b2-actin (1:2000, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and Histone H3 (1:2000, Abcam) using the methods above.\n\nFunctional outcomes\nMotor function\nRats were assessed for motor function using the beam balance and inclined plane tasks for five days after injury. Before CCI, the rats were pre-trained to remain on a 1.5\u2009cm wide and 90\u2009cm high wooden beam for 60\u2009sec for three consecutive trials. Testing consisted of three trials per day for five days. For the inclined plane, the rats were pre-trained to remain on a wide board set to incline for 10\u2009sec at 70 degrees for three consecutive trials. Post-injury, animals were placed on the board at 45 degrees and the angle was increased in 5-degree increments to a maximum angle of 80 degrees. We recorded the maximum angle at which the rat could remain on the board for 10\u2009sec given three attempts.\nCognitive function\nSpatial memory acquisition was assessed using the Morris-water maze (MWM) as described previously. Briefly, rats underwent testing on day 10\u201314 after injury for latency to find the hidden platform. Probe and visible platform trials were performed on day 14 to assess memory retention and for visual deficits. The water maze consists of a pool that is 180\u2009cm in diameter and 60\u2009cm high. The pool was filled with water (26\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C in temperature) to a depth of 28\u2009cm. A platform that is 10\u2009cm in diameter and set 2\u2009cm below the surface of the water was used as the hidden platform. The pool was located in a 2.5\u2009\u00d7\u20092.5\u2009m room with visual cues that remained constant throughout the experiment.\n\nHistological assessment\nSeven days after CCI, rats were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with 50\u2009mL heparinized ice-cold saline followed by 50\u2009mL 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. The brain was removed and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24\u2009h. Paraffin-embedded brains were cut into 5-\u03bcm coronal sections for immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Fluoro-Jade-B (FJB) staining was performed by removing paraffin in a series of xylene, immersed twice in 100% ethanol (EtOH) and 1% sodium hydroxide (in 80% EtOH) for 90\u2009sec, and then 70% EtOH for 30\u2009sec. Slides were placed on a shaker in 0.06% potassium permanganate for 10\u2009min and washed in distilled water before immersion in a 0.006% working solution of FJB (Histo-Chem Inc., Jefferson, AR) with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma, St Louis, MO) for 30\u2009min. Slides were imaged with a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope.\nIba-1 immunohistochemistry was performed using standard technique. Briefly, sections were deparaffinized and placed in 2% H\n2\nO\n2\nfor 20\u2009min and blocked with 3% normal goat serum (Vector, Burlingame, CA) in TBS containing 0.25% Triton X for 1\u2009h. Sections were incubated overnight in TBS-X solution containing rabbit anti-Iba-1 antibody (1:1000, Wako Chemicals, Osaka, Japan). The sections were then incubated for 1\u2009h with anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (ABC Elite Kit, Vector) and stained with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB, Vector). Slides were imaged using a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope and Iba-1 positive objects counted within the ipsilateral hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebral cortex.\nLate histological outcome\nAt 14 days after the insult, on completion of MWM testing, the rats were re-anesthetized and perfused as above. The brains were cryoprotected in 15% and 30% sucrose solution and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Serial coronal 40\u2009\u03bcm thick sections were taken every 160\u2009\u03bcm through the entire contusion using a cryotome, mounted on slides, and stained with cresyl violet. Image analysis software (MCID; Imaging Research, Saint Catherines, Ontario, Canada) was used to analyze lesion volumes as described previously.\n25\nTo assess neuronal loss, unbiased stereology was performed to count the total number of surviving neurons present 14 days after injury. The two-stage combination of optical dissector and Cavalieri volume-point counting methods was used as described previously.\n26\nTo generate an unbiased sample, every other section was sampled from eight sections containing the dorsal hippocampus. Stereologer software (Stereology Resource Center, Chester, MD) was used. The optical dissector had a size of 50\u2009\u00d7\u200950\u2009\u03bcm, a height of 10\u2009\u03bcm, and a guard-zone of 4\u2009\u03bcm. A grid spacing of 500\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u2009500\u2009\u03bcm in the x- and y-axis was used. The estimated number of surviving neurons in each field was divided by the volume of the region of interest to obtain the neuronal cellular density. Sampling had a coefficient of error \u22640.1.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using Prism 6 (Graphpad, La Jolla, CA). Behavioral data were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). When the overall ANOVA revealed a significant effect, the data were further analyzed with the Fisher\npost-hoc\ntest to determine specific group differences. All other data were analyzed by Student\nt\ntest. All data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean. A\np\n-value <0.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "High school and collegiate football players were recruited from Project Head to Head-II, an ongoing prospective study of SRC in athletes from southeastern Wisconsin. Baseline, pre-season enrollment of 546 athletes occurred prior to the 2015 football season and included the collection of blood biospecimens from all athletes. Exclusion criteria included any contraindication to study procedures, injury that would preclude participation in the study protocol, current psychotic disorder, current narcotic use, and history or suspicion of conditions known to cause cognitive dysfunction (e.g., epilepsy, moderate-to-severe TBI). Adult participants and parents of minors provided written informed consent; minors completed written assent. The institutional review board at the principal investigator's institution approved the study.\n\nOf the 546 athletes enrolled at baseline, 32 sustained a concussion during the 2015\u20132016 football season and were evaluated within 6\u2009h, 24\u201348\u2009h, and 8, 15, and 45 days post-concussion. Initial identification and diagnosis of concussion was determined by certified athletic trainers and/or team physicians at each institution. Study investigators then screened and triaged all injuries to confirm that they met study definition and requirements. The study definition of concussion was based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention HEADS UP educational initiative:An injury resulting from a forceful bump, blow or jolt to the head that results in rapid movement of the head and causes a change in the athlete's behavior, thinking, physical functioning, or the following symptoms: headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness/balance problems, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, drowsiness, sensitivity to light/noise, blurred vision, memory difficulty, and difficulty concentrating.Clinical reads of MRI scans conducted by neuroradiologists on data collected at 24\u201348-h, 8 days, 15 days, and 45 days post-injury as part of the broader study protocol revealed no acute intracranial lesions in any concussed athlete.\n\nTwenty-nine healthy football athletes matched on institution, sport team, sex, age, education, intellectual functioning, grade point average, race, and concussion history participated in similar follow-up visits as concussed athletes and served as controls. Two football athletes were injured while enrolled in the control protocol and their injured and control data are treated as independent data points. Given the focus of this study on performance of blood biomarkers during the acute injury phase, data from the pre-season, 6\u2009h, and 24\u201348\u2009h time points were analyzed. The demographic characteristics of each group and sample size at each time point can be found inTable 1.\n\nBehavioral battery\nAll participants completed a comprehensive interview and questionnaire at pre-season, which gathered concussion and health history and demographic information. The Sport Concussion Assessment Tool \u2013 3rd Edition (SCAT3) symptom checklist was collected at each visit and used to characterize concussion symptom severity (range from 0 to 132; higher scores reflecting greater symptom burden).\n27\nThe Wechsler Test of Adult Reading was administered at the preseason visit to provide an estimate of intellectual functioning.\n28\n\nBiomarker data\nVenous blood was collected using Red Top BD Vacutainer tubes, left to clot at room temperature for 30\u2009min, and centrifuged at 1,500 relative centrifugal force (RCF) for 15\u2009min.

    "Methods": "Two healthy male human subjects wore instrumented mouthguards36\u201338during roller coaster rides, running, and soccer headers to measure head kinematics during these activities. We then used the measured head kinematics to drive a rigid body model28and a finite element model32to estimate the displacement and strain experienced by the brain.\n\nSubjects\nTwo healthy male human subjects were recruited for this pilot study. At the time of the study, Subject A was 26 years old, with a height of 167\u2009cm, weight of 65.8\u2009kg, neck length of 12.5\u2009cm, neck circumference of 37cm, and head circumference of 59\u2009cm. Subject B was also 26 years old, with a height of 175\u2009cm, weight of 59.0\u2009kg, neck length of 12.5\u2009cm, neck circumference of 35\u2009cm, and head circumference of 57.5\u2009cm. Neck length was measured from the C7 spinous process to the tragus of the ear, neck circumference was measured perpendicular to the long axis of the neck above the thyroid cartilage, and head circumference was measured passing through the superciliary ridge and the opisthocranion.\n39\n\nMeasuring head kinematics\nWe used our previously validated instrumented mouthguard\n36\u201338\n(\nFig. 1A\n) to measure head kinematics during roller coaster rides, running, and soccer headers. We custom designed the instrumented mouthguard to fit tightly to the upper dentition of each human subject. This provided tight coupling of the sensors to the skull through the maxilla compared with other sensors mounted on either headgear or the skin. We equipped the instrumented mouthguard with a triaxial accelerometer (H3LIS331DL) and a triaxial gyroscope (ITG3500A) to measure the linear acceleration and angular velocity of the head at 1000\u2009Hz for the entire duration of each activity.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nUse of instrumented mouthguards to record head kinematics during roller coaster rides.\n(A)\nMouthguard,\n(B)\nlinear acceleration of the head during the entire duration of a roller coaster ride, and\n(C)\ncomparison of roller coaster accelerations with running and soccer heading.\n\nMeasured activities\nEach subject participated in three roller coaster rides at a local amusement park. The roller coaster data collection was a research practicum that did not fall under the purview of the institutional review board (IRB), given the fact that roller coaster rides are a common recreational activity, and the pilot nature of the study. One subject also participated in mild soccer header impacts, which was approved under Stanford IRB #26620. Both subjects wore the instrumented mouthguard to measure head kinematics. Subjects sat side by side during roller coaster rides, which were among the most thrilling rides at the amusement park and had advertised\ng\nforces up to 4.5\ng\n. Additionally, both subjects performed a 3\u2009min run at an \u223c9\u2009min mile pace, which was selected as a representative everyday activity that was considered safe for the brain. The soccer headers represented mild sports head impacts and were delivered using a ball launcher (Soccer Tutor, Burbank, CA) with a ball speed of 7.0\u2009m/sec, which is the average speed for headers in youth.\n37\n\nKinematics post-processing\nWe transformed the raw head linear acceleration and angular velocity kinematics from the mouthguard into a head-fixed anatomical frame and projected to the head's center of gravity, with x in the posterior-anterior direction, y in the right-left direction, and z in the inferior-superior direction. We filtered the linear acceleration signals using a fourth order Butterworth low pass filter with a CFC180 300\u2009Hz cutoff frequency and filtered the angular velocity signals using a fourth order Butterworth low pass filter with a 184\u2009Hz cutoff frequency according to the device's bandwidth. The linear acceleration and angular velocity filters have been shown to be sufficient for measuring impacts in American football,\n38\n,\n40\nwhich likely have higher frequency content than head motions observed during roller coaster rides. We obtained the angular accelerations by differentiating the angular velocity signals using a five point stencil.\n17\nWe computed peak linear acceleration magnitude, peak change in angular velocity, and peak angular acceleration magnitude for each roller coaster ride and each activity.\n\nRigid body simulation of brain displacements\nTo estimate brain displacements throughout the entire time course of these activities, we performed a rigid body simulation of brain motion within the skull. We modeled the gross motion of the brain using a rigid body representation of the brain\u2013skull interaction with dynamic elements representing the connective tissue.\n28\nWe used a previously developed sagittal plane rigid body brain model developed based on\nin vivo\nMRI images of mild head impacts and validated against cadaver impacts.\n26\nBecause the rigid body model had only been rigorously validated in the sagittal plane, we only used sagittal plane kinematics to drive the rigid body simulation. Because our sagittal plane simulation does not include out-of-plane kinematics, it only provides a surrogate measure to estimate the temporal evolution of the brain displacement with respect to the skull to identify the most critical 100\u2009ms window for the finite element simulation. Using input kinematics from the roller coaster rides, running, and the soccer header activities, we calculated the maximum brain displacement and peak brain velocity at the superior boundary between the brain and skull over the entire time course of the activities. To probe the sensitivity of the maximum brain displacements with respect to varying brain stiffness and varying brain mass, we performed additional rigid body simulation with 80% and 120% of the initial stiffness and of the initial mass for all three rides.\n\nFinite element simulation of brain strains\nTo estimate local brain deformations, we performed finite element simulations using the KTH brain model.\n32\nThe KTH brain model includes an anatomically detailed discretization of the scalp, the skull, the brain, the meninges, the cerebrospinal fluid, 11 pairs of the largest parasagittal bridging veins, and a simple neck with the extension of the spinal cord and the dura mater, with 7128 hexahedral elements in the brain. We used the linear accelerations and angular velocities from the three roller coaster rides, running, and soccer headers as input to the simulation and predicted the deformation field across the brain using the finite element software LS-DYNA (Livermore Software Technology Corporation, Livermore, CA). Because three-dimensional finite element simulations require substantial computational cost and the finite element brain model is not validated for long-duration simulations, we restricted our simulations to selected 100\u2009ms intervals from each activity. For the roller coaster rides and for the running activities, we selected five 100\u2009ms windows that included the largest brain displacements as predicted by the rigid body model. For the soccer header activity, we programmed the mouthguards to only record impact kinematics over a 100\u2009ms period during the head impact. Once the simulations were completed, we processed the results using LS PrePost (Livermore Software Technology Corporation, Livermore, CA). As indicators for brain injury incidence in contact sports, we computed the peak maximum principal Green\u2013Lagrange strains and strain rates from each simulation.\n17\n,\n21\nIn addition, we extracted the engineering strains in the bridging veins and compared them against reported values for bridging vein failure.\n41\nTo probe the sensitivity of the maximum brain strains with respect to varying brain stiffness and varying simulation window size, we performed additional finite element simulation with 80% and 120% of the initial stiffness and 140\u2009ms and 180\u2009ms simulation windows by adding 20\u2009ms and 40\u2009ms at the beginning and end of each simulation for all three rides."

    "Methods": "Materials\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats (275\u2013300\u2009g) were purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN). Antibodies to neuronal nucleus (NeuN; Millipore, Billerica, MA) and CaMKII\u03b1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) were obtained for use in these studies. An FD Rapid GolgiStain Kit was purchased from FD Neurotechnologies (Columbia, MD).\n\nLateral fluid percussion injury\nAll experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were conducted in accord with the recommendations provided in the\nGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\n. Protocols were designed to minimize pain and discomfort during the injury procedure and recovery. Lateral FPI was carried out similar to that described previously.\n17\u201319\nBriefly, rats were initially anesthetized using 5% isoflurane with a 1:1\u2009N\n2\nO/O\n2\nmixture and then maintained with a 2.5% isoflurane with 1:1\u2009air/O\n2\nmixture by a face mask. Animals were mounted on the stereotaxic frame; a 4.8-mm-diameter craniotomy was carefully made midway between bregma and lambda. The craniotomy used for hub placement was centered at 4.4\u2009mm from midline, placing the epicenter of the injury over the right parietal cortex. A hub (modified from a 20-gauge needle) was implanted into the burr hole and affixed to the skull by contact adhesive and dental cement. Once the assembly was secured, the rat was removed from the anesthesia and allowed to regain its toe pinch reflex. Immediately upon regaining this reflex, the rat was injured using an FPI device and a pressure of 1.5 atmosphere (atm) over base room pressure. Previous studies have shown that this injury magnitude does not cause visible brain damage, nor overt hippocampal damage, but does cause axonal injury as detected by diffusion tensor imaging.\n20\nAcute neurological responses were recorded post-injury. On average, injured animals regain their response to toe pinch at 72.4\u2009\u00b1\u20095.6\u2009sec, tail pain reflexes by 100.1\u2009\u00b1\u20095.3\u2009sec, and their righting response (ability to right itself three consecutive times after being placed on its back) by 387\u2009\u00b1\u200911.2\u2009sec. By comparison, sham-operated animals require only 36.3\u2009\u00b1\u20098.4\u2009sec to regain their righting response (after subtraction of the tail pinch reflex). Post-injury, the hub and surrounding dental cement were immediately removed and the incision closed by wound clips. Sham-operated animals received all the aforementioned surgical procedures except hub implantation and the injury. Animals' body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C during the surgery using a rectal thermometer coupled to a heating pad.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nTwo weeks after injury or sham operation, rats were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (100\u2009mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed, post-fixed overnight in perfusant, then cryoprotected in a 30% sucrose solution. Tissue sections (40\u2009\u03bcm in thickness) were generated using a Leica CM 1950 cryostat (Leica Biosystems Nussloch GmbH, Nussloch, Germany), and stored in PBS at 4\u00b0C until needed. Free-floating slices were incubated overnight in primary antibody (0.5\u20131.0\u2009\u03bcg/mL) in 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS containing 2% bovine serum album and 2.5% normal goat serum at 4\u00b0C. After extensive washing, immunoreactivity was detected using species-specific secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and developed using diaminobenzadine as the chromagen.\n\nStereological cell counts\nA blind counting methodology was used for determination of neuronal density in the IL. Sections spanning the rostral-caudal extent of the IL were chosen and immunostained as described above. Immuno-positive cells were counted using the optical dissector technique and\nStereo Investigator\n(MicroBrightField Bioscience, Williston, VT).\n21\nThe IL was identified based on its relative position to major landmarks, such as the forceps minor and genu of the corpus callosum, and the nucleus accumbens as indicated in Paxinos and Watson.\n22\nThe IL was further differentiated from the pre-limbic cortex because of its thinner shape and fewer, less well-defined cortical layers.\n23\nThe periphery of the IL was carefully outlined and the number of labeled cells in approximately 20 computer-chosen areas scored for each section by a blinded observer. The counting frame was 60\u2009\u00d7\u200960\u2009\u03bcm. The size of the counting frame and the number of grid sections were determined based on preliminary cell counts. Cells in the outermost planes of focus were omitted to avoid counting cell caps. The number of labeled cells/mm\n2\nfor each section was obtained from the estimated cells divided by the contour area. The number of cells/mm\n2\nfor each animal was calculated as the average of the number of cells/mm\n2\nfrom each section examined.\n\nContext fear conditioning and extinction\nBeginning on day 28 post-injury, rats were trained in a one-trial fear conditioning task. Rats were placed in the training chamber and allowed to freely explore their new surroundings for a period of 2\u2009min. Freezing behavior was monitored (in 2-sec increments) throughout the 2-min period by an observer blinded to the injury status of the animals. A 2-sec, 0.7-mA footshock was then delivered. Thirty seconds after the footshock, rats were removed from the training chamber and returned to their home cage. Twenty-four hours later, fear memory was tested by placing the animal back in the training chamber for a period of 3\u2009min and scoring freezing behavior. Extinction training was carried out 24\u2009h after fear memory testing by placing the animal in the training chamber for a period of 10\u2009min. Freezing behavior was monitored throughout the extinction period. Twenty-four hours later, memory for the extinction was tested as described above.\n\nRapid Golgi staining\nRapid Golgi staining was performed using a Rapid GolgiStain kit (FD Neuro Technologies, Ellicot City, MD) following the procedures recommended by the manufacturer. Thirty-two days post-injury (after the completion of extinction memory testing), animals were killed by decapitation, brains were quickly extracted, and the frontal lobe removed while submerged in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid. The frontal lobe was rinsed in ice-cold water, then cut into 5-mm slabs. Slabs were immersed in silver impregnation solution for 2 weeks in the dark, followed by immersion in \u201cSolution C\u201d for an additional week. Next, 150-\u03bcm-thick serial sections spanning the rostral-caudal extent of the IL were cut on a cryostat. Sections were mounted on 3% gelatin-coated slides and allowed to dry overnight. Development was carried out as described by the vendor, followed by fixation in 1% glutaraldehyde for 1\u2009h. Sections were rinsed then dehydrated using an alcohol series and clarified using xylene before cover-slipping with Permount (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA). Silver-impregnated layer II/III and V/VI pyramidal neurons in the IL were identified by their characteristic triangular cell soma with a prominent apical dendrite projecting toward the superficial layers of the cortex. Layer II/III was identified as the neuron dense subcortical layer proximal to the neuron sparse layer I, whereas layer V/VI was identified by the presence of pyramidal neurons with relatively larger cell bodies. Five pyramidal neurons in the IL ipsilateral to the injury per animal were chosen randomly (\nn\n=\u20095 for both injured and sham animals). The number of spines on first- to fourth-order apical and basal dendrites were counted by observers blind to the group designations. To be included in the analysis, the dendritic branch had to be at least 25\u2009\u03bcm in length. The number of spines was divided by the length of the dendrite to give spine density.\n\nStatistical analysis\nCell counts between sham and mFPI animals were statistically compared using a Student's\nt\n-test for unpaired groups. Evaluation of spine density was compared using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Group main and interactions (group\u2009\u00d7\u2009branch order) were considered to be statistically different at\np\n<\u20090.05. For evaluation of behavioral data, repeated measures (RM) ANOVAs (two-way or one-way as appropriate) and\nt\n-tests were utilized to determine statistical differences. A Holm-Sidak method for multiple comparisons post-hoc test was used to determine data points with significant differences. For data that did not pass a Shapiro-Wilk normality test, appropriate nonparametric analysis was performed. Data were considered significant at\np\n\u2264\u20090.05 and presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean."

    "Methods": "Ethical approval\nAll procedures were conducted according to the Canadian Council for Animal Care. Ethical approval was also obtained from the University of British Columbia.\n\nExperimental design\nThe experiment was conducted on 24 male Wistar rats (age\u2009=\u20099 weeks, mass\u2009=\u2009300\u2013350\u2009g; Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN). Animals were randomly assigned to one of two groups: uninjured control (CON;\nn\n=\u200913) or T2 SCI (SCI;\nn\n=\u200911).\nIn vivo\nechocardiography was used to investigate temporal changes in cardiac structure and function at pre-injury at day 7 and day 30 post-injury. On day 31, a subset of animals (\nn\n=\u20095 per group) underwent pressure-volume catheterization via a right common carotid artery approach to assess load-independent LV function. Further, these animals were harvested for fresh tissue, which was subsequently used for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. The remaining animals were used for cardiac immunohistochemistry to investigate structural changes at the myocyte and sarcomeric level.\n\nSpinal cord surgery and animal care\nAnimals were treated prophylactically with enrofloxacin (Baytril\u2122; 10\u2009mg kg\n\u22121\n,\nS.C.\n; Associated Veterinary Purchasing [AVP], Langley, Canada) 3 days prior to surgery. For spinal injury contusion, surgery animals were prepped (surgical site shaved, cleaned, sterilized) and anesthetized with isoflurane (initial chamber induction at 4% isoflurane with 2l min\n\u22121\noxygen, followed by maintenance on a Bain's system at 1.5\u20132% isoflurane with 1.5\u20132l min\n\u22121\noxygen). A dorsal midline incision was made and the superficial and deep paraspinal musculature dissected. A T2 laminectomy was performed. Following this the T1 and T3 vertebrae were clamped with modified Allis forceps. Forceps were secured in place with locking universal joints and mounted on a secure metal stage. After proper alignment, the animal was injured at the T2 spinal segment with 400 kdyn of predefined force (5\u2009sec dwell) using the Infinite Horizons Impactor (2.5-mm tip), as this severity of injury has been shown to produce a similar reduction in afterload and pre-load to that observed in the high-thoracic and cervical SCI clinical population.\n16\nPost-operative management included enrofloxacin (10\u2009mg kg\n\u22121\n,\nS.C.\n), buprenorphine (0.02\u2009mg kg\n\u22121\n,\nS.C.\n) and ketoprofen (5\u2009mg kg\n\u22121\n,\nS.C.\n) every 12\u2009h for 3 days post-operatively. As we have previously described, this injury resulted in a sustained inability to weight bear on the hindlimbs and a near complete loss of all descending sympatho-excitatory neurons; however, animals were able to freely use their forelimbs and showed no other signs of distress (i.e., feeding well, no hunching, socialization with cage mates).\n16\nManual bladder expression was continued for approximately one week post-injury, until animals regained spontaneous voiding.\n17\n\nIn vivo\nechocardiography\nTo assess temporal changes in cardiac structure and function, echocardiography was performed as described in detail elsewhere.\n8\nAnimals were placed under isoflurane anesthesia for all imaging (initial chamber induction at 4% isoflurane with 2l min\n\u22121\noxygen, followed by maintenance on a Bain's system at 1.5\u20132% isoflurane with 1.5\u20132l min\n\u22121\noxygen). LV structure and systolic function (i.e., stroke volume, ejection fraction) were assessed using M-mode echocardiography, and diastolic function was assessed using pulsed-wave Doppler during an apical four-chamber view. Estimated volumes were calculated according to the Teichholz method.\n8\nReported results were quantified by a blinded experimenter using commercially available software (Echopac; GE Healthcare, Horton, Norway) and determined from the average of five cardiac cycles during expiration.\n\nPressure-volume catheterization\nTo further determine inherent changes in LV pressure and volume indices as well as conduct a novel investigation into load-independent cardiac function, LV function was assessed\nin vivo\nunder isoflurane anesthesia using a pressure-volume (PV) conductance catheter (SPR-869, Millar, Inc., Houston, TX) inserted directly into the LV via a closed-chest right common carotid artery approach according to standard guidelines.\n12\nThe pre-soaked catheter (for 30\u2009min in physiological saline solution) was left in the carotid artery for 10\u2009min to allow hemodynamic stabilization and for the determination of arterial blood pressure, which was subsequently used to examine the low frequency power spectrum component as a measure of sympathetic influence.\n18\nFollowing this, the catheter was advanced into the LV under pressure guidance until the PV signal was visualized and subsequently optimized. After stabilization of the LV PV signal basal PV data were collected for 10\u2009min after which dobutamine (dobutamine,\nI.V.\n, Hospira, Inc., Lake Forest, IL), a specific beta-1 agonist, was infused in a step-wise manner via catheterization of the tail vein to mimic a sympatho-excitatory response. Following the return of all indices to pre-dobutamine, baseline cardiac pre-load was manipulated via complete inferior vena cava occlusions for the measurement of load-independent outcomes (i.e., end-systolic elastance [Ees], end-diastolic PV relationship [EDPVR], pre-load recruitable stroke work [PRSW], dP/dt-EDV). Briefly, a midline laparotomy was performed and the inferior vena cava isolated immediately caudal to the liver. Occlusions were performed using a cotton-tipped applicator. Data analysis was conducted in Labchart 8.1 (ADInstruments, Inc., Colorado Springs, CO) using the built-in PV loop analyses program.\n\nFresh tissue and qPCR\nFollowing PV measures, animals were sacrificed (overdose isoflurane and thoracotomy), the heart was excised, the great vessels were removed, and the heart was weighed for the determination of wet heart mass, at which point the harvested hearts were preserved at \u221280\u00b0C. To assess gene transcription changes in the LV between groups, total ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted from the left ventricle using Trizol\n\u00ae\nreagent with the PureLink\n\u00ae\nRNA Mini Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The purity and concentration of the isolated RNA were checked using a NanoDrop\u2122 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). Subsequently, 5\u2009\u03bcg of total RNA was reverse transcribed into complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) using the SuperScript\n\u00ae\nVILO\u2122 cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Real-time qPCR was carried out on the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System, using the SYBR\n\u00ae\nGreen PCR Master-Mix Kit (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Group comparisons were drawn using the 2\n-\u0394C\nT\nmethod according to recommended guidelines.\n19\nSupplementary Table 1\ncontains the list of the primers used in this study (see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). Targets included were: collagen (Col), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1), alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2), transforming growth factor beta receptor (TGF-\u03b2R), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), angiotensinogen (AGT), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), type 1a angiotensin II receptor (AgtR1a), beta-1 adrenergic receptor (B1R), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), nerve growth factor (NGF), and muscle LIM protein (MLP). \u03b2-actin was used as the reference gene.\n\nTissue processing and immunohistochemistry\nTissue processing\nAnimals were overdosed with isoflurane (5% isoflurane with 2l min\n\u22121\noxygen) and underwent a thoracotomy. Hearts were arrested with \u223c150\u2009mg KCl, and perfused with an aortic approach to preserve the LV with 500\u2009mL of 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and fixed with 500\u2009mL of 4% formaldehyde in PBS. Hearts were immediately dissected\n8\nand prepared for immunohistological analysis according to our previously described methods.\n16\nImmunohistochemistry\nSections were thawed for 1\u2009h at room temperature and pap-penned, followed by rehydration in 0.1\u2009M PBS for 10\u2009min. Sections were then incubated with 10% normal donkey serum for 30\u2009min. After removal of normal donkey serum, sections were incubated in primary antibody prepared in 0.1M PBS-Triton overnight at room temperature. The next morning three 10-min 0.1M PBS washes were done to remove the primary antibodies, after which they were incubated with secondary antibodies for 2\u2009h. Sections were then cover-slipped using Immuno Mount\u2122 and stored at 4\u00b0C. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-\u03b1 actinin (\u03b1A, 1:100; Abcam, ab68167) to stain the z-disks of cardiomyocytes, and to measure cell width, and goat anti-connexin 43/GJA1 (CX, 1:250; Cedarlane, NBP1-51938), to identify the end plates and thus calculate cardiomyocyte length. Secondary antibodies used were: Alexa Fluor\n\u00ae\n647 Donkey Anti Goat (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch, 705-606-147), Alexa Fluor 594 Donkey Anti Rabbit (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch, 711-586-152), and Hoechst Reagent (1:1000).\nImaging\nImmunofluorescence was digitally imaged using an Axioplan 2 microscope (Zeiss) and AxioVision 4.8 ZEN Blue (Zeiss) was used for all digital image capture procedures. Post-processing was completed using ImageJ (ImageJ, National Institutes of Health) software.\n\nQuantification of immunolabeling\nMyocyte length quantification\nAll cardiomyocyte measurements were taken from the mid-ventricular level of the LV free wall. Myocyte length was determined by taking the distance between two CX-labeled end plates and confirmed by the localization of at least one nucleus between these two sites. Five myocytes were measured per 20x image, for a total of 30 measured myocytes per animal, which were subsequently averaged for each animal.\nZ-disk width quantification\nZ-disk width was estimated based on the width of individual \u03b1A labels. Ten individual measurements were made per 20x image, for a total of 60 estimations of z-disk width per animal. These 60 estimations were subsequently averaged for each animal. Myocyte length/width ratio was then calculated.\nSarcomere length quantification\nTo measure individual sarcomere lengths, the distance between two \u03b1A was utilized. Specifically, the measurement was taken from the inner border of one \u03b1A and continued to the inner border of the next \u03b1A. Ten individual measurements were made per 20x image and averaged, as above. Based on the average myocyte length and sarcomere length for each animal, the number of sarcomeres per myocyte was then estimated.\n\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical analyses and all graphical representations of data were made using GraphPad Prism 6 and all immunohistochemical images were taken using ZEN Blue (Zeiss). All basal cardiac and immunohistochemical data were analyzed using independent samples\nt\ntest or repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), as appropriate. Data are presented in text as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation and visualized using mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error. Significant main or interaction ANOVA effects were further investigated using Sidak's post hoc testing. Load-independent cardiac data were analyzed using mixed-model regression analyses (STATA v12.1), as recommended in the literature.\n20\nThe significance level for all statistical tests was set at\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Data sources for population projections and tSCI incidences\nThe population estimates for the years 1971 to 2009 and the population projections for the years 2010 to 2032 were obtained from the Demography Division of Statistics Canada.\n22\nThe population projection scenario chosen was M4 (medium growth) in which medium values were assumed for fertility, life expectancy, and immigration.\nRecords for tSCI cases identified by specific\nInternational Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems,\n10th Revision (ICD 10), external cause of injury codes (E codes)\n23\nwere obtained from the National Trauma Registry (NTR) in Discharge Abstract Database (DAD) at CIHI.\n21\nThe DAD contained records of the patients who were discharged from all acute care hospitals including those who died during admission but not those who died before admission. Data for acute admissions in Quebec were not included because their provincial trauma registry was not linked to CIHI. Information on the age and gender were collected to calculate the age- and gender-specific injury rates for each province.\n\nTraumatic SCI incidence projection\nTo project provincial tSCI incidence, injury rates were applied to the population projection. To obtain outcome estimates relevant to the Incidence Forecasting Model (IFM) of the ACT Model,\n24\nonly patients with tSCI admitted to a designated SCI acute facility (RHSCIR facility) were considered, of which six facilities across Canada were included in the present study. To estimate the future tSCI admissions to a RHSCIR acute facility, the number of admissions to a RHSCIR facility was divided by the provincial injury rates of the same time range, which was then applied to the projected provincial tSCI incidence. Each facility had its own time range. All analyses were performed using SAS software, Version 9.3 of the SAS System for Windows (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).\n\nValidation of 2012\u2009tSCI incidence projection\nAt the initiation of this analysis in 2009, projections were calculated for 2012 and 2032. In the interest of validating our projection, actual numbers of acute admissions were obtained from RHSCIR for the year 2012 and compared with the projected numbers.\n\nForecasting healthcare costs and outcomes with ACT Modeling\nThe projected tSCI admissions for the years 2012 and 2032, encoded with the age and gender distribution of patients, were used as inputs for the ACT Model. The development of the ACT Model has been described elsewhere.\n25\n,\n26\nThe outputs from the ACT Model used in this study included: system outcomes (acute length of stay [LOS], probability of rehabilitation admission, and rehabilitation LOS); patient outcomes (probability of inhospital death, life expectancy [number of years lived by the person post-tSCI], life years lost [compared with life expectancy for uninjured persons of the same age], quality-adjusted life years [QALYs, dependent on neurological level and presence of secondary complications]); and costs (inhospital care costs [based on a fixed cost for basic physician services, total number of acute and rehabilitation days, and on neurology],\n3\n,\n27\nand long-term care costs directly attributable to tSCI incurred in the rest of life [ROL]).\nThe calculation of ROL cost was dependent on life expectancy, neurological level, and functional impairment (American Spinal Injury Association [ASIA] Impairment Scale [AIS] of the International Standards of Neurological Classification of SCI [ISNCSCI]).\n28\nThe 2032 cost estimates were adjusted for inflation based on the Consumer Price Index\n29\nby applying a conservative rate of 1% annual increase in healthcare costs giving a cumulative increase of 20% between 2012 and 2032.\nTwenty replications were performed for each simulated individual. Patient level outcomes were reported at the individual patient level in which the averages of these outcomes were calculated for all individuals within one replication, then the averages and standard deviations were calculated across all replications. Population level outcomes were aggregated for all the individuals from each facility. To give perspective on the increase of healthcare financial resources for tSCI care as forecasted by the simulation model, projected outcomes were presented as a percent change calculated by the outcome value obtained for 2032 minus the outcome value obtained for 2012, divided by value of 2012."

    "Methods": "Animals: Strains, sex, and age\nThe DoD Retina Blast (Mar16) dataset contains the data of 213 Affymetrix\n\u00ae\nMouse Gene 2.0 ST microarrays. With a total of 52 BXD strains and 2 parental strains (C57BL/6J and DBA/2J), this dataset is genotypically identical to our previously published DoD Normal Retina (May15) dataset and allows for strain-to-strain comparison. Almost all strains are represented by four independent biological samples usually comprising retinas from two male and two female mice between 66 and 114 days of age with a median of 76 days (\nSupplementary Fig. 1\n; see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). Animals were maintained on a 12-h light\u201312-h dark cycle in a parasite-free facility with food and water\nad libitum\n. All procedures involving animals were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Emory University, Animal Use and Care Review Office (ACURO) of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC), and were in accordance with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research.\n\nOcular blast injury procedure\nOcular blast injury was performed using a previously described model.\n6\nBriefly, animals were deeply anesthetized with 67\u2009mg/kg tribromoethanol and secured with tape on a semi-open plastic tube sleigh. The head was safely positioned between Styrofoam nuggets to minimize blast exposure to the brain. The sleigh was then inserted into a hollow plastic cylinder with the right eye of the mouse directly facing a 7-mm-wide hole, which was then placed in front of a custom short airgun barrel. Before every blast procedure, the output pressure was checked at the position of the eye with a pressure sensor (Honeywell; Morris Plains, NJ) and re-calibrated, if necessary, to an output of 49\u2009\u00b1\u20091 psi (\nSupplementary Fig. 1\n). The pressure sensor was fixed in place and placed flush against the tube opening. Because the thickness of the outer and inner tube (\u223c6\u2009mm), it was not possible to position the eye closer toward the tip of the barrel than 6\u2009mm as this would have resulted in inappropriate pressure on the eye due to squeezing it out of its orbit. Thus, there was an approximately 6-mm difference in distance of the pressure transducer and the eye to the gun barrel tip. Following a single blast, eyes were carefully investigated for signs of macroscopic damage. Eyes were lubricated with GenTeal\n\u00ae\nand mice were allowed to wake up on a heating pad. There was an overall mortality rate of 5% associated with the blast procedure. Of the 240 mice in the blast experiment, 10 died under anesthesia or during recovery. After recovery from anesthesia, 2 mice died the following day.\n\nFunctional assessment and Thy1\n-CFP\nflat mounts\nThy1\n-CFP mice (n\u2009=\u20094\u20137 per group) bred on a C57BL/6 background were subjected to blast and their eyes were fixed in Z-FIX (Anatech Ltd.; Battlecreek, MI), and washed 3 times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Retinas were dissected, mounted on slides with rails in Vectashield Hardset (Vector Laboratories; Burlingame, CA), and coverslipped.\n\nThy1\n-CFP\nfluorescence, RGC counting, and soma size assessment\nTotal fluorescence of\nThy1\n-CFP flat mounts was measured by quantifying green channel intensity using Photoshop CS5 without applying any further image enhancements (control\nn\n=\u20093; blast\nn\n=\u20094). Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) soma size was automatically measured in square pixels using a custom script in CellProfiler in two single frames (outer and inner) per retinal quadrant each, resulting in approximately 2000 to 4000 RGCs identified per animal.\n9\nRGCs were counted using flat mounted retinas from\nThy1\n-CFP mice. Briefly, each flat mount was divided into 8 regions, such that regions 1 through 4 were close to the optic nerve head (ONH) and regions 5 through 8 were toward the periphery of each flat mount. Each region consisted of a \u201ccutbox,\u201d which was 636.5\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u2009636.5\u2009\u03bcm in dimension and was prepared in Adobe Photoshop. Representative regions for each flat mount were selected and the number of CFP-positive RGC bodies were counted manually using the count tool in Photoshop. Data were averaged per group (blast, control) and determined to be significant if\np\n<\u20090.05 (Welch's\nt\ntest).\n\nOptokinetic tracking\nContrast sensitivity and visual acuity thresholds were measured by optokinetic tracking (OptoMotry, CerebralMechanics. Inc.; Lethbridge, Alberta).\n10\nBriefly, the mouse was placed on a central elevated platform in the optometry chamber surrounded by four monitors projecting a virtual rotating cylinder with sinusoidal gratings of vertical light and dark bars. A video camera mounted on the top of the chamber tracked the behavior of the mouse, which followed the moving gratings by turning its head, allowing for determination of spatial frequency (\u201cacuity\u201d) and contrast thresholds. Contrast sensitivity function data are expressed as the inverse of the contrast thresholds.\n\nSample processing, RNA isolation, and microarray hybridization\nFive days after the blast procedure, mice were given an overdose of tribromoethanol and sacrificed by rapid cervical dislocation. Retinas were then dissected from eyes and directly placed into 160\u2009U/mL Ribolock\n\u00ae\n(Thermo Scientific; Walton, MA) in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (Sigma; St. Louis, MO) on ice. Tissue was immediately stored at \u221280\u00b0C. RNA was isolated using a Qiacube\n\u00ae\nand the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen; Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The isolation included on-column DNase1 treatment to remove contaminating genomic DNA. All tissue was harvested between 10 a.m. and noon to minimize circadian differences in gene expression. RNA integrity was assessed on a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent; Santa Clara, CA) and RNA integrity number (RIN) values for all animals ranged from 8.3 to 10 with a median of 9.5 (\nSupplementary Fig. 1\n; see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). Each retina was hybridized to a separate GeneChip\n\u00ae\nMouse Gene 2.0 ST (Affymetrix; Santa Clara, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Microarray hybridization was performed by two different core laboratories: the Molecular Resource Center of Excellence at the University of Tennessee (Dr. William Taylor, Director) and the Emory Integrated Genomics Core (Dr. Michael E. Zwick, Director, and Robert B. Isett, Technical Director). In a separate experiment, we tested a set of arrays from C57BL/6J retinas at each facility to determine if there were batch effects or other confounding differences between core laboratories, but were not able to detect any. Therefore, data from both facilities were included in the analysis.\n\nQuantitative PCR\nFor validation of microarray expression data, genes were randomly chosen from four BXD strains in both blast and normal situations. Exon-specific primers were designed using NCBI PrimerBlast and verified to be specific to the target by melting curve and gel analysis. Amplification efficiency for all primers was >90%. Primer sequences are given in\nSupplementary Figure 2\n(see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). First strand synthesis was carried out at 42\u00b0C using Quantitect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen) and a mix of oligo(d)T primer and random hexamers. After incubation in genomic DNA (gDNA) eraser for 5\u2009min, 350\u2009\u03bcg of total RNA were retrotranscribed and diluted 10-fold with ultra-pure H2O. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out in 10\u2009\u03bcL reactions using QuantiTect SYBR Green Master Mix (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions on a Mastercycler realplex2 (Eppendorf; Hamburg, Germany) with annealing temperature set to 60\u00b0C. Technical triplicates were averaged and normalized against\nPpia\n, which was identified to be a stably expressed housekeeping gene in the retina with the help of all retinal databases found on GeneNetwork. Fold-changes were calculated in log\n2\nusing the ddCt method and compared with the microarray results by linear regression models.\n\nData processing, statistical analysis, and WGCNA\nMicroarray data were normalized using the Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) method.\n11\nExpression levels were log\n2\n-transformed,\nz\n-scored, and multiplied by a factor of 2 before a constant of 8 was added to avoid negative expression values and make the data comparable on GeneNetwork (see GeneNetwork extended methods). Data from probes with a mean expression level lower than the fifth percentile and probes whose sequence did not have a unique BLAT hit were filtered out. Differential expression was assessed by pairwise comparison of expression values across all strains.\n12\nP\n-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR), and a stringent cutoff of 0.001 was used to decide on statistical significance. The following parameters were chosen for weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA): a thresholding soft power of 7, for which both networks approached approximate scale-free topology. Signed topological overlap matrices were created separately and scaled appropriately to make them comparable. Modules were assigned by applying adaptive branch pruning to hierarchical clustering dendrograms with the deepSplit parameter set to 2, a minimum module size of 100, and the cutHeight set at 0.995. All analyses were performed in the R 3.1.1 statistical programming environment. The ggplot2 package for the R environment was used for most plots.\n13\n\nGene enrichment analyses and network graphs\nGene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment were assessed by submitting Affymetrix Probe IDs to\nWebGestalt.org\n.\n14\nReported\np\n-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using Benjamini-Hochberg's FDR. Network graphs were created with Cytoscape version 3.4.\n\nImmunostaining, microscopy, and lymphocyte quantification\nFor staining retinal flat mounts, C57BL/6J (\nn\n=\u20094\u20135 per time-point) mice were deeply anesthetized with tribromoethanol and perfused through the heart with 0.9% saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The retinas were dissected from the globe and washed 3 times in PBS with 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) added. Tissue was then blocked in 5% BSA (Sigma) with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 1\u2009h at room temperature. The retinas were then transferred into directly labeled primary antibodies: CD3 (HM3420, Life Technologies; 1:1000), CD4 (ab51467, Abcam; 1:1000), and CD8 (MCD0828TR, Life Technologies; 1:1000). After overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C, retinas were rinsed, placed on glass slides, and coverslipped. The whole mounts were examined with a NikonTi inverted microscope with C1 confocal scanner (Nikon Instruments; Melville, NY) at 40\u00d7\u2009to identify labeled cells. Each retina was systematically scanned in the X\u2013Y plain and Z-stacks were taken through the entire thickness of the retina. After merging all 40\u2009\u00d7\u2009images together to one picture, lymphocytes were manually counted per whole retina."

First, analyses used the lower bound of the recommended cutoff range for TBI samples (36\u201344),\n70\nwith \u2265\u200936 suggestive of PTSD.\n2\n,\n71\n(In populations in which the base rate of PTSD is \u2264\u200915%, cut scores below the upper diagnostic threshold for TBI samples of 44 will likely\noverestimate\nPTSD prevalence.\n91\nHowever, although the prevalence of PTSD within TBI samples is thought to be 16\u201339%,\n90\ndiagnostic thresholds set lower than 44 may still overestimate clinical-level PTSD, but will help clinicians detect the presence of minimum levels of disorder.\n91\n) Second, PTSD diagnosis was determined using the algorithm-derived Symptom Cluster Method (SCM), whereby rating endorsements \u2265\u20093 (moderately bothersome) on key\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\n, 4th Edition (DSM-IV)-defined clusters (comprising one \u201cre-experiencing item,\u201d three \u201cnumbing/avoidance\u201d items, and two \u201chyperarousal\u201d items) indicate symptoms suggestive of PTSD.\n72\nRPQ\nThe current project examined three configurations of the RPQ: the RPQ-3, a composite of the headache, dizziness, and nausea items, intended to reflect an acute cluster of post-concussive symptoms; the RPQ-13, a composite of the items not included in the RPQ-3 and which reflect a separable cluster of symptoms; and each item-level symptom (e.g., headache, dizziness, nausea).\n73\nIndividual item cut points for clinical significance were set at \u2265\u20092, where ratings of 2, 3, and 4 indicate that the symptom is mildly, moderately, or severely more problematic than compared with pre-injury, respectively.\n74\nSWLS\nA SWLS score of 20 is considered the \u201cneutral\u201d point below which participants are considered \u201cunsatisfied\u201d with life to varying degrees; therefore, the current project used a cut score of \u2264\u200919 to indicate general dissatisfaction with life.\n50\n,\n62\nAdditionally, SWLS raw scores were converted to\nz\nscores using published normative ratings and dichotomized into impairment groups (impairment defined as\nz\n\u2264\u2009\u22121.33, or roughly the lower ninth percentile). A normative reference value of\nM\n(\nSD\n)\u2009=\u200923.96 (6.33) was derived by averaging normative values across seven published healthy adult samples,\n62\n,\n75\u201379\nall of which reported highly consistent distributions of SWLS ratings across demographic groups.\n78\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe two main objectives of the analyses were to describe the sample's 6-month clinical outcomes and to report on convergence versus divergence between the GOSE and other outcome measures. To understand potential patterns of bias in reported rates of neuropsychological and functional impairment, completion rates of the Outcome CDEs were computed, and patterns of missingness on the GOSE and CVLT-II at 6 months were examined using select demographic, acute injury, and 3-month recovery measures. Analyses were conducted using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS; IBM) v. 24.\n80\nSignificance was assessed at\n\u03b1\n=\u20090.05 unless otherwise specified.\nDescriptive statistics for the GOSE are presented at 3 and 6 months (\nFig. 2\n). Other outcome variables, however, are reported only at the 6-month time-point. As 6 months was the major outcome assessment of interest in the study, this was the time-point at which the most complete set of outcome measures was collected on the full sample. Outcome data on the subsample of patients who completed a 12-month assessment has been published elsewhere.\n50\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nDistribution of valid cases per the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) categories 3\u20138 at 3 and 6 months.\nN\nwith GOSE outcome data was 456 at 3 months and 415 at 6 months (of 586 subjects enrolled).\nThe distributional properties of Demographic, Clinical Assessment, and Outcome CDEs are reported in\nTables 3\nand\n\u200b\nand4.\n4\n. Descriptive statistics for categorical CDEs are presented in frequencies (percentages); continuous CDEs are summarized with\nM\n(\nSD\n). Outcome measures for which raw scores were converted to standard scores, index scores, T scores, or\nz\nscores for analysis are noted in the CDE descriptions above. To yield clinically interpretable data on the outcome measures, continuous measures were dichotomized into impaired/not impaired categories. For neuropsychological measures with widely accepted normative reference groups (CLVT-II, WAIS-IV PSI, TMT, BSI-18), we selected a common cutoff corresponding to the ninth percentile of the normative distribution (operationalized as T\u2009\u2264\u200937 or \u2265\u200963,\nz\n\u2264\u2009\u22121.33, or standard score [SS] \u2264\u200979 depending on how each measure was scaled). This was done to align expected base rates of impairment (i.e., at 9%) between measures as much as possible. For measures without established normative reference groups (RPQ, SWLS, PCL-C), empirically established or recommended cut scores were used and rates of impairment in published non-TBI samples were presented for comparison with the current data. See the Note to\nTable 4\nfor citations to the reference samples used to facilitate interpretation of the current study data.\nAssociations between outcome measures and acute measures of injury severity were computed using Pearson's\nr\nfor associations between continuous CDEs, Spearman's rho for associations in which one CDE was ordinal, and Pearson's r\npb\n(point biserial) for associations in which one CDE was dichotomous.\n81\nFor illustrative purposes, the percentages of cases scoring above thresholds for clinical significance/impairment was also presented at each level of GOSE outcome."

    "Methods": "Participants\nSeventeen adolescents 12\u201318 years of age with chronic TBI (1\u20135 years post-injury) were recruited from outpatient pediatric brain injury rehabilitation clinics and enrolled in this study. Study inclusion criteria were as follows. Participants must have sustained an isolated event of trauma resulting in TBI characterized by at least one of the following: post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) lasting at least 1\u2009h, loss of consciousness lasting <15\u2009min, or presence of injury-related intracranial findings on clinical imaging. As Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores from the day of injury were infrequently available, the severity of TBI was defined using the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine (ACRM) 1993 criteria based on presence of injury-related intracranial findings on clinical CT findings (no findings\u2009=\u2009mild TBI, findings\u2009=\u2009moderate or severe TBI) and duration of PTA (< 24\u2009h\u2009=\u2009mild, 24\u2009h\u20137 days\u2009=\u2009moderate, >7 days\u2009=\u2009severe) unless a GCS score (13\u201315\u2009=\u2009mild, 9\u201312\u2009=\u2009moderate, \u22648\u2009=\u2009severe) was available and indicated a more severe injury. When determining severity, we made a classification with a bias toward a higher severity level. For example, if one category indicated mild TBI, but another category indicated moderate TBI, the injury was classified as moderate. Fourteen uninjured adolescents, ages 13\u201318, matched on age, sex, and socioeconomic status (SES) were recruited for a comparison control group using flyers, word of mouth, and radio advertisements. SES status was determined for both groups using maternal education. None of the participants within the TBI or control group had overt motor impairment or met criteria for pre-injury behavioral or educational diagnoses based on a structured parent interview. The Johns Hopkins Medicine institutional review board (IRB) approved this study, written informed consent was obtained from a parent or legal guardian, and assent was acquired from adolescent participants.\n\nBehavioral measures\nA Go/No-Go paradigm was used to measure response inhibition.\n11\nTwo versions of the task were used: Simple and Motivation. In the Simple task, participants were instructed to make a button press response when a green \u201cGo\u201d target was present, and to inhibit that response when a red \u201cNo-Go\u201d target item was present. \u201cGo\u201d targets were presented nearly four times as often as \u201cNo-Go\u201d targets to create the prepotent motor response that must be inhibited. The use of green and red \u2013 well-established cues for \u201cgo\u201d and \u201cstop,\u201d respectively \u2013 served to reduce the cognitive demands of the task. In the Motivation task,\n28\nthe task instructions were the same, but performance was incentivized with a monetary reward for correct \u201cGo\u201d and a monetary loss for incorrect \u201cNo-Go\u201d responses. On the \u201cGo\u201d trials, an individualized response deadline for Go responses was created based on the child's reaction time in the Simple task to prevent participants from responding slowing to improve their accuracy. Commission rate, measuring the rate (i.e., percentage of total trials) of inhibition failures, was used as the primary outcome measure for both the Simple and Motivation-based tasks.\n\nMRI acquisition\nRs-fMRI) data were acquired with a 3T Philips scanner. A high resolution T1-weighted anatomical scan, MPRAGE, was obtained for image co-registration, segmentation, and normalization processing (32-channel head coil, repetition time [TR]\u2009=\u20097.99\u2009ms, echo time [TE]\u2009=\u20093.76\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u20098 degrees). The rs-fMRI scan was 6\u2009min 30\u2009sec in duration (D-SENSE EPI, 32-channel head coil, TR\u2009=\u20092500\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u200930\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200970 degrees). During the rs-fMRI scan, participants were instructed to focus on a centrally located fixation cross. T2-weighted and fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) images were also acquired for interpretation by a pediatric neuroradiologist.\n\nRs-fMRI data processing\nStandard image preparation, processing, and analysis were completed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12b) and custom Matlab scripts. Functional images were adjusted for slice timing and head motion, co-registered to the T1 scan, normalized to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using unified segmentation-normalization, and linearly detrended on a voxelwise basis. Using the aCompCor method,\n29\nnuisance variables were estimated from the ventricles and white matter, and then regressed from each voxel along with linearly detrended versions of the six motion parameters and their first derivatives estimated through backward differences. A 6\u2009mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) filter was used to spatially smooth functional images, which were then temporally filtered (bandpass 0.01\u20130.1\u2009Hz).\n\nMotor network maps\nFor each subject, we used a two step process to generate a whole-brain connectivity map for the bilateral primary motor cortices. First, whole-brain connectivity maps for the right and left precentral gyri, as defined by the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) Atlas, were generated separately. For each region of interest (ROI), the time series of all voxels within that ROI were averaged, and the average time series was correlated with the time series of all other voxels in the brain. These correlations were converted to z-scores using Fisher's transformation. Whole-brain connectivity maps from the left and right ROIs were then averaged to create a motor network map for each subject. We visually inspected these maps to confirm that they accurately represented the motor network. For group motor network maps, see\nFigure 1\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nAveraged motor connectivity maps for the traumatic brain injury (TBI) group (top) and control group (bottom).\n\nVoxel-based analysis\nSPM12 second-level analyses were used to examine between-group differences in the generated motor network connectivity maps. Each subject's motor network map was entered into two-sample\nt\ntests to evaluate for differences between the TBI and control groups in motor network to whole brain connectivity. The voxel-level threshold was established at\np\n<\u20090.001, and familywise error (FWE) correction was used for multiple comparisons at a cluster-level threshold of\np\n<\u20090.05 in accordance with random-field theory.\n30\nConnectivity values for activated voxels were extracted using the MarsBar toolbox in SPM12.\n\nBrain\u2013behavior ROI-based analyses\nBetween-group differences in brain connectivity were further examined at the ROI level to avoid circularity in brain\u2013behavioral analyses.\n31\n,\n32\nMNI coordinates of the peak activated voxel, where cluster-level between-group differences were observed, were entered into the Wake Forest University (WFU) Pickatlas toolbox.\n33\n,\n34\nWFU Pickatlas was used to determine the region of origin of the peak activated voxel using the AAL atlas. Left and right ROI masks were then used in MarsBar toolbox to extract raw connectivity values from each voxel within the left and right ROI; these raw connectivity values were averaged across the left ROI and the right ROI to establish the connectivity between the motor network and ROIs for each subject.\n\nStatistical analysis\nOutliers were identified and excluded if performance was poorer than >2 SDs from the mean. Independent sample\nt\ntests were completed in SPSS to compare groups on Simple and Motivation-based Go/No-Go commission error rates. SPM12 was used for initial voxel-based comparisons, and SPSS was used for all subsequent rs-fMRI data analyses. Between-group comparisons of ROI connectivity values were completed using independent sample\nt\ntests. Within each group, relationships between motor network and ROI connectivity values and behavioral performance were evaluated using Pearson correlations;\np\nvalues <0.05 were considered significant; values between 0.05 and 0.10 were labeled as trend findings. Additional analyses were completed as follows to examine for other contributions to the findings. Within the TBI cohort, independent sample Kruskal\u2013Wallis tests were used to evaluate if TBI severity influenced behavioral performance or connectivity values. Age of participants was examined for correlation with ROI connectivity or behavioral findings; based on findings presented subsequently, partial correlations controlling for age were used to examine all brain\u2013behavior relationships in the TBI group."

On arrival, mice were housed individually in a temperature (23\u00b0C\u2009\u00b1\u20093\u00b0C) controlled vivarium with a cotton nestlet and cardboard tube for environmental enrichment. Either a standard 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at 7\nam\n) or a reversed 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at 7\npm\nor 10\npm\n) was utilized (\nTable 1\n). Mice were allowed to acclimate to the light/dark cycle for a week before testing during which time they were handled daily. Some mice had access to standard food\nad libitum\nwhile others were food restricted (\nTable 1\n). The body weights of the food-restricted mice were reduced slowly over the course of five days and maintained at 80\u201385% of their baseline free-feeding body weights. All mice were water deprived for 60\u2009min before testing. Testing was conducted five days per week between 10\nam\n\u20136\npm\n.

Each chamber was equipped with a touchscreen at the large base, liquid reward dispenser at the small base, house light, reward chamber light, tone generator, and infrared (IR) beams with an observation system. Each chamber was placed in a cubicle (inside dimensions: 45\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u200951\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u200949\u2009cm tall) that served to attenuate external sounds and light. A black plastic mask (28\u2009cm wide\u2009\u00d7\u200918\u2009cm tall) was inserted in front of the touchscreen allowing for different visual stimuli to be presented and different tasks to be utilized.\nTwo different masks were used in this study, a 3\u2009\u00d7\u20091 (Model 80614-M2, Lafayette Instrument Co., Lafayette, IN) and a 7\u2009\u00d7\u20092 (Model 80614-M3, Lafayette Instrument Co.). The 3\u2009\u00d7\u20091 mask, used for the PAL task, consisted of one row with 3 three square windows (2\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009cm). The 7\u2009\u00d7\u20092 mask, used for the LD task, consisted of two rows with seven windows (2.4\u2009cm wide\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009cm tall) with stimuli only being presented in the bottom row. A peristaltic pump (Model 80204M, Lafayette Instrument Co.) precisely delivered a drop of liquid reward. The reward was a milkshake consisting of 10% milk (condensed or powdered) in distilled water with systematic variations designed to entice the mice to perform including flavoring with Hershey's\n\u00ae\nsyrup (chocolate or strawberry; Hershey, PA) and further sweetening with sucralose sweetener (Splenda,\n\u00ae\nHeartland Food Products, Westwood KS); see\nTable 1\n. The system was controlled by the Animal Behavior Environment Test (ABET) II software (Model 89505, Lafayette Instrument Co.) allowing for the experimental programing, execution, and data collection. After each session, chambers were thoroughly cleaned with chlorhexidine.\n\nPre-training\nAll mice were pre-trained in the touchscreen chambers before assessment with PAL and LD tasks. Training procedures followed those listed in the instruction manuals provided by Campden Instruments Ltd/ Lafayette Instrument Co.\n36\n,\n37\nand described previously protocols, with some modification (\nSupplementary Table 1\n; see online supplementary material at\nwww.liebertpub.com\n).\n34\n,\n35\nBriefly, mice underwent a five-stage stepwise training paradigm as described below.\nStage 1: Habituation\nMice were acclimated to the chambers and introduced to reward. For habituation 1, mice were placed in a chamber for one 15\u2009min session with the goal of introducing the mouse to the chamber to acclimate. During the acclimation session, all chamber lights were off, and neither stimulus nor reward was presented. Habituation 2 consisted of three sessions introducing the mice to the reward lasting 20 or 40\u2009min (\nSupplementary Table 1\n; see online supplementary material at\nwww.liebertpub.com\n). During these sessions the reward tray light was activated, followed by a tone and the dispensing of liquid reward. Once the mouse collected the reward, there was a 20\u2009sec delay (reward tray light off) before the next trial. Mice were required to complete one session at each habituation step. For the mice advancing past pre-training to the PAL and LD tasks (\nTable 1\nand\nSupplementary Table 2\n; see online supplementary material at\nwww.liebertpub.com\n), 48 mice were habituated initially for each group but only the 24 best performers, as based on number of trials completed, advanced onto further training/ testing.\nStage 2. Initial Touch Training (ITT)\nMice were trained to associate the reward with a stimulus on the screen. A white square (stimulus) was displayed randomly in one of the windows in the mask. For the PAL task (3\u2009\u00d7\u20091 mask), the stimulus was presented in any one of the three windows. For the LD task (7\u2009\u00d7\u20092 mask), the stimulus was presented in any one of the bottom row windows (positions 8\u201314). The image was removed after 30\u2009sec. On removal of the image, a cued reward phase was initiated that included playing a tone, illuminating the reward tray light, and dispensing of the liquid reward. Once the mouse collected the reward, the tray light was extinguished, and there was a 20\u2009sec delay before the next trial began. Each session concluded after 40\u2009min or after the completion of 20 trials, which was the criterion for advancement (\nSupplementary Table 1\n; see online supplementary material at\nwww.liebertpub.com\n).\nStage 3: Must Touch Training (MTT)\nMice were trained to touch the stimulus on the screen to elicit the reward. A white square was displayed randomly in one of the windows as described with ITT. On touching the white square, a tone was played, the reward tray was illuminated, and a liquid reward was dispensed. There was a 20\u2009sec delay after the reward was collected before the start of the next trial. Failure to touch the screen or touching a blank window resulted in no reward response generated. Each session concluded after 40\u2009min or after the completion of 20 trials, which was the criterion for advancement (\nSupplementary Table 1\n; see online supplementary material at\nwww.liebertpub.com\n).\nStage 4: Must Initiate Training (MIT)\nMice were trained to initiate the training session. On entering the chamber, the reward tray was illuminated and primed with liquid reward. The mouse had to collect the reward to begin the session and initiate the presentation of the stimulus. Training for the remainder of the session was identical to MTT. Each session concluded after 40\u2009min or after the completion of 20 trials, which was the criterion for advancement (\nSupplementary Table 1\n; see online supplementary material at\nwww.liebertpub.com\n).\nStage 5: Punish Incorrect Training (PIT)\nMice were punished for incorrect responses. PIT followed the same format as described in MIT, except mice were punished if they failed to touch the correct window containing the white square as the stimulus. Touching the wrong window (a blank window) resulted in a time-out period of 5\u2009sec in which the stimulus disappeared, the house light was illumined (for those trained in reversed light/dark cycle), and no reward was dispensed. Each session concluded on the completion of 20 trials or after 40\u2009min had elapsed. Criterion for advancement was set at the completion of 20 trials in 40\u2009min with a 60% correct response rate for two consecutive days. Successful mice advanced onto similar PAL (sPAL) or LD training.\n\nsPAL Task\nThe sPAL task used the 3\u2009\u00d7\u20091 mask. There were three possible stimuli images with each image having a specific correct location in one of the three windows. Images and correct locations were the following: flower\u2014left window, plane\u2014middle window, and spider\u2014right window. Similar to MIT, mice were required to initiate the training session by collecting the liquid reward from the primed and illuminated tray. The first trial then began with the presentation of two similar stimuli. One stimulus was in the correct location associated with that specific image and the other stimulus was in the incorrect location. There were six possible trial types with the three different stimuli. Touching the image in the correct location resulted in a tone being played, illumination of the reward tray, and delivery of the liquid reward. Similar to pre-training, collecting the reward served as a reset (tone and tray light off) with a 20\u2009sec delay before the next trial began. Before sPAL testing could begin, mice were required to complete the sPAL acquisition stage where incorrect touches were ignored and there was no punishment. Each session concluded after 40\u2009min or after the completion of 20 trials, which was the criterion for advancement.\nFor sPAL testing, mice were punished for incorrect responses. Similar to PIT, touching the wrong image resulted in a 5\u2009sec time-out period in which all stimuli disappeared and the house light was turned on. Once the time-out period ended, mice were administered a correction trial in which the same stimuli were re-presented. The mice were required to complete successfully the correction trial before moving onto the next trial with new stimuli. Mice were evaluated on the number of trials they completed and correct response percentage. Correction trials did not count in overall percentage correct. Mice were given one session per day, which concluded after 40\u2009min or the completion of 20 trials, and sPAL testing ranged from 5\u201314 days.\n\nLD Task\nThe 7\u2009\u00d7\u20092 mask was used with the LD task, but stimuli were only presented in the bottom row (positions 8\u201314). As in pre-training, the stimulus presented with this task was a white square. Unlike pre-training, however, where there was only one white square, the LD task used two white squares that were positioned equally left and right from the center window (position 11). There were three difficulty levels associated with the LD task based on the separation of the stimuli. The stimuli were located far apart (large separation) for the easy level (positions 8 and 14), a moderate distance apart for the intermediate level (positions 9 and 13), and close together (small separation) for the hard level (positions 10 and 12).\nThe LD task consisted of three stages: acquisition, reversal, and probe. Mice were required to initiate the training session by collecting the pre-dispensed reward from the illuminated tray, similar to MIT. For LD acquisition, the stimuli (white squares) were presented at the intermediate separation level. Each mouse had one side, either left (position 9) or right (position 13), randomly designated as correct. Touching the correct stimulus elicited a tone, illuminated the tray, and dispensed the reward. There was a 10\u2009sec delay after the reward was collected before the next trial began. As with PIT, an incorrect response resulted in a time-out period of 5\u2009sec where the house light was turned on and no reward was issued. Each session concluded on the completion of 20 trials or after 40\u2009min had elapsed. Criterion for advancement was set at the completion of 20 trials in 40\u2009min with a 60% correct response rate for two consecutive days.\nLD reversal followed similar procedures as LD acquisition with some minor modifications. Again, the intermediate separation level was used with one side (left or right) initially being designated as the correct location and counterbalanced across animals. On completing seven of eight trials correctly, the correct location side was reversed to the opposite side. The training session ended after the completion of 20 trials or after 40\u2009min had elapsed. Criterion for advancement was set at the completion of at least one reversal in three of four consecutive sessions. In addition, mice were evaluated on the number of trials they completed and the correct response percentage. The LD reversal training ranged from 3\u20138 days.\nFor LD probe sessions, both the easy and hard separation levels were used. One side was randomly designated as the correct location side (either left positions 8 and 10 or right positions 12 and14, based on difficulty separation), and there were no reversals. Each trial, mice were randomly presented with stimuli at either the hard separation positions or easy separation positions. The stimuli were not displayed in the same positions for more than three consecutive trials. Similar to LD acquisition and reversal, touching the stimulus on the correct side resulted in reward, while touching the stimulus on the incorrect side resulted in a time-out period of 5\u2009sec. Each session, mice were given 60\u2009min to complete 40 trials (20 easy and 20 hard distributed randomly throughout the session). Each session ended after the 60\u2009min time limit had expired or all 40 trials were completed. Mice were evaluated on the number of easy and hard trials they completed, as well as the correct response percentage at both the easy and hard separation levels. The LD probe testing ranged from 5\u201310 days.\n\nExperimental mTBI\nMice that successfully completed all of the pre-training, LD acquisition, and LD reversal received either sham surgery or mTBI surgery before being evaluated with LD probe sessions. The mTBI model has been described previously by our laboratory.\n13\nBriefly, a weight drop device was used in which a 100\u2009g cylindrical weight was released from a height of 60\u2009cm to impact the mouse head and create an impact-acceleration injury. Mice were anesthetized with a 4% isoflurane induction and 2% maintenance for all surgical procedures. For injury induction, the mouse rested on a foam pad (14\u2009\u00d7\u20097\u2009cm, 5\u2009cm thickness), and the weight was dropped onto a metal disk (1.25\u2009cm diameter, 1\u2009mm thickness) that was affixed to the skull of the mouse at midline with cyanoacrylate adhesive. The duration of transient unconsciousness was determined by measuring righting reflex time, as described previously.\n13\nAnimals receiving the sham surgery experienced the same procedures with omission of the impact. The LD probe testing began 24\u2009h after mTBI or sham surgery.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data were recorded in the touchscreen session using the ABET II software (Lafayette Instrument Co.) and subsequently analyzed using Prism 7 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). Data are reported as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM) with statistical significance set at\np\n<\u20090.05. The Student\nt\ntest was used to analyze pre-training trials and righting times. Repeated measures two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze between-group differences across testing days with sPAL and LD tasks. To determine significant differences identified by ANOVA, the appropriate\npost-hoc\nanalysis was performed sequentially."

    "Methods": "Study design\nAdults with acute tSCI who were admitted to an acute specialized spine facility in a Level I trauma center (the study site, Vancouver General Hospital) and who were enrolled in the Rick Hansen SCI Registry (RHSCIR) and had AE data collected using the Spine Adverse Events Severity (SAVES)\n1\n,\n26\nsystem, which may record no experienced AEs, were included in the study cohort (2006\u20132014). Prospective SAVES data collection was piloted in 2006 and implemented in 2008. The RHSCIR is a prospective observational database that collects data on adult patients who have sustained a new tSCI and are admitted to a participating site. The RHSCIR includes data extracted from patient chart review and linkage to hospital administration databases (using the\nInternational Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision\n[ICD 10] coding system)\n27\nfrom the Discharge Administration Database (DAD). Institutional Research Ethics Board approval was obtained before enrolling patients. Full details of the RHSCIR have been published elsewhere.\n28\nPreviously reported analyses on a smaller cohort of patients (\nn\n=\u2009171) with SAVES data\n2\nwere repeated to validate the results on a larger sample in this study, which included the original sample. In keeping with the previous methodology established by Street and associates,\n2\nanalyses were performed to validate the most common AEs, and the association of top AEs found by Street and associates\n2\n(delirium, pneumonia, neuropathic pain [NP], PU, UTI) and total number of AEs with patient and injury (nonmodifiable) factors. New analyses were performed to identify potentially modifiable comorbidities relating to these common AEs. Inclusion criteria included patients having both comorbidity and AE data. Patients admitted to the study site more than seven days post-injury were excluded.\n\nStudy variables\nAge, gender, mechanism of injury (fall vs. nonfall), neurological severity and level of injury measured at admission by the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS) of the ISNCSCI\n17\nwere the nonmodifiable factors considered in the analyses.\nData on comorbidities collected for the RHSCIR were categorized to ensure that the same comorbidity was counted only once for the same patient. Count of comorbidities was calculated by summing all unique comorbidities of each patient.\nPotentially modifiable comorbidities in the acute setting included: health-related conditions (hypertension, diabetes, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy), substance (alcohol, drug) use/withdrawal, psychiatric conditions (delirium, schizophrenia, nonorganic psychosis, bipolar, depressive episode, mood disorder, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive [anankastic] personality disorder, history of self-harm, gender identity disorder). The comorbidities were grouped into the three categories (health-related conditions, substance use/withdrawal, and psychiatric conditions) based on their clinical symptoms and causes.\nThe AE data were obtained from the prospective, validated SAVES instrument used to collect AE data (type of AE if present, or absence of AE) during the inpatient stay at the study site.\n26\nThe SAVES instrument has been described in detail elsewhere.\n1\n,\n26\nWhere the same AE was recorded more than once for a patient, it was counted once. Count/number of AEs was calculated by summation of all unique AEs (main SAVES items) of each patient.\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics were used to describe patient and injury factors and the AEs. To determine the association between number of AEs experienced and nonmodifiable factors, a negative binomial regression model was applied with outliers removed based on the Tukey rule (i.e., 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009interquartile range rule). The association between each of the common five AEs experienced and nonmodifiable factors were modeled using multiple logistic regressions with a stepwise variable selection method (\np\nvalues for a variable to enter and stay in the model set to 0.25 and 0.10, respectively). Initial models included nonmodifiable factors such as age at injury, gender, mechanism of injury (fall; nonfall), AIS (AIS A; AIS B,C; AIS D) and neurological level (high cervical, C1\u2013C4; low cervical, C5\u2013T1; thoracic/thoracolumbar/lumbar/sacral, T2\u2013S5) as covariates. Final models included statistically significant covariates but age, AIS and neurological level were included regardless of their statistical significance because they were considered to be clinically relevant.\nBivariate analyses were performed to test associations between AEs and potentially modifiable comorbidities using the \u03c7\n2\ntest unless the expected counts were less than five, in which case the Fisher's exact test was performed. Bivariate associations were re-examined with multivariate logistic regressions to adjust for significant nonmodifiable risk factors of each AE identified from the final models. Age at injury, AIS and neurological level were always included because of their clinical significance.\nGoodness of fit tests were performed for all models and Akaike Information Criterion was used for model selection. Associations with a\np\nvalue <0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using SAS software, Version 9.4 of the SAS System for Windows.\n\u00a9\n2013.

    "Methods": "Animals\nAnimal use in all experiments followed National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines and all protocols were approved by the Institution Animal Care and Use Committee of Western University of Health Sciences. Calpain-1 KO mice on a C57Bl/6 background were obtained from a breeding colony established from breeding pairs generously provided by Dr. Chishti (Tufts University). C57Bl/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Labs and were the corresponding WT. Only male mice were used in this study.\n\nControlled cortical impact\nThe CCI model was established in mice following the protocol described in previous publications.\n21\u201324\nMice (3-month old, 25\u201330\u2009g) were anesthetized using isoflurane and fixed in a stereotaxic frame with a gas anesthesia mask. A heating pad was placed beneath the body to maintain body temperature around 33\u201335\u00b0C. The head was positioned in the horizontal plane. The top of the skull was exposed, and a 5-mm craniotomy was made using a micro-drill lateral to the sagittal suture, and centered between bregma and lambda. The skull at the craniotomy site was carefully removed without damaging the dura. The exposed cortex was hit by a pneumatically controlled impactor device (AMS-201, Amscien). The impactor tip diameter was 3\u2009mm, the impact velocity was 3\u2009m/sec, and the depth of cortical deformation was 0.5\u2009mm. After impact, the injured region was sutured using tissue adhesive (3M), and mice were placed in a 37\u00b0C incubator until they recovered from anesthesia. In sham surgery, mice were sutured after craniotomy was performed. The selective calpain-2 inhibitor, NA101, was injected as indicated at a dose of 0.3\u2009mg/kg, based on our previous studies,\n18\n,\n25\nand control animals were injected with the vehicle (5% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] in phosphate buffered saline [PBS]). In the case of intravenous (i.v.) injection, NA101 was injected immediately before TBI, due to the relatively low success rate of i.v. injection in this strain of mice (calpain-1 KO on a C57Bl/6J background).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nAt the indicated times after TBI, mice were anesthetized and perfused intracardially with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffer (PB; pH 7.4). After perfusion, brains were removed and immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4\u00b0C for post-fixation, then in 15% and 30% sucrose at 4\u00b0C for cryoprotection. Three coronal frozen sections (20\u2009\u03bcm thick) in each brain at bregma \u22120.58, \u22121.58, and \u22121.94 were prepared. To determine\nin situ\ncalpain activation, sections were co-stained with rabbit anti-spectrin breakdown product (SBDP; 1:500; a gift from Dr. Saido, Riken, Japan) and mouse anti- phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN; 1:600; 9556, Cell Signaling)antibodies. To determine astrocyte and microglia activation after TBI, sections were immunostained with rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:1000; AB5804, EMD Millipore) or goat anti-ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1 (iba1; 1:500; ab5076, Abcam) antibody. Sections were first blocked in 0.1\u2009M PBS containing 5% goat or donkey serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 (blocking solution) for 1\u2009h, and then incubated with primary antibody(ies) prepared in blocking solution overnight at 4\u00b0C. Sections were washed 3 times in PBS (10\u2009min each) and incubated in Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Ig)G, Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-goat IgG, and/or Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific) prepared in blocking solution for 2\u2009h at room temperature. After three washes, sections were mounted with mounting medium containing 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole henylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories). For quantification of SBDP and PTEN levels, three 637\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u2009637\u2009\u03bcm areas near the lesion site in each section were imaged using confocal microscopes (Nikon C1 and Zeiss LSM-880) and analyzed. In each area, the regions proximal (0\u2013170\u2009\u03bcm from the lesion edge) and distal (>170\u2009\u03bcm from the lesion edge) to the impact site were separately outlined using the \u201cFreehand Selection\u201d function of ImageJ, and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of SBDP or PTEN was measured. Data in all three sections from the same brain were averaged. For quantification of GFAP and iba1 levels, whole brain sections were imaged using the \u201cTile Scan\u201d function of an LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss). Three 300\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u2009300\u2009\u03bcm areas centered 400\u2009\u03bcm to the lesion edge on the ipsilateral side and three areas of the same size centered 700\u2009\u03bcm to the cortical surface in the contralateral side were selected. MFI of GFAP or iba1 in each area was measured in ImageJ. Then, MFI in the contralateral side (background signal) was subtracted from MFI in the ipsilateral side. Data in all three sections from the same brain were averaged. Image acquisition and quantification were done by two persons in a blind fashion.\n\nTUNEL and Fluoro-Jade C staining\nBrains were collected at 0, 6, 24, and 72\u2009h after TBI. Coronal frozen sections (20\u2009\u03bcm thick) at bregma 1.54, 0.50, \u22120.58, \u22121.58, \u22121.94, and \u22122.30 were prepared. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed in a set of sections using the ApopTag\nin situ\napoptosis detection kit (S7165, Millipore). Sections were visualized under confocal microscopy (Nikon). All TUNEL-positive nuclei surrounding the lesion area in six sections of each brain were counted using the \u201cAnalyze Particles\u201d function in ImageJ. Fluoro-Jade C staining was performed in the same set of sections. Sections were incubated in 0.0001% solution of Fluoro-Jade C (AG325; EMD Millipore) dissolved in 0.1% acetic acid for 10\u2009min. Sections were visualized under confocal microscopy (Nikon). All Fluoro-Jade C-positive cells surrounding the lesion area in a set of sections of each brain were counted using ImageJ. To separately analyze cell death density in the region proximal and distal to the impact site, the regions proximal (0\u2013170\u2009\u03bcm from the edge of impact site) and distal (>170\u2009\u03bcm from the edge of impact site) to the impact site were outlined using the \u201cFreehand Selection\u201d function of ImageJ. TUNEL- or Fluoro-Jade C-positive cells in these two regions were separately counted. Image acquisition and quantification were done by two persons in a blind fashion.\n\nQuantification of lesion volume\nBrains were collected 3 or 30 days after TBI. Coronal frozen sections at eight different levels (bregma 1.54, 0.50, \u22120.58, \u22121.58, \u22121.94, \u22122.30, \u22122.70, and \u22123.40\u2009mm) were prepared and stained with 0.2% cresyl violet solution (sc-214775; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 5\u2009min. Sections were visualized under a light microscope (Zeiss). The lesion in each section was outlined and the lesion area was measured in ImageJ. The lesion volume between two successive sections was calculated as the average of the lesion areas of these two sections multiplied by the distance between them. The total lesion volume was the sum of lesion volumes between all the analyzed sections. Image acquisition and quantification were done by two persons in a blind fashion.\n\nBeam walking\nThe beam apparatus consists of a 1-m wooden round beam with a diameter of 2\u2009cm resting 50\u2009cm above the tabletop on two poles. A black box is placed at the end of the beam as the finish point. Nesting material from home cages is placed in the black box to attract the mouse to the finish point. A lamp (with 60-W light bulb) is used to shine light above the start point and serves as an aversive stimulus. Each mouse is placed on a brightly lit platform and is allowed to transverse the round beam. A nylon hammock is stretched below the beam, about 7.5\u2009cm above the table top, to cushion any falls. On training day, mice are allowed to cross the beam, with gentle guiding or prodding as needed, until they cross readily. The timer is started by the nose of the mouse entering the start point, and stopped when the animal reaches the safe box. Mice rest for 10\u2009min in their home cages between training sessions. Mice are trained for 2 days and 3 times per day. Training is continued for additional days if mice still do not traverse the entire beam successfully after 2 days of training. The beams and box are cleaned of mouse droppings and wiped with towels soaked with 70% ethanol and then water before the next mouse is placed on the apparatus. On testing day, mice are placed on the beam and numbers of back paw slips and latency to cross are scored. Mice are tested 3 times with 10\u2009min interval for resting. Results for the three tests are averaged to provide individual values for each mouse on that day. The experiments were performed and results analyzed by a \u201cblind\u201d observer.\n\nFear conditioning\nFear conditioning was performed as previously described.\n26\nMice were put in the same room 30\u2009min before being placed in the fear-conditioning chamber (H10\u201011MTC; Coulbourn Instruments). The conditioning chamber was cleaned with 10% ethanol to provide a background odor. A ventilation fan provided a background noise at \u223c55\u2009dB. After a 2-min exploration period, three tone-footshock pairings separated by 1\u2009min intervals were delivered. The 85\u2009dB 2\u2009kHz tone lasted 30\u2009sec and co-terminated with a footshock of 0.75\u2009mA and 2\u2009sec. Mice remained in the training chamber for another 30\u2009sec before being returned to home cages. Context test was performed one day after training in the original conditioning chamber with 5-min recording. On day 3, animals were subjected to cue/tone test in a modified chamber with different texture and color, odor, background noise, and lighting. After 5-min recording, mice were exposed to a tone (85\u2009dB, 2\u2009kHz) for 1\u2009min. Mouse behavior was recorded with the Freezeframe software and data were analyzed using the Freezeview software (Coulbourn Instruments). Motionless bouts lasting more than 1\u2009sec were considered as freezing. The percent of time the animal froze was calculated and group means with standard error of the mean (SEM) and cumulative distribution of percent freezing were analyzed. The experiments were performed and results analyzed by a \u201cblind\u201d observer."

    "Methods": "This single-center, retrospective cohort study was approved by the Seattle Children's Hospital Institutional Review Board. Patients were identified using a registry of children seen at our institution between January 2010 and March 2016 with health care provider-diagnosed concussion sustained during recreation or sport. Concussions sustained in both high- and low-energy activities, such as physical education class, field sports, and motocross, were included. Because of the retrospective nature of this study and the large number of patients identified, we were not able to confirm the clinical criteria used to diagnose concussion. However, providers at our institution follow the recommendations of the International Conference on Concussion in Sport when diagnosing concussion.2\n\nOur concussion database includes patients seen in all settings, including the emergency department (ED) and outpatient clinics. The following data were obtained from this database: patient demographics; site of first visit for concussion (e.g., ED or clinic); the activity in which the injury was suffered; the mechanism of the injury; history of previous TBI; and the date of the concussion. If the exact date of injury was not known, the first of the month of injury was used as an approximation.\n\nThe resulting list of patients was cross-referenced with a separately maintained database of radiology records, from which all head CT and brain MRI reports were extracted. These reports were than manually reviewed to identify the following: the indication for the study; the pertinent findings; and the sequences utilized in all MRI scans. We relied solely on radiology reports generated by board-certified pediatric radiologists and did not manually review the images. MRI scans obtained outside of our hospital system were not included because the reports for these studies were not routinely available. MRI scans were ordered by providers in the subspecialty clinics evaluating these patients. Individuals with any one of the following were excluded: an abnormal CT preceding the MRI; an MRI ordered for reasons other than concussion, such as for tumor surveillance; or an MRI ordered as part of a research study. Children with abnormal CT scans were removed because we aimed to study the yield of MRI in concussion, which consensus statements have defined as a functional disturbance of brain function without imaging evidence of structural pathology.2Scans that identified normal variants, such as a cavum septum pellucidum, were classified as normal. Abnormal MRI scans were then reviewed by a pediatric neuroradiologist (F.A.P.) blinded to reports from the complete scan to determine whether or not the findings could be identified on FLAIR or SWI without additional sequences.\n\nStatistical analysis\nContinuous variables were described with median and interquartile range (IQR) and analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test or the Kruskal-Wallis test, as appropriate. Categorical variables were summarized with frequencies and proportions and analyzed using Pearson's chi-square test. The threshold for statistical significance was set to \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata/IC software (version 14.1 for Macintosh; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX)."

    "Methods": "Study design\nThis is a retrospective study based on records of 323 patients with tSCI admitted to the inpatient rehabilitation facility at l'Institut de R\u00e9adaptation en D\u00e9ficience Physique de Qu\u00e9bec (IRDPQ) (the study site) in Qu\u00e9bec City, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, between the periods of April 8, 2005 and March 24, 2012 (\nFig. 1\n). The study site and its partner, the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Qu\u00e9bec\u2013H\u00f4pital de l'Enfant-J\u00e9sus, constitute the Centre of Expertise for patients with SCI in eastern Qu\u00e9bec, providing care in seven regions of the province. As SCI Centre of Expertise, policies are in place to facilitate timely admission for patients requiring care. The study site enrolled all adult patients with tSCI except for those requiring ventilator support (patients with a C1-C3 American Spinal Injury Association [ASIA] Impairment Scale [AIS] A) who would be admitted to a dedicated facility elsewhere in the province; consequently the analysis lacked representation from this injury group. Data source for the study was from the two different local administrative databases used by the study site: CliniBase and a local Access database. Institutional research ethics approval was obtained before study commencement.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSample size flow chart of the study cohort. AIS, American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale.\n\nStudy variables\nPatient and injury factors included age at injury, gender, mechanism of injury, days from injury to rehabilitation admission (rehabilitation onset), presence of complications (pressure ulcer, urinary tract infection, and pneumonia), and neurological classification at admission (C1\u20134 AIS A,B,C; C5\u20138 AIS A,B,C; T1\u2013S5 AIS A,B,C; and AIS D) as measured by the AIS from the International Standards of Neurological Classification of SCI (ISNCSCI).\n23\nTherapy treatment factors included in this analysis were LOS at study site, hours of therapy, and therapy intensity. Total hours of therapy were defined as the time therapists spent working directly with a patient in an individual or group setting during the patient's LOS in the disciplines of OT, PT, and kinesiology. Because the measure collected pertains to the time provided by the therapists\u2014as opposed to the time actually received by each individual patient\u2014the hours of therapy may somewhat underestimate the actual therapy time each patient benefited from; intervention time provided by one therapist may be divided by more than one patient in certain group-intervention situations. Therapy intensity was defined as the hours of therapy provided by therapists per week and was calculated by the total hours of therapy provided divided by the total number of weeks of a patient's LOS.\nAt the study site, occupational therapists are responsible for teaching techniques for managing daily life activities and tasks such as getting dressed, preparing meals, and getting around the home and the community. The physical therapists help patients develop muscular potential and regain motor function. Patients are referred to kinesiologists by the physical therapist to work on movement and cardiovascular conditioning. The kinesiology therapies are typically delivered in a group-based format and thereby the \u201chours of therapy provided\u201d data significantly underestimates the actual time spent by the patients with the kinesiologists. Moreover, kinesiology therapies began only a few weeks before discharge and would generally continue on an outpatient basis. These outpatient hours were not included in the reported total hours of therapy.\nThe outcome of this study was the Motor Function Scores from the FIM\n1\n(motor FIM). This measure was used to describe the impact of the SCI on patient's activities of daily living and function in terms of the degree of independence performing the activities; hence, it is considered as a valid measure for burden of care but not necessarily for the degree of disability. The change in motor FIM assessed at admission and at discharge was used to reflect the functional change during the rehabilitation stay. Motor Function Scores were assessed on a seven-level scale in which level one indicated a patient's complete dependence to perform a task and level seven indicated that a patient can perform a specific task with complete independence, yielding a range of Motor Function Scores from 13 (totally dependent) to 91 (totally independent). Motor FIM efficiency was defined as the total amount of change in motor FIM divided by the patient's LOS.\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive analysis was performed to describe the patient sample. Before exploring the relationship between amount of rehabilitation therapy and motor FIM change, successive statistical tests involving a generalized additive model\n24\nbelonging to the nonparametric regression were first applied to determine the most suitable method of regression modeling for the data. The results suggested that quadratic form of regression was more appropriate for the data than a linear form (\nSupplementary Material\n; see online supplementary material at\nftp.liebertpub.com\n). Accordingly, polynomial regression with linear and quadratic forms of total hours of therapy was then applied and assessed with the lack-of-fit criteria. The second-order regression model (quadratic form of total hours of therapy) was used to analyze the effect of the amount of therapy on motor FIM change. Factors considered as clinically and statistically relevant for motor FIM change were included in the model (age at injury, gender, AIS and level of injury at admission, complications, and rehabilitation onset). Year of injury was not considered, because the mean LOS and the mean motor FIM change were not statistically different throughout the study years. Mechanism of injury was deemed not as clinically relevant as AIS and level of injury.\nPatients with an AIS D injury were modeled as a subgroup, because preliminary data analysis of the joint distribution of variables revealed a different pattern of motor FIM improvement from that group compared with the rest of the patients.\nFor the regression analyses, outliers were removed based on the Tukey method, which defines an outlier as 1.5 interquartile range below the 25th percentile or above the 75th percentile. A sensitivity analysis was performed to test whether the patient population with complete data was different from those with incomplete data. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was applied to compare the population means including age, motor FIM at admission, motor FIM change, complications, total hours of therapy, and total rehabilitation LOS.\nA\np\nvalue of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23.0, Armonk, NY, IBM Corp; R 3.1 (CRAN: the Comprehensive R Archive Network at\ncran.r-project.org/\n); and SAS software, Version 9.3 of the SAS System for Windows,\n\u00a9\n2013, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC.\n\nSimulation modeling\nTo explore ways to improve the efficiency of the provision of care and to predict its potential financial and resource implication, a computer simulation model referred to as the ACT Model V1.0 was employed. The development of the ACT Model has been described elsewhere.\n21\n,\n22\nThe ACT Model was customized for the study site in the following ways: (1) the study site's data on patient, injury, and therapy characteristics were used as input; (2) motor FIM change was added as an outcome after the rehabilitation care phase; (3) statistical analyses performed in this study on the effect of amount of therapy on motor FIM change were also used as input.\nThe model was used to test the effects of hypothetically increasing therapy intensities on system outcomes. Three \u201cwhat-if\u201d scenarios chosen for comparative analysis were: (1) baseline scenario (i.e., current therapy intensity); (2) 50% increase in therapy intensity; (3) 100% increase in therapy intensity. The simulation was designed to reflect the rehabilitation program in two aspects: the cumulative hours of therapy were increased gradually throughout the LOS, and the mean total hours of therapy provided was specific to each injury group. To satisfy these conditions, the simulation framework consisted of consecutive incremental steps of 15 therapy hours that were assigned to the four injury groups until each group reached its respective observed mean therapy hours, after which the group would be assigned the same number of hours until the end of simulation.\nThe assigned therapy hours were used to predict motor FIM change using the results found in this study. The assigned therapy hours were also used to predict LOS based on a linear regression model where both the number of therapy hours and injury severity were significant predictors.\nTo account for therapy intensity, the LOS was reduced to reflect each proposed scenario. For the 50% increase scenario, the LOS was reduced to 75%, so that if 10\u2009h of therapy were normally provided in 10 days, the simulation would adjust it to 7.5 days (i.e., providing 1.5\u2009h of therapy every day instead of 1\u2009h). For the 100% scenario, the LOS was reduced to 50% (i.e., providing 2\u2009h of therapy per day, instead of 1\u2009h).\nThe predicted motor FIM change and LOS were used to compute motor FIM efficiency. LOS was also used to calculate bed utilization and care costs. The bed utilization was calculated by the formula:\nCare costs were based on the values of cost per day and cost of services during the initial hospitalization for each neurological category of tSCI as published by Krueger and colleagues,\n25\nand were reported as 2011 Canadian dollars. Fifty replications were performed for each simulation run."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll animal procedures approved by the University of California Animal Care Committee (Irvine, CA) and conformed to the recommendations of the American Veterinary Medical Association Panel on Euthanasia. Male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) weighing 300\u2013350 (approximately 8\u201312 weeks), were maintained in a 12-h light/12-h dark (6:00\nam\n/6:00\npm\n) cycle and fed standard rat chow. Animals typically arrive 2 weeks before experiments and are handled daily for 5\u2009min to allow for habituation and reduction of stress levels.\n\nCardiac arrest\nAfter 6:00\npm\nthe night preceding the CA experiment, rats were fasted with 25% of their normal dietary intake. On the day of CA, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane, intubated, and connected to a TOPO\n\u2122\nmechanical ventilator (Kent Scientific, Torrington, CT) to allow delivery of 2% isoflurane and 50% O\n2\nand 50% N\n2\ngas during surgical preparation for CA. Operative procedures typically began by 9:00\nam\n. The femoral artery and vein were cannulated to monitor blood pressure (BP) and heart rate and to allow for the intravenous (i.v.) administration of medications. While intubated and mechanically ventilated, positive end expiratory pressure was maintained at 3\u2009cmH\n2\nO and body temperature was monitored with a rectal thermometer and maintained at 37\n\u00b0\nC. The CA experiment occurs in sequence beginning at \u201cminute 0\u201d when isoflurane level was reduced to 1.0\u20131.5% to lighten the level of anesthesia while inhaled gas was switched to 100% O\n2\n. Two minutes later, isoflurane was stopped to wash out residual anesthesia and a neuromuscular blocker paralyzer (Vecuronium 2\u2009mg/kg i.v.) was administered. At this time, the ventilator inlet was disconnected from oxygen gas to allow room air to be mechanically delivered to the animal. Asphyxia was initiated at minute 5 of the experiment by turning the ventilator off and clamping the ventilator tubing, leading to asphyxial CA. CA time was defined as systolic BP less than 30 and pulse pressure of 10 or less. We decided to choose an 8-min duration of asphyxia to induce CA after our preliminary experiments showed that 7-min asphyxia duration led to milder and more transient neurological deficits that are less representative of human CA outcome whereas 9-min asphyxia duration led to significant mortality in rats (inability to resuscitate). After 8\u2009min of total asphyxia time, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed (manual sternal compressions at 180\u2013240 per minute), mechanical ventilation was resumed at 100% O\n2\n(4 liters per minute flow rate), tidal volume \u223c8\u2009mL/kg (by adjusting peak inspiratory pressures) with respiratory rate 70\u201380 per min, and epinephrine (0.01\u2009mg/kg) was administered with NaHCO\n3\n(1.0\u2009mmol/kg). CPR continued for 1\u2009min or until return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). No isoflurane anesthesia was administered during or after CPR for the remainder of the experiment. Arterial blood gases were obtained 10\u2009min before asphyxia and 10\u2009min after ROSC to allow optimal adjustment of the ventilator. Over the next 1\u20132\u2009h after ROSC, vessels were decannulated, and when spontaneous respirations were adequate, rats were extubated. The entire CA procedure from initial anesthesia to extubation typically took approximately 5\u2009h.\n\nPost\u2013cardiac arrest care\nNormal saline (5\u2009mL) and lactated Ringer's (5\u2009mL) was injected subcutaneously (s.c.) 5\u2009h after CPR to limit dehydration until the rat was able to drink water over the subsequent hours. At the same time, animals received prophylactic cefazolin (45\u2009mg/kg) to limit risk of infection. One cup of HydroGel (ClearH\n2\nO, Portland, ME) and 10 pellets pre-soaked in water were placed near the rat's mouth and throughout the cage until the rat recovered and resumed eating normal rat chow. The rat was re-examined 12\u201318\u2009h post-CA and every 24\u2009h post-CA to ensure proper hydration and food consumption. Rats that were unable to drink water or eat pre-soaked pellets (e.g., suvorexant-treated rats) were hydrated daily with s.c. saline and lactated Ringer's injections.\n\nNeurological evaluation\nArousal and neurological recovery were quantified using the Neurological Deficit Scale (NDS;\nTable 1\n), as described previously.\n18\nThe NDS consists of components that measure arousal, brainstem function, motor, and sensory activities. The NDS was determined at 4, 24, and 72\u2009h post-ROSC by at least two well-trained personnel who were blind to treatments.\nTable 2\nshows the number rats undergoing NDS evaluations at the various time points post-ROSC. Sample sizes were determined based on a preliminary power analysis.

Rats received intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections supplemented with suvorexant (30\u2009mg/kg) immediately (i.e., within 5\u2009min) after resuscitation and 10 and 20\u2009h post-CA. Control rats were injected with 1\u2009mL of vehicle at the same time intervals. Personnel were blinded to the treatment.\nBecause of the complexity of the experimental procedures, only 1 rat can be prepared for CA on a given day. Because of the need for animal care and behavioral tests on subsequent days, only 1\u20132 rats undergoing suvorexant or vehicle treatments were conducted per week. Accordingly, suvorexant and saline groups were comprised of rats prepared in the following time sequence. A total of 10 experiments (five drug and five vehicle) were planned from the beginning. A separate group of lab personnel who were not involved with the animal experiments randomly assigned rats into either drug or vehicle groups and prepared three syringes for i.p. injection at the three separate time points: immediately after resuscitation; at 10\u2009h post-CA; and at 20\u2009h post-CA. Syringes were covered with aluminum foil and labeled in a masked fashion to maintain blindness for staff conducting the injection.\nTable 3\nshows the treatment versus vehicle animal numbers undergoing NDS testing at the various time points. All animals were successfully resuscitated and survived until 72\u2009h post-CA, when euthanasia occurred.\nTable\n3.\nNumber of Rats Used For Suvorexant Treatment\nNDS Time points measured/no. of rats\na\nTreatment group\nControl\n4\u2009h\n24\u2009h\n72\u2009h\nDrug (suvorexant)\n5\n5\n5\n5\nControl (vehicle)\n5\n5\n5\n5\nOpen in a separate window\na\nAll experiments terminated at 72\u2009h; no attrition.\nNDS, Neurological Deficit Scale.\n\nCerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue collections\nRats were anesthetized with Euthasal (catalog no.: NDC 66794-013-25, a dose of 1\u2009mL/kg by i.p. injection; Pramal/Healthcare, Mumbai, India). After rats lost withdrawal to paw pinch, approximately 50\u2013100\u2009\u03bcL of CSF were collected by puncture into the cisterna magna using a glass capillary. Rats were then immediately perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137\u2009mM of NaCl, 2.7\u2009mM of KCl, 10\u2009mM of Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, and 1.8\u2009mM of KH\n2\nPO\n4\n; pH 7.4), and brains were dissected out and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20\u2009h at 4\u00b0C. The fixed brain was transferred and maintained in 30% sucrose for 4 days and subsequently frozen in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) embedding medium and kept in \u221280\u00b0C. CSF and brains from control rats were collected in a similar manner without undergoing the CA procedure.\nTable 2\nshows all rats successfully undergoing cisternal tap and CSF isolation. Technical difficulties prevented successful isolation of CSF from some rats.\n\nImmunofluorescence\nFrozen brains in OCT were coronally sectioned at 30\u2009\u03bcm using a cryostat (Microtome HM 505N). Sections were stored in serial order in a 96-well plate in 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009PBS with NaN\n3\nat 4\u00b0C. For immunohistochemistry (IHC), brain sections were blocked with 5% donkey serum in 0.3% PBST (0.3% Triton X-100 in 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009PBS) for 1\u2009h at room temperature, incubated with 1% donkey serum in 0.3% PBST with primary antibodies for 72\u2009h at 4\u00b0C, washed, and then incubated with secondary antibodies and 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 2\u2009h at room temperature, followed by final washes and cover-slipped onto microscope slides using Vectashield Mounting Medium (H-1000; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The following primary and secondary antibodies were used: goat anti-orexin-A C-19 (OXA, SC-8070; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); rabbit antimelanin concentrating hormone (MCH); Alexa Fluor 488 donkey antirabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG; A21206; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA); and Alexa Fluor 555 donkey antigoat IgG (A21432; Life Technologies).\n\nMeasurement of cerebrospinal fluid orexin-A concentration\nOXA concentration in CSF was analyzed using a radioimmunoassay kit (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Belmont, CA). For each rat, approximately 2\u201310\u2009\u03bcL of CSF sample was subjected to measurement, and the average of duplicated sets was used for statistical analysis.\n\nCell counting\nQuantification of OXA and MCH neurons was performed as described elsewhere.\n19\u201322\nBriefly, based on the rat brain atlas (\nThe Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates\n, 6th Edition) from figure 54 (bregma, \u22122.52\u2009mm) to figure 65 (bregma, \u22123.84\u2009mm), 12 sections were chosen at a 90-\u03bcm interval (one of every four sections) covering a total 1350\u2009\u03bcm of the hypothalamus area where OXA and MCH are expressed. Sections were prepared for double immunofluorescence for OXA and MCH as described above. All of the brain sections were screened under the microscope and five sections (between Figures 58 and 62), which included the highest number of OXA and MCH neurons, were selected. Large images (3.0\u2009mm dorsoventral\u2009\u00d7\u20091.8\u2009mm mediolateral) that encompassed the hypothalamic area containing all neurons expressing either OXA or MCH were obtained using the large scan acquisition tool on a Nikon Eclipse Ti-E microscope (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). For cell counts, images were imported into ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD) and the numbers of OXA- and MCH-immunoreactive neurons were counted by three trained personnel using ImageJ Plugin \u201cCell Counter.\u201d Cells with nuclei were included in counts. To avoid cell-counting errors, brains that were cut in oblique angles were excluded from the analysis. Total number of rat brains that were included in histology and cell counting after taking into account these technical limitations are shown in\nTable 2\n.\n\nSemiquantitative image analysis by using CellProfiler\nOne brain section that contained the highest number of OXA neurons (typically the area shown in Figure 61, bregma \u22123.36\u2009mm of\nThe Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates\n, 6th edition) was selected per animal. These selected sections from each rat were simultaneously stained according to the IHC protocol described above. Large scan images of the hypothalamus (\u223c1.5\u2009\u00d7\u20091.2\u2009mm) were acquired using Nikon Eclipse Ti-E. The same imaging conditions applied to each section, including exposure time, gain, and resolution. For unbiased, high-throughput computational image analysis, CellProfiler Cell Image Analysis Software (version 2.1.1) was used.\n23\n,\n24\nOXA- and MCH-immunoreactive neurons were identified under the same algorithms of image analysis, image detection thresholds, parameters, and filter settings. All images were blindly analyzed to acquire 1) sizes of neurons, 2) immunofluorescent pixel intensities per neuron, and 3) mean pixel intensities of OXA- and MCH-immunoreactive neurons.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics software (V21; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Statistical pair-wise comparisons to determine significance were made either by unpaired two-tailed\nt\n-test or by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a post-hoc Tukey test. Data in\nFigure 4A\nwere analyzed by repeated-measure ANOVA general linear model; data in\nFigure 4B\nwere analyzed by two-way ANOVA and post-hoc\nt\n-tests using Prism software (Version 6.0; GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). Correlation analyses were done using bivariate correlations and Spearman coefficients were reported. A\np\nvalue <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 4.\nDual orexin receptor antagonist (suvorexant) impairs neurological recovery post-CA.

    "Methods": "Subjects\nTwenty-five adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. All rats were 4 to 5 months old at the beginning of the experiment. Rats weighed at least 250\u2009g and were food deprived to no less than 85% of their normal body weight during behavioral testing. The rats were housed in a reverse 12:12\u2009h light cycle to increase daytime activity. All handling, housing, surgical procedures, and behavioral training of the rats were approved by the University of Texas Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nExperimental design\nIn the first experiment, we examined the effect of TBI on organization of the intact motor cortex in untrained animals (\nFig. 1A\n). Two groups of animals were used: untrained controls that received no CCI (Controls;\nn\n=\u20096) and untrained animals that received a CCI in the left motor cortex (TBI Only;\nn\n=\u20097). ICMS was performed in the right motor cortex (contralateral to the TBI) of each group, and both ipsilateral (right side) and contralateral (left side) movement responses were recorded (\nFig. 1C\n). ICMS occurred approximately 2 months after the TBI in the TBI Only group.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExperimental design.\n(A)\nFour groups of animals were used in this study. In the first experiment, animals were separated into a group of unlesioned controls and another group that received a traumatic brain injury (TBI). The second experiment consisted of two groups of animals, each receiving training on the pull task for 3 months, and one of these groups received a TBI after achieving proficiency at the task. Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) was performed in all groups such that the time since the controlled cortical impact (CCI) and the total amount of training was matched between groups.\n(B)\nAn example of a rat performing the isometric pull task.\n(C)\nRats were given a CCI in the left motor cortex, which primarily affects usage of the opposite limb. ICMS was performed in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the affected limb.\n(D)\nA picture illustrating an exemplar TBI lesion.\nIn the second experiment, we investigated how forelimb training affects organization of the intact hemisphere after TBI (\nFig. 1A, 1B\n). Two additional cohorts of animals were used: trained animals that did not receive a CCI (Training Only;\nn\n=\u20096) and trained animals that received a CCI (TBI+Training;\nn\n=\u20096). After 1 week of recovery following the TBI, all animals performed forelimb training for 2 months. ICMS was then performed in the right motor cortex (contralateral to the TBI, and ipsilateral to the trained limb) after the completion of forelimb training.\nAnimals were matched such that the Training Only and TBI+Training groups each received an equal amount of training on the pull task, and the TBI Only and TBI+Training groups were each mapped at equivalent time-points after the CCI.\nFigure 1A\nshows a detailed timeline for each group of animals. Data from a subset of these rats were published in a previous study.\n25\n\nControlled cortical impact procedure\nRats were anesthetized with a cocktail of ketamine hydrochloride (50\u2009mg/kg), xylazine (20\u2009mg/kg), and acepromazine (5\u2009mg/kg) injected intramuscularly, and given supplemental doses as needed. After placing the rat in a stereotaxic frame, a craniotomy was performed to expose motor cortex in the left hemisphere. A controlled-cortical impact device was then centered over the forelimb area of exposed motor cortex (\nFig. 1D\n). In Experiment 1, rats in the TBI Only group were impacted using a spring-loaded impactor\n26\n,\n27\nwith a calculated velocity of 3\u2009m/sec and an impact depth of 2\u2009mm. As in our previous studies, the impactor was allowed to dwell for 5\u2009sec before it was removed from the brain. In Experiment 2, rats in the TBI+Training group were impacted using a commercially acquired controlled-cortical impact device (Impact One; Leica). Standard impact parameters used in the TBI+Training group were an impact velocity of 5\u20136\u2009m/sec, an impact depth of 2\u2009mm, a dwell time of 0.3\u2009sec, and an impact tip with a 3\u2009mm diameter.\nTable 1\ndetails the exact impact parameters used for each rat in this study. After the impactor was positioned over the exposed cortex, an impact was delivered. Following the impact, the craniotomy was covered with a thin layer of bone cement.\n28\nAfter surgery, rats received subcutaneous administration of antibiotics (Baytril, 10\u2009mg/kg), analgesic (buprenorphine, 0.3\u2009mg/kg), and 4\u2009mL of 50:50 0.9% saline and 5% dextrose. Two days after surgery, each rat was given one additional Baytril tablet (0.5\u2009mg, BioServ, Frenchtown, NJ).\nTable\n1.\nCCI Parameters Used for Each Rat in the Study\nRat\nImpactor type\nImpact velocity (m/sec)\nTip diameter (mm)\nDwell time (sec)\nDepth (mm)\nTBI-only group (Experiment 1)\n1\nSpring\n3\n3\n5\n2\n2\nSpring\n3\n3\n5\n2\n3\nSpring\n3\n3\n5\n2\n4\nSpring\n3\n3\n5\n2\n5\nSpring\n3\n3\n5\n2\n6\nSpring\n3\n3\n5\n2\n7\nSpring\n3\n3\n5\n2\nTBI+training group (Experiment 2)\n1\nLeica\n5\n3\n0.3\n2\n2\nLeica\n5\n3\n5\n2\n3\nLeica\n5\n3\n0.3\n2\n4\nLeica\n6\n3\n0.3\n2\n5\nLeica\n6\n3\n0.3\n2\n6\nLeica\n6\n3\n0.3\n4\nOpen in a separate window\nCCI, controlled cortical impact; TBI, traumatic brain injury.\n\nIsometric pull task\nThe behavioral apparatus and software were used as described in previous studies.\n26\n,\n27\n,\n29\u201331\nThe isometric pull task is designed to assess skilled forelimb function and volitional forelimb strength. The apparatus (Base Cage; Vulintus, Inc., Dallas, TX) consisted of an acrylic box (25.4\u2009\u00d7\u200930.5\u2009\u00d7\u200912.1\u2009cm). The box contained a slot in the front right corner that the rat could reach through to access an aluminum pull handle (Pull Behavior Module; Vulintus, Inc.). The slot was sized and positioned such that rats could only reach and pull using their right forelimb (\nFig. 1B\n). The pull handle was centered in the slot at a height of 6.4\u2009cm from the cage floor and 1.9\u2009cm outside the cage relative to the inner cage wall for fully trained animals. The aluminum handle was connected to a force transducer that could measure pull force with sub-gram accuracy. The force transducers were inspected daily and recalibrated using a system of standard weights and linear interpolation when the baseline drifted by \u00b15\u2009g. Matlab software was used to control the behavioral apparatus. A microprocessor controller (Controller; Vulintus, Inc.) sampled the force transducer at 100\u2009Hz and sent the information to the Matlab software, which displayed the data on screen, controlled the behavior session, and saved the data to permanent files.\n\nBehavioral training\nAll animals in Experiment 2 underwent identical forelimb training, consisting of two 30-min sessions per day, 5 days per week, with at least 2\u2009h between daily sessions. Shaping procedures were similar to those previously described.\n26\n,\n27\n,\n29\n,\n30\nAnimals were trained to reach through a narrow slot in the cage with the right forelimb, grasp a handle, and apply at least 120\u2009g of force. A trial was initiated when at least 10\u2009g of force were applied to the pull handle. After initiation, the force on the pull handle was sampled for 4\u2009sec. If the force threshold required for a hit was met within 2\u2009sec after trial initiation, the trial was recorded as a success and a reward pellet was delivered (45\u2009mg dustless precision pellet; BioServ). If the force threshold was not reached within 2\u2009sec, the trial was recorded as a failure and no reward was delivered. Success rate for each day was calculated as the number of hits for that day divided by the total number of trials for the day. After achieving a stable baseline, defined as 10 consecutive sessions over which the average success rate on the pull task was 85% or higher, half of the animals received a CCI. Forelimb training commenced 1 week after the CCI and continued for 2 months. At the completion of 2 months of post-lesion training, the ICMS procedure was performed (\nFig. 1A\n).\n\nICMS procedure\nAt the prescribed time (\nFig. 1A\n), ICMS was performed using standard procedures to investigate right-sided (ipsilateral) and left-sided (contralateral) movement representations in the right hemisphere (the hemisphere ipsilateral to the trained forelimb;\nFig. 1C\n).\n25\nRats were anesthetized with a cocktail of ketamine hydrochloride (50\u2009mg/kg), xylazine (20\u2009mg/kg), and acepromazine (5\u2009mg/kg) injected intramuscularly, and given supplemental doses as needed.\nAfter placing the rat in the stereotaxic frame, a craniotomy and duratomy were performed to expose motor cortex in the right hemisphere (4\u2009mm to \u22123\u2009mm anteroposterior [AP], and 0.25\u2009mm to 5\u2009mm mediolateral [ML]). A tungsten electrode (impedance less than 1\u2009M\u2126) was inserted to a depth of 1.8\u2009mm into the cortex. Electrode penetrations were performed along a grid with each site spaced 500\u2009\u03bcm apart. Stimulation sites were chosen randomly, with an effort made to ensure that each site was at least 1\u2009mm in distance from the immediately previous penetration. Each stimulation consisted of a 40\u2009msec pulse train of ten 200-\u03bcsec monophasic cathodal pulses delivered at 286\u2009Hz. A maximum stimulation intensity of 300\u2009\u03bcA was used to determine the presence of any ipsilateral forelimb response to stimulation. The maximum stimulation intensity was chosen based on previous studies that indicate ipsilateral motor responses are evoked at higher currents than contralateral responses.\n25\n,\n32\n,\n33\nThe presence of ipsilateral forelimb movement was first determined, and the current was then lowered to find the lowest threshold at which ipsilateral movement was reliably evoked. After determining the threshold current for ipsilateral responses, the current was again lowered until a threshold was found for contralateral movement. If no ipsilateral or contralateral movement was observed at the maximal stimulation, then the site was deemed nonresponsive. The borders of motor cortex were defined based on nonresponsive sites on all sides.\nAll ICMS experiments were performed blinded by two experimenters, as in previous studies.\n25\n,\n34\n,\n35\nThe first experimenter would place the electrode. The second experimenter, blinded to experimental condition and electrode location, would deliver stimulation and classify responses. Each site was classified based on the part of the body that moved at the lowest threshold stimulation current. Jaw, vibrissae, and neck movement were classified as \u201chead\u201d responses. Any movement of the digits, wrist, elbow, and shoulder was considered a \u201cforelimb\u201d response. Any hindlimb movements were classified as \u201chindlimb\u201d responses. Cortical area for each movement representation was calculated by multiplying the number of sites eliciting a response by 0.25\u2009mm\n2\n(0.5\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20090.5\u2009mm). At the completion of the ICMS procedure, all animals that had received CCI lesions were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde and standard histological techniques were used to confirm the presence of a lesion.\n26\n,\n27\n\nStatistical analysis\nBehavioral data obtained with the isometric pull task were analyzed using Matlab software similar to previous descriptions.\n26\n,\n27\n,\n29\n,\n36\nGroups were compared across time using a mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by\npost hoc\npaired or unpaired\nt\n-tests as statistically merited.\nThe primary outcome measure of the ICMS procedures was the number of ipsilateral forelimb responses observed from each animal, while other responses on the contralateral side of the body were secondary measures. Lilliefors test was used to determine whether the ICMS data was normally distributed. Because the ICMS data of the TBI Only group was not normally distributed, a Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare the TBI Only group with control rats in the first experiment. Due to an absence of ipsilateral forelimb responses in animals receiving a TBI, a Chi-squared test was used to investigate differences in the proportion of animals that had responses between the Control and TBI Only groups. In the second experiment, the data was normally distributed and an unpaired\nt\n-test was used to compare ICMS data between the Training Only and TBI+Training groups.\nWhen comparing ICMS data from both experiments together, a two-way ANOVA was used for a complete analysis of all groups, followed by Tukey-Kramer\npost hoc\ntests to compare individual group differences. Complete maps from all animals used in this study have been included in the\nSupplementary Material\n(see online supplementary material at\nwww.liebertpub.com\n).\nWhere appropriate, corresponding effect sizes were calculated for each statistical test. The effect size measurements used were Cohen's U\n1\n(to complement the Wilcoxon rank-sum test), Hedge's g (to complement\nt\n-tests), risk difference (to complement Chi-squared), and partial eta-squared (\u03b7p\n2\n, to complement repeated-measures ANOVA and two-way ANOVA).\nLesion size within TBI animals from both experiments was measured by four separate raters blinded to experimental group. The median lesion size from the four raters was calculated for each brain. Lesion size was then compared between the two groups of TBI animals using an unpaired\nt\n-test. A Spearman's rho was calculated to investigate whether a relationship exists between lesion size and ICMS ipsilateral forelimb area."

    "Methods": "All experimental procedures were conducted in strict accordance with the guidelines set by the Drexel University Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee and the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, U.S. National Academy of Sciences. Adult Chx10-eGFP (green fluorescent protein) transgenic mice (Strain 011391-UCD) obtained from Mutant Mouse Regional Research Centers (MMRRC University of California, Davis, CA) were created using a bacterial artificial chromosome on a FVB/N- Swiss Webster hybrid background strain and used in all experiments. A total of 22 mice (na\u00efve, uninjuredn=\u20098; C2Hx,n=\u200914) were used for this study. Of those, three mice were used for terminal electrophysiological recordings immediately after C2Hx and five mice survived the C2Hx injury to receive terminal electrophysiological recordings two weeks post-injury.\n\nAll operations were performed under isoflurane anesthesia (induction 5%; maintenance 2%, in 100% O2at 2\u2009L/min) on a water-circulating heating pad. Upon recovery, animals received buprenorphine analgesic (subcutaneous [sc] at 0.03\u2009mg/kg) and warmed lactated Ringer's solution (1\u2009mL sc to prevent dehydration). In those animals receiving C2Hx (n=\u200914), an incision was made extending from the base of the skull to the third cervical segment (C3), and a laminectomy was made at the second cervical segment (C2). A dural incision was then made, and a lateral Hx was performed on the left side of the spinal cord by inserting a No. 11 scalpel blade through the midline of the dorsal columns ventrally to the underlying vertebral column, drawing the blade laterally and angling the tip outward so that it followed the underlying vertebrae, transecting the lateral funiculus. This approach was repeated three times on the left side of the spinal cord. Unlike our previous experience with C2Hx in the adult rat,7\u20139the dura was not sutured immediately post-injury. Overlying muscle was sutured in layers, and the skin was closed with wound clips. Extent of the lesion was confirmed viapost-hochistochemical analysis.\n\nInjured (n=\u200911) and na\u00efve Chx10-eGFP (n=\u20098) mice were traced with a transsynaptic, retrograde pseudorabies virus tracer (PRV614; a PRV Bartha promoting mRFP expression). Animals were anesthetized as described above, a laparotomy was performed to expose the diaphragm, the liver gently moved from the muscle surface, and PRV614 was topically applied to the left hemidiaphragm (50\u2009\u03bcl, 2.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009108plaque-forming units [pfu]/mL) as described previously for both rat6and mouse.10Animals were allowed to survive for 72\u2009h before undergoing terminal, bilateral, diaphragm electromyography (dEMG).\n\nTerminal bilateral dEMG recordings were made immediately (n=\u20093) or two weeks post-C2Hx (n=\u20095), or 72\u2009h post-PRV (n=\u20098) in age-matched na\u00efve control animals, just before being euthanized and perfusion-fixed for histological analyses. Animals were anesthetized with a mixture of xylazine hydrochloride and ketamine hydrochloride (9\u2009mg/kg sc and 72\u2009mg/kg intraperitoneally, respectively). A laparotomy was then performed along the incision made during PRV-tracing to re-expose the abdominal surface of the diaphragm. Bipolar hook electrodes (paraformaldehyde [PFA]-coated tungsten wire with exposed tips, A-M Systems, Cat # 796500) were then placed into the medial costal region of the left and right hemidiaphragm as described previously.11Activity was recorded during spontaneous breathing, and baseline was counted as a minimum of 10\u2009min of stable activity. The dEMG signals were amplified (1,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009) and band pass filtered (0.3-10KHz) using differential A/C amplifier (Model 1700, A-M Systems) and digitized (Power 1401, Cambridge Electronic Design). Recordings were analyzed using Spike 2 and OriginLab 9 software as described previously.11\n\nAt the end of each experiment, all animals were deeply anesthetized by an overdose of ketamine, intracardially perfused with saline (0.9% NaCl in water) and paraformaldehyde (PFA; 4% w/v in 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffered saline [PBS], pH 7.4), and the spinal cord immediately dissected and stored in PFA. For cell counts, tissue was sectioned in the horizontal plane (20\u2009\u03bcm, on slide), and all sections were stained for chicken-GFP (1:750, Abcam) and Rabbit-PRV (1:10,000, courtesy of Lynn Enquist, Princeton University) with anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 488 (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). For lesion reconstruction, tissue (n=\u20093) was sectioned in the horizontal plane (20\u2009\u03bcm, on slide), histologically processed with cresyl violet, and every section was used to create an average overlay of the lesion created by the injury. For characterization of the transgenic line, tissue was sectioned in the transverse plane (20\u2009\u03bcm, on slide) and stained for sheep-Chx10 (1:200, Millipore), with anti-sheep Alexa Fluor 594 (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Sections were photographed and examined using a Zeiss M2 AxioImager microscope.\n\nPRV-positive PhMNs, PRV positive spinal interneurons (SpINs), and PRV/GFP double-labeled cells with visible nuclei were counted at 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification in every longitudinal cervical spinal cord section from each animal sectioned longitudinally as described previously.6,11The corrected number (Abercrombie correction factor) of PhMNs and PhINs are reported as averages for post-injury and na\u00efve groups\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation.\n\nAnatomical and electrophysiological results were quantified using Microsoft Office Excel 2016, Spike 2 (version 8, Cambridge Electronic Design, UK) and OriginLab9 software (Northampton, MA).

    "Methods": "Study design\nThis cohort review utilized data from the Rick Hansen Spinal Cord Injury Registry (RHSCIR) collected from patients admitted to an SCI specialized acute care facility located within a Level I trauma center (Vancouver General Hospital) between 2004 and 2012. RHSCIR is a pan-Canadian prospective registry of patients with tSCI admitted to 1 of 18 acute and 13 rehabilitation facilities. All participating facilities obtained local research ethics approval before enrolling patients. A core dataset was collected for all patients, and an expanded dataset and a long-term community follow-up questionnaire administered over an extended period of time post-injury were collected for those who provided informed consent.\n18\nDetails of the RHSCIR and the community follow-up questionnaire are described elsewhere.\n18\n,\n19\nFor this study, community follow-up data collected between 9 and 18 months post-discharge from inpatient care (referred to as \u201c1 year in the community\u201d) were included in the analysis.\n\nStudy variables\nPatient and injury factors\nDemographic details of patients obtained from the RHSCIR expanded dataset used in the analysis were: age at injury, gender, education level, employment status, marital status, compensation status, neurological injury severity by American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA Impairment Scale [AIS]; AIS A, B, C, D, E), and neurological injury level (cervical, C1\u2013C8; thoracolumbar, T1 and below) at discharge from inpatient care, both derived from the International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI (ISNCSCI) examination.\n20\nRural and urban setting\nThe residential postal code collected at discharge from inpatient care and at 1 year in the community were used to determine living setting (rural vs. urban) at the respective time-points. Statistics Canada generally defines rural as being fewer than 400 people per square kilometer. The process of defining a rural or urban place of residence has been described previously.\n21\nIndividuals who migrated from one living setting to another between discharge and 1 year in the community were identified and compared with those who remained in the same living setting.\nOutcomes\nPatient outcomes analyzed in this study were collected in follow-up questionnaires and included: the Craig Hospital Inventory of Environmental Factors Short Form (CHIEF-SF),\n22\nthe Functional Independence Measure (FIM\n\u00ae\n) instrument, the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form-36 Version 2 (SF36v2\u2122) Questionnaire,\n23\nthe Life Satisfaction Questionnaire (LiSat-11), and the SCI Health Questionnaire (SCIHQ).\n19\nThese outcome measures have been previously validated and shown to be appropriate with long-term follow-up of tSCI patients.\n19\n,\n22\n,\n25\u201327\nThe CHIEF-SF questionnaire measures the frequency and magnitude of perceived environmental barriers on participation in activities. A mean total CHIEF-SF score and the mean five subscale scores (policy barriers, physical/structural barriers, work/school barriers, attitudes/support barriers, and services/assistance barriers) were calculated.\n22\nThe FIM instrument was used to quantify physical and cognitive functioning, and a mean total FIM score was calculated.\n25\nThe SF36v2 assesses health status and includes eight domains (physical functioning, role limitations\u2013physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role limitations\u2013emotional, mental health), which can be reported as Physical Component Score (PCS) and Mental Component Score (MCS).\n23\nThe LiSat-11 is a measure of quality of life, also referred to as subjective well-being, and a mean total score was calcuated.\n24\nThe SCIHQ asked the patient to self-report any secondary health conditions experienced, and the conditions selected for this study were deemed to require specialized care based on clinical expert opinion, and included: autonomic dysreflexia, deep vein thrombosis, depression, pressure ulcers, spasticity, and urinary tract infections.\n19\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics were used to describe demographic and injury factors of patients in the study cohort. Statistical tests were performed to compare patient outcomes between the rural and urban populations at 1 year in the community. After reviewing the distribution of data, normally distributed data were compared using\nt\ntest; data not normally distributed were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. For discrete data, Fisher's exact test or \u03c7\n2\ntest was used.\nA sensitivity analysis was performed to test if patients lost to follow-up were different from those included in the study.

    "Methods": "Animal subjects\nSubjects were 14 female Sprague-Dawley rats (8\u201312 weeks old at time of entry into the study) housed individually with a 12\u2009h light/12\u2009h dark cycle with food and water available\nad libitum.\nAll of these animals were part of a larger study of EUS activity during spontaneous voiding in rats with intact spinal cords.\n22\nAll animal procedures were in accord with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, Commission on Life Sciences, National Research Council (National Academy Press, Washington, DC, 2010), and had been reviewed and approved by the Wadsworth Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nSurgical preparation and peri-operative care\nDuring all surgeries, aseptic technique was used and animals were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane gas (4% for induction, 1.5\u20132.5% for maintenance). Hydration during surgical procedures was maintained by subcutaneous saline administration. Local anesthetic (bupivacaine) and topical antibiotic ointment (nitrofurazone) were applied to all skin incisions after closure. For 5\u201310 days after implantation, animals received antibiotics (gentamicin 4\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneally [i.p.] twice daily) and penicillin (50,000 units/kg, i.p. every other day) and an analgesic (carprofen, 10\u2009mg/kg, subcutaneously [s.c.] immediately after surgery, and subsequently 5\u2009mg/kg s.c. or 1\u2009mg p.o. [half of a 5-g tablet] twice daily). After transection, animals received antibiotics until the return of spontaneous bladder reflex function (see below). Transected animals also received a high-calorie nutrient supplement (Nutri-Cal) p.o. two times per day until the end of the study.\nEach rat received two surgical procedures. The first procedure was for implantation of EUS EMG electrodes. After a 2- to 3-week recovery period and subsequent 24-h EUS EMG and urinary output recording sessions using spinal-intact rats, a second surgical procedure was performed for spinal cord transection, and the recordings were repeated. These procedures and recordings are described below.\n\nEUS EMG electrode implantation\nRats were implanted with wires for recording EUS EMG as described in LaPallo and colleagues.\n22\nBriefly, anesthetized rats received a midline incision over the skull through which EUS EMG electrodes were routed to a midline abdominal incision. The pubic bone was exposed by blunt dissection. The EUS EMG electrodes were passed through a pair of holes drilled in the pubic bone just lateral to the midline about 5\u2009mm caudal to the rostral bone edge and secured with suture to a pair of holes drilled near the rostral bone edge. After flushing the surgical field with saline and closing the abdominal incision with absorbable suture and the skin with wound clips, the connector to which the EUS EMG wires connected was secured to the skull with bone screws and dental cement.\n\nSpinal transections\nAnimals received either mid-thoracic or thoraco-lumbar complete spinal cord transections. For the mid-thoracic transection, rats were anesthetized and a 3-cm skin incision was made over the vertebral column extending caudally from the level of the caudal aspect of the scapulae. Bilateral incisions were made along the sides of the T7 to T9 spinous processes and the muscle and connective tissue were cleared from the vertebral laminae. After removing the T8 spinous process and lamina with rongeurs, the periosteum was carefully pulled from the surface of the dura and the dura was cut to expose the spinal cord. A drop of local anesthetic was placed on the spinal cord and after 3\u20134 minutes, it was transected with fine spring scissors. Visual observation of retraction of the cut ends of the spinal cord allowed confirmation of complete transection. After inserting a small piece of absorbable gelatin sponge (Gelfoam) between the cut ends of the spinal cord to control bleeding, the incised muscle over the transection area was closed with absorbable suture and the skin incision was closed with wound clips. The surgical site was flushed with sterile saline at each stage of the procedure. Analgesics and antibiotics were administered as described above.\nThe procedure for thoraco-lumbar transections differed from that of the mid-thoracic transections only in the location of the surgical site, laminectomy, and the spinal segmental location of the transection. The skin incision centered over the T12 vertebra and subsequent incision and clearance of muscle and connective tissue exposed the T11 to T13 vertebrae. The T12 spinous process and lamina were removed and the dura was incised along the midline and reflected. Initial transections of the lumbar spinal cord targeted to the L3-L4 level resulted in near-total gray matter atrophy and loss of EUS EMG activity. This was likely due to ischemia caused by interruption of the main arterial supply to the lumbar spinal cord, given that the most caudal ventral radicular artery enters the spinal cord typically at or rostral to L1, occasionally at L2, but never more caudally.\n23\n,\n24\nThus, subsequent transections were performed just cranial to the most caudal large thoraco-lumbar blood vessels, typically in the lower thoracic or upper lumbar spinal segment.\nSpinal transection renders the LUT areflexive for a variable length of time. During this period, the bladders of rats were manually expressed two to three times per day until spontaneous micturition reflexes re-emerged and once per day thereafter. In transected rats, post-operative antibiotics were continued until the re-emergence of spontaneous micturition reflexes.\n\nUrine output and EUS EMG recording\nOn recording days, rats were housed in a metabolic cage (Tecniplast) during 24-h sessions for recording EUS EMG and accumulated urine weight as described in LaPallo and colleagues.\n22\nBriefly, a flexible armored cable attached to the pedestal mounted on the rat's skull connected the implanted wires to recording equipment via a commutator, which permitted the rat to move freely about its cage during the recording session. Urine and feces fell through the cage grid floor onto funnels that separated and diverted the urine into a cup mounted on a force transducer (FT03; Grass Technologies) that weighed the accumulating urine. Force oscillations were dampened with a mineral oil-filled dashpot. A small amount of mineral oil added to the collection cup prevented evaporation of the accumulating urine. Metabolic cage efficiency evaluated by applying saline aliquots of various amounts revealed that an average of 97% of the applied fluid was recovered below the cage. Void size was not adjusted for this small loss because the percent lost with each fluid application varied with location of the applied fluid.\nEMG and force signals were routed to recording apparatus in an adjacent room. EMG data were band-pass filtered (10\u2013300\u2009Hz), digitized at 600\u2009Hz, full-wave rectified digitally, down-sampled to 200\u2009Hz by averaging sequences of three adjacent points, and stored. Urine weight recordings were low-pass filtered (12\u2009Hz) to further remove oscillations from the signal. At the end of each experiment, rats were euthanized and the vertebral column with spinal cord surrounding the lesion site were stored in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Bladders were removed, cleaned, blotted dry, and weighed in six of seven rats in each of the two transection groups.\n\nData analysis\nUrine weight and EUS EMG data were analyzed using custom software (Igor Pro, Wavemetrics). Power spectra of EMG signals were calculated using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. Time-frequency spectrograms were obtained by repeating FFTs every 0.1\u2009sec on overlapping 1-sec epochs of Hanning-windowed EMG data, and were corrected for temporal overlap of these repeated spectral calculations and for power loss due to windowing.\nAlthough data were collected continuously in each 24-h session, analysis focused on voiding epochs. Voids were detected as a urine weight increase of at least 0.04\u2009g. Void duration was calculated as the time during which urine flowed in each void, ignoring intra-void pauses in flow (see LaPallo and colleagues\n22\nfor details of addressing voids containing late-falling drops). Determination of EUS EMG properties during voiding was based on the onset and offset of urine accumulation (as determined above) and the pattern of EUS EMG. Because EUS bursting was not consistently evident during voiding, the transition from guarding to voiding (defined as EUS EMG onset) was calculated using an empirical method based on spectral analysis of EMG activity during voids that was validated using voids with visually identified EUS bursting.\n22\nVoiding EUS EMG offset was defined as the EUS EMG onset time plus void duration.\nThe following void-associated EMG properties were calculated between void EMG onset and void EMG offset: 1) average EMG amplitude; bursting power (P\nburst\n), defined as the average signal power in the EUS bursting-frequency range expressed as a percentage of the total average power; 2) low-frequency bursting power (P3-5), defined as the average EUS EMG power in the 3- to 5-Hz range expressed as a percentage of the total average power; 3) high-frequency bursting power (P8-12), defined as the average EUS EMG power in the 8- to 12-Hz range expressed as a percentage of the total average power; 4) bursting time, defined as the cumulative time during which the bursting power was above a threshold value defined as the mean P\nburst\nin amplitude-matched non-voiding epochs +2\u2009\u00d7\u2009standard deviations (SD) of amplitude-matched 2-sec non-void epochs); and 5) bursting productivity, defined as the ratio of the void size (normalized to 200\u2009g body weight) to bursting time. The EUS bursting frequency range used to calculate P\nburst\nwas defined using five to 10 (median of eight) 1-Hz wide consecutive frequency bins. The range used was always the same within each animal, but varied between animals (see \u201cIntra-void EUS EMG\u201d in the\nResults\nsection). Values of P\nburst\nwere first divided by the number of 1-Hz wide frequency bins that comprised the bursting range, and then normalized to a 7-Hz wide frequency range to enable comparisons with our previous study, in which the bursting frequency ranges used were 4\u201310\u2009Hz or 3\u20139\u2009Hz.\n22\nThe inter-burst timing of EUS EMG activity was analyzed in a subset of voids (\nn\n=\u2009308 from the 14 animals) that showed clearly alternating bursts of EMG activity with minimal tonic activity between the active phases by calculating bursting silent period (defined as the time during a single bursting cycle in which the EUS EMG was not active); bursting active period (defined as the time during a single bursting cycle in which the EUS EMG was active); and bursting period (defined as the duration of a single bursting cycle, i.e., active period + silent period).\nRepetitive non-voiding contractions (NVCs) of the bladder are common after SCI, and are associated with co-contraction of the EUS and impaired urinary output.\n12\nAlthough bladder pressure was not measured in the present study, a similar pattern of EUS activations were observed prior to many voids in rats with spinal cord lesions (see\nRepetitive non-voiding contraction\nin Results), but not in rats with intact spinal cords. Thus, these EUS contractions were considered to reflect reflex activity in response to SCI-induced bladder NVCs and thus are identified here as repetitive non-voiding EUS contractions (rNVECs; this acronym's parallel structure to NVC emphasizes that it is EUS activity that is distinct from, but still serves as a marker for NVCs of the bladder). Based on spectral analysis of inter-void EUS EMG activity, rNVECs are defined as oscillations in EUS EMG occurring at one to eight cycles per minute that exceed average EMG power from the same rat under intact conditions in the one to eight cycles per minute range by 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009SD. rNVECs were characterized by calculating: rNVEC amplitude, defined as the peak amplitude of individual rNVEC contractions; rNVEC duration, defined as the width of individual rNVEC contractions at one-half peak amplitude; total rNVEC duration, defined as the sum of time of all rNVEC epochs during the inter-void interval; and inter-rNVEC interval, defined as the time between peaks of successive contractions.\n\nStatistical analysis\nEvaluations of voiding and EUS properties before and after spinal transection were performed using analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with repeated measures (equivalent to paired\nt\n-test for comparisons made between intact and transected animals, in which the latter group was formed by pooling data from the 3rd and 4th week post-transection). Statistical significance of relationships between void size and other properties was determined by simple or multiple regression analysis. In preparation for regression analysis of the relationship between urine weight per void and other urodynamic and EUS EMG-related factors, data for each parameter were normalized by\nz\n-transformation for each individual animal by subtracting the mean value and then dividing by its standard deviation."

    "Methods": "Control dogs\nClinically normal dogs were prospectively recruited to establish normal values for evoked potentials and H-reflex testing in our laboratory. Informed consent was obtained and examinations were conducted in accord with the North Carolina State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol #15-150-O). All dogs had to have a normal neurological examination and no history of neurological disease. Laboratory standards were already established for other electrophysiological parameters.\n\nCase selection\nDogs were recruited prospectively from the patient pool of the Canine Spinal Cord Injury Program at the North Carolina State University (NCSU) College of Veterinary Medicine (Raleigh, NC). All dogs had chronic motor deficits ranging from paraplegia to ambulation with weakness and ataxia with absent or severely reduced hindlimb and tail pain perception (with or without urinary and fecal incontinence). In all dogs, signs were attributed to an acute TL-SCI (third thoracic to third lumbar spinal cord segments) based on neurological exam findings causing paralysis with loss of pain perception suffered a minimum of 3 months previously. Advanced imaging (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) or definitive diagnosis were not required for inclusion. Exclusion criteria included muscle contractures or concurrent neuromuscular conditions that alter local reflexes or concurrent systemic conditions that would preclude safe sedation. Data collection on each dog included signalment, concomitant medications, diagnosis, lesion location, duration of injury, and past treatment of the SCI. Past therapy, including participation in interventional clinical trials, were noted, but not utilized, as exclusion criteria for the purposes of this project. Informed consent was obtained for all animals and examinations were conducted in accord with the NCSU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol #15-004-01).\n\nGeneral neurological and gait evaluation\nAll cases underwent a neurological examination, including standard evaluation of gait, proprioception, spinal reflexes, and pain perception (\nTable 1\n). Pain perception was tested in standard fashion by squeezing vigorously (using the handle of bandage scissors or blunt-tipped forceps) over the phalanges of the hindlimbs and the base of the tail. Perception was defined as a conscious, behavioral response to the noxious stimulus such as turning around, vocalizing, or trying to bite. Medial and lateral digits were tested in all dogs. More extensive gait analysis was performed by one of the investigators (M.J.L.) assisted by a veterinary technician and consisted of walking each dog on a nonslip surface for approximately 3\u20135\u2009min and on a treadmill for approximately 3\u2009min with the speed adjusted to a comfortable walking pace for each individual (range, 0.6\u20131.0\u2009mph). Dogs were allowed to acclimate to the hospital environment with these two handlers for 1\u20132\u2009h preceding gait analysis. All examinations were videotaped. Gait was categorized as ambulatory (able to take at least 10 consecutive weight bearing steps unassisted) or not and quantified using an ordinal gait scale (open field score [OFS] ranging from 0 to 12).\n22\n,\n23\nOFS greater than 4 corresponds to independent walking. Treadmill footage was scored using previously described measures of pelvic limb stepping (stepping score; SS) and coordination (regularity index; RI).\n24\n,\n25\nGait scores (OFS, SS, and RI) generated without sling support only were utilized for the purposes of this project.\nTable\n1.\nNeurological Examination\nExam parameter\nAssessment\nGait\nAmbulatory, nonambulatory paraparetic, paraplegic\nProprioceptive placing, hopping\nAbsent (0), delayed (1), normal (2)\nPatellar, withdrawal reflex\nAbsent (0), decreased (1), normal (2), increased (3), clonus (4)\nHindlimb muscle tone\nDecreased/flaccid, normal Increased\nCutaneous trunci reflex\nVertebral level of caudal border recorded\nHindlimb, tail nociception\nPresent or absent\nUrination\nVoluntary or involuntary\nOpen in a separate window\n\nElectrodiagnostic evaluation\nElectrodiagnostic testing included evaluation of long tracts with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and recording of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and cortical somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) as well as evaluation of local reflex circuitry by H-reflex, F-waves, and M-waves. All procedures were performed by one of the investigators (M.J.L.) assisted by a veterinary technician. All cases were sedated with 1\u20134\u2009\u03bcg/kg of intravenous (i.v.) dexmedetomidine (Dexdomitor; Orion Pharma, Espoo, Finland) and 0.1\u20130.2\u2009mg/kg of i.v. butorphanol (Torbugesic; Zoetis, Kalamazoo, MI). The sedation protocol was adjusted, as needed, to ensure that dogs lay calmly. Testing was performed in lateral recumbency and was not initiated until dogs were relaxed and no longer reactive to mild tactile or auditory stimuli. The room was darkened and kept quiet throughout the duration of testing to facilitate continued relaxation through the testing period. Control dogs were sedated with the same protocol for TMS and H-reflex recordings. They were then anesthetized for SSEP recordings, which was required to ensure tolerance of the procedure in neurologically normal dogs (with normal sensation). The anesthetic protocol consisted of propofol induction (Propoflo 10\u2009mg/mL; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) and inhaled isoflurane for maintenance (VET ONE Fluriso; MWI, Boise, ID).\nTMS was performed using a Magstim 200\n2\nmagnetic stimulator (Version 1.9; The Magstim Company Limited, Spring Gardens, UK) using a 50-mm double coil stimulator with a peak magnetic field strength of 2.5 Tesla. The center of the coil was positioned over the frontal bone of the skull on midline (at the vertex) in contact with the scalp and the current flow within each coil run in an antiparallel direction. Following a single discharge of the stimulator, MEPs were recorded from the left extensor carpi radialis muscle in the thoracic limb as a positive control and the left cranial tibial muscle in the pelvic limb by active, reference, and ground needle electrodes placed percutaneously in standard fashion and connected to an electromyograph (Nicolet VikingQuest; Natus Neurology Incorporated, Middleton, WI).\n26\nStimulation was repeated four times at supramaximal stimulus (90% stimulus intensity, 1-ms pulse duration, 100-\u03bcs rise time, and 2- to 10-Hz low-/high-frequency filters) for each limb. Presence (yes/no) and minimum latency of MEPs were recorded. Amplitude was not measured because of variability and the polyphasic nature of waveforms. MEPs were defined as present if detectable waveforms were identified in at least two of four trials at supramaximal intensity at a sensitivity of 200\u2009\u03bcV/division or less and with a latency of 100\u2009msec or less. Minimum latency was defined as the time interval measured in milliseconds from the stimulus onset to the first deflection from baseline of the resultant waveform. Path length was measured from stimulus site over the cortex following the anatomic neuronal pathway to the active electrode in the extensor carpi radialis or cranial tibial muscle and used to calculate conduction velocity.\nSSEPs were recorded after electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve for the pelvic limb and ulnar nerve for the thoracic limb (as a positive control) with an electromyograph (Nicolet VikingQuest; Natus Neurology Incorporated). Active and reference stimulating needle electrodes were placed percutaneously adjacent to the tibial nerve just proximal to the tarsus and adjacent to the ulnar nerve near the carpus. Active recording needles were placed between the fifth and sixth lumbar vertebrae (L5\u2013L6) at the level of the lamina (for recording cord dorsum potential following tibial nerve stimulation) and under the scalp overlying the contralateral somatosensory cortex (for recording of cortical potentials) with reference electrodes placed subcutaneously approximately 2\u2009cm lateral to the L5\u2013L6 recording electrode and just below the opening of the contralateral external ear canal, respectively.\n27\n,\n28\nA ground electrode was placed subcutaneously between stimulating and recording needles. Stimulation was delivered at a frequency of 3.1\u2009Hz, duration of 0.2\u2009ms, and a stimulus intensity range from 1.2\u201325.0\u2009mA with at least 200 (range, 200\u2013400) averaged stimulations for the pelvic limb. The ulnar nerve was stimulated at the minimum intensity necessary to elicit a discernible evoked potential (range, 1.0\u201316.0\u2009mA) in order to ensure patient tolerance. The presence (yes/no) and minimum latency of SSEPs and cord dorsum potentials were recorded. Minimum latency was defined as the time interval measured in milliseconds from the stimulus onset to the first deflection from baseline of the resultant waveform. Path length was measured from the recording site over the cortex following the anatomic neuronal pathway to the site of stimulation of the distal ulnar or tibial nerve. The path length from L5\u2013L6 to the stimulation site for the tibial nerve was also recorded.\nM-waves were then generated for sciatic/tibial nerve stimulating at the sciatic notch and just proximal to the tarsus and recording from the plantar interosseous muscles according to standard protocol.\n29\n,\n30\nThe stimulus had a duration of 0.1\u2009ms and intensity was increased to supramaximal, which was defined as the intensity resulting in no further increase in wave amplitude. The maximum M-wave amplitude was measured from the largest negative to the largest positive peak and the motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) calculated with greater than 60 meters per second (m/s) considered normal.\n29\nCathode and anode of the stimulating electrodes located adjacent to the distal tibial nerve were reversed for generating F-waves with active, reference, and ground electrode placement unchanged. The tibial nerve was stimulated repetitively 16 times at a frequency of 2\u2009Hz, duration of 0.1\u2009ms, and supramaximal stimulus intensity producing M-waves followed by F-waves. The minimum latency of the F-waves, F-wave persistence (percentage of F-waves present in 10 stimulations), and the F-ratio [(latency F \u2013 latency M\u2009\u2212\u20091)/ 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009latency M] were recorded and compared to reference values.\n31\n,\n32\nTo record H-reflex from the plantar interosseous muscles, the distal tibial nerve was stimulated (duration, 1\u2009ms; frequency, 0.2\u2009Hz or less) starting at low intensity (machine minimum, 0.1\u2009mA) and increasing gradually according to previously reported methods in dogs.\n33\n,\n34\nThe H-reflex threshold (stimulus intensity at which H-reflex first appeared) and minimum H-reflex latency were recorded. The maximum H-reflex amplitude and maximum M-wave amplitude (defined as the largest negative to the largest positive peak for each waveform) were each recorded during H-reflex testing and used to calculate the H:M ratio (maximum H amplitude/maximum M amplitude). \u201cAfter discharges,\u201d defined as electrical activity that persisted (sustained activity) or appeared randomly (episodic activity) after the onset of H-reflex and F-waves, were also noted. Sustained after discharge activity was classified into short duration (<10\u2009ms for H-reflex, <20\u2009ms for F-waves) versus long duration (>/\u2009=\u200910\u2009ms for H-reflex, >/\u2009=\u200920\u2009ms for F-waves). Episodic activity was categorized as present or absent for both F-wave and H-reflex recordings. Limb length, measured from the trochanteric notch to the lateral digit, was also recorded.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll analyses were performed using Jmp 12 Pro (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Presence or absence of MEPs, SSEPs, F-waves, H-reflex, after discharges, and ability to ambulate were each recorded and analyzed as categorical data. Summary statistics for continuous data (gait scores, MEP/SSEP latency, F-wave, and H-reflex variables) are reported as mean and standard deviation (SD) if normally distributed or median and range if not using the Wilk-Shapiro test for normality. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare means for MEP latency and H-reflex variables between cases with SCI and the cohort of control dogs. Associations between presence of MEPs or SSEPs and ambulation status were established by constructing contingency tables and using Fisher's exact test. Associations between presence of MEPs or SSEPs and gait scores were determined using an ANOVA. Associations between F-wave variables or H-reflex variables and gait scores were determined by linear regression.\np\n<\u20090.05 significant with adjusted\np\nvalues calculated for multiple comparisons using Holm's correction calculator."
