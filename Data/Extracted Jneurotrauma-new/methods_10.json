    "Methods": "We determined the prevalence and risk factors for VAP in children with moderate-to-severe TBI (post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score of <13). We retrospectively reviewed all pediatric patients admitted at a level one pediatric trauma center between January 2009 and January 2012 with moderate or severe TBI who received mechanical ventilation for 2 days or more after injury. Administrative data, including the local trauma database, were used to identify children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) after head injury. The institutional review board at the University of Utah and privacy board for Primary Children's Hospital reviewed this study and waived the need for informed consent.\n\nPrimary Children's Hospital is an American College of Surgeons\u2013verified level I trauma center caring for injured children in a five-state catchment area. Approximately 800 trauma patients are admitted to the inpatient service, with 80 admitted to the PICU annually. All patients admitted to the PICU with severe TBI receive multi-disciplinary care, including: pediatric trauma surgery, neurosurgery, critical care, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and palliative care when indicated.\n\nCriteria for VAP in children remain controversial.18We defined VAP as a pulmonary process developing on or after hospital Day 2 with clinical suspicion of pneumonia based on fever, elevated or depressed white count, increased secretions, decreased pulmonary compliance or oxygenation, and required a microbiologic specimen deemed positive by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria. Microbiologic specimens were collected at the discretion of the medical team and were not obtained in patients without signs or symptoms of pneumonia. Criteria enumerated by the CDC to define a positive specimen are purulent sputum and \u2265103colony-forming unit/high powered field (CFU/hpf) for protected bronchial brush specimens (PBBS) and >104CFU/hpf for either tracheal aspirate (TA) or bronchiolalveolar lavage (BAL) with commensal organisms excluded. Microbiologic specimens were considered purulent if there were \u226525 neutrophils and \u226410 epithelial cells per low power field. Patients were considered no longer at risk of VAP 2 days after extubation, at the time of tracheostomy placement or death, whichever came first. Patients who did not have a specimen collected or who did not have a positive microbiologic specimen were categorized as not having VAP. Chest radiographic information was collected but not utilized as findings in this trauma population were very non-specific and microbiologic (largely PBBS) specimens, which are more specific, were required for diagnosis.8,24Patients who died or developed pneumonia prior to hospital Day 2 were excluded from analysis.\n\nDemographic and injury data were collected, including age, race, and mechanism of injury. Mechanism of injury was divided into non-accidental trauma, blunt trauma involving motorized vehicles and blunt trauma not involving motorized vehicles. Emergency medical transport team notes or emergency department records were used to identify the location of intubation. Rapid sequence intubation is part of local emergency medical service and emergency department protocols but its use was not collected as documentation was not consistent. Injury severity was evaluated using post-resuscitation GCS, chest Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score, Injury Severity Score (ISS), and Rotterdam computed tomography (CT) scores which were independently assigned by a neurosurgeon blinded to patient outcome.19,20\n\nThe need for and type of intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring device was determined based on clinical need by the treating neurosurgeon. ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) were abstracted from the daily nurse charting. We collected data regarding administration of antibiotics in the first 2 days of hospitalization prior to the patients being at risk of VAP. We evaluated intensive care therapies used to monitor and treat intracranial hypertension, such as: administration of continuous infusions of narcotics, sedatives, barbiturates, neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA), hypertonic saline, or vasopressors, as well as boluses of osmolar agents, such as mannitol.\n\nWe also evaluated receipt of enteral feeds or total parenteral nutrition (TPN), which also have been reported as risk factors for VAP.7,16Source of nutrition was recorded as none, TPN, gastric or transpyloric feeds. Histamine-2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors were routinely given to patients not being fed via the stomach for prophylaxis of stress gastric ulcers. Outcomes are reported as discharge to home with no long-term care, discharge to long-term care on a rehabilitation service, skilled nursing facility or home health care, or death prior to discharge. Care guidelines for mitigating and treating intracranial hypertension that mirror recommendations from the Brain Trauma Foundation (Supplementary Fig. 1; see online supplementary material atwww.liebertpub.com) were used by the clinical teams.21The care guidelines include temperature regulation to maintain euthermia (36\u201338\u00b0C), ICP goal <20\u2009mm Hg when monitored, normocapnia (partial pressure of carbon dioxide [PaCO2], 35\u201340\u2009mm Hg), and serum sodium concentration >140\u2009mEq/L. Once these are optimized, subsequent persistent intracranial hypertension is treated serially with sedation/analgesia, administration of NMBA (typically vecuronium 0.1\u2009mg/kg/h), osmolar therapy with mannitol or 3% saline, an external ventricular drain or lumbar drain if feasible, barbiturate infusion with a goal of burst suppression on electroencephalography (EEG), and mild hyperventilation (PaCO2, 30\u201335\u2009mm Hg).\n\nPatients with and without VAP were compared using the Mann-WhitneyUtest for continuous and categorical variables. Demographic and static risk factors were compared by group and reported as relative risk ratios RR with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) or as median values and corresponding interquartile range (IQR). Because risk of VAP increases with duration of mechanical ventilation and exposure to intensive care therapies, we used a Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for duration of mechanical ventilation and sought to identify potentially modifiable ICU risk factors for VAP. Patients were censored once they developed VAP, had a tracheostomy tube placed, were extubated, or died. The hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI are reported.\n\nCovariate selection for the Cox model was performed using step-wise forward and backward variable selection procedures.22To identify ICU therapies that were independently associated with an increased hazard of VAP, apvalue of <0.20 was required for inclusion in the model during the forward selection phase. In the backward selection phase, ICU therapies were excluded from the multivariable model if they had apvalue \u22650.05.\n\nAdditionally, time-dependent covariates were tested in the Cox proportional hazards models. These models were constructed to determine whether the effects of ICU therapies on the risk of VAP varied based on the time at which they were initiated (e.g., the 2nd versus the 10th hospital day), compared with any exposure to the ICU therapy throughout the entire duration of mechanical ventilation. These Cox proportional hazards models were developed using the survival package in R 3.0.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).23Additional statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 22.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY)."

    "Methods": "Participants\nTBI participants were recruited from four pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) located in Level 1 trauma centers in Los Angeles County. In these institutions, patients with msTBI are routinely admitted to the PICU. A study representative discussed the goals of the study with the parents of patients, gave them an institutional review board-approved brochure about the study, and obtained permission for the investigators to contact them after discharge from the medical center. Thirty-five percent of patients whose parents agreed to be contacted while the child was in the PICU participated in this study. Of 124 families contacted at the PICUs, 27 were lost to contact (kept canceling/rescheduling), 21 did not qualify because they did not meet criteria (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score\n19\n>12, English skills not sufficient, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], learning disability, braces, etc.), 26 were not interested, 48 are participating, and 2 are interested, pending scheduling. Healthy controls, matched for age, sex, and educational level, were recruited from the community through flyers, magazines, and school postings. Several participants were only scanned in the chronic phase, whereas a few additional participants scanned in the post-acute phase (not included in the numbers above) were scanned outside our established 1\u20136 month time window, so were not included in this analysis. For those participants who completed the longitudinal assessment, the chronic assessment was completed approximately 12 months after the post-acute assessment. Demographics of the participants included in cross-sectional analyses of the post-acute and chronic phases are presented in\nTable 1\n. The injury mechanisms for our TBI group were as follows, out of 36 total injured participants: 12 motor vehicle accident (MVA) struck as a pedestrian, 6 MVA-passenger, 7 skateboard, 3 scooter, 2 bike, 1 blunt head trauma from sports, 1 assault, 1 skiing, 1 fall from ladder, 1 uncategorized blunt head trauma, and 1 uncategorized skull fracture. The demographic information from our sample is consistent with the existing epidemiological information on moderate-severe pediatric/adolescent TBI, both in the male to female ratio and in the types of mechanisms of injury.\n20\nIn our post-acute sample, the average GCS score (initial GCS upon hospital admission) was 8.75 (SD\u2009=\u20093.7), 18% of participants had neurosurgery, and 18% had evidence of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) on computed tomography (CT). In our chronic sample, the average GCS score (initial GCS upon hospital admission) was 9.33 (SD\u2009=\u20093.8), 38% participants had neurosurgery, and 19% had evidence of increased ICP on CT.\nTable\n1.\nDemographic Information\nPost-acute\nChronic\nTBI\nControl\nTBI\nControl\nN\n36\n35\n18\n22\nAge\n14.1 (2.7)\n14.8 (2.8)\n15.8 (2.6)\n16.2 (3.2)\nM/F\n26/10\n23/12\n13/5\n15/7\nICV (cm\n3\n)\n1940 (63)\n1945 (68)\n1957 (82)\n1925 (62)\nOpen in a separate window\nDemographic information on the participants.

We list the number of TBI and control participants in each phase, the male/female ratio, the average age of these groups (and standard deviation), and the ICV (intracranial volume, in cm\n3\n).\nTBI, traumatic brain injury.\nIn this study, we focus on cross-sectional analyses. Longitudinal analyses will be a focus of future studies as children continue to return for their follow-up visits. Thirty-three of the participants in the chronic phase completed the post-acute assessment prior. Seven of the chronic participants were not enrolled in time for a post-acute assessment, or did not complete magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at time 1. The majority of participants in the post-acute phase have returned or will return for their time 2 follow-up, but several participants have not continued in the study, as detailed in our earlier article.\n21\nThe most frequent reasons for leaving the study were that the participants no longer met criteria or moved out of the area; there was no systematic bias introduced through these non-returns.\nInclusion criteria\n1) non-penetrating msTBI (intake or post-resuscitation GCS score between 3 and 12); 2) 8\u201319 years of age; 3) right-handed; 4) normal visual acuity or vision corrected with contact lenses/eyeglasses; and 5) English skills sufficient to understand instructions and be familiar with common words (the neuropsychological tests used in this study presume competence in English).\nExclusion criteria\n1) history of neurological illness, such as prior msTBI, brain tumor, or severe seizures; 2) motor deficits that prevent the subject from being examined in an MRI scanner (e.g., spasms); 3) history of psychosis, ADHD, Tourette's syndrome, learning disability, mental retardation, autism, or substance abuse. These conditions were identified by parental report and are associated with cognitive impairments that might overlap with those caused by TBI. Participants were excluded if they had metal implants that prevented them from safely undergoing an MRI scan.\n\nScan acquisition\nParticipants were scanned on 3T Siemens Trio MRI scanners (Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Germany) with magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo imaging (MPRAGE). The T1-weighted images were acquired with the following acquisition parameters: GRAPPA mode; acceleration factor phase encoding (PE)\u2009=\u20092; repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE)/T1\u2009=\u20091900/3.26/900\u2009msec; field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u2009250\u2009\u00d7\u2009250\u2009mm; an axial plane acquisition with isotropic voxel size\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm, flip angle\u2009=\u20099 degrees.\n\nScan comparison\nPartway through the study, scanning moved from the UCLA Brain Mapping Center (BMC) to the Staglin IMHRO Center for Cognitive Neuroscience (Staglin). Both scanners were 3T Siemens Trio scanners, and the protocol was maintained. In the post-acute phase, 29 participants were scanned at BMC and 42 at Staglin. In the chronic phase, 9 participants were scanned at BMC and 31 at Staglin. To determine that this scanner change did not introduce bias into our data, we scanned 6 healthy adult volunteers at both the BMC and Staglin centers, 1.5 months apart. We then assessed possible scanner effects based on the T1-weighted image pairs. Extensive details of this process can be found in our prior article.\n21\nFor the T1-weighted images, scan comparisons revealed no detectable pattern in the difference between the intensity correction fields above noise, except in the cerebellum, where there appeared to be scanner-induced differences in image intensity even after N3 (intensity non-uniformity) correction (\nhttp://www.itksnap.org\n). For this reason, the cerebellum was masked out of the analyses presented in this article.\n\nCognitive measures\nParticipants completed a battery of cognitive tests at both time 1 and time 2. To capture overall ability, a performance index was generated based on the linear combination of the following age-based standardized or scaled measures: 1) Processing Speed Index from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th ed. (WISC-IV)/Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 3rd ed. (WAIS-III)\n22\n; 2) Working Memory Index from the WISC-IV/WAIS-III\n22\n; 3) Trials 1\u20135 from the California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version, 2nd ed. (CVLT-C/II)\n23\n; and 4) Trails 4 from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS).\n24\nThese measures assess cognitive domains most sensitive to the effects of TBI.\n25\nThe WISC and WAIS-based Processing Speed Index comprised the Coding and Symbol Search subtests. For the Working Memory Index, the Digit Span and the Letter-Number Sequencing subtests were included. The CVLT (child or adult version) Trials 1\u20135 score assesses verbal learning and short-term memory. Condition 4 of the Trail Making Test was a measure of switching attention. A series of principal components analyses confirmed these measures share sufficient common variance in both children with TBI and healthy controls.\n\nTensor-based morphometry\nEach subject's T1-weighted anatomical data was N3-corrected using c3d (\nhttp://www.itksnap.org\n) to correct for intensity inhomogeneities. Volumes were then automatically skull-stripped using Brainsuite (\nhttp://brainsuite.org\n) and these masks were manually edited by a trained neuroanatomical expert (ELD and JVR). We used a study-specific registration template, motivated by previous studies finding that this leads to better registration results. We chose a healthy control male, aged 14.2 years (the average for our sample at time 1) with a visually normal T1-weighted scan to initialize the linear registration. This examplar subject was registered to the international consortium for brain mapping (ICBM) template using the fsl tool\nflirt\n(\nhttp://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk\n), using 7 degrees of freedom (DOF) registration, with trilinear interpolation, and using mutual information as the similarity function for alignment. Following this, each subject's masked, non-uniformity (NU)-corrected T1-weighted image was registered to the subject-template using iterative 6, 7, and 9 DOF registration, with concatenated transformation files so that only one resampling step was run. This protocol was modified for this dataset from the original protocol.\n26\n,\n27\nAt this point, we created a minimal deformation template (MDT) from the healthy controls (19 female/23 male). The MDT is the template that deviates least from the anatomy of the subjects, with respect to a mathematically defined metric of difference, and, in some circumstances, using a MDT can improve statistical power.\n28\nThe MDT serves as an unbiased registration target for non-linear registrations.\nNext, each subject's aligned T1s were non-linearly aligned to the MDT template, using an inverse consistent elastic-model registration algorithm (32 fast fourier transform [FFT]\u2009\u00d7\u2009300 iterations).\n29\nThe inter-subject displacement vector field, obtained from this step, was then applied to transform the Jacobian map of each subject to the brain coordinates defined by the MDT. Spatial normalizations among different brains enable regional comparisons and intergroup statistical analyses.\n\nGroup comparison\nWe ran voxel-wise linear regression testing for group differences, including age, sex, scanner, and intracranial volume (ICV) as covariates. The 9 DOF linear registration that is part of our processing protocol accounts for differences in brain scaling, thus removing much of the effect of ICV, but we still included it as a covariate. This was run separately for the post-acute and chronic data. Results were corrected for multiple comparisons using searchlight FDR\n30\nacross the brain (\nq\n<\u20090.05). We tested the voxel-wise Jacobian maps for associations with our summary cognitive score with linear regression, covarying for age, sex, scanner, and ICV, both across all subjects (for which we also covaried for group) and within TBI only. We also tested the Jacobian maps for associations with GCS score upon hospital admission."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll experiments were performed using adult female Wistar rats (Charles River, Quebec, Canada,\nn\n=\u200980) weighing 250\u2013280\u2009g. All procedures involving animals were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University Health Network, in accordance with the policies established in the Guide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals made by the Canadian Council on Animal Care. For injured rats, bladders were expressed three times daily until spontaneous voiding returned. Food and water were provided\nad libitum\n. Post-operative buprenorphine (0.03\u2009mg/kg, Temgesic) was given subcutaneously before the animals awakened and then every 12\u2009h for 7 days. Rats were given Clavamox (amoxicillin trihydrate/clavulanate potassium) in their drinking water for 7 days post-injury to prevent urinary tract infection.\nThe following humane end points were determined\na priori\nfor exclusion and/or euthanasia: weight loss exceeding 20% pre-operative weight, not eating or drinking for more than 24\u2009h, anorexia, and chronic urinary tract infection or hematuria that did not respond to antibiotics.

We determined that the iliac crests, which can be located by palpation through the intact skin, are a useful landmark to locate the adjacent L6 vertebra and spinous process, which lie immediately between the iliac crests. Then, the last rib is palpated and its medial most aspect is at the junction with the T13 vertebra. Counting the spinous processes sequentially rostrally from L6 to T13 was then used to confirm the location of the T13 vertebra (\nFig. 1\u20132\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nOperative anatomy of the lumbar injury model.\nA\u2013C\nare computed tomography (CT) images post-laminectomy.\nD\u2013F\nare operative photographs and show vertebral levels in white, spinal cord segments in red, and spinal roots in black. CT imaging was used to verify consistent localization of the T11 and T12 vertebral levels. (A) is an AP view, while (B) and (C, higher magnification) show a lateral view. The last free floating ribs (13th rib) articulate with the last thoracic (T13) vertebra and are a useful anatomical landmark. Laminectomy is performed directly rostral to T13 to remove the T12 and T11 laminae, revealing the T13, L1, and L2 spinal cord segments (\nFig. 1\n). (C) shows that the spinous processes and laminae of T11 and T12 have been removed. (D) After midline incision and clearance of connective tissue, the T9-T13 vertebrae are exposed. A useful landmark is the \u201ctriangle\u201d of spinous process orientation of T9, T10, and T11: T9 is directed caudally; T10 is directed dorsally; and T11 is directed rostrally. (E) After removal of T11 and T12 laminae, three spinal cord segments are exposed (T13, L1, and L2). The clip is applied between T11 and T12 vertebrae and is indicated with a dotted red line in E and F. (F) A durotomy was performed to show that the injury at L1-L2 includes the T12 and T13 roots, which have been dissected to show their location (L1 cannot be seen in the photograph). Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nUnder aseptic conditions, the spinal cord was exposed through a midline skin incision, and the muscles retracted to expose the spinous processes and laminae of the T9, T10, T11, and T12 vertebrae. The specific relative angulation of the spinous processes of the T9, T10, and T11 vertebrae was used as an important intraoperative landmark: T9 points caudally, T10 points directly dorsal, and T11 points rostrally. This produces a reliable \u201ctriangle\u201d orientation that can be readily seen if the animal is positioned flat on the operating table.\nAfter the T11 and T12 vertebrae had been identified, a laminectomy was performed at T11 and T12 with Friedman-Pearson rongeurs (\nFig. 1\u20132\n). The clip was then held open with a clip applicator, with the lower blade of the clip passed extradurally completely around the spinal cord and nerve roots at the junction between the T11 and T12 vertebrae, corresponding to the L1-L2 spinal cord segmental level. The clip was then rapidly released from the applicator to produce a bilateral impact force and sustained dorsal-ventral compression (\nFig. 1\u20132\n).\nThe compression of the spinal cord was maintained for 60\u2009sec before removal of the clip. The muscles were then sutured using 3\u20130 polyglactin sutures, and the skin was closed with Michel clips. Before use, the force of the clip was measured with a force calibrator that measures the peak closing force of the clip to ensure reproducibility.\n\nOpen-field locomotor scale\nLocomotor function was evaluated using the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale weekly for 6 weeks.\n18\nRats were video recorded for 4\u2009min to assess the animal's motor function including joint movements, coordination, paw placement, and toe clearance. A score of 0 indicates no hindlimb movement, whereas a score of 21 indicates unimpaired locomotion as observed in normal uninjured rats.\nTwo evaluators blinded to groups performed the rating of the BBB scores. Five groups of rats were used in this study: one group underwent laminectomy-only sham operation (\nn\n=\u200910); four groups underwent injury with clip closing forces of 20\u2009g, 26\u2009g, 35\u2009g and 56\u2009g (\nn\n=\u200922, 18, 16, 14 respectively), with mortality and exclusion as reported (\nTable 1\n). Clips of varying closing force were used to determine the sensitivity of the lumbar spinal cord to impact-compression injury, and the duration of compression was 1\u2009min in all groups.\n\nSensory testing\nAt-level mechanical allodynia: von Frey filaments (VFF)\nCutaneous sensitivity to normally innocuous mechanical stimulation was evaluated weekly using VFF. We compared animals in the 20\u2009g injury group versus the sham control group. A series of VFFs with stiffness of 1.4\u2009g, 2.0\u2009g, and 4.0\u2009g were applied to T13, L1, and L2 dermatomes as described by Takahashi and colleagues\n19\nin 2003 to determine at-level mechanical allodynia. Probing was performed when the animals were calm and not moving. A positive response was recorded when the filament bends, and the animal responded with an aversive action, including vocalizing, flinching, licking, turning away, or overt behavioral cue corresponding to discomfort. A total of 10 applications of each VFF were scored as positive or negative to obtain a total response percentage.\nThermal hyperalgesia: tail-flick\nTo measure thermal nociceptive response, we assessed 20\u2009g and sham groups bi-weekly for 6 weeks. Animals were wrapped in a soft, dark material to calm and distract them. The dorsal surface of the tail between 4 and 6\u2009cm from the tip was exposed to a beam of light calibrated to 50\u00b0C generated from an automated machine (IITC Life Science, Woodland Hills, CA). The timer was stopped when the animal flicked its tail away from the beam of light, indicating an aversive response. Latency was measured at 5-min intervals over three consecutive trials, with mean latency reported.\n\nHistology\nAnimals were deeply anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital before sacrifice. For lesion analysis, animals were perfused with 500\u2009mL of 10% neutral buffered formalin after intravascular injection of 1\u2009mL heparin (1000 IU/mL), and the spinal column was dissected. A 1.5\u2009cm segment of the spinal cord centered on the injury site was excised and post-fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin at room temperature. Spinal cords from each of the four injury groups were randomly selected (sham,\nn\n=\u20097; 20\u2009g,\nn\n=\u200910; 26\u2009g,\nn\n=\u20097; 35\u2009g,\nn\n=\u20096, and; 56\u2009g,\nn\n=\u20095), and 8\u2009\u03bcm serial cross-sections were made in a cryostat. The sections were stained with Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) and counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to visualize white and gray matter.\nImage analysis was performed with a Nikon TE300 inverted bright field microscope, and images of LFB/H&E stained sections were captured with an Optronic CCD camera connected to the microscope. To assess the impact of a clip compression injury at the L1-L2 spinal cord segments, transverse sections for each animal were systematically sampled every 240\u2009\u03bcm over a distance of 1\u2009cm. Tissue section areas were quantified into volumes using the Cavalieri method. Any necrotic tissue within the cavitation was counted as part of the lesion. The percentage of scar/lesional tissue and cavity (total lesion) for each section were calculated as percent of total section area. Preserved gray and white matter were calculated similarly.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nFor immunohistochemical analysis, rats underwent fixation with 4% transcardial perfusion in 0.1M phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and the tissue was excised and maintained in 30% sucrose at 4\u00b0C. A 1-cm segment of the spinal cord centered on the injury site was dissected and used for cryosectioning. The tissue was embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound and cryosectioned in 20\u2009\u03bcm serial cross-sections collected on Superfrost slides.\nSections were then rehydrated in 0.1\u2009M PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X 100, blocked with either 10% normal goat (NGS) or normal donkey serum (NDS) for 1\u2009h at room temperature, and then incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C. We used the primary antibody anti-choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) (1:500, Millipore, AB144P) for motoneurons. After three washes, cells were incubated for 1\u2009h with the secondary antibody goat anti-mouse Alexa 564 IgG (1:500). Slides were washed with PBS and then coverslipped with Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI for nuclear counterstain. Immunofluorescent tissue was examined using a Nikon TE300 inverted fluorescent microscope.\n\nMotoneuron quantification\nFor motoneuron quantification, polyclonal anti-ChAT (1:100, Millipore, AB144P) was used, and large cholinergic cells in the ventral horn of the spinal cord were counted. These motoneuron counts were performed at 20x magnification bilaterally. ChAT+ cells were readily visible in the anterior horn and only counted in Rexed lamina IX. Values were pooled and the number of motoneurons per section was reported at 1-mm intervals.\n\nElectrophysiology\nHoffmann reflex (H-reflex)\nThe H-reflex records the monosynaptic excitation of alpha-motoneurons, and has been used as a surrogate for spasticity after SCI. In this study, H-reflex recordings were performed before SCI and weekly thereafter for 6 weeks. Under isoflurane anesthesia, electrodes were inserted transcutaneously in the left hindlimb. A pair of stimulating electrodes was inserted into the region of the posterior tibial nerve slightly above the ankle. For recording, a pair of silver needle electrodes was placed into the plantar muscles of the left hindpaw. The tibial nerve was stimulated using a 0.1\u2009msec duration square wave pulse at a frequency of 1\u2009Hz.\nThe recordings were filtered between 10 and 10,000\u2009Hz. Recordings of the H-reflex typically consist of two electromyography (EMG) responses\u2013an initial M-wave and a later H-wave. The M-wave is the result of direct activation of the motor axons and does not involve the spinal circuits. The later H-wave, or H-reflex, is a compound EMG response in the plantar muscle elicited by the synaptic activation of motoneurons by muscle afferents. The peak threshold for both the M and H waves was determined, and the Hmax/Mmax ratio was calculated.\nMotor and sensory evoked potentials\nMotor (MEP) and sensory evoked potentials (SEP) were examined to evaluate the electrophysiological integrity of the spinal cord after clip impact-compression injury to the lumbar spinal cord at 6 weeks post-injury. The rats were immobilized in the prone position and fixed in a stereotactic holder under isoflurane anesthesia. The conductivity of both descending motor tracts and ascending sensory tracts were analyzed. SEPs and MEPs were analyzed by peak amplitude measurements from the first positive peak to the first negative peak.\nSEPs\nThe intervertebral ligaments between C1 and C2 were removed surgically using fine forceps. Two pairs of 1.0-mm ball electrodes were positioned extradurally over the spinal cord at C1 and C2 for recording evoked potentials. The sciatic nerve was exposed and placed on bipolar silver electrodes. A constant current stimulus of 0.1\u2009msec in duration and 2.0 mA in intensity was applied at a rate of 1.13\u2009Hz to the sciatic nerve. At a bandwidth of 10 to 3000\u2009Hz, a total of 100 SEPs were averaged and replicated. SEPs peak latency was measured from the start of the stimulus to the peak of first negative peak (N1). The evoked potential amplitudes were measured as the voltage difference from the peak of the first positive peak to the peak of the N1.\n20\nRecordings were acquired using Keypoint Portable (Dantec Biomed, Denmark).\nMEPs\nStainless steel subdermal needle recording electrodes were inserted into the biceps femoris muscle in the hindlimb. Stimulation was applied to the midline of the cervical spinal cord between C1 and C2 vertebrae using a ball electrode as described above with the following specifications: 0.13\u2009Hz; 0.1\u2009msec; 2 mA; 200 sweeps. The amplitude was determined by the difference between the first positive and negative peak. Recordings were acquired using Keypoint Portable.\n\nImaging\nUltrasound imaging\nVery high-resolution ultrasound (VHRUS) imaging was used to measure\nin vivo\ncavity volume and tissue morphology. Spinal cord VHRUS imaging followed the protocols developed previously by Soubeyrand and colleagues\n21\nin 2014. In short, at 6 weeks post-injury, animals were placed under 2% isoflurane anesthesia as described above. and a midline incision was made in the skin followed by retraction of muscle and scar tissue to reveal the surgical site and spinal cord. Ultrasound gel (Medi-Inn, Canada) was then applied on the dorsal aspect of the dura mater.\nThe VHRUS probe (44\u2009MHz, Vevo 770, Visualsonics, Toronto, Canada) was attached to the rail mount of the Vevo Integrated Rail system III (Visualsonics, Toronto, Canada) by an integrated clamp. The rail mount was positioned 6\u2009mm above the middle of the spinal cord. To obtain only sagittal acquisitions, the scanhead was tilted and locked. Both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) acquisitions were obtained.\nFor 3D acquisitions, the motor stage travelled 6\u2009mm from left to right, acquiring a 2D slice at each step, with a distance of 102\u2009\u03bcm. Slices were stacked and assembled as a 3D file. The 3D files were analyzed with ImageJ software (NIH). The analysis was then performed on a stack of 19 sagittal slices centered on the midline. On each slice, the dark cavitation within the spinal cord (known to be cavity by the absence of tissue to reflect high frequency sound waves) was delineated to obtain the area. Subsequently, the cavity area of each slice was combined to determine the cavity volume (using the known distance between sagittal slices).\nCT\nCT imaging was used to confirm the correct operative level (\nFig. 2\n). As indicated above, the 13th rib articulates with the anterior aspect of the 13th thoracic vertebral body, and the L6 vertebra lies directly between the iliac crests, which can be seen clearly in the images. The bony anatomy was imaged with the GE Locus Ultra MicroCT system. The following technical specifications were used: 16-sec anatomical scan time with 150\u2009\u03bcm\n3\nresolution, a 14-cm maximum transaxial field of view (FOV), 10.2\u2009cm/16\u2009sec maximum longitudinal FOV with 1000 volumes per rotation. The X-ray tube was used an 80\u2009kV voltage, 50 mA current, and 0.15\u2009mm Cu filter with a \u201cstandard\u2019 reconstruction filter. Animals were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane to avoid movement during scan acquisition and imaged at 7 days post-surgery.\nMRI\nAnimals were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane for MRI imaging. The images were acquired on a 7T Biospec USR 70/30 (Bruker Corporation, Ettlingen, DE), with the B-GA12 gradient coil insert. A 7.2\u2009cm inner diameter cylindrical linearly polarized RF coil was used for radio frequency (RF) transmission, and a 20-mm flat surface coil taped above the lesion was used for RF signal reception.\nCoronal 2D-RARE T1-weighted images were acquired with the following parameters: echo time 12\u2009msec, echo train length of 2, and repetition time was gated to the respiratory cycle (TR \u223c1300\u2009msec). Images were acquired over a 40\u2009\u00d7\u200940\u2009mm FOV with a 320\u2009\u00d7\u2009320 matrix for 125-micron in-plane resolution. The effective readout bandwidth was 44.6\u2009kHz, slice thickness was 1.1\u2009mm for a total of 5 slices. The scan time was approximately 24\u2009min.\nAxial 2D-RARE T1-weighted images were acquired with the following parameters: echo time 14.4\u2009msec, echo train length of 4, and repetition time was gated to the respiratory cycle (TR \u223c1300\u2009msec). Images were acquired over a 16\u2009\u00d7\u200916\u2009mm FOV with a 128\u2009\u00d7\u2009128 matrix for 125-micron in-plane resolution. Out-of-FOV signal was suppressed using saturation bands. The effective readout bandwidth was 48\u2009k Hz, with a slice thickness of 1.1\u2009mm for a total of 15 slices. The scan time was approximately 22\u2009min.\n\nStatistics\nTail-flick, VFF, and lesion analysis were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Bonferroni\npost hoc\nfor multiple comparisons. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare BBB scores between different injury groups with Bonferroni\npost hoc\n. T-tests were used to compare ultrasound quantification, H-reflex scores, and evoked potentials. Criteria for statistical significance was \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05, \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.20, and all statistical analyses were performed using SigmaStat software. All values are represented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM) except BBB scores, which are calculated as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD)."

    "Methods": "Male Sprague-Dawley rat pups (PND 10) were purchased with lactating mothers from Harlan. The rats were housed for at least 1 week before commencement of the experiments. The rats were fed standard rat chow and provided waterad libitum. Ambient temperature was controlled at 20\u201322\u00b0C, and lighting was on a 12-h/12-h cycle. Experiments were performed exploring the effect of (1) mTBI on short-term histological outcome and (2) repetitive mTBI on motor, cognitive, and long-term histological outcome. The experimental design and time points for histological and neurocognitive outcome testing are summarized inFigure 1. This study was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nMild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)\nAn adult mTBI model\n5\nwas modified for all experiments with several important changes. Briefly, rats were anesthetized via a nose cone using 2% isoflurane and a 2:1 nitrous oxide/oxygen mix. The heads were shaved, and the surgical site was disinfected with povidone-iodine. The anesthetized rats were placed onto a stereotaxic frame, secured using ear bars, an incision was made along the scalp, and a pneumatically driven piston delivered a pre-defined injury to the intact skull just above the left parietal cortex. A rubber ball (9.5\u2009mm in diameter with a durometer of 50, Precision Associates, Inc, Minneapolis, MN) was mounted onto a bowl shaped metal tip (University of Pittsburgh Machine Shop), and the rubber tip was lowered at 23 degrees and measured to strike at 1.8\u2009mm caudal to bregma and 3.0\u2009mm left of the midline. The tip was retracted and lowered to a depth of 1.0\u2009mm and fired at 4.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2\u2009m/sec with duration of 50\u2009msec.\nThe procedure resulted in <10% skull fractures and no immediate fatalities or apnea. After the impact, the skin was sutured and the rats were allowed to recover from anesthesia with 100% oxygen on a warming pad and then returned to their cages. Sham controls underwent similar procedures including anesthesia, except the device was fired in the air above the rat's exposed skull without making contact. After the insult, the incision was sutured.\n\nAssessment of histological outcome\nRats were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane and transcardially perfused with ice-cold saline and 0.5% heparin followed by 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brains were post-fixed with 2% PFA for 24\u2009h, then transferred to 15% and 30% sucrose solutions, respectively, 24\u2009h apart. The brains were cut with a cryostat microtome (Leica, Jung CM1800) at 40\u2009\u03bcm, and the sections were kept in cryoprotectant. Neuropathologic evaluations were performed on four transverse sections \u223c200\u2009\u03bcm apart spanning from \u223c\u2009\u22123.0\u2009mm to \u22124.5\u2009mm relative to bregma\n25\non days 7, 21, and 92.\nSilver degeneration staining\nSilver staining was performed using the FD NeuroSilver Kit II (FD NeuroTechnologies, Ellicott City, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, sections were placed in 4% PFA for 4 days before staining, and all steps were performed on shaker with 130\u2009rpm.\nImmunohistochemistry\nFor free floating peroxidase immunohistochemistry staining, 40\u2009\u03bcm sections were placed in 2% H\n2\nO\n2\nfor 20\u2009min and blocked with 3% normal goat serum in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.25% Triton X (TBS-X) for 1\u2009h. Sections were incubated overnight in TBS-X solution containing rabbit anti-Iba-1 antibody (1:1000, Wako Chemicals) and 1.5% normal goat serum. The following day, the sections were washed, incubated for 1\u2009h with anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (ABC Elite kit, PK6100, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Sections were washed with TBS three times for 10\u2009min each and stained with DAB for visualization (DAB, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).\nDouble immunofluorescence staining\nFor double immunofluorescence staining, 40\u2009\u03bcm coronal sections were rinsed with TBS and incubated with TBS++ (0.1% Triton X-100 and 3% goat serum in 0.1\u2009M TBS) for 30\u2009min at 37\u00b0C. Sections were double stained with antibodies against Iba-1 (rabbit, 1:1000, Wako Chemicals), iNOS (monoclonal mouse,1:50, Thermo Scientific), and arginase-1 (polyclonal goat, 1:200, Santa Cruz) for 1\u2009h at 37\u00b0C, and they were kept overnight at 4\u00b0C. The following day, sections were washed with TBS (3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009min) and incubated with anti-mouse Alexa Flour 488-conjugated IgG (for INOS, 1:1000), anti-goat Alexa Flour 488-conjugated IgG (for arginase-1, 1:1000), anti-rabbit Alexa Flour 594-conjugated IgG (for Iba-1, 1:1000) for 1\u2009h at 37\u00b0C. After rinsing, sections were mounted on slides with DAPI containing medium (Victashield, H-200). Slides were examined under fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse 90i and Olympus Fluoview 1000).\nDigital image analysis of axonal injury\nDigital image analysis of silver staining was performed to quantify the degree of axonal injury. Two random 20\u00d7 magnified pictures were taken of each region of interest (i.e., cortex, external capsule, and corpus callosum) with a light microscope (Nikon Eclipse 90i). Each brain contributed a total of four sections \u223c200\u2009\u03bcm apart spanning from \u223c\u22123.0\u2009mm to \u22124.5\u2009mm, bregma.\n25\nAn area threshold of 0.8\u201320\u2009\u03bcm\n2\nwas used to exclude artifacts and cell staining. The percentage of injured neuronal processes was defined by dividing the stained area by the area of interest.\nQuantification of microglia\nIba-1 positive cells were counted as previously described.\n26\nTo estimate the number of Iba-1 labeled microglia, images were taken using a light microscope (Nikon Eclipse 90i). Each brain contributed a total of four sections \u223c200\u2009\u03bcm apart spanning from \u223c\u22123.0\u2009mm to \u22124.5\u2009mm, bregma.\n25\nLight intensity and area (>115\u2009\u03bcm\n2\n) thresholds were defined to detect Iba-1 labeled cells. Images were analyzed using NIS-Elements software to calculate the number of Iba-1 labeled cells within the area of interest.\n\nAssessment of neurocognitive outcome\nBeam balance and inclined plane tests\nRats were assessed for motor function using the beam balance\n27\nand inclined plane tasks\n28\nfor 5 days beginning the day after the last impact as described previously. Briefly, the beam balance task consists of a 1.5\u2009cm wide and 90\u2009cm elevated wooden beam that the rats must remain on for 60\u2009sec. Before surgery, the rats were pre-trained on the beam. To reach criterion, each rat had to remain on the beam for 60\u2009sec for three consecutive trials. For the inclined plane, the rats were placed on a flat board with angles increasing from 45 degrees to 85 degrees in 5 degree increments. Each degree consisted of three trials that were 10\u2009sec each. The maximum angle at which the rats could maintain position for 10\u2009sec was recorded. All rats were pre-trained for the inclined plane before surgery. To reach criterion, each had to remain on the incline for 10\u2009sec, while positioned at 70 degrees for 3 consecutive trials.\nMorris water maze (MWM) task\nRats underwent MWM training to assess the acquisition of spatial learning and memory retention. Briefly, rats underwent training on days 11\u201315 and were retested on day 61 after the last impact (sham or injury) for latency to find the hidden platform. One day of probe and visible platform trials were performed on day 16 after the last impact to assess memory retention and nonspecific visual deficits. The water maze consists of a pool that is 180\u2009cm in diameter and 60\u2009cm high. The pool was filled with water (26\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C in temperature) to a depth of 28\u2009cm. A platform 10\u2009cm in diameter and 26\u2009cm high (i.e., 2\u2009cm below the water's surface) was used as the hidden platform. The pool was located in a 2.5\u2009\u00d7\u20092.5 meter room with numerous extramaze cues that remained constant throughout the experiment.\nA video tracking system (Anymaze, San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA) was used to record and quantify the swimming motions of the rats. The tracking system consists of a CCD camera that is mounted over the pool and is attached to a tracking detection unit interfaced to a personal computer. On each trial, the rats were placed by hand in the pool facing the wall at one of four start points. Rats were given a maximum of 120\u2009sec to find the hidden platform. If the rat failed to find the platform after 120\u2009sec, it was placed on the platform by the experimenter for 30\u2009sec before being returned to a heated incubator between trials for 4\u2009min.\nFor the probe trial, the hidden platform was removed, and the rat was placed in the maze from the location point most distal to the quadrant where the platform was previously situated and allowed to freely explore the pool for 30\u2009sec. For the visible platform task, the platform was raised 2\u2009cm above the surface of the water to assess potential nonspecific deficits in visual and motor function.\nNovel object recognition (NOR)\nThe NOR task assesses declarative memory and consists of an opaque rectangular plastic container with approximate dimensions of 28\u2033\u2009L\u2009\u00d7\u200920\u2033 W\u2009\u00d7\u200920\u2033 H with an open top such that the experimenter can observe the rat and objects simultaneously. Three plastic objects consisting of a white PVC tube 3\u2033 diameter and 1\u2032 high (permanent object), red plastic jar 3\u2033 round 3\u2033 high (decoy object), and white plastic bottle 3\u2033 square 4\u2033 high (novel object) were used on every rat throughout testing. During the habituation phase (day 17), each rat was individually placed in the chamber in ambient lighting conditions to freely explore and habituate to two objects, the permanent and decoy, for a total time of 30\u2009min. Testing began 24\u2009h after habituation (day 18) with a reminder trial consisting of 1\u2009min in the same container with the habituation objects. The rat was then removed and returned to the colony for 1\u2009h. Testing occurred after a 1\u2009h interval, and the rat was again placed in the container with the permanent object and the novel object while the experimenter measured the time spent with the novel object and the permanent object for a total time of 2\u2009min.\nElevated plus maze\nThe elevated plus maze (EPM) (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL) consisted of two high walls for the closed arms (wall height 40\u2009cm) perpendicular to two open arms. Each arm had a width of 10\u2009cm and a length of 50\u2009cm. The open arms had 0.5\u2009cm curbs along the edges to prevent falls. A floor lamp (40 watt bulb) illuminated the maze from above. Each arm had an average light intensity of 100\u2009\u00b1\u200910 lux. Rats were placed in the center platform of the maze facing the junction of an open and closed arm and were allowed to freely explore the maze for 5\u2009min. A video tracking system (Anymaze, San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA) was used to record and quantify behavior.\nFear conditioning (FC)\nThe FC apparatus consisted of a sound and light insulated box containing a smaller Plexiglas chamber (30.5\u2009\u00d7\u200924.1\u2009\u00d7\u200921\u2009cm, Medical Associates, St. Albans, VT) with an electric grid floor (1.6\u2009cm spacing, 4.8\u2009mm diameter rods) and a camera mounted at the top. The rats were placed in the room 1\u2009h before testing for acclimation and then placed in the box for 60\u2009sec where they were presented with a 10\u2009sec tone (75 dB, 32.8\u2009kHz) coterminating with a 1\u2009sec foot shock (1 mA) that was delivered through the grid floor. Five pairings of the tone and foot shock were given sequentially for a total training period of 410\u2009sec, with 60\u2009sec separating each tone. The box was cleaned with Versa Clean between rats. On day 2, 24\u2009h after training, contextual FC was assessed by placing the rats in the box, and freezing was measured for 3\u2009min.\nAt 1\u2009h after contextual FC and 25\u2009h after training, cue FC was assessed by placing the rats in an altered chamber. Specifically, the box was cleaned and scented with a novel vanilla scent, a paper roll lined with print was placed within the box to hide the walls and floor, and a white noise of 65 dB was given the first 2\u2009min. After 2\u2009min, only a cue sound (75 dB, 32.8\u2009kHz) heard as the day before without the foot shock was delivered for 1\u2009min followed by 1\u2009min of silence. The rat's freezing behavior was measured for 4\u2009min. Freezing behavior was quantified as percent of time motionless after putting a threshold of motion based on sham animals using a video-based analysis (FreezeFrame, Coulburn Instruments).\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using Statview 5.0.1 software (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA). The motor and MWM data were analyzed by repeated-measures analysis of variance (rm-ANOVA). When the overall ANOVA revealed a significant effect, the data were further analyzed with the Fisher\npost hoc\ntest to determine specific group differences. All other data were analyzed either by ANOVA (quantification of silver and microglial staining) or Student\nt\ntest (NOR, EPM, FC). All data are presented as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean. Differences were considered statistically significant when the\np\nvalue was \u22640.05."

    "Methods": "Closed cranial window technique\nNewborn pigs (1\u20135\u2009d; 1.0\u20131.4\u2009kg) of either sex were studied. All protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania. Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane by mask (1\u20132%), maintained with a-chloralose (50\u201380\u2009mg/kg supplemented with 5\u2009mg/kg/h, intravenously). A catheter was inserted into a femoral artery to monitor blood pressure. The trachea was cannulated, and the animals were ventilated with room air. A water circulating heating blanket was used to maintain the animals at 37\n\u00b0\n-39\u00b0C, monitored rectally.\nThe closed cranial window technique for measuring pial artery diameter and collection of CSF for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis has been previously described.\n27\nThis window consisted of three parts: a stainless steel ring, a circular glass coverslip, and three ports consisting of 17-gauge hypodermic needles attached to three precut holes in the stainless steel ring. For placement, the dura was cut and retracted over the cut bone edge. The cranial window was placed in the opening and cemented in place with dental acrylic. The volume under the window was filled with a solution, similar to CSF, of the following composition (in mM): 3.0\u2009KCl, 1.5\u2009MgCl\n2\n, 1.5\u2009CaCl\n2\n, 132\u2009NaCl, 6.6 urea, 3.7 dextrose, and 24.6\u2009NaHCO\n3\n. This artificial CSF was warmed to 37\n\u00b0\nC and had the following chemistry, which is similar to that of endogenous CSF: pH, 7.33; pCO\n2\n, 46\u2009mm Hg; and pO\n2\n, 43\u2009mm Hg. Pial arterial vessel diameter was measured with a microscope, a camera, a video output screen, and a video microscaler.\nThe method used to induce brain FPI has been described previously.\n32\nA device designed by the Medical College of Virginia was used. A small opening was made in the fronto-parietal skull contralateral to the cranial window. A metal shaft was sealed into the opening on top of intact dura and fluid coupled to the brain injury device (i.e., the shaft was connected to the transducer housing, which was in turn connected to the fluid percussion device). The device itself consisted of an acrylic plastic cylindrical reservoir 60\u2009cm long, 4.5\u2009cm in diameter, and 0.5\u2009cm thick. One end of the device was connected to the transducer housing, whereas the other end had an acrylic plastic piston mounted on O-rings. The exposed end of the piston was covered with a rubber pad. The entire system was filled with 0.9% saline. The percussion device was supported by two brackets mounted on a platform. FPI was induced by striking the piston with a 4.8\u2009kg pendulum. The intensity of the injury (usually 1.9\u20132.3\u2009atm, with a constant duration of 19\u201323\u2009msec) was controlled by varying the height from which the pendulum was allowed to fall. The pressure pulse of the injury was recorded on a storage oscilloscope triggered concurrently with the fall of the pendulum. The amplitude of the pressure pulse was used to determine the intensity of the injury.\n\nProtocol\nPial small arteries (resting diameter, 120\u2013160\u2009\u03bcm) were examined. Vessel diameters were examined in all animals pre-FPI and 1\u2009h post-FPI in response to hypotension (moderate, severe), papaverine (10\n\u22128\nM, 10\n\u22126\nM), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2; 1\u2009ng/mL, 10\u2009ng/mL). Hypotension was induced by the rapid withdrawal of either 5\u20138 or 10\u201315\u2009mL blood/Kg to induce moderate or severe hypotension (decreases in mean arterial blood pressure of 25% and 45%, respectively). Such decreases in blood pressure were maintained constant for 3\u20134\u2009min by titration of additional blood withdrawal or blood reinfusion.\nTypically, 2\u20133\u2009mL of artificial CSF were flushed through the window over a 30\u2009sec period, and excess CSF was allowed to run off through one of the needle ports. For sample collection, 300\u2009\u03bcL of the total cranial window volume of 500\u2009\u03bcL was collected by slowly infusing artificial CSF into one side of the window and allowing the CSF to drip freely into a collection tube on the opposite side. Eight CSF samples were removed for each animal (four prior to FPI and four starting 50 minutes after FPI). Two 3\u2009mL blood samples were taken from the left femoral arterial line into a Cyto-chex BCT (Streck; Omaha, NE) vacutainer tube. CSF samples were stored at \u221220\u00b0C and blood samples were stored at 4\u00b0C.\nThree experimental groups were studied, vehicle control, FPI+vehicle, and FPI+PEG-TB. In vehicle control animals, vascular responses were obtained initially, the vehicle administered, and the vascular responses obtained again 1\u2009h later (time control). In TBI animals, vascular responses were similarly obtained initially, vehicle or PEG-TB administered, and the vascular responses obtained again at 1\u2009h post injury. PEG-TB\u2013treated animals (\nn\n=7) were given 0.7\u2009\u03bcL per gram of piglet weight of a 0.3% PEG-TB solution (weight/volume; Sigma Aldrich; St. Louis, MO) intravenously at 30\u2009min post-FPI. FPI+vehicle animals (\nn\n=6) were given a similar volume of saline at 30\u2009min post-FPI. Vehicle control animals (\nn\n=6) were surgicated, and vascular responses recorded initially and then again 1\u2009h later after receiving a similar volume of saline at the 30\u2009min time-point, but were not injured.\n\nELISA and radioimmunoassay\nCommercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were used to quantify CSF, tPA, and ERK-MAPK (Assay Designs, Farmingdale, NY) concentration, while radioimmunoassay kits were used to quantify ET-1 (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA). Phosphorylated ERK-MAPK enzyme values were normalized to total form and then expressed as percent of the control condition.\n\nMP isolation and analysis\nAll reagents were from Sigma Aldrich unless otherwise stated. Blood samples were mixed via gentle inversion 15\u201320 times and 1\u2009mL aliquots were then centrifuged at 2300\u2009g for 15\u2009min to prepare platelet-poor plasma and the supernatant carefully removed. Centrifugation was performed at room temperature.\nMP analysis was performed using three sets of antibodies for each sample. Each aliquot of sample was combined with 200\u2009\u03bcL of Annexin buffer (diluted 1:10 in de-ionized water), 5\u2009\u03bcL of each antibody (below), as well as 5\u2009\u03bcL of 3\u2009\u03bcm reference counting beads (final concentration 10\n5\n/mL; Spherotech). The diluted annexin buffer was filtered prior to use through a 0.1\u2009\u03bcm sterile low-protein-binding filter (Millipore, Danvers, MA). Annexin-V-FITC (BD Bioscience, Sparks, MD) antibody was used to identify annexin+MPs. All MP isolations were performed in triplicate and the average of the three values obtained for each specimen was used for analysis.\nFlow cytometry was performed on a 10-color FACSCanto (BD Biosciences). A previously described flow rate\u2013based method was used to quantify MPs in the sample.\n33\nMPs were defined according to size and positive expression of Annexin V.\n\nHistologic preparation\nThe brains were prepared for histopathology at 4\u2009h post FPI. Pigs were transcardially perfused with heparinized saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were then carefully removed from the skull and coronal sections were prepared at 0.6\u2009cm intervals for gross examination and photography. For histopathology, staining was performed on parafiin-embedded slides and serial sections were cut at 30\u2009\u03bcm intervals from the front face of each block and mounted on microscope slides. The sections (6\u2009\u03bcm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). Mean number of degenerating neuorns (\u00b1standard error of the mean [SEM]) in CA1 and CA3 hippocampus in vehicle control, FPI+vehicle, and FPI+PEG-TB\u2013treated animals were determined, with data displayed for the side of the brain contralateral to the site of injury (the side where pial artery reactivity was investigated). To determine the extent of neuron degeneration in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 subfields, six HE-stained sections from each animal were examined and the number of degenerating neurons were counted manually. Three frames (1\u00d71.2\u2009mm per frame) encompassing a total area of 3.6\u2009mm\n2\nin each slide from each hippocampal CA1 and CA3 region were analyzed at\u00d7100 magnification.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were performed with Stata v11.2 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Pial artery diameter values were analyzed using analysis of variance. If the value was significant, the data were then analyzed by Fisher's protected least significant difference test. MP concentrations were not normally distributed and thus a non-parametric test, the Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test, was used. CSF signaling assay values and counts of degenerating neurons were analyzed with Student's\nt\n-tests. An \u03b1 level of\np\n<0.05 was considered significant in all statistical tests. Values are represented as mean\u00b1SEM of the absolute value or as percentage changes from control value."

Statistical analyses were performed as described in the Methods.\nNA, not applicable; MS-153, (\nR\n)-(\u2212)-5-methyl-1-nicotinoyl-2-pyrazoline; MAP-2, microtubule-associated protein 2.\n\nDrug administration\nMS-153 was dissolved in saline and administered intravenously as a bolus dose at 5\u2009min after the injury via the femoral vein and followed by the subcutaneous implantation of a mini osmotic pump (Model 2001D; Alze, Cupertino, CA) to deliver the drug for 24\u2009h. Two doses of MS-153 were used; the low dose (25\u2009mg/kg, followed by a continuous infusion of 12.5\u2009mg/h for 23\u2009h) and a high dose (50\u2009mg/kg, followed by a continuous infusion of 25\u2009mg/h for 23\u2009h). The dose and dosing for MS-153 were based on studies in rat models of focal ischemia\n42\n,\n45\nand pharmacokinetics that demonstrated that MS-153 crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier and has a serum half-life of approximately 0.7\u2009h.\n45\nAnimals that survived to 7 or 14 days following injury were re-anesthetized at 24\u2009h after the injury using isoflurane to remove the osmotic pumps.\n\nGlutamate uptake assays in synaptosomes\nBrain- and sham-injured animals were euthanized by decapitation and tissue from the cortex and hippocampus below the impact site was dissected and immediately frozen at \u221220\u00b0C. When ready to perform uptake assays, frozen brain tissue was rapidly thawed and synaptosomes were prepared to examine kinetic parameters of glutamate uptake (V\nmax\nand K\nM\n). These were calculated by fitting the raw data to a Michaelis-Menten equation\n44\n; V\nmax\nand K\nM\nvalues were normalized to percentage of sham to control for variability among different assays.\n55\nThe kinetics of glutamate uptake in synaptosomes from brains of na\u00efve rats in the presence of MS-153 were analyzed using a standard dose\u2013response curve (0.1- 1000\u2009\u03bcM of MS-153, pre-incubated for 40\u2009min). The dose\u2013response curves from at least three independent experiments were fitted to the Hill equation. To determine the effect of MS-153 on injury-induced alterations in kinetic parameters of glutamate uptake, synaptosomes from brain-injured rats were tested for glutamate uptake in the presence of 100\u03bcM MS-153\n\nImmunoblot analysis\nAnalysis of GLT-1 and glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST) expression after the injury was performed in synaptosomal preparations from brain- and sham-injured animals. Lysates from synaptosomes were subjected to SDS-PAGE (4\u2009\u03bcg of protein per lane) and immunoblotted with antibodies against GLT-1 (1:10,000; Millipore, Billercia, CA) or GLAST (1:5,000; AbCam, Cambridge, MA); \u03b2-actin (1:1,000; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) was used as loading control. Detection was performed with infrared-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit DyLight 800, green and anti-mouse DyLight 680 red; LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-COR Biosciences). Analysis of spectrin breakdown products (SBDP) were performed in tissue lysate from brains extracted 24\u2009h after the injury as previously described.\n56\n\nHistological analysis\nBrain- and sham-injured animals were anesthetized, transcardially perfused with heparinized saline followed by 10% formalin, and brains processed for histologic evaluation as previously described.\n57\nCoronal sections (40\u2009\u03bcm) were taken between approximately 1.5\u2009mm and 6\u2009mm posterior to bregma, reflecting the rostral-caudal extent of the injury. Staining and quantification of Fluoro-Jade B (FJ-B) reactivity (0.001%; Chemicon; Millipore), neuronal nucleus protein immunoreactivity (NeuN, 1:10,000, clone A60; Millipore), and loss of MAP-2 (1:5,000, clone AP-20; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were performed as previously described.\n58\u201360\n\nStatistical analyses\nAnimal weights at the time of injury, duration of apnea immediately after injury, glutamate uptake kinetics, GLT-1/GLAST expression and SBDP generation in immunoblots, and FJ-B counts were compared using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by appropriate\npost hoc\nanalyses for comparisons between groups. NeuN cell counts were compared using a two-way ANOVA followed by a Neuman-Keuls\npost hoc\ntest, using the right hemisphere values as control, as they were similar to both hemispheres in sham animals (not shown).

    "Methods": "This research is part of Diagnosing and Evaluating Traumatic Encephalopathy using Clinical Tests (DETECT), an ongoing study with a primary goal of developing methods for diagnosing CTE during life. DETECT includes former NFL players and a control group. For this study, only former NFL players were included. DETECT study procedures are described elsewhere.19The Boston University Medical Center Institutional Review Board approved all study procedures, and all neuroimaging procedures were approved by the Partners Institutional Review Board. Prior to participation, all participants provided written informed consent.\n\nParticipants\nInclusion criteria for former NFL players in DETECT are: male; age 40\u201369; a minimum of 12 total years of organized football participation; and two years of play in the NFL. Additionally, participants must report a worsening of cognitive, behavioral, and mood symptoms for at least the last 6 months that is self-perceived, reported by others, or for which they have received treatment from a doctor. These symptoms may include difficulties with memory, planning and organization, impulsivity, violence, depression, anxiety, and/or apathy. As reported previously (with a sample that was nearly identical to the present sample),\n19\nthere were significant group differences in performance on select neuropsychological tests, with the AFE <12 group performing more poorly than the AFE \u226512 group; however, the mean performance of both groups was within 1.5 SD below demographically-corrected norms. Exclusion criteria are MRI and lumbar puncture contraindications or history of other diagnosed neurologic disease. Of the 74 former NFL players who had participated in DETECT at the time of the study, three did not have imaging data acquired. An additional five cases were excluded due to motion artifact, leaving 66 former NFL players eligible for this study.\nCurrent age differed significantly between AFE groups when all subjects were included (AFE <12,\nn\n=\u200930, mean\u2009=\u200950.3 years, SD\u2009=\u20096.6; AFE \u226512,\nn\n=\u200936, mean\u2009=\u200957.4 years, SD\u2009=\u20097.4;\np\n<\u20090.001). Because of this age difference and the resulting possibility of differences in style of football played in different chronological eras, we selected age-matched pairs for subsequent analyses. That is, one subject in the AFE <12 group was randomly paired,\na priori\n, with another subject of the same age from the AFE \u226512 group if any existed. Twenty-six subjects (AFE <12\u2009=\u200910 subjects; AFE \u226512\u2009=\u200916 subjects) could not be matched within 2 years of age with a participant in the other AFE group, and, therefore, these subjects were not included in the analysis. The remaining 40 subjects were matched within 2 years of age, with 20 subjects in each AFE group (age at scan range\u2009=\u200940\u201365). Because of the potential impact of current age on CC integrity, it was determined that focusing on age-matched pairs was of greater methodological importance than including a larger sample size with large between-group age differences. Moreover, using age-matched pairs in this study reduced the standard error of the mixed-effects regression estimates, which increases the power for detecting clinically significant estimates.\n\nHead impact exposure variables\nAFE to tackle football was treated as a dichotomous variable and used to divide subjects into two groups: AFE <12 and AFE \u226512. Not surprisingly, duration of football play, defined as the total number of years, differed between AFE groups and was therefore used as a covariate. Duration was treated as a continuous variable.\n\nMRI acquisition\nDiffusion weighted images (DWI) were acquired on a 3T MR scanner (TIM Verio; Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) with a 32 channel head coil. An echo planar imaging DWI sequence was used with the following parameters: repetition time, 11,700\u2009msec; echo time, 85\u2009msec; field of view, 256\u2009mm; 128\u2009\u00d7\u2009128 matrix; 2.0\u2009mm slice thickness; and parallel imaging using GRAPPA with acceleration factor 3. Seventy-three slices were acquired using 87 diffusion directions organized in multiple b-value shells, consisting of 64 diffusion-weighted images with a b-value of 900\u2009sec/mm\n2\n, 10 images with a b-value of 400\u2009sec/mm\n2\n, six images with a b-value of 100\u2009sec/mm\n2\n, and seven images with b-value of 0\u2009sec/mm\n2\nused as baseline images.\n\nPost-processing of diffusion tensor imaging data\nAffine registration of the DWI to the baseline image was performed to remove intrascan misalignments due to eddy currents and head motion (FSL 4.1; FMRIB Software Library, the Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain, Oxford, UK). Additionally, an automated evaluation of DWI images for motion artifact was conducted using in-house software and resulted in the elimination of four cases. A visual inspection of all 87 components of each DWI also was performed and resulted in the elimination of one additional case due to motion artifact. Further, this quality check revealed dropped signals in less than five of 87 diffusion directions in six cases (AFE <12\u2009=\u20091 case; AFE \u226512\u2009=\u20095 cases). These six cases were included in the study. However, to eliminate possible influences of these signals, we excluded the diffusion directions and gradient information using in-house software. One direction was removed in two cases, two directions were removed in three cases, and three directions were removed in one case. A corrected DWI-file with the gradients eliminated was obtained for each of the respective participants.\n\nCorpus callosum region of interest and tractography\nThe whole CC was defined manually on the midsagittal slice, with one slice to each side of the midsagittal slice on the color-oriented FA map (\nn\n=\u20093 slices) using 3D Slicer software package version 4.3.1 (\nwww.slicer.org\n; Surgical Planning Laboratory, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA). The whole CC label map was mathematically subdivided into five subregions, as described by Hofer and Frahm\n67\n(\nFig. 1\n). The five subregions contain commissural fibers of prefrontal (region I), premotor and supplementary motor (region II), primary motor (region III), sensory (region IV), and parietal, temporal and occipital cortical (region V) areas.\n67\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nTractography of the corpus callosum. The corpus callosum was subdivided into five regions containing commissural fibers of prefrontal (region I), premotor and supplementary motor (region II), primary motor (region III), sensory (region IV), and parietal, temporal and occipital cortical (region V) areas. Tracts were obtained using deterministic (streamline) tractography to trace fiber paths through the regions of interest. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nSeeding of fiber tracts through the whole CC and CC subregions was conducted in 3D Slicer using a deterministic (streamline) tractography approach, which uses the principal diffusion direction in each voxel to obtain fiber trajectories, with stopping criteria of FA lower than 0.15.\n68\nTo ensure that only CC fibers were included, exclusion regions of interest (ROIs) were used in the axial plane at the levels of the superior thalamus and rostral midbrain in order to eliminate corticothalamic fibers and corticospinal and corticobulbar fibers, respectively. Further, to ensure the accuracy of the CC subregion fiber extraction, regions not being examined were excluded (i.e., when fibers were extracted from region I, regions II-V were considered exclusion ROIs). Each tractography output was then inspected and if present, fibers clearly representing non-callosal tracts were manually removed in 3D Slicer. Fibers from the cingulum bundle and inferior longitudinal fasciculus were most frequently manually removed, while uncinate fasciculus and fornix fibers were manually removed in fewer cases. Mean FA, trace, AD, and RD were extracted for each CC tract. All of these procedures were carried out blind to AFE group membership and age.\n\nStatistical analysis\nDue to the need to include covariates in the analysis, a multi-variate mixed-effects linear regression model was used to determine the effect of AFE to tackle football on all DTI measures. This model included duration of play and body mass index (BMI) as covariates. BMI has been shown to be negatively correlated with the integrity of the corpus callosum.\n69\nThe model also adjusted for correlations within the age-matched pairs and between DTI measures from the same subject to account for possible inflation of type I error. All analyses were conducted using SAS 9.3."

    "Methods": "BDNF serum concentrations were determined in duplicate in two independent cohorts of TBI cases presenting to the Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) and the San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) emergency departments (ED), and one control cohort of JHH ED patients presenting for non-TBI complaints. Findings were subsequently validated in the prospective, multi-center Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in TBI Pilot (TRACK-TBI) Pilot study.20We also compared the prognostic value of BDNF to that of two well-studied TBI biomarkers, GFAP and UCH-L1, since these biomarker values were available from a previous study.18Study protocols were approved by the institutional review boards at participating sites.\n\nStudy population\nCase cohorts\nJHH and SFGH are academic, tertiary care, Level 1 trauma institutions. Patients were eligible for inclusion as TBI cases if they presented to JHH and SFGH ED after experiencing acute blunt head trauma and met the following criteria: age 18 years or older; presented within 24\u2009h of injury; met the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) criteria for obtaining head CT scans in TBI\n21\n; received a non-contrast head CT scan as part of their clinical evaluation; and had excess serum sample available in the clinical chemistry lab. Cases met the definition of TBI proposed by the Demographics and Clinical Assessment Working Group of the International and Interagency Initiative toward Common Data Elements (TBI CDE) for Research on Traumatic Brain Injury and Psychological Health.\n22\nEligible cases were excluded if they had one of the following prior medical conditions: demyelinating disease, neurodegenerative disease, dementia, stroke, brain tumor, intracranial surgery, or active cancer. TBI cases were selected between November 2012 and September 2013. Since we utilized excess clinical blood samples, informed consent was waived.\nControl cohort\nPatients included as control subjects were JHH ED patients who were evaluated for suspected acute coronary syndrome,\n23\nhad no blunt head trauma in the preceding 7 days, and were deemed to have a non-cardiac condition and discharged home from the ED. Eligible control subjects were excluded if they met any of the exclusion criteria for cases (see above). Control subjects did not receive head CT scans since there was no clinical indication for doing so. Clinical and demographic data were collected via structured patient interviews and a review of the electronic medical record. Subjects were enrolled between January 2012 and February 2013. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects.\nValidation cohort\nThe TRACK-TBI Pilot study enrolled subjects 16 years and older who presented to SFGH ED, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) ED, and the University Medical Center Brackenridge (UMCB), Austin, TX, ED with TBI.\n20\nPatients were included in the study if they presented to the ED within 24\u2009h of acute blunt force head trauma and met the ACEP criteria for obtaining a head CT in TBI, as previously described.\n20\nOnly subjects from TRACK-TBI Pilot who had serum samples available for testing were included in the present study. Subjects in the validation cohort were enrolled from April 2010 to June 2011, and were distinct from those in the SFGH case cohort. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects prior to enrollment in the study. Subjects unable to provide consent due to their injury were consented through their legally authorized representative at time of injury, and re-consented if cognitively able during their inpatient stay and/or their follow-up assessment time-point.\n\nSerum sample collection and biomarker measurement\nFor the JHH and SFGH TBI case cohorts, excess serum samples stored in a 4\u00b0C refrigerator were retrieved from their respective clinical chemistry laboratory and stored in a\u2009\u2212\u200980\u00b0C freezer. These samples were kept at 4\u00b0C for variable duration (median of 5 days). Serum samples for JHH control subjects and for TRACK-TBI Pilot subjects were collected, processed and stored in a \u2212\u200980\u00b0C freezer within 2\u2009h of collection, as previously described.\n23\n,\n24\nSamples for TRACK-TBI patients were collected within 24\u2009h of injury.\n13\nSamples were randomized and BDNF assayed in batches with an electrochemiluminescent sandwich immunoassay and read with a Sector Imager 2400 (Meso Scale Discovery, Rockville, MD). BDNF assay capture (MAB848) and detection antibodies (MAB648) and assay standard (248BD005) were obtained from R&D Systems (Duoset reagents, Cat. # DY248; Minneapolis, MN). Assays were performed within a single laboratory by staff blinded to clinical outcomes or study cohort. Samples from the different cohorts were shipped to this single academic laboratory. The assay lower limit of detection (LOD) was 0.0125\u2009ng/mL and the lower limit of quantification was 0.5\u2009ng/mL. As specified by the manufacturer, these assay reagents have no overlap with the TrK receptor proteins B-NGF, GDNF, NT-3, and NT-4. Assays were performed in duplicate. A previous study examining the stability of BDNF in blood samples stored at room temperature for 0-24\u2009h, 24-48\u2009h, 48-72\u2009h, or >\u200972\u2009h revealed an average increase of 1.67 (95% CI: 1.08-2.26) ng/mL per each 24-h period.\n25\nSince BDNF values are high in healthy subjects and low in diseased subjects, we defined low BDNF values as values that are lower than the 1st percentile in JHH non-TBI control subjects. This is analogous to the use of the 99th percentile as the recommended cut-off value in cardiac biomarkers\n26\n,\n27\n(values are high in diseased and low in healthy subjects).\nGFAP and UCH-L1 were previously measured in TRACK-TBI Pilot in a single laboratory (Banyan Biomarkers, Alachua, FL).\n15\n,\n18\nThe LOD of GFAP and UCH-L1 were 0.1\u2009ng/mL and 0.03\u2009ng/mL, respectively.\n\nOutcomes\nAll patients enrolled in TRACK-TBI Pilot received head CT scans at the time of presentation to the ED. Each head CT was de-identified and read by a blinded board-certified neuroradiologist following the recommendations of the TBI-CDE Neuroimaging Working Group.\n28\nOur primary outcome, incomplete recovery at 6 months, was defined as a composite outcome of either post-concussive syndrome (PCS) or Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) score of <8 at 6 months, as these two measures together encompass a wider spectrum of the entire sphere of post-TBI outcomes. We defined PCS as having three or more symptoms on the 6-month Rivermead Post-Concussion Questionnaire\n29\nthat were rated as worse than before the injury (score of 2).\n30\nThe GOSE categorizes recovery after TBI on a scale of 1\u20138, where 1\u2009=\u2009dead and 8\u2009=\u2009upper good recovery. GOSE <\u20098 signifies incomplete recovery.\n31\nAdditionally, head CT findings were classified as traumatic lesion present (this does not include isolated skull fractures) or no traumatic lesion present. TBI severity was classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on the Department of Defense/Department of Veterans Affairs definition (\nTable 1\n).\n32\nTable\n1.\nThe Department of Defense/Department of Veterans Affairs Classification of TBI Severity\nCriteria\nMild\nModerate\nSevere\nHead CT/MRI\nNormal\nNormal/ abnormal\nNormal/ abnormal\nLoss of consciousness\n0-30\u2009min\n>\u200930\u2009min and <\u200924\u2009h\n>\u200924\u2009h\nAlteration of consciousness/mental state\n<\u200924\u2009h\n>\u200924\u2009h\n>\u200924\u2009h\nPost-traumatic amnesia\n<\u20091 day\n>\u20091 and <\u20097 days\n>\u20097 days\nBest Glasgow Coma Scale score within first 24\u2009h\n13\u201315\n9\u201312\n<9\nOpen in a separate window\nTBI, traumatic brain injury; CT, computed tomography; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging.\n\nStatistical analyses\nClinical and demographic data were summarized with descriptive statistics and differences were examined using the Mann-Whitney test (2-groups), the Kruskal-Wallis test (n-groups) and the \u03c7\n2\ntest (proportions).

    "Methods": "Animals\nC57BL/6 WT and CX3CR1\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice (Harlan Laboratories, Udine, Italy and Jackson Laboratories, Sacramento, CA) were housed in a specific pathogen-free vivarium at a constant temperature (21\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C), with a 12\u2009h light\u2013dark cycle and\nad libitum\naccess to food and water. The IRCCS-Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri adheres to the principles set out in the following laws, regulations, and policies governing the care and use of laboratory animals: Italian Governing Law (D.lgs 26/2014; Authorization n.19/2008-A issued March 6, 2008, by Ministry of Health); Mario Negri Institutional Regulations and Policies providing internal authorization for persons conducting animal experiments (Quality Management System Certificate\u2014UNI EN ISO 9001:2008\u2014Reg. N\u00b0 6121); the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (2011 edition), and European Union directives and guidelines (EEC Council Directive 2010/63/UE). The Statement of Compliance (Assurance) with the Public Health Service (PHS) Policy on Human Care and Use of Laboratory Animals has been recently reviewed (9/9/2014) and will expire on September 30, 2019 (Animal Welfare Assurance #A5023-01).\n\nExperimental design\nExperimental design 1 (\nFig. 1A\n) was followed to characterize temporal M/\u03bc activation after TBI in the pericontusional tissue obtained 1 day, 2 days, 4 days, 7 days, or 5 weeks after sham/TBI injury (\nn\n=\u20098 per time-point). Experimental design 2 (\nFig. 1B\n) was followed to evaluate the consequences of CX3CR1 deletion on neurobehavioral and histopathological outcome, and on M/\u03bc phenotypical features in TBI mice. Sensorimotor deficits were evaluated in WT/CX3CR1\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice 4 days and 5 weeks after sham/TBI injury (\nn\n=\u20098).

Mice were sacrificed at 4 days, 7 days, or 5 weeks for M/\u03bc immunohistochemistry and morphological analysis or at 1 day, 4 days, or 5 weeks for CD11b\n+\ncell sorting by MACS technology and gene expression analysis. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nMice were randomly allocated to surgery (sham-operated or TBI) by a list randomizer (\nwww.random.org/list\n), taking care to distribute them equally across experimental days. All surgeries were performed by the same investigator, blinded to the experimental groups. All behavioral, histological, and biochemical evaluations were done by investigators unaware of genotype or injury status of the animals.\n\nExperimental TBI\nMice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (65\u2009mg/kg intraperitoneally) with rectal temperature maintained at 37\u00b0 C and placed in a stereotaxic frame. Mice were then subjected to craniectomy followed by induction of controlled cortical impact brain injury (CCI) as previously described.\n24\u201326\nBriefly, the injury was induced using a 3-mm rigid impactor driven by a pneumatic piston rigidly mounted at an angle of 20\u00b0 from the vertical plane and applied vertically to the exposed dura mater, between bregma and lambda, over the left parieto-temporal cortex (antero-posteriority, \u22122.5\u2009mm; laterality, \u22122.5\u2009mm) at impactor velocity of 5\u2009m/sec and deformation depth of 1\u2009mm. The craniotomy was then covered with a cranioplasty and the scalp sutured. Sham-operated mice received identical anesthesia and surgery without brain injury.\n\nSensorimotor function assessment\nNeurologic motor function was assessed by performing the well-established neuroscore test at 4 days and 5 weeks post-TBI. In our hands, the neuroscore has proven to be a sensitive paradigm for measuring post-traumatic neurologic deficits in mice up to 1 month post-injury.\n26\u201328\nThe neuroscore generates a score for each individual mouse from 4 (normal) to 0 (severely impaired) for each of the following indices: 1) forelimb function, 2) hindlimb function; 3) resistance to lateral right and left pulsion, as previously described.\n26\u201328\nThe best score per mouse is 12.\n\nTissue processing for histopathological analysis\nAt selected times after injury, mice were killed for histological analysis. Under deep anesthesia (equitensin 120\u2009\u03bcL/mouse), animals were transcardially perfused with 20\u2009mL of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) 0.1\u2009mol/L, pH 7.4, followed by 50\u2009mL of chilled paraformaldehyde (4%) in PBS. The brains were carefully removed from the skull and post-fixed for 6\u2009h at 4\u00b0C, and then transferred to 30% sucrose in 0.1\u2009mol/L phosphate buffer for 24\u2009h until equilibration. The brains were frozen by immersion in isopentane at \u221245\u00b0C for 3\u2009min before being sealed into vials and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. Twenty-\u03bcm thick serial sections were cut using a cryostat from bregma +1\u2009mm to bregma \u22124\u2009mm.\n\nTUNEL staining\nTo assess the presence of injured cells showing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-Y-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed on 20\u2009\u03bcm sections using an\nin situ\ncell death detection kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One coronal section per mouse, located at \u22121.5\u2009mm from bregma, was selected and adequate negative and positive controls were performed. After staining, the sections were visualized using fluorescent microscopy (Olympus IX70; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Images of the area of interest were acquired using appropriate software (Cell^F Olympus). For each mouse, nine fields at 20\u00d7 magnification were analyzed over the injured cortex. TUNEL-positive cells were counted using ImageJ software (\nhttp://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/\n) and expressed as the number per mm\n2\nfor subsequent statistical analysis.\n25\n\nNeuronal count\nCresyl violet\u2013stained brain sections were used for neuronal count. One coronal section per mouse, located at \u22121.5\u2009mm from bregma, was chosen to assess the viability of neurons in the injured cortex. An Olympus BX61 microscope, inter-faced with Soft Imaging System Colorview video camera and AnalySIS software (all Olympus) was used. For each mouse, nine fields at 40\u00d7 magnification were analyzed over the injured and the contralateral cortex. The degree of neuronal loss was calculated by pooling the number of stained neurons in the sections of each hemisphere and was expressed as a percentage of the contralateral hemisphere. Fields were analyzed using the open source platform software Fiji (\nhttp://fiji.sc/Fiji\n)\n29\nand segmentation was used to discriminate neurons from glia on the basis of cell size.\n30\n,\n31\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nImmunohistochemistry was performed on 20-\u03bcm thick brain coronal sections using anti-mouse CD11b (1:1000, kindly provided by Dr. Doni), anti-mouse CD45 (1:800; BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Jose, CA), anti-mouse CD68 (1:200; Serotec, Kidlington, UK), anti-mouse Ym1 (1:400, Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada), anti-mouse inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS; 1:50; BD Biosciences Pharmingen to measure M/\u03bc activation, recruitment, phagocytosis, M2, and M1 polarization respectively. Positive CD11b, CD45, CD68, Ym1, and iNOS cells were stained by reaction with 3,3-diaminobenzidine-tetrahydrochloride (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) as previously described.\n28\nFor each reaction, adequate negative controls were performed. For negative control staining, the primary antibodies were omitted, and no staining was observed. CD45-positive cells displayed two morphologies: a leukocyte-like shape corresponding to cells with a rounded cell body without branches and high expression of CD45 (CD45\nhigh\n), and a microglia-like shape having a small cell body and several branches and a fainter expression of CD45 (CD45\nlow\n). Quantification was carried out only on CD45\nhigh\ncells.\n32\n,\n33\nThree brain coronal sections per mouse (at 0.4, 1.6, and 2.8\u2009mm posterior to bregma) were used to quantify CD11b-, CD68-, iNOS-, Ym1-, and CD45-stained areas. Quantitative analysis was thus performed in the pericontusional tissue defined by anatomic boundaries and by acquiring the same focal plan throughout the samples.\n26\n,\n28\n,\n34\nAn Olympus BX61 microscope equipped with a motorized stage and managed with AnalySIS software (Olympus) was used for image acquisition. For each section, nine fields (40\u00d7 magnification) were selected for quantification. The pericontusional tissue was defined as the 2200\u2009\u03bcm wide area surrounding the lesion edge. The first raw of fields was positioned at the contusion edge, spacing each field by 361.2\u2009\u03bcm (distance between centers of the fields). A second and a third raw of fields were positioned further from the lesion and aligned to the first raw. Distance between each raw was 722.4\u2009\u03bcm. An immunostained area for each marker was measured using Fiji software (\nhttp://fiji.sc/Fiji\n),\n29\nexpressed as positive pixels/total assessed pixels, and indicated as staining percentage area or as number per mm\n2\nfor subsequent statistical analysis.\n\nMorphological analysis\nMorphological analysis was carried out on CD11b-stained sections. Image processing was performed using Fiji software.\n29\n,\n35\nAn algorithm was created to segmentate and analyze stained cells.\n33\nBriefly, images were first scaled into microns (pixel size\u2009=\u20090.172 \u00d7\u20090.172\u2009\u03bcm). Background was subtracted and a math operation was applied so that all the gray values greater than a specified constant were replaced by the constant. The constant was defined by an operator on the basis of the best segmentation performance on pilot images and did not change throughout the experimental groups. Images were then binarized and smoothed to best fit cell shape and get rid of single positive pixels still present in the background. A further step of pixel erosion helped to achieve satisfactory cell shape fitting. To be sure to select only cells entirely present in the acquired field, cells with area >\u200925\u2009\u03bcm\n2\nwere considered for analysis. Once segmented, the objects were measured for the following parameters: area, perimeter, Feret's diameter (max caliper), circularity, and solidity.\n36\nMean single cell values for each parameter were used for statistics.\n\nImmunofluorescence and confocal analysis\nImmunofluorescence was performed on 20\u2009\u03bcm coronal sections as previously described.\n15\n,\n32\nPrimary antibodies used were anti-mouse CD11b (1:30000; kindly provided by Dr. Doni) and anti-mouse CD68 (1:200; Serotec). Fluoro-conjugated secondary antibody used was Alexa 546 anti-rat (1:500; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Biotinylated anti-rat antibody (1:200; Vector Laboratories) also was used followed by fluorescent signal coupling with a streptavidin tyramide signal amplification kit (cyanine 5; Perkin Elmer, MA). Appropriate negative controls were run without the primary antibodies. None of the immunofluorescence reactions revealed unspecific fluorescent signal in the negative controls. Immunofluorescence was acquired using a scanning sequential mode to avoid bleed-through effects by an IX81 microscope equipped with a motorized stage and a confocal scan unit FV500 with three laser lines: Ar-Kr (488\u2009nm), He-Ne red (646\u2009nm), and He-Ne green (532\u2009nm; Olympus) and an ultraviolet diode. Three-dimensional images were acquired over a 10\u2009\u03bcm\nZ\n-axis with a 0.23\u2009\u03bcm step size and processed using Imaris software (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland).\n\nCD11b\n+\ncell sorting and RT-PCR\nTwenty-four hours, 4 days, and 5 weeks post-TBI, mice were killed and ipsilateral traumatized cortices were rapidly dissected out, weighted, and dissociated using MACS\n\u00ae\nneural dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotech, Cambridge, MA). CD11b\n+\ncells were isolated by a myelin removal and immunomagnetic cell separation kit (Myelin Removal Beads II, CD11b Microbeads; Miltenyi Biotech). CD11b\n+\ncells were isolated according to the manufacturer's instructions, with the exception of increases in single runs of gentleMacs\u2122 brain program #1 to three runs and brain program #3 to two runs in order to ensure complete tissue dissociation.\nTotal ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted from CD11b\n+\ncells using the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples of total RNA (100\u2009ng) were treated with DNAse (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and reverse-transcripted with random hexamer primers using multiscribe reverse transcriptase (TaqMan reverse transcription reagents; Applied Biosystems). Primers were designed to span exon junctions in order to amplify only spliced RNA using PRIMER-3 software (\nhttp://frodo.wi.mit.edu/\n) based on GenBank accession numbers, and are indicated in\nTable 1\n. The same starting concentrations of complementary DNA template were used in all cases. RT-PCR was conducted using Power SYBR Green according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). \u03b2-Actin was used as reference gene and relative gene expression levels were determined according to the \u0394\u0394Ct method (Applied Biosystems). Data are presented as fold change, compared with values of the respective control group.\nTable\n1.\nPrimers Used for RT-PCR\nGene\nNCBI refSequence\nForward primer\nReverse primer\n\u03b2-actin\nNM_007393.3\nGCCCTGAGGCTCTTTTCCAG\nTGCCACAGGATTCCATACCC\nIL1\u03b2\nNM_008361.3\nAGTTGACGGACCCCAAAAGA\nGGACAGCCCAGGTCAAAGG\nTNF\u03b1\nNM_013693.2\nAGACCCTCACACTCAGATCATCTTC\nTTGCTACGACGTGGGCTACA\nIGF1\nNM_001111274.1\nCACACTGACATGCCCAAGAC\nCCTTTCCTTCTCCTTTGCAG\nIL10\nNM_010548\nCCTGGTAGAAGTGATGCCCC\nTCCTTGATTTCTGGGCCATG\nTGF\u03b2\nNM_011577.1\nGGAGAGCCCTGGATACCAAC\nCAACCCAGGTCCTTCCTAAA\nOpen in a separate window\nRT-PCR, real-time polymerase chain reaction; NCBI, National Center for Biotechnology Information; IL, interleukin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor, IGF, insulin-like growth factor; TGF, transforming growth factor.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation.

    "Methods": "Participants\nModerate-to-severe TBI participants were recruited from the pediatric intensive care units of four Los Angeles County trauma hospitals. The overall study was approved by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) institutional review boards and the institutional review boards of each facility from which patients were recruited. Participants were invited to participate following a telephone screening for the following inclusion criteria: 1) the child had sustained a moderate-to-severe closed-head, non-penetrating TBI. Moderate-to-severe injury was defined as a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score between 3 and 12 on admission to the hospital (children with higher GCS scores were included if their injury produced confirmed abnormalities on clinical brain imaging, such as hemorrhage); 2) 8\u201318 years of age at the time of injury; 3) normal visual acuity or normal vision once corrected with eyeglasses or contact lenses; and 4) the child's proficiency in the English language so that he/she could understand instructions and participate in the neurocognitive assessments. Participants with a pre-TBI history of developmental, neurological, or psychiatric disorders (e.g., including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD[ and previous head injuries) were excluded. Parents provided written informed consent, while children provided written assent to participate in this study. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, standard neurocognitive evaluations, and another neurobehavioral measure were collected from participants in addition to the EEG/ERP data. The control group included 39 typically-developing children ascertained from the same communities as the msTBI patients. Healthy control group children had no history of head trauma and also were required to meet inclusion criteria 2\u20134. Participants completed the entire protocol, including electrophysiological and neurocognitive evaluations, in one day.\nEighty-three children were entered into this study. Six children (five children with msTBI and one control child) were removed from data analysis due to unreadable ERP results. These children's ERPs were unreadable due either to excessive eye movements, muscle tension\u2013related artifacts, or other \u201cnoise\u201d that made the peak points on their parietal and occipital EEG waveforms unidentifiable. Three additional children (two controls and one child with TBI) were removed from data analysis due to missing mastoid EEG channels. To remain consistent with inclusion criteria, one additional child with msTBI was removed from data analysis after we learned that this child was diagnosed with ADHD prior to the msTBI. There were 44 children with TBI and 39 healthy control participants included in the analyses presented below. Preliminary review of the distribution of IHTT scores of the msTBI and control participants (\nFig. 1\n) revealed that the distribution of scores in the msTBI group was highly skewed, with a substantial number of the scores of the msTBI group outside of the normal range. Just over half (\nn\n=\u200926) of the msTBI group had IHTT scores within 1.5 standard deviations of the normal range. The balance of the TBI group had very slow IHTTs, outside of the normal range. The normal range was defined based on the IHTT scores for the healthy control group. The cutoff for including participants in the slow IHTT group was an IHTT greater than the 1.5 standard deviations of the range in the healthy controls. Consequently, the msTBI group was split into two subgroups: normal IHTT TBI (\nn\n=\u200926) and slow IHTT (\nn\n=\u200918) TBI children (see\nresults\nsection for more details).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nViolin plots of the distribution of interhemsipheric transfer times (IHTT) in the healthy control, slow, and normal interhemispheric transfer time moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury groups.\nThe demographic and clinical characteristics of the three groups are presented in\nTable 1\n. A 3\u2009\u00d7\u20091 analysis of variance revealed that the normal range IHTT and slow IHTT msTBI groups and healthy control group did not significantly differ in age. Chi-square tests revealed that the three groups also did not significantly differ in gender or handedness. Hand dominance was based upon self-report from participants. The normal IHTT and slow IHTT msTBI groups did not differ in their worst GCS score recorded during the first 24\u2009h of injury, nor were these two groups different on the average time since injury at time of study participation. Worst GCS score was not available for one normal IHTT msTBI group participant.\nTable 1\npresents the demographic characteristics and injury severity of the groups in this study.\nTable\n1.\nDemographics and Injury Severity by Group: Controls Versus Two TBI Groups\nControl Mean (SD)\nNormal IHTT TBI Mean (SD)\nSlow IHTT TBI Mean (SD)\nSignificance value\nN\n39\n26\n18\nAge at testing (years)\n15 (3)\n14.6 (3.3)\n14.3 (2.4)\nF\u2009=\u20090.41 (\np\n=\u20090.66)\nGender (male)\n25 (64%)\n21 (81%)\n12 (67%)\n\u03c7\n2\n=\u20092.17 (\np\n=\u20090.34)\nHandedness (right dominant)\n35 (90%)\n24 (92%)\n16 (89%)\n\u03c7\n2\n=\u20090.18 (\np\n=\u20090.92)\nTime since injury (weeks)\n\u2013\n13.3 (5)\n13 (5.1)\nF\u2009=\u20090.04 (\np\n=\u20090.84)\nWorst GCS score\n\u2013\n8.7 (4.6)\n7.4 (4)\nF\u2009=\u20090.97 (\np\n=\u20090.33)\nParent education (years)\n15.6 (3)\n13.7 (3.6)\n13 (3.8)\nF\u2009=\u20094.47 (\np\n=\n0.02\n),\n=\u20090.10\nOpen in a separate window\nWorst GCS score\u2009=\u2009worst Glasgow Coma Scale score recorded in 24\u2009h after injury.

Principal components analysis confirmed that these five tests shared sufficient common variance in both children with msTBI and healthy controls that they could be combined into a composite score with unit weighting (Moran and colleagues, 2015, submitted for publication). The five tests included the following:\nPsychomotor processing speed\nThe Processing Speed Index (PSI) score from the\nWechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition\nor the\nWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition,\ndepending on age, was used.\n30\n,\n31\nWorking memory\nThe Working Memory Index score from the\nWechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition\nor\nWAIS-Third Edition,\ndepending on age, was used.\n30\n,\n31\nVerbal learning\nThe index of verbal learning was T-scores for the total words learned over five trials of the\nCalifornia Verbal Learning Test Children's Version (CVLT-C)\nor\nSecond Edition\n(CVLT-II), depending on age.\n32\n,\n33\nExecutive functioning\nThe index of executive function was derived from the Inhibition/Switching condition of the Color-Word Interference subtest from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Functioning System battery.\n34\nIQ estimate\nThe Vocabulary and Matrix Reasoning subtests of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI)\n35\nwere used to generate a two subtest estimate of Full Scale IQ for all participants.\nVisual ERP measure of IHTT\nThis study used visual ERPs to measure IHTT. IHTT is defined as the time required to transfer stimulus-locked neural activity between the left and right brain hemispheres. Electroencephalography was recorded while participants completed a computerized, pattern matching task with bilateral field advantage. A BIOSEMI system (BioSemi, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) was used to acquire ERPs. The low pass filter\u2009=\u200940\u2009Hz, high pass filter\u2009=\u20090.16\u2009Hz, bandwidth (3dB)\u2009=\u2009134\u2009Hz, and sample rate\u2009=\u2009512\u2009Hz.\nParticipants were exposed to two distinct visual patterns (geometric shapes of nine to 11 letter o's) following a gaze-fixation (a colon) in the center of the visual field. These patterns were presented randomly to two of the four visual fields (upper and lower; left and right). This created four bilateral and two unilateral conditions (right and left visual fields; RVF and LVF). Participants were asked to determine if the two patterns presented during each trial constituted a \u201cmatch\u201d or a \u201cnon-match\u201d. \u201cMatch\u201d and \u201cnon-match\u201d responses were made by pressing the \u201cM\u201d and \u201cN\u201d keys of a computer keyboard. Participants alternated between pressing with the right hand with their index finger on the \u201cN\u201d key and their middle finger on the \u201cM\u201d key, or with the left hand with their index finger on the \u201cM\u201d key and middle finger on the \u201cN\u201d key for each trial. The responding hand was alternated in eight blocks of 97 trials. Each participant's cross-callosal IHTT was calculated using the electroencephalographic visual ERPs, which were collected during the unilateral conditions. Greater detail on this methodology is described elsewhere.\n36\nERP recording\nWhile participants performed the pattern matching task, visual ERPs were recorded, synchronized to the onset of the pattern presentation. A 16-channel cap plus two grounders were used to record EEG. Parietal and occipital electrode sites were used because previous studies have shown these lateral sites produce large visual ERPs, which yield clear evoked potential IHTTs.\n37\u201339\nIn addition, electrodes were placed above, below, and at the outer cantus of each eye for the recording of eye movements. Electrodes placed on the mastoid bones (i.e., behind the ears) of participants were used as linked-ears references. This reference point has been shown to provide a more valid estimate of IHTT than mid-frontal reference points.\n28\nERPs at each recording electrode from each trial were stored on a computer disk for later averaging.\nFor each electrode, ERPs were averaged for the 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 combinations of LVF versus RVF. Averaged ERPs were displayed on a computer visual display and the N1 component identified blind to participant group. For each of the parietal or occipital recording electrodes\u2014contingent upon which set provided the most clearly identifiable nodes and peaks\u2014the latency and amplitude of these components were stored in a computer file for statistical analysis. IHTT was calculated by averaging ERP waveforms at the P3 or O1 (left hemisphere) and P4 or O2 (right hemisphere) electrode sites. Next, the peak latency (in milliseconds) of the early N1 evoked potential components was determined. Then, the latencies of the ipsilateral and contralateral conditions were subtracted to determine the overall IHTT for each visual field. Finally, the RVF and LVF IHTTs were averaged to compute the overall IHTT for each participant. The average of left to right visual field and right to left visual field IHTTs for each participant were used in the remaining analyses. Longer IHTTs indicate slower transfer of visual information across the posterior brain regions. Accuracy of pattern matching was not recorded in this study. Previous studies have demonstrated that true deficits in IHTT are reflected in slower reaction times rather than response accuracy, particularly in individuals with agenesis of the corpus callosum.\n40\n,\n41\n\nStatistical analysis\nAnalyses reported include independent samples\nt\n-tests, Pearson correlations, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests. Data were analyzed using statistics program R and in SPSS v21 (IBM, Inc., Armonk, NY)."

    "Methods": "Ethics statement\nAll methods and data are reported with consideration for the guidelines provided by Animals in Research: Reporting in Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) and Minimum Information About a Spinal Cord Injury Experiment (MIASCI).\n28\n,\n29\nFurther, we certify that all applicable institutional and governmental regulations concerning the ethical use of animals were followed during the course of this research. Animal experiments were performed under a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Maryland, Baltimore and in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations as stipulated in the United States National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering.\n\nSubjects\nThese experiments were conducted on new groups of animals distinct from those previously reported from this laboratory. In all, 35 female Long-Evans rats (ages 10\u201312 weeks; 200\u2013225\u2009g; Harlan, Frederick, MD) underwent SCI (see below for injury details) and were assigned to one of four groups: no treatment after injury (10 rats); riluzole (10 rats); hypothermia (eight rats); or glibenclamide (seven rats). All treatments were started 4\u2009h after injury (see treatment details below). Survivors were maintained for six weeks after injury, during which they underwent various evaluations for well-being and for neurological function, and after which they were euthanized to measure lesion volumes.\n\nSample size calculation\nWe based our sample size calculation on a previous study\n30\nthat used the same model of SCI and compared riluzole and glibenclamide, except that in the previous study the impact force was greater (30 vs. 25\u2009mm drop of a 10\u2009g weight), and the doses of the two drugs were lower. In that study, mean lesion volumes were 2.2 and 1.2\u2009mm\n3\nfor riluzole versus glibenclamide (standard deviation, 0.6\u2009mm\n3\n). These values yield an effect size (Cohen's d) of 1.7. Sample size calculation for a two-sample comparison (\u03b1=0.05; two-tailed), an effect size of 1.7, and a power of 80%, indicated a minimum sample size of seven per group. In order to maintain a balanced design for the analysis of long-term outcomes, the number of animals in each group was increased, commensurate with early mortality.\n\nRat model of SCI\nA unilateral impact to the cervical spinal cord at C7 was calibrated to produce ipsilateral but not contralateral primary hemorrhage.\n12\n,\n25\nRats were anesthetized (ketamine, 60\u2009mg/kg plus xylazine, 7.5\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneally [IP]) and the head was mounted in a stereotaxic apparatus (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL). Using aseptic technique and magnification (Zeiss operating microscope with co-axial lighting; Thornwood, NY), the spine was exposed dorsally from C3 to T3 via a 3\u2009cm midline incision and sub-pereosteal dissection of the paraspinous muscles. The ear bars were removed and the animal was repositioned so that it was supported from the spinous process of T2 (Spinal Adaptor; Stoelting) and the snout. At C7, the spinous process, part of the right lamina, the entire left lamina and the dorsal half of the left pedicle were removed using a 1.9-mm diamond burr (RS-6280C-6; Roboz Surgical Instrument Co., Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) and a high-speed drill, with care taken to avoid mechanical and thermal injury to the underlying dura and spinal cord. The dura was exposed by sharply removing the interlaminar ligaments rostral and caudal to the lamina of C7 and any remaining ligamentum flavum. The guide tube containing the impactor (1.55\u2009mm tip diameter, 57\u2009mm length, 1.01\u2009g) was angled 5\u00b0 medially. Using the manipulator arm of the stereotaxic apparatus, the impactor was positioned on the dura mater near the left C8 nerve root. As previously,\n12\n,\n25\nthe caudal edge of the impactor was placed in line with the caudal edge of the C8 nerve root at the axilla, and the medial edge of the impactor was placed 0.3\u2009mm medial to the dorsolateral sulcus. The impactor was activated by releasing a 10\u2009g weight from a height of 25\u2009mm inside the guide tube. The impact caused an immediate, forceful flexion of the trunk and 70\u201390\u00b0 flexion of the ipsilateral knee, which had been extended before impact, and resulted in a hemorrhagic contusion evident on the surface of the cord involving the ipsilateral but not the contralateral sulcus, as observed under the microscope through the translucent dura.\nAfter injury, the surgical site was flushed with 1\u2009mL of normal saline (NS), the musculature was replaced over the spine and the skin incision was stapled. Rats in the hypothermia treatment group had an epidural thermoprobe (Flexible Implantable Probe IT-23; Braintree Scientific Inc., Braintree, MA) placed on the dura and loosely sutured to the musculature to secure it in place. All rats were given 10\u2009mL of glucose-free NS subcutaneously. Rats in the three non-hypothermia groups were nursed on a heating pad (DC temperature controller with feedback; FHC Inc., Bowdoin, ME) to maintain rectal temperature \u223c37\u00b0C until they emerged from anesthesia (1\u20132\u2009h). After returning to their cages, a purified high calorie supplement (DietGel Boost; Clear H\n2\nO, Portland, ME) and water were placed near the rat to be easily accessible. Bladder function was assessed two to three times daily by observing for urination and by palpating the bladder. Manual expression of the bladder was performed using Cred\u00e9's maneuver, as needed, until the rats regained reflex voiding.\n\nControls\nBecause comparison groups included two drugs solubilized using different vehicles, and a non-drug group, we elected to have the controls not receive any vehicle or other manipulation.\n\nRiluzole treatment\nRiluzole treatment was based on Wu colleagues,\n18\n,\n19\nwho reported that rats with SCI receiving a dose of 8\u2009mg/kg IP twice daily had 30% (3/10 rats) survival, those administered 6\u2009mg/kg IP twice daily had 92.3% (24/26) survival, and those administered 4\u2009mg/kg IP twice daily had 100% survival. Here, we used an intermediate dose of 5\u2009mg/kg IP twice daily, which was twice the dose we studied previously.\n30\nRiluzole was prepared as described,\n16\nwherein it was initially dissolved in 45% (2-hydroypropyl)-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (2HP\u03b2CD) with 0.2\u2009N HCl, then diluted to a final concentration of 5\u2009mg/mL; 1\u2009N NaOH was added to adjust to pH 7.4. Beginning 4\u2009h after trauma, the final solution was delivered in phosphate-buffered saline at a dose of 5\u2009mg/kg IP twice daily for 7 d, adjusted for the rat's actual daily body weight.\n\nSystemic hypothermia treatment\nTemperatures were recorded using both a rectal probe and the epidural probe implanted at surgery. Within 5\u2009min of trauma, the rats were placed on a warming pad and the epidural temperature was maintained at 37\u00b11\u00b0C for 4\u2009h. Subsequently, moderate hypothermia (epidural temperature, 33.0\u00b10.3\u00b0C) was induced for 4\u2009h as described previously.\n21\nRats were transferred to the cooling system, comprised of a water blanket and pump (HTP WD-020 and HTP-1500, Adroit; Medical Systems Corp., Loudon, TN) with the pump reservoir filled with ice water. The rats were covered with a thermal blanket to stabilize their temperature. During this time, they were anesthetized with low-dose isoflurane (0.75%) via face mask, to prevent them from shivering or moving and dislodging the temperature probe. They reached the target epidural temperature for hypothermia within 30\u2009min of starting cooling. Blood oxygen saturation and pulse rate (MouseOx, Starr, Life Sciences Corp, Holliston, MA), as well as respiratory rate, were monitored continuously and recorded every 30\u2009min. After 4\u2009h, the animals were gradually rewarmed at 1\u00b0C/h until they were normothermic. After completing the hypothermia treatment, the epidural probes were removed by gentle traction, and the rats were returned to their cages, where food and water were easily accessible.\n\nGlibenclamide treatment\nGlibenclamide treatment consisted of administering a loading dose (10\u2009\u03bcg/kg, IP), 4\u2009h after trauma, plus implanting a mini-osmotic pump for continuous one-week long subcutaneous delivery beginning 4\u2009h after trauma of 400\u2009ng/h, which was twice the infusion dose that we studied previously.\n12\n,\n25\n,\n30\nDrug formulation and methods of administration have been described in detail.\n31\nA stock solution of glibenclamide was prepared by placing 25\u2009mg glibenclamide (#G2539; meets ISP testing; Sigma, St Louis, MO) into 10\u2009mL dimethyl sulfoxide. The solution to be loaded into the mini-osmotic pumps (Azlet 2001, 1\u2009\u03bcL/h; Azlet Corp., Cupertino, CA) was made by taking 2.1\u2009mL unbuffered NS, adding 4\u2009\u03bcL of 10\u2009N NaOH (undiluted Fixanal; Riedel-deHa\u00ebn, Seelze, Germany), then adding 400\u2009\u03bcL stock solution, in that order, to prevent precipitation of drug. The solution to be used for the loading dose was made by adding 4\u2009\u03bcL of stock solution to 1\u2009mL NS. After filling the mini-osmotic pumps, they were primed overnight in NS at 37\u00b0C with the outlet of the pump connected to a length of PE60 tubing that extended above the level of the priming solution, to prevent H+ ions from entering the pump chamber. Prior to implanting, the pump outlet was fitted with an empty catheter (PE60 tubing), 4\u2009\u03bcL in volume, that resulted in a 4-h delay in the start of drug infusion.\n30\nLoaded and primed mini-osmotic pumps were implanted subcutaneously after completing surgery to induce SCI. The pumps delivered 400\u2009ng/h of glibenclamide for 7 d. The loading dose (10\u2009\u03bcg/kg IP) was administered 4\u2009h after injury, with the volume of the loading dose in microliters equal to the weight of the rat in grams. After completing the glibenclamide treatment on Day 7, the rats were briefly anesthetized with isoflurane and the mini-osmotic pump was removed to conceal group identity.\n\nData collection and blinding of investigators\nIn accordance with good laboratory practice, different investigators performed surgery for SCI (OT) versus evaluation of outcomes (HH, DP, KK, BRS, SI) and, when possible, outcome evaluations were performed by investigators who were blinded to treatment group. Outcome measures were evaluated in two phases. Phase 1 consisted of the first 7 d after trauma, during which group identity could not be concealed, because early mortality had to be compensated by adding new animals to the appropriate groups, and because required manipulations or external signs of group identity (twice daily IP injections [riluzole] vs. an implanted mini-osmotic pump [glibenclamide] vs. nothing [controls and hypothermia]) prevented concealment.\nDuring Phase 1, we assessed mortality daily; also, on Days 1, 3, and 7, we assessed autonomic function (heart rate, rectal temperature, and ipsilateral ptosis), arousal scores (lethargy), motor scores, bladder function, and serum glucose. Also during Phase 1, on Days 1, 3, and 7, we measured modified (unilateral) Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (mBBB) scores, performance on the inclined plane, beam balance, and body mass. On Day 8, after external signs of group identity had been removed, de-identified rats were marked with a coded ear tag (National Band and Tag Co., Newport KY) and randomly assigned to cages by a scientist (VG) not involved in outcome evaluations. During Phase 2, de-identified rats were evaluated weekly by blinded investigators (HH, DP, KK, OT) for mBBB scores, performance on the inclined plane, beam balance, and body mass. Performance on the accelerating rotarod was tested only once,\n32\nduring Week 6. After completing the functional evaluations of Week 6, rats were euthanized and the spinal cords were processed to evaluate lesion volume (BRS, SI).\n\nTreatment allocation\nFor the first 28/35 rats, each day four rats underwent SCI and were allocated to one of the four treatment groups. For practical reasons\u2014specifically, the length of time required to administer delayed hypothermia and rewarming\u2014the first rat of the day was always assigned to the hypothermia group. Treatment allocation for the other three rats was determined by coin toss by an investigator not otherwise involved in the experiments. The final 7/35 rats were allocated to treatment groups in accordance with early mortality.\n\nAutonomic function\nRectal temperature was measured using a digital thermometer (DT-610B; ATP Instrumentation, Leicestershire, UK). Heart rate was recorded using the MouseOx. Ipsilateral ptosis was determined by physical examination.\n\nArousal (lethargy)\nThe response to non-noxious whisker/face tactile stimulation was scored as follows: 0, dead; 1, alive but no response; 2, weak response (moves head); 3, strong response (moves head, neck, and forelimbs).\n\nMotor scores\nMotor function early after trauma was evaluated, with scores determined as follows\n33\n,\n34\n: 0, no movement of hind limbs, no weight bearing; 1, barely perceptible movements of hind limbs, no weight bearing; 2, frequent and/or vigorous movement of hindlimbs but no weight support; 3, alternative stepping and propulsive movements of hind limbs, some intermittent weight bearing; 4, can support weight and walk with deficit apparent; 5, normal walking.\n\nBladder function\nOn two to three occasions per day, the bladder was palpated to determine fullness. When full, manual compression was applied to initiate emptying (Cred\u00e9's maneuver). The appearance of the urine, whether grossly bloody or not, was recorded.\n\nSerum glucose\nTail prick was used to obtain a droplet of blood; serum glucose was measured using a glucometer (OneTouch Ultra; LifeScan Inc., Milpitas, CA).\n\nBBB scores\nBBB\n35\nscores were determined as described, except that modifications were introduced to allow more accurate assessment of the functional asymmetry associated with hemicord injury. The scoring sheet shown in the original paper\n35\nprovides for scoring of the right and left hindlimbs separately, with the final score for the animal being based on the two scores. Here, because we were studying hemicord injuries, we maintained the two scores separately, which we refer to as mBBB scores.\n25\n,\n30\nThe method for scoring up to and including scores of 11 is identical for mBBB and BBB. For mBBB scoring of coordination, forelimb\u2013hindlimb coordination was operationally defined as a one-to-one correspondence between forelimb and ipsilateral hindlimb steps on each side; \u201calternation in hindlimb stepping\u201d, which is taken into account in BBB scoring, was ignored for mBBB scoring. For scores above 19, both right and left sides were credited for \u201ctail consistently up\u201d and for \u201ctrunk stability.\u201d Serial mBBB scores were assessed by two independent investigators, with the worse of the two scores being used.\n\nInclined plane\nWe measured the angle of failure on up-angled and down-angled planes, using a wooden surface (unfinished Luan plywood), with the plane position angled from horizontal at \u223c5\u00b0/sec.\n36\nThe animals were placed transversely on the inclined plane and the highest angle the rat could maintain for 5\u2009sec was recorded. The better of two consecutive tests was taken as the final measure.\n\nBeam balance\nPerformance on beam balance was evaluated,\n37\nwith scores determined as follows: 0, falls off; 1, hangs on; 2, stands on beam but one or two legs slip off; 3, stands on beam; 4, walks on beam.\n\nAccelerating rotarod\nPerformance on the accelerating rotarod\n38\n(IITC, Life Science, Woodland Hills, CA) was measured during the fifth week after SCI. The drum was started at 4\u2009rpm and was accelerated at rate of 2\u2009rpm every 5\u2009sec up to a maximum of 45\u2009rpm. Three trials separated by 20\u2009min were administered; we report the average latency to falling off of the drum.\n\nLesion volume and spared spinal cord tissue\nAt six weeks after SCI, the rats were deeply anesthetized, exanguinated, and transcardially perfusion-fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin, and the spinal cords were harvested. Serial paraffin sections (10\u2009\u03bcm thickness) were prepared from 2\u2009cm spinal cord segments encompassing the injury site. Sections were obtained every 500\u2009\u03bcm (no treatment group; \u223c20 sections/rat) or every 250\u2009\u03bcm (riluzole, hypothermia, and glibenclamide groups; \u223c40 sections/rat) and were mounted on glass slides. All sections were deparafinized and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) as a single batch (Tissue-Tek Prisma/Film Automated Slide Stainer; Sakura, Torrance, CA). After coverslipping, the sections were scanned at 2400 dpi using a flatbed scanner. The file names of the images were encoded to de-identify treatment group identity. Photoshop CS6 (v 13.0 x64; Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose CA) was used to view the image of each section enlarged \u223c40\u00d7and to draw planimetric lesion contours.\n39\nLesion boundaries were identified as abrupt reductions in H&E staining, compared with uninjured tissues. All contours outlining the lesion area and the area of spared spinal cord tissue were drawn by one researcher (BRS); ambiguous lesion boundaries were resolved by consensus between BRS and an experienced histopathologist (SI). Lesion volumes and volumes of spared spinal cord tissue (in mm\n3\n) were calculated as the sum of the areas (in mm\n2\n) multiplied by 0.5 or 0.25\u2009mm, as appropriate.\n\nData analysis\nLike BBB scores,\n40\u201342\nmBBB scores are derived from an ordinal scale and are not normally distributed, and so were analyzed using a nonparametric procedure. Modified BBB scores and beam balance scores at six weeks were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, with Dunn's post hoc comparison. Parametric data at six weeks, including performance on the inclined plane and accelerating rotarod, as well as body weight, lesion volumes, and volumes of spared spinal cord tissue, were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance with Fisher's post hoc comparisons. All data, including scores, are presented as mean\u00b1standard error."

    "Methods": "Study design\nThe study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of Boston Children's Hospital. Each participant consented electronically, in writing. We conducted a cross-sectional study of alumni from four New England division III institutions, targeting alumni between the ages of 40\u201370 years of age. We chose this age range because a prior study suggested that cognitive decline is evident in middle age.\n17\nEach participating institution sent their alumni an introductory email containing a link to an online questionnaire that was developed using Assessment Center\nSM\n. Participating institutions only allowed for one electronic request to be sent. Therefore, no reminder emails were used to prompt non-responders and no other forms of contact (e.g., phone calls, U.S. Postal Service) were used.\nAssessment Center\nSM\nis a free, online research program that allows researchers to design a secure, customized, data collection tool using several well-validated measures including the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) toolbox, and Neuro-QOL. Assessment Center\nSM\nhouses a library of measures to assess health-related quality of life. These measures parallel each other and comprise an array of instruments derived mostly from calibrated item banks that enable users to administer computerized adaptive testing or short forms to assess health-related quality of life. In addition, responses are automatically scored in reference to the general population or a defined clinical population.\nWe utilized instruments from Neuro-QOL and PROMIS on the basis of their construction and psychometric properties. Both systems identified relevant health-related quality-of-life domains through a comprehensive literature review, expert interviews, as well as patient and caregiver focus groups. Large calibration studies were conducted in clinical samples and samples from the general population of the U.S. to determine the final item banks and scales. Developers then administered additional sampling to validate the measures in disease populations. The resulting item banks and scales have been shown to reliably assess multiple domains of functioning, including physical, mental, and social well-being.\n18\nWe focused our analysis on domains purported to be associated with exposure to sub-concussive blows. We used the Neuro-QOL measures for executive function, general concerns, anxiety, depression, emotional and behavior dyscontrol, fatigue, positive affect, and sleep disturbance. Negative consequences of alcohol use were measured using the PROMIS measure Alcohol: Negative Consequences short form 7a. For most domains of interest, item banks were available. This allowed for computerized adaptive testing, which is the most precise and efficient means of measurement.\nIndividual item responses were given a numerical value, ranging from 1 to 5. A total score for each scale was calculated by summing the value of individual responses. Assessment Center software automatically converted total scores to a standardized T-score with a mean of 50 (standard deviation=10) based on comparison to the general public. For positive attributes (e.g., mobility) higher scores reflect better functioning, whereas higher scores on undesirable attributes (e.g., anxiety) reflect worse functioning.\n\nRisk factors, outcomes, and covariates\nAlumni were asked whether they participated in sports during college. The sport(s) participated in and number of seasons played was recorded. We categorized responses into: 1) collision sports, 2) contact sports, and 3) non-contact sports. Collision sports were defined as those during which routine, purposeful, body-to-body collisions occur as a legal and expected part of the game. We included the following as collision sports: football, rugby, men's ice hockey, and men's lacrosse. Contact sports were defined as those during which body-to-body contact occurs as a recognized part of the game, but purposeful body-to-body collisions are not allowed. We included the following as contact sports: soccer, basketball, baseball, softball, women's ice hockey, women's lacrosse, and field hockey. Non-contact sports were defined as those during which body-to-body contact is a rare, unexpected occurrence. We included the following as non-contact sports: swimming, cross country, golf, tennis, squash, Frisbee, and volleyball. Those athletes who participated in multiple sports were categorized as collision sport athletes if any of their sports were collision sports. Of the alumni who did not participate in a collision sport, any athlete who participated in at least one contact sport was categorized as a contact sport athlete.\nOur primary outcome was patient reported Neuro-QOL/PROMIS measures. Our main predictor variable was exposure to collision sports. Covariates were chosen a priori based on clinical judgment and previous research suggesting a potential association with our chosen quality-of-life measures, and included age, gender, race, annual income, highest educational degree, college grades, exercise frequency, and the presence of common medical conditions, including heart disease, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and a family history of dementia.\nOur study aim was to determine whether the exposure to sub-concussive blows (as opposed to concussions) that occur during collision sports were associated with later life neurobehavioral quality-of-life measures. Therefore, respondents who reported a history of concussion at any point in their lives, whether sport-related or not, were excluded from the primary analysis and considered separately. As the definition of concussion, incidence of diagnosed concussions, and assessments used to make the diagnosis of concussion have changed substantially over the years, we included athletes reporting a history of concussions that were diagnosed by a medical professional, as well as athletes reporting \u201cundiagnosed\u201d concussions, defined as any blow to the head or face that was not diagnosed as a concussion but resulted in loss of consciousness, amnesia, headache, difficulty concentrating, emotionality, irritability, slowed reaction times, sleep problems or trouble in school, in our definition of concussion. Subjects who reported other types of head injury that required treatment in a hospital (skull fracture, epidural bleed, subdural bleed, subarachnoid bleed, intracranial hemorrhage) were excluded.\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics were used to report the number and percentage of respondents in each variable category. As not all participants responded to each question, percentages were calculated using the number of respondents to a given survey item as the denominator. We used multivariable linear regression to adjust for the effect of potential covariates in separate models for each patient-reported outcome measure. Since former collegiate athletes have the potential to differ from non-athletes with respect to quality of life and overall health, and since there is some level of sub-concussive blows associated with contact sports, albeit lower than with collision sports, we chose non-collision, non\u2013contact sport athletes as our referent group."

    "Methods": "Sample size determination\nSample size was determined a prior\ni\nusing commercially available software (S-PLUS version 8.2; TIBCO software Inc., Seattle, WA) based on the assumptions of a normal Gaussian distribution of errors, a significance level of 0.05, and a minimum power of 80%. Sample size was estimated to address our primary objective\u2014that in dogs with acute SCI, APP concentration in the CSF is increased, compared with healthy control dogs. Recordable concentrations of CRP have been detected in both healthy (mean, 0.1\u2009\u03bcg/mL) and neurologically abnormal (mean 0.5-1.59\u2009\u03bcg/mL) dogs, using methodology parallel to that proposed in this study.\n23\nThus, we used the previously reported distribution of detectable CRP as a basis for our power calculation.\n23\n,\n24\nWe elected to use all available control dog (\nn\n=21) and were able to identify 54 SCI dog samples; however, due to insufficient CSF volume, only 42 SCI samples were included in analysis. This resulted in a power of 88% to detect differences in CSF CRP concentration between groups.\n\nInclusion criteria\nProcedures in dogs with naturally-occurring SCI were performed with owner consent and consisted of only standard medical and surgical care. CSF collected from the cisterna magna, which was obtained during clinical evaluation, was banked with owner consent. Purpose bred dogs were obtained and used with approval from the Texas A&M University Animal Care and Use Committee (AUP 2007-115; AUP 2011-145). All studies adhered to the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\nA repository of CSF aliquots stored at \u221280\u00b0C and housed at Texas A&M University since December 2009 was searched in July 2014 for samples from dogs with SCI that met the following inclusion criteria: 1) confirmed intervertebral disc herniation (IVDH) between the T3 and L6 vertebrae; 2) neurologic dysfunction of <7 d duration; 3) surgical decompression of the herniated disc with post-operative rehabilitation performed; and 4) complete medical records including neurologic score at admission and follow-up scoring at Day 42 post-surgery. Dogs that were part of ongoing clinical trials or had a myelogram performed as part of pre-operative diagnostics were excluded from this study.\nHealthy control CSF samples were collected from purpose-bred dogs with normal physical and neurologic exams, normal complete blood counts, and normal serum biochemical analysis. All CSF samples from healthy control dogs were collected and stored in the same manner as described for dogs with IVDH-associated SCI and were required to have a normal total nucleated cell count (TNCC; <5 cells/\u03bcL) and total protein concentration (<35\u2009mg/dL).\n\nSample collection and therapeutic procedures\nDogs with SCI received complete physical examination, neurologic examination, complete blood count, and serum biochemistry prior to anesthesia. Dogs were then pre-medicated with glycopyrrolate (Robinul-V; West-Ward, Eatontown, NJ) and oxymorphone (Numorphan; Endo Pharmaceuticals, Chadds Ford, PA) or hydromorphone (West-Ward). Following pre-medication, dogs were induced with propofol (Rapinovet; Abbott Labs, Chicago, IL) and intubated, and anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane (SevoFlo; Abbott Labs). Thoracolumbar vertebral column imaging was performed either via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography. CSF was then collected via needle puncture of the cerebellomedullary cistern, with an aliquot saved and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C for further analysis. Following CSF collection and diagnostic imaging, a hemilaminectomy was performed to remove herniated intervertebral disc material and associated epidural hemorrhage. Either gross visualization of the disc material or histopathology was used to confirm the diagnosis of IVDH.\nFollowing surgery, dogs were recovered in the intensive care unit with intravenous fentanyl citrate (Hospira Inc., Lake Forest, IL) analgesia and standard bladder management. Twenty-four hours later, physical rehabilitation consisting of supported overland walking, passive range of motion, and standing strength exercises was initiated. Dogs were released to their owner's care after pain control was achieved via oral analgesics (tramadol hydrochloride; Amneal Pharaceuticals, Hauppauge, NY) and urine could be voluntarily voided or the bladder manually expressed. Physical rehabilitation exercises were continued by owners for six weeks post-operatively.\n\nNeurologic scoring\nTwo separate ordinal SCI scoring systems were used in this study and were applied at initial evaluation and 42 d post-surgical recheck.\n25\nBoth scoring systems have excellent inter-rater agreement and predict long-term ambulatory outcome in dogs with IVDH-associated SCI. For both assessment tools, dogs were considered ambulatory if they could rise unassisted and take 10 or more steps without falling. Dogs that were non-ambulatory had pelvic limb movements evaluated using tail support. Postural reaction scoring was performed by supporting the dog in a standing position and placing the dorsum of the paw in contact with the ground. Superficial and deep nociception were evaluated by pinching the interdigital webbing and clamping the nail bed with hemostats, respectively. Nociception was considered intact based on demonstration of a behavioral (e.g., orienting to the stimulus, vocalization) or physiological (e.g., tachycardia) response to stimulation.\nThe modified Frankel score (MFS)\n25\nwas used as a coarse ordinal system to stratify injured dogs into groups that parallel those in the American Spinal Cord Injury Association Impairment Scale. The MFS consists of 6 strata where 0=paraplegic with absent deep nociception, 1=paraplegic with deep nociception intact, 2=paraplegic with superficial nociception intact, 3=non-ambulatory paraparetic, 4=ambulatory paraparetic, and 5=spinal hyperesthesia only.\nThe Texas Spinal Cord Injury score (TSCIS)\n25\nwas developed as a more refined system than the MFS and was used for all analyses that did not require stratification into broad functional categories. With this system, individual limbs are assessed independently and given a score based on nociception, gait, and proprioceptive placing. Nociception was scored as 0=absent, 1=deep nociception present but absent superficial nociception, and 2=deep and superficial nociception intact. For gait assessment, scores ranged from 0\u20136 as follows: 0=no voluntary movement present when supported; 1=intact limb protraction with no ground clearance; 2=intact limb protraction with inconsistent ground clearance; 3=intact limb protraction with consistent ground clearance; 4=ambulatory with moderate paresis/ataxia (will fall occasionally); 5=ambulatory with mild paresis/ataxia (does not fall even on slick surfaces); and 6=normal gait. Proprioceptive placing was scored as 0 when absent, 1 when delayed (correction to normal posture taking>1\u2009sec), and 2 when considered normal.\n\nMeasurement of acute phase proteins\nAll CSF samples were thawed and centrifuged at 10,000\u2009g for 1\u2009min prior to APP measurement. Hp measurement was carried out using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Diagnostics, West Chester, PA). Standard curves were established using the following standards: 125.0, 62.5, 31.2, 15.6, 7.8, 3.9, 1.95, and 0.0\u2009ng/mL. Sample optical density was determined using a microplate reader at 450\u2009nm within 15\u2009min of the completion of the assay.\nCRP measurement was carried out using an ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Diagnostics). Standard curves were established using the following standards: 10.0, 5.0, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, and 0.0\u2009ng/mL. Sample optical density was determined using a microplate reader at 450\u2009nm within 15\u2009min of the completion of the assay.\nSerum amyloid A (SAA) measurement was carried out using an ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Diagnostics). Standard curves were established using the following standards: 1000.0, 500.0, 250.0, 125.0, 62.5, 31.25, and 0.0\u2009ng/mL. Sample optical density was determined using a microplate reader at 450\u2009nm within 5\u2009min of the completion of the assay.\nAlpha-1-glycoprotein measurement was carried out using an ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Diagnostics). Standard curves were established using the following standards: 300.0, 150.0, 75.0, 37.5, 18.8, 9.4, 4.7, and 0.0\u2009ng/mL. Sample optical density was determined using a microplate reader at 450\u2009nm within 15\u2009min of the completion of the assay.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were determined a priori, in consultation with an investigator with expertise in biostatistics (NDC). Baseline population characteristics were summarized using medians and ranges. Acute phase protein concentrations in the CSF of healthy control and SCI dogs were compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to determine relationships between CSF acute phase protein concentration in dogs with SCI and SCI severity at admission as measured by the MFS. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and testing of its statistical significance was used to assess correlation between CSF acute phase protein concentration in dogs with SCI to duration of SCI prior to CSF sampling, cytologic characteristics of CSF, and 42 d post-surgical recovery as measured by TSCIS. Significance was set at <0.05. All analyses were performed using commercially available software (S-PLUS version 8.2; TIBCO software Inc., Seattle, WA)."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nThe study was approved by the Cambridge Local Research Ethics Committee and assent obtained from the next of kin. All TBI subjects were patients in the Neurosciences Critical Care Unit (NCCU) in Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge. Patients were older than 16 years of age with TBI requiring ventilation and intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring. The major exclusion criterion was deranged clotting and/or low platelets, precluding the placement of a microdialysis catheter. None of the TBI patients had any significant previous neurological conditions or a family history of neuro-degenerative disease.\nPatients undergoing a craniotomy for resection of benign brain tumors, enabling microdialysis catheters to be safely placed into radiographically normal brain, were selected as control subjects. The microdialysis catheters were placed via the craniotomy and tunneled under the scalp of the patient. Control patients were awake for the duration of the microdialysis perfusion.\n\nMicrodialysis\nA total of 30 TBI patients were monitored using microdialysis, which was started as soon as possible following admission to the NCCU. Microdialysis catheters (CMA71, 100\u2009kDa molecular weight cut-off respectively, 10-mm membrane; M Dialysis AB, Stockholm, Sweden) were inserted into the cerebral frontal parenchyma of patients, together with an ICP transducer (Codman, Raynham, MA) using a triple-lumen cranial access device (Technicam, Newton Abbot, UK). One of the 30 patients studied received two catheters at different cranial sites. The catheters were perfused with either regular CNS perfusion fluid (NaCl, 147\u2009mM; KCl, 2.7\u2009mM; CaCl\n2\n, 1.2\u2009mM; and MgCl\n2\n, 0.85\u2009mM in water; M Dialysis AB), or CNS perfusion fluid supplemented with 4\u2009mM 1,2-\n13\nC\n2\nglucose (Pharmacy Manufacturing Unit, the Ipswich Hospital NHS Trust, Ipswich, UK). Patients with two catheters were treated with two types of perfusion fluid: one with and one without glucose supplementation. A perfusion flow rate of 0.3\u2009\u03bcL min\n\u22121\nwas provided using a CMA106 pump (M Dialysis AB). Collection vials were changed hourly and analyzed at the bedside for glucose, lactate, pyruvate and glutamate or glycerol, using a CMA600 or ISCUSFlex microdialysis analyzer (M Dialysis AB) using automated enzymatic colorimetric assays as part of routine multimodality monitoring. Microdialysates were then stored at \u221280\u00b0C for subsequent analysis by HPLC to determine amino acids and NAA. Microdialysates from each patient were pooled into either 8\u2009h periods (normal CNS perfusion fluid) or 24\u2009h periods (CNS perfusion fluid supplemented with glucose) for HPLC analysis.\nThe six benign tumor resection patients were monitored using microdialysis, which commenced immediately after surgery was completed. The catheters were perfused with CNS perfusion fluid (as above) supplemented with glucose (as above) at a flow rate of 0.3\u2009\u03bcL min\n\u22121\n. Collection vials were changed hourly and analyzed with the ISCUS at 4-h intervals. Microdialysates were then stored at \u221280\u00b0C for subsequent analysis by HPLC to determine amino acids and NAA. Microdialysates from each patient were pooled into 24\u2009h periods for HPLC analysis.\n\nDetermination of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) by HPLC\nMicrodialysate samples were diluted using the ratio of 5\u2009\u03bcL of microdialysate with 10\u2009\u03bcL of water prior to HPLC analysis on an Agilent 1100 series HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) using an adapted version of methodology published previously.\n29\nThe HPLC system comprised of a binary pump, refrigerated auto-sampler (at 10\u00b0C), and ultraviolet detector (at 210\u2009nm), with a ChemStation data system (Agilent). The column (maintained at 20\u00b0C) was a Phenomenex Hyperclone C18 (150\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009mm, particle size 3\u2009\u03bcm, pore size 100 \u00c5; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA), with a Phenomenex SecurityGuard Luna C18(2) guard cartridge. The mobile phase (0.25\u2009mL min\n\u22121\n) was continuously vacuum-degassed. Using the auto-sampler, each pre-diluted microdialysate sample (2\u2009\u03bcL) was injected onto the HPLC column. Separation was achieved using isocratic elution. Mobile phase consisted of 25\u2009mM potassium phosphate in water, 2.8\u2009mM tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, Dorset, UK), and 1.25% v/v methanol, pH 7.0. The run time was 15\u2009min, and after every four samples, the column was washed with a mobile phase consisting of 100\u2009mM potassium phosphate in water, 2.8\u2009mM tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, and 30% v/v methanol, pH 5.5. Before injection of the next four samples, the column was equilibrated with the original mobile phase for 1\u2009h. Quantitation was by peak areas relative to external standards of NAA (Sigma-Aldrich). NAA typically eluted at 6.6\u2009mins. The limit of quantification of the HPLC method is 1.8\u2009\u03bcM.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using SPSS21 software (IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY) included non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney\nU\n-test). Relationships between eNAA and time after injury or operation, and eNAA and other biomarkers were explored using linear regression, with Spearman's rank correlation coefficient\nr\nand analysis of variance (ANOVA)\np\nvalues. A pre-selected\np\nvalue of 0.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Experiments in this report utilized Swiss-Webster mice bred at Ohio State University (OSU) and derived from breeders purchased from Charles River (Wilmington, MA). Pups were weaned at 21 days of age and housed in standard conditions in groups of 3\u20135 same-sex conspecifics (unless otherwise specified) in a standard mouse cage (32\u2009\u00d7\u200916\u2009\u00d7\u200912\u2009cm). Mice had ad libitum access to food (Harlan-Teklad #8640, Madison, WI) and filtered tap water and housed in a 14:10 light\u2013dark cycle. All procedures were approved by the OSU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were conducted in accordance with National Institute of Health guidelines.\n\nTBI procedure\nA mild closed-head injury was induced using an Impact One device (Leica Biosystems, Richmond, IL). For juvenile mice, 21-day-old mice were secured in a stereotaxic frame and the skull was exposed using aseptic surgical technique. The impactor was placed gently on the surface of the skull (-1 AP, 1-ML relative to bregma) and then the stainless steel impactor tip (round; 2\u2009mm in diameter) was driven into the closed skull to a depth of 1\u2009mm at 3\u2009m/sec (dwell time, 30\u2009msec). This treatment reliably produces mild TBI without skull fracture, hemorrhage, or mortality. The sham procedure was identical except the impactor is lowered into contact with the skull and then retracted. The skin was closed with nylon sutures. Surgeries on 60-day-old adults were identical except that the coordinates were \u22122AP, \u22122ML and the impactor tip was 3\u2009mm in diameter.\n\nAlcohol self-administration\nMice were given daily access to two bottles, one containing water and the other ethanol diluted in water. The ethanol concentration (v/v) was increased every 4 days; mice received 3%, 6%, 10%, and finally 20% ethanol. Fluid intake and body weight were assessed every 2 days. The positions of the bottles were changed every 2 days to control for position preferences. Average ethanol consumption per day was obtained for each ethanol concentration. To obtain a measure of ethanol consumption that corrected for individual differences in mouse size, grams of ethanol consumed per kilogram of body weight per day were calculated for each mouse. As a measure of relative ethanol preference, an ethanol preference ratio was calculated by dividing the total ethanol solution consumed by total fluid (ethanol plus water) consumption. Using the same paradigm, mice also were given access to escalating concentrations of the bitter tastant quinine (0.1\u2009mM and 0.3\u2009mM) and water sweetened with saccharine (1.6\u2009mM and 3.2\u2009mM).\n\nLoss of righting reflex\nMice were injected with 4\u2009g/kg of a 20% ethanol solution intraperitoneally (IP)\n16\nand the latency to the loss of righting reflex was visually recorded. Following loss of righting reflex, mice were placed on their backs in a V-shaped container and return of righting reflex was recorded when the mice could right themselves twice in 1\u2009min.\n\nConditioned place preference\nPlastic chambers measuring 42\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u2009\u00d7\u200918\u2009cm were divided in half by a separator wall. Chambers were designed with different tactile (grid canvas floor of different materials and shape) and visual cues on the walls (thin stripes vs. checkerboard pattern). On Day 1, mice were injected with saline (10mL/kg; IP) and allowed to explore the two sides freely for 5\u2009min in order to habituate to the apparatus and determine side bias. Mice were then assigned to receive alcohol on one of the sides of the chamber in such a manner as to minimize initial side biases. Mice were injected with ethanol (2\u2009g/kg of a 20% ethanol solution IP) on Days 2, 4, 6, and 8 of conditioning and were confined to the assigned side of the chamber for 5\u2009min daily. On Days 3, 5, 7, and 9, mice were placed in the opposite side and injected with saline. On day 10 mice were injected with saline and allowed to freely explore the chambers and the time spent in both the alcohol-conditioned and saline-conditioned sides was recorded. Following conditioned place preference (CPP) testing, mice were returned to their home cages for 4 days and then were injected again with either ethanol (2\u2009g/kg) or saline, and then perfused 2\u2009h later for analysis of immediate early gene expression.\n\nEnvironmental enrichment\nMice were housed in larger rat-sized cages (45\u2009\u00d7\u200925\u2009\u00d7\u200920\u2009cm) 5\u20138 mice/cage with a running wheel, chew toys, Habitrail, extra nestlets, and deeper bedding. Toys and wheels were changed weekly throughout the experiment.\n\nReal-time polymerase chain reaction\nFresh brains were removed, placed in RNAlater RNA storage buffer and then prefrontal cortex from the injured hemisphere was dissected out. RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), reverse transcribed with M-MLV and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conducted with Taqman.\n\nTissue processing\nMice were overdosed with sodium pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde following injury. To assess degeneration of neuronal processes, we performed silver staining using a NeuroSilver Kit (FD Neurotechnologies, Columbia, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sections were cut at 40\u2009\u03bcm on a cryostat, stained with the silver staining kit, mounted on gel covered slides and then coverslipped with permount. C-Fos immunoreactive cells were labeled using an antibody obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (SC-52; Dallas, TX) and visualized with ABC and DAB (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Fluoro-Jade C staining was conducted according to our previously published methods.\n17\n\nMicroscopy\nAxonal degeneration was assessed by qualitatively rating the number and distribution of argyrophilic axonal segments in the corpus callosum and other forebrain white matter tracts by an observer blinded to the experimental conditions. Multiple sections (at least three) were scanned at 10\u00d7 magnification and then regions of degeneration were viewed at 40\u00d7. The degree of staining was then scored on a 4-point scale (0\u2009=\u2009few axonal profiles, 3\u2009=\u2009dense axonal degeneration throughout white matter tracts and the corpus callosum bilaterally).\n17\nC-Fos immunoreactive cells were counted bilaterally following acquisition of z stacks consisting of 10 sets of 4\u2009\u03bcm slices per region. Stacks from the accumbens core and shell, central nucleus of the amygdala, and periaqueductal gray were flattened and cells counted using the Image J cell counter. Cell counts were conducted in defined regions of interest (ROIs) for each region (accumbens, ROI\u2009=\u20090.072\u2009mm\n2\n; amygdala, ROI\u2009=\u20090.04\u2009mm\n2\n; periaqueductal gray, ROI\u2009=\u20090.22\u2009mm\n2\n) and are reported as cells per mm\n2\n. Our analysis did not reveal significant hemisphere differences in c-Fos numbers; therefore, the cell count is averaged across hemispheres for each animal, and the counts are reported as the average across groups. An investigator blinded to experimental conditions performed all analyses.\n\nProtocol (\nFig. 1\n)\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExperimental timeline. Experiment 1 investigated whether juvenile and/or adult TBI altered alcohol self-administration, detection of tastants, or behavioral sensitivity to alcohol in adulthood. Experiment 2 tested whether juvenile injury enhanced the hedonic response to (2\u2009g/kg) alcohol in the conditioned place preference paradigm and the effects of alcohol on immediate early gene expression in adulthood. In Experiment 3, environmental enrichment immediately after juvenile injury was used as a proxy for early intervention, and drinking behavior and injury outcomes were assessed.\nExperiment 1\nThe effect of juvenile and adult TBI on drinking behavior in male and female mice. Male and female mice (\nn\n=\u20098\u201310 per group), underwent a TBI (or sham) procedure at 21 days of age, 60 days of age, or both time-points, resulting in the following groups: TBI/sham (injury only at 21 days), TBI/TBI (injuries at both time-points), sham/TBI (injury only at 60 days), or sham/sham (control). Beginning at the age of 80 days, mice were assessed for alcohol self-administration, followed by tastant detection and loss of righting reflex (LORR) testing.\nExperiment 2\nEffects of early TBI on CPP and immediate early gene expression following alcohol administration. Male and female (\nn\n=\u20097\u20139 per group) mice underwent a single TBI (or sham) procedure at 21 days of age, then all mice received a sham procedure at 60 days and were assessed for alcohol CPP beginning on Day 80. At the end of the experiment, all mice were injected with 2\u2009g/kg ethanol (or saline control) and perfused 2\u2009h later.\nExperiment 3\nEffects of environmental enrichment on drinking behavior and injury outcome. Female mice (\nn\n=\u20096 per group) underwent a TBI (or sham) procedure at 21 days of age and were immediately placed in environmental enrichment (or standard) housing. One cohort was sacrificed 1 week after enrichment for tissue collection for PCR or silver staining, an additional cohort was maintained in enrichment for 6 weeks, then single housed for 1 week before testing for alcohol self-administration.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAlcohol self-administration was analyzed via a four-factor repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). CPP data were analyzed via paired\nt\n-tests. All other animal data were analyzed via ANOVA and all results were considered significant at\np\n\u2264\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "In this study, all the procedures were evaluated and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the Fist Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University in Chongqing, China.\n\nExperimental TBI: CCI\nWild type (WT) C57BL/6J male mice, 10 to 12 weeks old and weighing 18\u201323\u2009g, were used in our experiments. The mice were labeled after removal from the feeding center and randomly divided into different groups (sham injury+saline group, TBI+saline group, and TBI+COG1410 group) using the randomizer of Excel. Subsequent CCI injury was produced on the exposed cortex using a controlled impactor device, TBI-0310 TBI Model system (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, LLC, Fairfax Station, VA), as previously described.\n19\nBriefly, the mice were deeply anesthetized, and a 5-mm right lateral craniotomy centered at 2.7\u2009mm lateral from the midline and 3\u2009mm anterior to the lambda was performed using a motorized drill. The skull was removed without disrupting the dura. The CCI injury was produced using a pneumatic cylinder with a 3-mm diameter flat-tip impounder with an impact velocity of 3\u2009m/sec, a dwell time of 100\u2009msec, and a cortical contusion depth of 1.5\u2009mm. A plastic skull cap was secured over the craniotomy after the injury and the scalp was sutured closed with nylon sutures before the mice recovered from anesthesia. The mice were maintained at 37\u00b0 throughout the duration of the surgery using a rectal temperature probe and feedback temperature controller. The anesthetized mice were placed in an incubator (37\u00b0) until they recovered the ability to ambulate. This procedure produces a moderately severe contusion in the right sensorimotor cortex with pronounced behavioral deficits but virtually no mortality. Sham injury mice underwent the same surgical procedure, including the anesthesia and craniotomy, without the CCI injury.\n\nCOG 1410 synthesis and peptide injections\nThe COG1410 peptide aeetyl-AS-Aib-LRKL-Aib-KRLL-amide, composed of apoE residues 138\u2013149 with aminoiso-butyric acid (Aib) substitutions at positions 140 and 145, was synthesized, purified, and kindly provided by Cognosci (Research Triangle Park, NC). The peptide was dissolved in a sterile 0.9% saline solution immediately prior to use, and the solution was injected into the tail vein at a dose of 1\u2009mg/kg. The peptide was administered immediately after the scalp was sutured closed post-CCI, followed by a once-daily intravenous injection until the day before the mice were sacrificed.\n20\nThe vehicle groups underwent injections of only sterile 0.9% saline at each time-point. The investigator who administered the treatment was different from the investigator who performed the surgeries and a single investigator who was blinded to the injury status and treatment regimens of the animals performed all assessments.\n\nRotarod test\nA rotarod instrument (ZB-200 Rota-Rod Treadmill; Taimeng Software Co. LTD, Chengdu, China) was used to assess vestibulomotor function of mice. The mice underwent three trials at a stationary rotational speed 16\u2009rpm for 1\u2009min on the day prior to CCI (interval of 15\u2009min between trials). Three trials with an accelerating rotational speed were performed 1\u2009h before CCI as described by Hamm and colleagues.\n21\nThe average time to fall from the rotating cylinder in the later three trials was recorded as the baseline latency. The mice underwent three consecutive daily accelerating rotational speed trials on Days 1\u20133 after CCI or sham injury (interval of 15\u2009min). The average latency of falling from the rotarod device was recorded for each mouse.\n\nDetermination of Evans Blue dye extravasation\nEvans Blue (EB) dye (2% weight/volume [w/v] in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) in a volume of 4\u2009mL/kg (50\u2009\u03bcg per gram of body weight) was given via a tail vein injection after CCI and allowed to circulate for 3\u2009h. The mice were sacrificed and transcardially perfused with PBS until colorless PBS came out off the right atrium. The injured hemispheres were removed, and the olfactory bulb and cerebellum were separated, weighed, and homogenized in 2\u2009mL of PBS followed by the addition of 2\u2009mL of 60% trichloroacetic acid (w/v). The homogenates were centrifuged at 18,000\u2009g at 4\u00b0C for 10\u2009min, and absorbance of 200\u2009mL of supernatant at 620\u2009nm was measured using a microplate reader (Elx800; Biotek, Winooski, VT). The optical density (OD) of the EB dye in each sample was recorded, and the results are expressed as OD per gram of brain tissue.\n22\n\nMRI protocol\nAll magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed using a Bruker 7T (70/20) system (BrukerBiospin, Billerica, MA). Pre- and post-CCI mice were anesthetized after the rotarod test using a gas mixture (induction, 5% isoflurane with 1\u2009L/min O\n2\n; maintenance, 1% isoflurane with 1\u2009L/min O\n2\n), and mounted in a Bruker animal bed. The body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C, and the respiratory rate was continuously monitored. T2-weighted images were acquired using RARE (repetition time=4000, echo time=45, RARE factor 8, 0.5\u2009mm, field of view 2.5\u2009cm, 256\u00d7256). The images were analyzed by using Bruker ParaVision 6.0 software. The lesion volumes were determined as pixels with T2 values higher than the mean plus two standard deviations of the value in the homologous contralesional region.\n23\n\nPreparation of brain tissue and protein determination\nTissues from each injured hemispheres were separated after CCI or sham injury, weighed and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue samples from each group were lysed in RIPA Lysis Buffer with a protease inhibitor cocktail (05892791001; Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and homogenized at 4\u00b0C until lysis was complete. Protein was extracted using a Protein Extraction Kit (P0033B; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Shanghai, China). The protein concentration was determined by enhanced BCA protein assay kit (P0010S; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology). Half of the protein was boiled 5\u2009min with buffer for western blotting; the other half of the protein sample was not boiled and was used for gelatin zymography.\n\nGelatin zymography\nThe matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity was examined using gelatin zymography as previously described.\n24\nAn equal amount of protein from each group was loaded and separated in a 10% polyacrylamide gel copolymerized with gelatin (1\u2009mg/mL). The gels were renatured after separation by electrophoresis, and incubated with developing buffer for 40\u2009h at 37\u00b0. Then, the gels were stained with 0.5% Coomassie Blue R-250 for 30\u2009min and destained with 20% ethanol and 10% acetic acid. The MMP-9 activity was quantified using densitometric analyses with the National Institutes of Health Image J software (Image J 1.42q; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland). The results expressed as relative OD.\n\nWestern blotting\nEqual amounts of each protein were processed for electrophoretic separation (SDS-PAGE) and subsequent electrotransfer to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The western blots were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1\u2009h. The membrane was incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with a primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal anti-occludin [1:1,000, sc-5562; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, Texas], rabbit polyclonal anti-claudin-5 [1:1,000, sc-28670; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.], a rabbit polyclonal anti-ZO-1 [1:1,000, sc-10804; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.], mouse monoclonal anti-\u03b2-actin [1:1,000, sc47778; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.]), followed by incubation for 1\u2009h with a secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The bands were revealed using ECL Western Blotting kit (32209; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and photographed by a chemiluminescence imaging system (ChemiDoc XRS+; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).

    "Methods": "CCI\nAdult C57BL6 mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (5% induction, 2% maintenance in medical grade air: 21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen) and placed in a stereotaxic frame on a heating pad to maintain body temperature. A 4-mm diameter craniotomy was produced on the left parietotemporal region of the skull midway between bregma and lambda using a trephine (CMA7431058, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA), rotating the trephine by hand to advance the cutting blade through the skull. The area was cleaned periodically with saline during the procedure to rinse away bone fragments from the injury site. No overt bleeding was observed in the underlying cortex. Isoflurane was stopped 30\u2009sec before CCI.\nA moderate CCI was produced at a velocity of 2.4\u2009m/sec with an impact depth of 1.15\u2009mm, centering the impact at approximately \u22122.5\u2009mm bregma. In a control group (sham), animals underwent craniotomy, placed in the stereotaxic holder, but no CCI was delivered. Anesthesia was reinstated after injury, and the exposed area was sutured closed. After surgical closure, mice were allowed to emerge from anesthesia and placed in a heated cage to wake and recover.\nAt different time points after injury (1, 2, 4, 8, 24\u2009h or 7 days), animals were euthanized and processed for either immunohistochemistry or Western blot analysis. For immunohistochemistry, mice were transcardially perfused with 30\u2009mL of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) and then with 40\u2009mL of ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were harvested, post-fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4\u00b0C, and then cryoprotected in 24% sucrose. For Western blotting, brains were dissected and the hippocampi separated into lesion-side (L-side, experimental injury sample) and contralateral-side (C-side, internal control sample). The tissue was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen within 3\u2009min of extraction for Western blot analysis.\n\nDrug treatments\nMice in four treatment groups were sacrificed at time points specified in parenthesis: 25 rapamycin treated injured (2, 4, 8, and 24\u2009h,\nn\n=\u20094\u20139 mice per time point), 25 vehicle treated injured (2, 4, 8, and 24\u2009h,\nn\n=\u20094\u20139 mice per time point), 25 rapamycin treated sham (2, 4, 8, and 24\u2009h,\nn\n=\u20094\u20138 mice per time point), 24 vehicle treated sham (2, 4, 8, and 24\u2009h,\nn\n=\u20094\u20138 mice per time point). One hour post-CCI or sham, mice were injected intraperitoneally with either rapamycin (Calbiochem\n\u00ae\n) or vehicle (5% polyethylene glycol [PEG], 5% Tween-80 in saline) at a dose of 1\u2009mg/kg of body weight. We selected this dose based on past studies\n13\nand our preliminary dose-response studies. All experiments and animal housing were in accordance with procedures approved by the Animal Care and Use Committees at both University of Pennsylvania and Rutgers University, according to the National and Institutional Guidelines for Animal Care established by the National Institutes of Health.\n\nWestern Blot analysis\nHippocampal tissue was freshly dissected from the L-side and the C-side of the brain after CCI or sham injury, and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer (50\u2009mM Tris pH 7.4, 1% NP40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1\u2009nM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA] supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors). The tissue was homogenized and spun at 4\n0\nC, at 3000\u2009rcf for 5\u20137\u2009min to remove debris, and protein concentration was measured by a standard Bradford assay. Laemmli sample buffer was added to the lysates, and the samples were boiled for 3\u2009min.\nProteins (20\u2009\u03bcg per sample) were separated by SDS-PAGE using 8.0% or 10.0% gels and transferred onto 0.2\u2009\u03bcm nitrocellulose membrane at 4\u00b0C in 20% methanol Tris-Glycine buffer for 2.5\u2009h at a constant 0.5\u2009Amp. Membranes were blocked in 3% milk in TBS-T for 1\u2009h, and incubated in primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C. Membranes were then incubated for 1\u2009h in secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies, and subjected to ECL-Plus Western Blotting Detection System (Pierce/Thermo Fisher, Rockland, IL). Primary antibodies against phospho-ribosomal protein S6 (Ser235/236) (pS6), phospho-Akt (Thr308) (pAktT), total Akt, and S6 were purchased from Cell Signaling, and anti-actin antibody was purchased from Millipore.\nAll phosphorylated protein levels were normalized to the total amount of each protein. Quantification was performed using the band analysis function of Alpha Imager software (Protein Simple). For each condition, samples were analyzed from\nn\n>\u20093 mice, average phosphorylated/total density values were calculated for each protein, and C-side values were set at 1. Statistical significance was calculated comparing L-side to C-side values using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the\npost hoc\nDunnett test. A\np\nvalue of 0.05 or less was considered significant.\n\nImmunofluorescence\nBrains were frozen in a 30% sucrose/Cryo-OCT (optimum cutting temperature medium) compound solution (30:70 mixture; Fisher) and serially sectioned at 30\u201350\u2009\u03bcm on a cryostat. Coronal slices were mounted directly on slides. Slides were thawed at room temperature, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton-X, and blocked in 5% normal goat serum (NGS). Slides were incubated with primary antibody in 5% NGS in 0.1% Triton-X overnight at 4\u00b0C. Slides were then washed in PBS, probed with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1\u2009h at room temperature, and mounted in Vectashield Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). The following antibodies were used: Fluorophore-conjugated AlexaFluor 488-anti-pS6 (Ser235/236) (1:250, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (1:250, Cell Signaling Technology or 1:500, Dako), anti-NeuN (1:100, Millipore), and anti-Iba1 (1:250, Wako).\nMultiple sections from 3-4 mice per treatment were examined at each time point. Representative images were acquired using a Yokogawa CSU-10 spinning disk confocal head attached to an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX50), or an epifluorescence microscope (Olympus BX3-CBH). Positive cell counts were performed manually and in blind. Statistical significance in positive cell number was determined by the Student\nt\ntest when only two datasets were compared, or by ANOVA and the Dunnett\npost hoc\nanalysis for more than two datasets.\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered significant.\n\nFluoro-Jade B staining\nSlides were washed in PBS to remove OCT, then washed in TBS and dried. Dried tissue was serially washed in 1%NaOH and 80% alcohol, 70% alcohol, DI, 0.06% KMnO4, and DI. Slides were incubated in Fluoro-Jade B (FJB) staining solution (4% FJB, Millipore, in acetic acid) for 20\u2009min. Slides were then washed in distilled water, dried, washed in xylene and mounted in DPX (VWR). Representative images were acquired using a Yokogawa CSU-10 spinning disk confocal head attached to an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX50).\nBecause FJB staining did not allow us to distinguish and count individual positive cells, an analysis of the fluorescence intensity was performed using ImageJ. Fluorescence analysis for hippocampal areas, such as dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3, was performed by measuring the integrated density of the cell body layer after subtracting the background (area\u2009\u00d7\u2009mean gray value of adjacent background). Intensity values were normalized to the selected areas to obtain corrected total fluorescence values. Comparison between these values obtained from vehicle- versus rapamycin-treated brains was performed using the Student\nt\ntest.\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered significant.\n\nMorris water maze\nThree days post-injury, spatial learning and memory were tested using the Morris water maze.\n14\nA standard Morris water maze tank configured for mice was used for all assessments. A metal tank, 1\u2009m in diameter, was painted flat black. A removable platform made of clear Plexiglas (10\u2009cm in diameter) was placed in the southeast quadrant of the pool (in accordance with Smith and associates\n14\n). The pool was filled with water (22\u201326\u00b0C) to a level 1\u2009cm above the platform surface. Nontoxic white Prang tempera paint (Prang and Dixon Ticonderoga, Heathrow, FL) was added to the water to mask the platform location and increase the visual contrast between the mouse and background. Visual cues consisted of laminated construction paper of varying shades and shapes taped to the inside walls of the pool, approximately 3 inches above the water line.\nThe start location of the mice was rotated among four directions (North, South, East, and West), and the time for the mouse to reach the platform was recorded. Mice were removed from the pool on climbing onto the platform. Animals that failed to find the platform were assigned a maximum score of 90\u2009sec. Between trials, mice were placed in their home cages under heat lamps and allowed to rest for at least 10\u2009min. For each animal, we used a single block of eight consecutive trials, equally spaced over the 8\u2009h testing period. The average time to the platform (latency) for the last four trials was reported as the average latency to platform. To assess whether CCI or rapamycin caused compounding motor effects, swim speed was measured for vehicle- or rapamycin-treated animals in na\u00efve, sham, and CCI groups. Statistical significance was calculated using ANOVA.\np\nvalue\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered significant.\n\nStatistics for behavioral tests\nAll statistical tests were performed using a commercially available statistical software package (JMP Pro, v. 11, Cary, NC). We used a mixed model to consider the fixed effects (treatment\u2009\u00d7\u2009injury) and the repeated measures (trials) of the experimental design. We used the mixed model structure to evaluate the latency times over consecutive trials in the first half (trials 1\u20134) and second half (trials 5\u20138), consistent with previous work.\n15\nIf the mixed model produced significant differences for the fixed effects measures and/or their interaction across these two trial groups, we then used the Tukey honest significant difference (HSD) testing for\npost hoc\ncomparison."

    "Methods": "One hundred thirty-six adult male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN, USA; 300\u2013350\u2009g) underwent a fluid percussion TBI (n=\u200982) or sham (n=\u200954) injury. Separate groups were used for each of four analyses including baseline recordings (shamn=\u20096, TBIn=\u20097), assessment of stimulation duration (TBIn=\u200911), a stimulation-response evaluation (object exploration task; shamn=\u200919, TBIn=\u200933), and finally the Barnes maze spatial learning task (shamn=\u200929, TBIn=\u200931). Following surgery, animals were exposed to a 12-h light and dark cycle and monitored daily for changes in weight. Investigators were blind to sham versus TBI groups for all experiments. For stimulation studies, investigators were not blind to stimulation conditions during the collection of data. However, investigators were blind to both injury and stimulation conditions during all behavioral and electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis. All experiments were performed in compliance with the UC Davis IACUC protocol.\n\nLateral fluid percussion injury and electrode placement\nAnimals were anesthetized using 4% isoflurane in O\n2\n/N\n2\nO (1:2) carrier gas, and were then intubated and mechanically ventilated with 2% isoflurane to maintain surgical anesthesia. A circular 4.8\u2009mm diameter craniectomy was made in the skull over the right hemisphere, leaving the dura intact, at a position of 3\u2009mm lateral to the midline and midway between lambda and bregma (anterio-posterior [AP] \u223c\u22124.5\u2009mm).\n22\n,\n23\nA rigid plastic injury tube was placed into the craniectomy site, cemented to the skull using methyl methacrylate and cyanoacrylate adhesive and filled with sterile saline. Then a calibrated \u223c0.10\u2009mL pulse of sterile saline was rapidly injected (18\u2009msec) through the injury tube onto the surface of the dura with a pressure of 2.12\u20132.15\u2009atm to produce a moderate TBI in each rat.\n22\nAfter TBI, the intubated rat was then returned to the ventilator with isoflurane at \u223c1% for maintenance during surgical placement of a twisted stainless steel, 0.005 inch diameter, three-channel bipolar electrode (Plastics One MS333-3-B-SPC; Plastics One, Roanoke, VA) spanning the CA3\u2013CA1 dorsal hippocampal fissure with a ground wire wrapped around a surgical screw (AP \u22123.3\u2009mm from bregma, lateral +2.0\u2009mm from midline, 3.6\u2009mm deep to skull; see\nFig. 1A\n). An additional 2\u2009mm craniotomy (\u20130.5\u2009mm AP, 1.0\u2009mm lateral) was made to allow access for implantation of a second chronic indwelling twisted parallel bipolar stimulating electrode into the MSN (\u20136.8\u2009mm depth from the skull surface at 12.8 degrees to avoid the dural sinus).\n\nAcute EEG recordings\nOn post-injury days (PID) 1\u20137, rats (sham\u2009=\u20096, TBI\u2009=\u20097) were placed in an enclosed translucent Plexiglas\n\u00ae\ncage, 25\u2009\u00d7\u200945\u2009\u00d7\u200950\u2009cm for 10\u2009min. An EEG was recorded with a pre-amplifier (Grass model 7P5B; Grass Technologies Inc., Quincy, MA) and polygraph driver amplifier (Grass model 7DAG). Data were collected with a computer acquisition system (Polyview16 v1.1; Astromed, Inc., West Warwick, RI).\n17\nEEG data were collected with a bandwidth ranging from 0.1\u2009Hz to 500\u2009Hz. Continuous video analysis of behavior (Logitech c920; Logitech, Newark, CA) was captured for the duration of the EEG recording. The EEG was analyzed for percentage of total time oscillating in the theta frequency range (6\u201310\u2009Hz), ipsilateral septohippocampal phase coherence, and peak oscillatory frequency.\n\nEEG analysis\n\u201cP_episode\u201d percent time in theta analysis\nUsing an oscillatory detection method, p_episode, we determined the percent of recording time in which the EEG signal included significant oscillations in the 6\u201310\u2009Hz theta frequency range\n11\n,\n24\u201326\non PID 1\u20137. P_episode applies a power threshold, P\nt\n, and a duration threshold, D\nt\n, to determine the percent time in high power of the theta (6\u201310\u2009Hz) frequency. Specifically, a background spectrum is calculated by fitting the observed power values to a \u03c7\n2\ndistribution using linear regression. The 95th percentile of this fit distribution in the theta frequency range was used to establish a power threshold, therefore excluding low power oscillations that may in fact be artifact. As previously published, the duration threshold was set to three cycles.\n27\nThis means that there needed to be three consecutive peaks in the theta range for an oscillation to be detected. Based upon these parameters, the percent of recording time in which the values exceeded both power and duration thresholds was quantified.\nPhase coherence estimation\nTo calculate coherence we used EEGLab\n28\nand custom-written code in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA). Phase coherence was estimated between the MSN and ipsilateral hippocampus in the 6\u201310\u2009Hz frequency range using the pairwise phase consistency (PPC) index\n29\non PID 1\u20137. The PPC index for each electrode pair was estimated by computing the relative phase angle difference between signals on each trial. The cosine was then computed between all pairwise (i.e., between trials) combinations of relative phases, and the PPC was taken as the mean of these cosine values. PPC values range from 0 to 1, with more positive values indicating greater phase coherence. We accounted for potential volume conduction confounds, which may artificially inflate phase coherence estimates, by removing relative phases at 0 degrees (\u00b15 degrees) prior to calculating the PPC index.\n29\nFast Fourier Transform power analysis to assess peak oscillating frequency\nOne of the limitations of p_episode is that the analysis cannot distinguish small frequency differences (\u223c1\u20132\u2009Hz) in oscillations. Therefore, although it is a useful tool to assess theta across the 6\u201310\u2009Hz range, it is not able to detect slight shifts in peak oscillatory frequency. Therefore, we used a power spectral frequency analysis performed with 0.1\u2009Hz intervals to determine if injury caused a change in the peak oscillatory theta frequency on PID 3 and 7.\n\nObject exploration task\nOn PID 5, rats (sham\nn\n=\u200919, TBI\nn\n=\u200933) were habituated to a white circular platform (1.8\u2009m diameter). No objects were present on the platform and the rat was allowed to explore for 5\u2009min. The following day animals were evaluated for object exploration. Two distinct objects, a pump soap dispenser and a soda can, were placed on the platform 68\u2009cm apart. Animals were first brought into the room in an empty cage. They were subsequently connected to the EEG cables for 2\u2009min prior to exposure to the objects on the platform. For the stimulation groups, stimulation was initiated in the second min in the cage, 1\u2009min prior to introduction to the platform. Animals were separated into eight different stimulation groups: sham no stimulation (\nn\n=\u20098), sham 7.7\u2009Hz (80\u2009\u03bcA,\nn\n=\u20095), sham 100\u2009Hz (80\u2009\u03bcA,\nn\n=\u20096), TBI no stimulation (\nn\n=\u200910), TBI 7.7\u2009Hz (20\u2009\u03bcA, n\u2009=\u20095; 80\u2009\u03bcA,\nn\n=\u20096; 200\u2009\u03bcA,\nn\n=\u20095), and TBI 100\u2009Hz (80\u2009\u03bcA,\nn\n=\u20097). Initially, we compared 7.7\u2009Hz stimulation across multiple stimulation amplitudes and identified 80\u2009\u03bcA as the ideal stimulation intensity. Subsequently, we added additional sham stimulation as well as gamma stimulation test groups using the 80\u2009\u03bcA stimulation intensity (with additional sham and TBI controls). The animals were placed on the platform equidistant between the two objects and behavior and EEG were observed for 5\u2009min. Behavior was analyzed both for time interacting with objects as well as total distance traveled.\n\nBarnes maze\nThe Barnes maze was performed as previously described by our lab.\n18\nTwo trials per day were conducted with a 5-min inter-session interval on post-operative days 5\u20137. Six groups were evaluated on the Barnes maze including sham (\nn\n=\u200914) and sham with 7.7 (\nn\n=\u20098) or 100\u2009Hz (\nn\n=\u20097) stimulation, TBI (\nn\n=\u200915), and TBI with 7.7 (\nn\n=\u20098) or 100\u2009Hz (\nn\n=\u20098) stimulation. All stimulation during the Barnes maze was at 80\u2009\u03bcA. At the start of each trial, animals were placed in the center of the Barnes maze apparatus under a dark box for 1\u2009min. For animals in the stimulation groups, stimulation was initiated immediately prior to being placed in the box. After 1\u2009min, the box was lifted and the animal was given 5\u2009min to find a hidden escape box using four distinct spatial cues. If the animal did not find the escape box after 5\u2009min, it was guided to it. During each trial, video-EEG was concurrently recorded. Latency to finding the escape hole and search strategies were analyzed for each trial. Search strategies were categorized as spatial, peripheral, and random. The spatial strategy was defined as the rat moving directly toward the escape hole, whereas the peripheral strategy indicated that the rodent follows the edge of the circular platform until it reached the escape hole. The random strategy was defined as a rat searching non-consecutive holes before reaching the escape hole.\n\nStimulation paradigm\nThe electrode in the MSN was connected to an isolated pulse stimulator (model 2100; A-M Systems, Sequim, WA), and electrical stimulation was delivered using the following stimulation parameters: 1\u2009msec square wave pulses at a frequency of 7.7 or 100\u2009Hz. To assess the effects of stimulus duration animals received 15, 30, or 60\u2009sec of 80\u2009\u03bcA stimulation. For the object exploration task, stimulation was initiated 1\u2009min prior to animals being introduced to the behavioral apparatus and was terminated 6\u2009min later immediately prior to returning animals to their home cages. Animals were stimulated at 7.7 (20, 80, or 200\u2009\u03bcA) or 100\u2009Hz (80\u2009\u03bcA). For the Barnes maze task, 80\u2009\u03bcA at 7.7 or 100\u2009Hz stimulation was initiated 1\u2009min prior to the first trial of each day. Stimulation was terminated at the completion of the second daily trial, immediately prior to returning the rat to its home cage.\n\nStimulation duration\nA total of 11 rats receiving TBI were used to evaluate the effect of stimulus duration. On PID 3, animals were habituated to an opaque Plexiglas box (1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20090.5\u2009m). Habituation included two 5-min periods of exploring the empty box separated by 3\u2009h. On PID 4 and 5, rats each received four 17-min trials, two per day, with each daily trial separated by 3\u2009h. Animals were put in a start cage for 2\u2009min. Animals received no stimulation or 15, 30, or 60\u2009sec of stimulation immediately prior to being transferred to the Plexiglas box. Animals were randomized to stimulation condition with each animal exposed to each condition once over the four trials. For each trial, there were four objects in the box. On the first trial, they were four novel objects. For each subsequent trial, two novel objects were introduced in the place of the familiar objects. The two remaining familiar objects were moved to novel positions within the box. Objects included a plastic lemon, a plastic lime, three different sized (height and width) cans, a pump soap dispenser, and four different-shaped dog chew toys. The EEG was analyzed for percent of time oscillating in the theta frequency range during stimulation as well as percent of time oscillating in theta and septohippocampal phase coherence over the first 5\u2009min following stimulation. A post hoc analysis confirmed that there was no effect of cumulative stimulation or repeated behavioral trials as data within a stimulation condition were similar regardless of trial number.\n\nHistology\nRats were euthanized 15\u201320 days after injury by deep anesthesia and transcardial perfusion with 100\u2009mL of 0.1\u2009M sodium phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH 7.4) followed by 50\u2009mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4). Brains were extracted, stored overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4\n\u00b0\nC, and subsequently placed in sucrose immersion for cryoprotection. Coronal sections were cut at 45\u2009\u03bcm thicknesses using a sliding microtome (model 860, American Optical, Buffalo, NY). Serial sections starting at bregma and ending at \u22124.80\u2009mm relative to bregma were saved in 24-well cell culture plates for histological staining. Sections in the vicinity of electrodes were mounted onto 0.1% gelatin-subbed slides, stained with cresyl violet to identify precise electrode placement.\n\nStatistical analysis\nSPSS statistics version 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) was utilized for all statistical evaluation. A paired-samples\nt\ntest was used to compare percent time of theta oscillations at baseline relative to during stimulation. A repeat measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was utilized to compare 1) daily percentage of time in theta recordings, 2) daily MSN-hippocampal coherence, 3) effect of stimulation on post-stimulation percent time and coherence of theta, and 4) Barnes maze latency. A Dunnett post hoc analysis was used to compare individual groups. A one-way ANOVA was utilized to compare 1) differences in peak oscillatory frequency, 2) differences among 15, 30, and 60\u2009sec of stimulation, 3) object exploration times, and 4) total distance traveled during object exploration. Dunnett post hoc analysis was used to compare individual groups. A nonparametric binomial analysis was used to compare differences in search strategy, random as compared with spatial+peripheral, and among groups on the Barnes maze. Performance of sham animals was used as the \u201ctest proportion.\u201d Statistical significance was assigned to values p\u2009<\u20090.05. All data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009the standard error of the mean."

    "Methods": "Animals\nMale C57BL6 mice aged 2 months old were used for this experiment. The mice were kept in our animal facility on a 12-hour light/dark cycle, with food and water supplied\nad libitum\n. All procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institutional Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals at Indiana University School of Medicine.\n\nControlled cortical impact model of TBI\nThe mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal ketamine/xylazine (87.7/12.3\u2009mg/kg) and were fixed on a stereotaxic apparatus. After a midline incision on the scalp, a \u223c4\u2009mm craniotomy was performed above the left hemisphere of the brain, with the center being between the lambda and bregma sutures of the skull and the medial edge being 1\u2009mm from the midline. An Impact One\u2122 stereotaxic impactor (Leica Microsystems Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL) with a 3-mm diameter rod tip was used to compress the cortex at a velocity of 3.0\u2009m/sec to a depth of 1.0\u2009mm. This setting allowed us to generate moderate TBI of the brain. A small piece of sterile plastic film was used to cover the burr hole, and the scalp was sutured. The mice in the sham group received only the craniotomy without cortical impact.\nBecause TBI-induced brain edema may increase cortical thickness, we also measured changes in cortical thickness in 12 mice (2 in each group). The mice were sacrificed after sham injury or at 1\u20134\u2009h, 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, and 14 days after CCI, respectively. Fresh coronal slices across the level of the recording site were cut immediately with a vibratome and imaged using a digital CCD camera (\nFig. 1D\u2013F\n). Thicknesses of the ipsilateral and contralateral cortex were measured and the percentage of cortical swelling was calculated by dividing the ipsilateral cortical thickness by contralateral cortical thickness.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nIn vivo\nsingle-unit recording from control and injured primary motor cortex in mice.

The mouse brain image was created with Allen Mouse Brain Atlas using Brain Explorer\n\u00ae\n2 (Website: \u00a92014 Allen Institute for Brain Science. Allen Mouse Brain Atlas:\nhttp://mouse.brain-map.org/\n). Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\n\nSingle-unit recording\nExtracellular single-unit recordings were made from the primary motor cortex of the mice within 1\u20134\u2009h, or at 1, 3, 7, or 14 days after CCI. Before the recording, the animal was anesthetized with intraperitoneal ketamine/xylazine (87.7/12.3\u2009mg/kg)\n29\nand placed in a stereotaxic apparatus with a heating patch under its body to keep it warm. A 1.5\u20132\u2009mm diameter hole was drilled on the skull for inserting a recording electrode. The hole was located 1-mm lateral to the midline and 1\u20132\u2009mm from the anterior edge of the cranial window that had been used to create for CCI (\nFig. 1A\n). Recording electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass tubing (impedance of 8\u201312\u2009M\u03a9) and filled with 2\u2009M NaCl solution. The recording electrode was mounted on a motorized micromanipulator (PatchStar, Scientifica, UK), which was calibrated and controlled by software.\nThe position and orientation of the mouse head was carefully adjusted so that the cortical surface of the recorded hemisphere was perpendicular to the recording electrode. The recording electrode was then vertically lowered through the dura into the neocortex. Under continuous monitoring of spontaneous activity, the pipette was firstly inserted to \u223c400\u2009\u03bcm below the pial surface and then slowly advanced at 5\u2009\u03bcm until a single-unit activity was clearly detected and remained stable. After a 3\u20135\u2009min waiting period for the spontaneous firing to become stable, recordings were made and lasted for 10\u201315\u2009min. During each recording session, the exposed cortex was covered by a small piece of saline cotton to keep the tissue from drying.\nBecause the level of anesthesia affects the rate of spontaneous firing, it is important that\nin vivo\nrecordings were made when the animals were in a stable state of anesthesia. To determine the duration and depth of anesthesia after ketamine/xylazine injection, we monitored mouse response to tail pinch, heart rate, blood pressure, and electroencephalography (EEG) in four control mice. We found that the mice maintained a stable blood pressure and EEG frequency patterns for 25\u201330\u2009min after initial or supplemental (at \u00bd dosage) injection of ketamine/xylazine. Their responsiveness to tail pinch was closely correlated with increase in blood pressure, suggesting that the mice were awakening from the anesthesia state.\nThese observations were consistent with previous studies showing that ketamine-induced anesthesia lasted for about 30\u2009min, during which stable EEG patterns are maintained and cortical neurons have depressed but constant firing activity.\n30\n,\n31\nTherefore, our recordings were made in a time window between 5\u201325\u2009min after initial or supplemental drug injection, during which the response to tail pinch and breath rate were monitored.\nSignals were filtered (\u223c10\u2009kHz) and recorded with MultiClamp 700B (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and were saved in a computer. At the end of the experiment, the mice were sacrificed with a lethal injection of sodium pentobarbital.\n\nHistological verification of recording sites\nWe used the depths of pipette penetration driven by the micromanipulator to measure the depths of the recorded neurons and their laminar location in the cortex.\n32\n,\n33\nThis approach allowed us to efficiently record multiple neurons from a mouse, but there might be a deviation between the anatomical location of a recorded neuron and the penetration depth of the recording electrode. To correct this error, we compared the anatomical locations of pipette tips marked by electrocoagulation and the depth of pipette penetration in a subset of recorded mice (\nn\n=\u200910).\nAfter a glass micropipette was lowered into the cortex, the depth of penetration relative to the pial surface was recorded, and a recording was made. A single current (600\u2009\u03bcA, 200\u2009\u03bcs) was applied with an isolated pulse stimulator (Model 2100, A-M systems, Sequim, WA) through the pipette. Animals were then sacrificed, and the brains were removed. The cortical regions containing the recording sites were sectioned at a thickness of 200\u2009\u03bcm using a vibratome (Leica VT1200, Leica Biosystems, Richmond, IL). The unfixed brain slices were immediately observed under a microscope (Zeiss Axio Imager M2), and images were captured using a digital CCD camera.\n\nNissl staining\nMice receiving CCI or sham injury were deeply anesthetized and then were perfused transcardially with 0.9% NaCl followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were removed, postfixed overnight, and transferred to a 30% sucrose solution until they sank. The brains were sectioned at 30\u2009\u03bcm using the Leica CM1950 cryostat. The sections were rehydrated in 0.01\u2009M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) for 40\u2009min, followed by washing in PBS plus 0.1% Triton\n\u00ae\nX-100 for 10\u2009min. After two washes in PBS, the sections were then incubated with NeuroTrace solution (1:200 in PBS, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) for 20\u2009min at room temperature. After several washes at room temperature, the sections were mounted with FluoroGel mounting medium (GeneTex, Irvine, CA) and were imaged with an inverted microscope system (Zeiss, Axiovert 200M equipped with Apotome).\n\nData analysis\nSingle units were automatically detected based on rise time, amplitude, and duration of the events using Wdetecta software.\n27\nThe detecting parameters were manually adjusted for each recording trace to ensure correct detection of all single units. By overlaying individual spikes at the beginning, the middle, and the end of each trace, we confirmed that the waveform of each single unit was generally constant during the recording period (\nFig. 3A,B\ninserts). Recordings with increasing spike width during the recording period were excluded from the data analysis. Based on published studies, pyramidal neurons were identified using the following criteria: (1) the mean firing frequency of the spike was lower than 10\u2009Hz; (2) the spike width was longer than 660\u2009\u03bcs.\n34\n,\n35\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nSingle-unit recordings from layer V pyramidal neurons of the sham and injured neocortex\nin vivo\n.

In the 10-min recording periods, the time bins in each frequency histogram are 10\u2009sec wide. Note the dramatic decrease in firing rates in a neuron within 1\u20134\u2009h after CCI and increases in firing rate in neurons at 3 and 14 days after CCI. The inserts in A and B show representative traces of single-unit activity at the beginning, middle, and end of recording; the waveforms of each single-unit activity were consistent throughout the recording period.\nStatistical analyses of spike frequency were performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software. Data were presented as mean\u2009\u00b1standard error of the mean. Statistical comparisons of cortical depth and firing frequency among all groups were made using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test. Distribution of fractions of events with different interspike intervals (ISI) among all groups was analyzed with two-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni\npost hoc\ntest. The percent of events with ISI \u226410\u2009msec was compared with the Mann-Whitney\nU\ntest. The statistical significance was set at\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Study design\nWe performed a propensity score-matched cohort study using patient data that were prospectively collected in RHSCIR. RHSCIR is an ongoing multi-center observational study of patients with acute TSCIs who are admitted to major trauma centers and accompanying rehabilitation centers in Canada.\n32\nThere are currently 31 participating study sites in the RHSCIR network, which are located across 16 cities from 9 out of 10 Canadian provinces. This article's primary objective was specified\na priori\nduring the development of RHSCIR, along with several other research objectives.\n32\nEach participating site obtained local Research Ethics Board or Institutional Review Board approval prior to enrolling patients and collecting data.\n\nParticipants\nPatients were eligible for this study if they were 18 years of age or older and they presented to a participating site following an acute TSCI. Patients with non-traumatic etiologies of SCI such as infection, neoplasm, iatrogenic, or acute vascular causes were ineligible, but no exclusions were made on the basis of age, sex, medical co-morbidities, associated injuries, or planned treatment. According to the RHSCIR protocol, approximately 265 data elements were collected during participants' pre-hospital, acute, and rehabilitation phases of care. Further descriptions of the RHSCIR data elements, procedures, governance structure, and patient privacy and confidentiality framework are available elsewhere.\n3\n,\n32\n,\n33\nWe used the RHSCIR database to identify all patients from May 2004 to March 2014 who received either the NASCIS-II regimen of methylprednisolone started within 8\u2009h of their acute injury or no steroid treatment. Patients who received regimens of methylprednisolone other than NASCIS-II, patients who received steroids other than methylprednisolone, and patients whose steroid status was indeterminate were excluded. Patients who received the NASCIS-II regimen followed by an additional 24\u2009h of methylprednisolone were included.\n15\nThe indications for NASCIS-II methylprednisolone were not standardized across the participating sites, and patients could have received NASCIS-II methylprednisolone at RHSCIR acute care sites or at non-participating community hospitals prior to being transferred to an RHSCIR acute care site.\n\nData sources\nMotor function scores were measured by trained physicians, nurse practitioners, or physiotherapists according to the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI).\n34\nISNCSCI total motor scores (TMS) can range from 0 (absent motor function) to 100 (intact motor function) and comprise component upper extremity motor scores (UEMS; range 0\u201350), and lower extremity motor scores (LEMS; range 0\u201350). We considered patients' baseline motor scores to be those obtained on their admission to acute care and we considered patients' final motor scores to be those obtained at the time of their discharge to the community from acute care or inpatient rehabilitation.\n31\nEach ISNCSCI record was processed through a customized electronic algorithm that maintained consistency and high quality.\n32\nWe also retrieved the following variables from the RHSCIR database for each patient: age, sex, Body Mass Index, Glasgow Coma Scale and Injury Severity Score at admission, injury mechanism, Charlson Comorbidity Index,\n35\nwhether or not patients underwent surgery, and RHSCIR study site. These data elements were collected by trained research personnel and entered into standardized local RHSCIR databases before being exported to the RHSCIR national office for centralized quality checks.\n32\nMissing or ambiguous data were reconciled with local research coordinators, hospital health records, and medical chart abstraction whenever possible.\nWe collected rates of in-hospital mortality, urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonias, decubitus ulcers, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, surgical site infections, and sepsis using\nInternational Classification of Diseases\n, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes from the Canadian Institute for Health Information's Discharge Abstract Database.\n36\n\nStatistical analysis\nWe used 1:1 propensity score matching based on logistic regression to match patients who received NASCIS-II methylprednisolone with controls who received no steroid treatment. To control for potential confounding, we matched according to varying neurological level of injury (cervical: C1\u2013T1, or thoracic: T2\u2013L3) and baseline severity of neurological impairments (ISNCSCI ASIA Impairment Scale A, B, C, or D), as well as age, sex, and time from injury to first neurological examination (<72\u2009h, 72\u2009h to one week, greater than one week, or unknown).\n3\n,\n37\u201339\nJitter plots and propensity histograms were used to verify the distribution of propensity scores in each group. Sensitivity analysis were performed to control for any residual imbalance by (i) comparing the matched groups while adjusting for the matched variables using negative binomial regression; and (ii) comparing the NASCIS-II methylprednisolone group against the full cohort of unmatched potential controls while adjusting for the same variables and RHSCIR site using negative binomial regression.\n40\nGoodness of fit was confirmed using the Akaike information criterion and the Bayesian information criterion.\nDiscrete variables are reported as counts or proportions, normally distributed continuous variables as means with standard deviations (SD), and skewed continuous variables as medians with interquartile ranges (IQR). We used parametric tests for data with normal distributions and non-parametric tests for data without normal distributions.\n3\n,\n31\nWe compared unmatched groups with the independent samples\nt\ntest using Levene's test to assess the equality of variance or the Mann-Whitney U test, and matched groups with the paired\nt\ntest or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. We used Pearson's \u03c7\n2\nor Fisher's exact test for categorical data depending upon the number of the sample in each cell. Direct correlations were evaluated using Pearson's correlation coefficient.\nParticipants with missing data were excluded from each analysis and imputations were not performed.\n18\n,\n41\nExtreme outliers were removed from each group when comparing lengths of stay. All tests of significance were two-tailed and\np\nvalues of less than 0.05 were considered significant. All analyses were performed using R 3.1 (CRAN: the Comprehensive R Archive Network at\nhttp://cran.r-project.org/\n), Excel 2011 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA), and IBM SPSS Version 22, 2012 (SPSS Inc., Chicago IL)."

    "Methods": "Our hypothesis was that functional brain-to-spinal cord connectivity in completely paralyzed individuals could be facilitated with electrical and/or pharmacological neuromodulation when presented concomitantly with training of the neural networks that control stepping-like movements. To assess the effectiveness of these interventions, we conducted a series of weekly training-testing sessions over a period of \u223c18 weeks (Fig. 1). The subjects were tested while lying on their left side with the upper leg supported directly in the area of the shank and the lower leg placed on a rotating brace attached to a horizontal board supported by vertical ropes secured to the ceiling as described previously.7,10By using this supportive device, the subject's legs were placed in a gravity-neutral position. Transcutaneous electrical stimulation was delivered using a 2.5\u2009cm round electrode (Axelgaard, Fallbrook, CA) placed midline on the skin between spinous processes T11 and T12 (simply T11) or over coccyx 1 (Co1) as a cathode and two 5.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910.2\u2009cm2rectangular plates (Axelgaard, Fallbrook, CA) placed symmetrically on the skin over the iliac crests as anodes. The cathode electrode was manually placed on the skin with a constant pressure to maintain consistent conductive contact to generate the most robust oscillatory movement of the lower extremity. For electrical stimulation we used monopolar rectangular stimuli (1\u2009msec duration) filled with a carrier frequency of 10\u2009kHz and at an intensity ranging from 80 to 180\u2009mA (30\u2009Hz at T11 and 5\u2009Hz at Co1). The intensity of stimulation selected was adjusted to effect in each subject to induce stepping-like movements.\n\nEach session from Pre-Train (t1) to Post-Train (t2) consisted of stimulation at the level of T11, Co1, and the combination of the two sites with and without simultaneous voluntary effort to move the lower limb in a stepping-like motion (Fig 1). In addition, each session consisted of passively oscillating the limbs in a step-like fashion for 3\u2009min without and 3\u2009min with continuous stimulation at each of the three stimulation sites noted above. These passive oscillations are referred to as \u201cconditioning\u201d (see details below). From Post-Train (t2) to Pre-Drug (t3) the same procedures were followed, but without the conditioning oscillation with stimulation at both sites simultaneously. This reduced level of oscillations was designed to maintain and sustain a plateau performance prior to the initiation of the drug phase of the intervention. Over the 18-week period we performed four detailed recording-assessment sessions (t1\u2013t4;Fig. 1A) reflecting the quality of the stepping-like motions. In the first 4 weeks Subjects 1\u20134 (S1\u2013S4) performed all four training-testing sessions, whereas Subject 5 (S5) performed only two training-testing sessions at 3 and 4 weeks. To determine the effects of pharmacological enabling motor control plus painless cutaneous enabling motor control the subjects were trained once per week over a period of 4 weeks (t3\u2013t4). To determine the potential for generating locomotor-like stepping all training and periodic testing (t1\u2013t4) were performed in an apparatus designed to minimize gravitational effects (Fig. 2A).7,10\n\nAngular displacements at the hip and knee joints in both legs were recorded with goniometers (Biometrics Ltd., Ladysmith, VA). The subjects had access to visual feedback via a mirror placed so that movement of the legs could be observed. Bipolar surface electrodes were placed bilaterally on the soleus, medial gastrocnemius (MG), tibialis anterior (TA), medial hamstring (HM), and vastus lateralis (VL) muscles.11,12Electromyogram (EMG) signals were amplified (Konigsberg Instruments, Pasadena, CA) differentially (bandwidth of 10\u2009Hz to 10\u2009kHz) and acquired at 10\u2009KHz using a 16-channel hard-wired A/D board and customized LabVIEW software (National Instruments, Austin, TX). To minimize artifacts from the stimulation, the EMG signals were passed through a band-pass filter (30\u2013200\u2009Hz). The filtered EMG signals were analyzed off-line to compute the amplitude, duration, and timing of individual bursts.\n\nThe conditioning treatment consisted of imposing passive, continuous, anterior-posterior limb movements in an oscillatory stepping-like pattern (\u223c20 cycles/min) for 3\u2009min without stimulation, followed by 3\u2009min with sub-motor threshold stimulation either at T11, Co1, or T11+Co1 with the subject's legs supported in the gravity-neutral apparatus. The total time for each testing or training session was \u223c45\u2009min. We also tested whether the conditioning treatment alone within a single training session could facilitate the ability to generate knee oscillations without and with stimulation at the end of the study (t4inFig. 1).\n\nFor the final 4 weeks of the study all subjects were informed that they would receive either a placebo or the serotoninergic agonist buspirone. All subjects were given buspirone 7.5\u2009mg orally twice daily for the last 4 weeks (t3\u2013t4) (Fig. 1B).\n\nThe University of California, Los Angeles Institutional Review Board approved all procedures. Subjects were enrolled based on the enrollment criteria of traumatic cervical or thoracic injury, AIS B, greater than one year from injury, and stable motor function as documented by sequential clinical exams. All subjects signed voluntary written consent forms to participate in these studies. The clinical profiles of the subjects upon enrollment into this study are as follows: S1 is a 42-year-old male who suffered a T3\u2013T4 spinal cord injury (SCI) after a steer wrestling accident and was 24 months from initial injury; S2 is a 20-year-old male who suffered a C5\u2013C6 SCI sustained during a football game and was 36 months from initial injury; S3 is a 20-year-old male who suffered a C6 SCI after a motor vehicle accident and was 36 months from initial injury; S4 is a 19-year-old male who suffered a C7 SCI during a swimming accident and was 24 months from injury; and S5 is a 56-year-old male who suffered a T3\u2013T4 SCI after a bicycle accident and was 72 months from injury. Magnetic resonance imaging was obtained in all subjects to confirm the location and extent of the injury (Supplementary Fig. 1; see online supplementary material athttp://www.liebertpub.com).\n\nThe ability to facilitate voluntarily generated locomotor-like movements during spinal cord painless cutaneous enabling motor control when the legs were placed in a gravity-neutral position was determined. After instructing each subject to oscillate the limbs as if stepping, we asked the subject to relax for a period of 15\u201320\u2009sec before we initiated stimulation with the cathode at the T11 and/or Co1 vertebral level. Then, we asked the subjects to attempt to voluntarily oscillate the legs in the presence of stimulation at T11, Co1, or T11+Co1 (Fig 1B).\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistics were performed in SPSS version 19 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) with base, regression, advanced models, and categories packages. Several parameters were studied to thoroughly characterize the recovery of sensorimotor function. Such high dimensionality substantially complicates the extraction of relevant parameters to account for differences between experimental conditions. Reduction of such multi-dimensional datasets, however, can be achieved via multivariate statistical analysis such as principal component analysis (PCA).\n13\n,\n14\nPCA is mathematically defined as an orthogonal linear transformation that transforms the original dataset to a new coordinate system, such that the variance is maximized on each new coordinate axis. Non-linear PCA (NL-PCA) was implemented using the CATPCA command with appropriate link functions to accommodate non-linear and non-normal distributional features for each variable.\n15\nHerein, data were analyzed using the correlation method, which adjusts the mean of the data to 0 and the standard deviation to 1. The degree of similarities and differences, that is, the criteria of success of an intervention, between the subjects and conditions were evaluated as the difference in the factor coordinates of each observation (scores) on each PC axis. PC (object) scores were extracted across all end-points, subjects, and levels of the repeated measures. PC retention was determined by the eigenvalue >1 rule,\n16\nand the face validity of PC loading patterns. PC1 scores then were carried forward as the principal outcomes for assessing the impact of the experimental manipulations by three-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) (GLM command), with each subject serving as his own control. Significant interactions were followed up by interaction graphing with assessment of specific differences by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's\npost hoc\n. Significance was assessed at\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Participants\nA targeted sample of male collegiate athletes (\nn\n=\u200949) from a single National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I American rules football program and non\u2013football athletes/non-athletes without a history of self-reported concussion or football experience (\nn\n=\u200927; HC) were recruited for this study. All individuals reported no past or current history of mood disorders, anxiety disorders, alcohol abuse, or substance abuse. All participants provided written informed consent approved by local institutional review boards. Participant interviews based on retrospective recall were used to establish concussion history, defined as concussions that were medically diagnosed by a clinician at the time of injury, as well as the number of years of tackle football experience. Twenty-four football athletes self-reported no clinically diagnosed concussions (Ath). Twenty-five current or former football athletes self-reported at least one clinician-diagnosed concussion (Ath-mTBI). This group included one track-and-field athlete with extensive football experience (nine years), including experience at the collegiate level. All football athletes with a history of concussion were currently cleared for competition (i.e., no residual concussion symptoms) at the time of scan by clinicians trained in sports medicine.\n\nBehavioral assessment\nA common concussion behavioral battery was used to aid in interpretation of any potential neuroanatomical differences. Specifically, the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics 4 Sports Medicine Battery (ANAM)\n23\nwas administered to a subset of football athletes (37/49) and control participants (22/27) in a confidential research setting. Behavioral data was only available in this subset because behavioral data collection began at a later stage than neuroimaging data collection. The ANAM is an automated, computerized assessment of self-reported concussion symptoms, mood scales, and cognitive tests.\n23\nConstruct validity and test\u2013retest reliability for ANAM measures can be found elsewhere.\n24\n,\n25\nThroughput, which is the number of correct responses per minute, was used to measure performance on each cognitive task.\n26\nD\u2032,\na measure of signal detection, was used for the go-no-go task. Task scores were standardized relative to a normative sample of male collegiate athletes available as part of the ANAM software. Raw scores were used for the go-no-go and mathematical processing task as the normative group does not include scores for these tests. The standardized throughput score from the two simple reaction time tests were averaged and used as a single measure.\nSeveral steps were taken to ensure data quality. Three athletes with a history of concussion responded with zeros for all self-reported symptom and mood scales, including positive symptoms, indicating low effort. As a result, self-reported scores for these participants were excluded from further analyses. The ANAM Validity Indicator Report was used to exclude participants with questionable effort on the cognitive battery and individual subtests with suboptimal performance indicative of poor effort or misunderstanding of subset instructions.\n27\n\nImaging parameters\nMRI was performed using a GE Discovery MR750 3-Tesla whole body MRI scanner (General Electric Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) and brain-dedicated receive-only 32-element coil array optimized for parallel imaging (Nova Medical, Inc., Wilmington, MA). T1-weighted anatomical images were collected using a parallelized magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence with sensitivity encoding (field of view [FOV]\u2009=\u2009240\u2009mm; 130 axial slices; slice thickness\u2009=\u20091.1\u2009mm; image matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256; repetition time [TR]/echo time [TE]\u2009=\u20095/1.948\u2009msec; acceleration factor R\u2009=\u20092 in the phase encoding direction; flip angle\u2009=\u20098\u00b0; inversion time\u2009=\u2009725\u2009msec; sampling bandwidth\u2009=\u200931.25\u2009kHz; voxel size\u2009=\u20090.9375\u2009\u00d7\u20090.9375\u2009\u00d71.1\u2009mm). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed in a subset of football athletes (46/49) and control participants (22/27) with the following parameters: 30 non-collinear directions; b-value\u2009=1000\u2009sec/mm\n2\n; TR\u2009=\u20098800\u2009msec; TE\u2009=\u2009minimum; acquisition matrix\u2009=\u200996\u2009\u00d7\u200996 interpolated to 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256; FOV\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256\u2009mm; slice thickness\u2009=\u20092\u2009mm; inter-slice spacing 0.2\u2009mm; slices\u2009=\u200969; acceleration factor R\u2009=\u20092 in the phase encoding direction; and original voxel size 2.7\u2009\u00d7\u20092.7\u2009\u00d7\u20092.2\u2009mm.\n\nDTI processing\nDTI analyses were performed in the Analysis of Functional NeuroImages analysis suite.\n28\nGradients images were co-registered to the b0 volume using a 12-parameter affine alignment to correct for subject motion and eddy currents, with resultant rotational parameters also applied to the gradient table. Similar to previous publications,\n29\na 3.5\u2009mm Gaussian full-width at half-maximum smoothing kernel was applied to each gradient to reduce Gibb's ringing artifact. A non-linear algorithm was used to calculate the diffusion tensors, followed by scalar measures of axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and FA. Separate 12-parameter affine alignments were used to register each participant's b0 volume to their anatomical T1 image in native space and the native T1 anatomical image to the N27 brain template in Talairach space.\n30\nThese alignment matrices were subsequently concatenated to create a single transformation matrix for each participant.\nRegion of interest (ROI) analyses were conducted to examine a priori white matter tracts defined from the Johns Hopkins University white matter atlas.\n31\nSelected a priori ROIs included the genu, body, and splenium of the corpus callosum, as well as the left and right anterior corona radiata, superior corona radiata, combined anterior and posterior internal capsule, and the cingulum of hippocampus. ROIs were subsequently transformed to each participant's native b0 image using the inverse of the transformation matrix. The intersection between each ROI and a binary FA map (FA\u2009>\u20090.25) created for each participant was calculated to restrict analyses to white matter only.\n\nDTI quality assurance\nA previously described binary classification scheme was used to flag individual gradients with excessive motion or other artifacts.\n32\nOne participant with six flagged gradients was excluded from DTI analyses. No other participant had more than three flagged gradients. Head motion during DTI scan acquisition was calculated as the Euclidean norm of the temporal derivatives of the translational and rotational head motion estimated using a six-parameter affine registration of gradient images to each participant's b0 image.\n33\n\nCortical thickness estimation\nCortical reconstruction and volume segmentation was performed using the FreeSurfer image analysis suite version 5.1.\n34\n,\n35\nThe result from each step was inspected for every subject as part of a quality assurance protocol, and corrections were made when necessary. Cortical thickness was measured as the distance between the gray\u2013white matter boundary and the pial surface at each point of the cortical surface.\n36\nParticipant's cortical thickness estimates were resampled to an averaged surface template and smoothed with a 20\u2009mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel. Kernel size was determined using previously published algorithms to maximize power based on estimated effect sizes and our sample numbers, which indicated a smoothing kernel of 20\u2009mm was required for an effect size of 0.3 with 25 participants in each group.\n37\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses except for the analysis of cortical thickness were conducted in the Systat Software, version 13 (Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA). One-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) were performed to determine if age and education differed between groups. For DTI quality assessment, the null hypothesis for group differences in the number of flagged diffusion gradients was evaluated with Mann-Whitney tests due to expected violations of normality. Differences in head motion were evaluated with ANOVA.\nMultivariate analyses of covariance (MANCOVAs) were used when appropriate to reduce the number of tests and control for false positives given moderate covariance structure between data. Age was included as a covariate due to the significant differences among groups (see\nresults\n). A priori multivariate comparisons of athletes with a history of concussion versus athletes without a history of concussion, and both football groups versus healthy control participants were performed for FA ROI analyses and considered significant at\np\n<\u20090.05. Follow-up univariate contrasts were performed following significant multivariate effects and considered significant at\np\n<\u20090.05.\nVertex-based analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with age as covariate was performed with a priori comparisons of cortical thickness between athletes with a history of concussion versus athletes without a history of concussion, and both football groups versus healthy control participants. A cluster-wise multiple comparison correction was performed using a Monte Carlo simulation with a vertex-wise threshold of\np\n<\u20090.05, Bonferroni corrected for contrasts across two hemispheres."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nTwenty-eight adult female Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 250 and 300\u2009g were used in this experiment. The rats were housed in a 12:12\u2009h reversed light cycle and were food deprived to no less than 85% of their normal body weight. All handling, housing, surgical procedures, and behavioral training of the rats were approved by the University of Texas Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nBehavioral apparatus and software\nThe behavioral apparatus and software were used as previously described.\n14\nThe apparatus consisted of an acrylic box (25.4\u00d730.5\u00d712.1\u2009cm). The box contained a slot in the front right corner that rats could reach through to access the aluminum pull handle. The slot was sized and positioned such that rats could only reach the pull handle using their right forelimb. The pull handle was centered in the slot at a height of 6.35\u2009cm from the cage floor, and the distance of the pull handle to the cage was varied from 1.9\u2009cm inside the cage (relative to the inner cage wall) to 1.9\u2009cm outside the cage. The aluminum pull handle was connected to a force transducer (Vulintus, Inc., Sachse, TX) that could measure pull force with sub-gram accuracy. The force transducers were inspected daily and were recalibrated when necessary. Matlab software (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA) was used to control the behavioral apparatus and collect data. A microprocessor controller (Vulintus, Inc., Sachse, TX) sampled the force transducer at a frequency of 100\u2009Hz and sent the information to Matlab software, which displayed the data on the screen, controlled the behavioral session, and saved the data to permanent files.\n\nBehavioral training\nAnimals underwent training for two 30-min sessions per day 5 days per week, with at least 2\u2009h between sessions. Shaping procedures were similar to those previously described.\n13\n,\n14\nAnimals were trained to pull on the handle with 120\ng\nof force, and single reward pellets were dispensed following successful trials (45\u2009mg dustless precision pellet, BioServ, Frenchtown, NJ). If rats did not receive 50 pellets per day, they were given 10\u2009g of additional pellets after daily training sessions were completed.\nA trial was initiated when at least 10\ng\nof force were applied to the pull handle. After initiation the force on the pull handle was sampled for 4\u2009sec. If the force threshold required for a hit was met within a 2-sec window after force initiation, the trial was recorded as a success and a reward pellet was delivered. If the force threshold was not reached within 2\u2009sec, the trial was recorded as a failure and no reward was delivered. Success rate for each day was calculated as the number of hits for that day divided by the total number of trials for the day.\nRats were considered fully trained after they maintained a performance of 85% success at the 120\ng\nthreshold for 5 consecutive days. None of the animals in this study failed to meet this criterion. After the animals successfully reached this stage, they received a CCI over the forelimb area of left motor cortex to impair use of the trained forelimb. They were then implanted with a vagus nerve cuff and given 7 days to rest before behavioral testing resumed. Because of the severe forelimb deficits resulting from CCI, animals underwent a manual or automated adaptive reshaping procedure during early post-lesion sessions to encourage independent performance of the task. Once a post-lesion baseline assessment could be obtained, which consisted of animals independently initiating at least 50 trials per session for a 2-day period, and at least one successful 120\ng\npull on each day, they were then divided into two therapy groups to receive VNS paired with successful trials during rehabilitative training (VNS+Rehab) or to receive only rehabilitative training but no VNS (Rehab). Due to the duration of the reshaping period, division into experimental groups typically occurred 3 to 4 weeks post-injury. After establishing post-lesion baseline performance and separating animals into experimental groups, rehabilitative training continued for 6 weeks and consisted of training on the pull task with the same parameters that were used during pre-lesion training. (1.9\u2009cm handle distance, 120\ng\nforce threshold, 2-sec time window). The VNS group did not receive stimulation during the sixth week of training to assess whether the effects of VNS were sustained after stimulation ceased.\n\nStimulation parameters\nVNS onset occurred within 45\u2009msec of each successful trial. The stimulation parameters consisted of a 500-msec train of 15 pulses at 30\u2009Hz. Each biphasic pulse was 0.8\u2009mA in amplitude and 100\u2009\u03bcs in phase duration. These parameters were identical to our earlier studies.\n9\u201311\n,\n15\nDuring the first day of the post-lesion baseline, rats did not have a stimulator cable connected to the headcap. For both Rehab and VNS+Rehab animals, the stimulator cable was connected during the second day of post-lesion baseline assessment, but no stimulation was delivered. Throughout the 6 weeks of therapy, the stimulation cable for the Rehab rats was not connected to a stimulator. During the sixth week, the stimulator cable was not used for either group.\n\nSurgical procedures\nRats were anesthetized with a cocktail of ketamine hydrochloride (50\u2009mg/kg), xylazine (20\u2009mg/kg), and acepromazine (5\u2009mg/kg) injected intramuscularly, and they were given supplemental doses as needed. After placing the rat in the stereotaxic frame, a craniotomy (3 to \u22122\u2009mm anteroposterior [AP], 0.5 to 4\u2009mm lateral relative to bregma) was performed using rongeurs to expose the motor cortex. A spring-loaded CCI device (Vulintus, Inc., Sachse, TX) set to a velocity of 3\u2009m/sec with an impactor tip of 3\u2009mm in diameter was lowered to the surface of the cortex. Upon triggering, the impactor delivered a downward blow 2\u2009mm in distance and was left in place for 5\u2009sec before being lifted out. The craniotomy was then covered with KwikCast silicone polymer (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) and sealed with a thin layer of acrylic.\nFour bone screws were inserted into the skull at points near the lambdoid suture and over the cerebellum. A two-channel connector was then attached to the cranial screws using acrylic. The rat was then removed from the stereotaxic frame, and was laid in a supine position. An incision was made in the neck, and blunt dissection of the muscles exposed the left cervical vagus nerve. After isolating the vagus nerve from the carotid artery, the nerve was placed inside the stimulating cuff and the cuff was sutured closed. Cuff leads were tunneled subcutaneously and attached to the two-channel connector atop the skull. All incisions were sutured and the exposed two-channel connector was encapsulated in acrylic. A topical antibiotic cream was applied to both incision sites.\nFollowing surgery, rats were provided with 4\u2009mg Rimadyl\n\u00ae\nand a 350\u2009mL water bottle containing 50\u2009mg of minocycline hydrochloride. This water bottle was removed after one week, and each rat was returned to normal drinking water.\n\nHistology\nFollowing the completion of therapy, animals were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, and their brains were removed for processing. Coronal sections 40\u2009\u03bcm thick extending through the lesioned area were cut using a cryostat and stained with cresyl violet. Twenty-two of the brains were included in histological analyses to investigate lesion size and damage to both white matter and gray matter.\nWhite matter was measured as the area of the corpus callosum and external capsule in each hemisphere of the brain.\n14\nThe total volume of white matter was calculated for each hemisphere, and the ratio was taken as the total volume of white matter in the lesioned hemisphere to the total volume of white matter in the unlesioned hemisphere. The volume of gray matter was similarly calculated, and a ratio of the lesioned to the unlesioned hemisphere was obtained. Histological analysis was completed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health; imagej.nih.gov) and was performed blind to the experimental group and performance of each animal on the pull task.\n\nStatistical analysis\nBehavioral data from each subject was grouped by combining each 5 consecutive days into epochs. Each day consisted of two sessions of data. Post-lesion performance at each epoch was compared across experimental groups, as well as compared with post-lesion baseline performance and the last 5 days of pre-lesion training. Significant differences were determined using repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), paired\nt\ntests, and unpaired\nt\ntests. All data are reported as mean\u00b1standard error of the mean (SEM). Significant differences between groups are noted in\nFigures 2\nand\n\u200b\nand4\n4\nas *\np\n<0.05. Significant differences for each group from post-lesion are noted by filled markers in\nFigure 2\nand\nFigure 4\n. Bonferroni correction was used to calculate a cut-off value for significance as\np\n<0.0083 for therapy time points when compared with post-lesion. Error bars indicate mean\u00b1SEM. Matlab software was used for all statistical analyses.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nVNS paired with rehabilitative training enhances recovery of performance on the isometric pull task.\n(A)\nTwo example trials are shown to illustrate measures of behavioral performance.

    "Methods": "Development and structure of pre-clinical CDEs for TBI\nTo address the widely heterogeneous aspects of human TBI, numerous animal TBI models have been developed over several decades. In particular, diverse variations in the species, sex, genetic backgrounds, injury biomechanics, neurobehavioral and neuropathological outcomes of models have emerged. Moreover, an array of iterative modifications of established models by individual laboratories adds further complexity.\nTo reasonably permit data comparison with respect to outcome, CDEs will need to address both \u201c\nCore\u201d\ndata elements relevant to all studies, such as species, age and sex, as well as those specific to established individual models and their modifications and outcomes. To achieve this goal, a working group was established that comprised 11 experts with experience across a range of preclinical TBI models. Multiple iterative working group meetings and teleconferences were held to draft an overall structure of the CDEs. In addition, individual experts were tasked with identifying CDEs specific to each model.\nThe proposed CDEs were sent out for review to the larger TBI research community using the NINDS TBI Research listserv (\nhttps://list.nih.gov/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A0=TBI\n) to provide an opportunity for feedback and further improvements. The suggestions were reviewed, and many were incorporated into the matrix."

    "Methods": "Participants\nA sample of 44 patients with mTBI were imaged with MR (T1-weighted) approximately 2 months after injury and again approximately 1 year after injury. Twenty-nine healthy control subjects without a history of mTBI were recruited from the community and were also imaged twice with a similar interval. The participants with mTBI included consecutive persons with mTBI seen in the emergency department of the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, a level 1 trauma center. Mild TBI was diagnosed using American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine Criteria (ACRM). Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores and absence, presence, and duration of loss of consciousness (LOC) were established when possible from participant/family interview, or available medical records.\n\nStandard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents\nThe protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Dartmouth, and all participants gave written informed consent.\n\nImaging methods\nScans were acquired on a research-dedicated 3T Philips Achieva magnet. This 3.0T system has the high performance Quasar Dual gradient set with strengths up to 80\u2009mT/m and slew rates up to 200T/m/sec and an anatomical landmark-based longitudinal repositioning system (SameScan/SmartScan). A Philips 8-channel SENSE Head Coil was used.\nAn MPRAGE (Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo) T1-weighted sequence was used in each session with the following parameters: 140 contiguous 1.2\u2009mm sagittal slices; TR: 6.8\u2009ms; TE: 3.3\u2009ms; TI: 852.9\u2009ms; TFE prepulse delay: shortest; flip angle: 8 degrees; NEX: 1; BW/Pixel: 241; FOV: 256\u2009mm, matrix 256, 1.0\u00d71.0\u2009mm in-plane resolution. This series balances scan time, signal-to-noise ratio, high gray/white tissue contrast, and high spatial resolution (scan duration: 8:55\u2009min). The sequence also provides optimal tissue contrast on the boundary of key subcortical regions known to be implicated in mTBI. That allows for accurate delineation of brain structures on consecutive slices and provides the basis for generation of accurate ground truth data needed for training of fully automatic segmentation techniques.\n\nShape-constrained deformable brain model\nShape-constrained deformable surface models\n9\n,\n12\n,\n13\ncombine the strengths of both deformable and active shape models by encoding\na priori\nshape information while external forces guide the deformation and adapt the model to a target structure. The geometry of the shape-constrained deformable brain model is represented with a triangular mesh that consists of vertices and triangles, as illustrated in\nFigure 1\n. During model creation, various properties describing the local image appearance and shape variation are extracted and learned from a set of training volumes and their corresponding ground truth data. The ground truth data represent highly accurate segmentations of the structures included in the model from a set of high resolution anatomical MRI volumes acquired with the sequence outlined above. The adaptation of the model to a new volume is rapid, fully automatic, and involves a number of image processing steps illustrated in\nFigure 2\n. Detailed methods of this approach and its quantitative accuracy evaluation have been described previously.\n9\u201311\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nThe shape-constrained deformable brain model: (\nA\n) shaded surface, and (\nB\n) triangular mesh.

It starts with approximate shape detection followed by an iterative parametric adaptation. Finally, when the model is close to the anatomical structures in the volume, a deformable adaptation is applied. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\n\nStatistical analyses\nDistributions for demographic data were examined for outliers and distributional characteristics. mTBI and healthy control groups were compared using\nt\ntests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables with respect to basic demographic information. The shape-constrained deformable brain model was applied to both groups at each time point. Volumetric measures from the amygdala, brainstem, caudate, cerebellum, corpus callosum, hippocampus, putamen, and thalamus in the mTBI and healthy control groups at each time point were examined for significant group differences using multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA), with age and relative intracranial volume included as covariates.\n14\nMANCOVA with repeated measurements was performed between the two imaging time points within each group. The statistical computations and\npost hoc\nanalysis were performed using STATA 11."

Participants were excluded if they were not fluent English or Spanish speakers, had a pre-existing neurological disorder or severe psychiatric disorder (e.g., bipolar disorder, schizophrenia), blood alcohol level >200\u2009mg/dL, or previous hospitalization for head injury.\nPatient groups (mTBI and OC)\nPatient recruitment took place between 12/15/2008 and 4/30/2012. MTBI and OC patients were recruited as a consecutive series of admissions to EDs of three Level-1 trauma centers: Texas Children's Hospital, Memorial-Hermann Hospital, and Ben Taub General Hospital in Houston, Texas by study personnel according to a rotating schedule. Eligibility was based, in part, on the following measures: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS\n26\n), graded by ED trauma or other medical staff; Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS\n27\n) ratings made by AIS-certified research nurses based on detailed medical record review; and head CT scans read and coded by a board-certified neuroradiologist (JVH).\nAlthough every attempt was made to screen and enroll the patients while in the ED, patients were allowed to go home from the ED and return for the baseline assessment; the target window for this assessment was <96\u2009h post-injury.\nThe diagnosis of mTBI was made by ED trauma physicians based in part on GCS\n26\nscores between 13 and 15, loss of consciousness (LOC) less than 30\u2009min, and post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) less than 24\u2009h. PTA was assessed using the Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test (GOAT\n28\n). To be eligible for inclusion, all participants must have had negative findings on initial CT scan and had mild or no extracranial injuries demonstrated by AIS scores less than 2 (not including the head region).\nTypically developing (TD) group\nForty-four TD control participants who had not sustained any injury but were similar to the injury groups in age, sex, and level of education were recruited using notices on community bulletin boards.\n\nProcedure\nParticipants were evaluated with a neuropsychological test battery within 96\u2009h post-injury and again at 3 months post-injury. For a complete description of the sample and all study procedures, see Hanten and associates\n29\n; only procedures relevant to the present analysis are described below. Neuropsychological measures included the Brief Visual Memory Test-Revised\n30\nimmediate recall (BVMT-R Total), the Verbal Selective Reminding Test\n31\n,\n32\nincluding the number of words recalled after a delay (VRST Delay) and number of words continuously recalled (VSRT CLTR), and the Symbol-Digit Modalities Test\n33\noral (SDMT-O) and written (SDMT-W) administrations.\nThe Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire\n34\n,\n35\nand the Brief Symptom Inventory,\n36\nfrom which the Global Severity Index (GSI) was calculated, were also collected as self-report symptom measures. Socioeconomic Composite Index (SCI) scores were calculated based on annual family income, level of education (maternal education for participants younger than 18 years old), and occupational prestige. This measure has been associated with cognitive outcomes after pediatric TBI in previous work.\n37\n\nStatistical analysis\nOC patients at 3 months post-injury served as a reference group. Participants were classified as demonstrating poor symptomatic recovery if they obtained at least one score above the 90th percentile for either the Rivermead Post Concussion Symptom Questionnaire or the Brief Symptom Inventory GSI. They were classified as exhibiting poor cognitive outcome if they scored below the 10th percentile on at least one of the following cognitive outcome measures: SDMT-O, SDMT-W, BVMT, VSRT Delay, and VSRT CLTR. The group and subgroup comparisons were performed using the chi-square (\u03c7\n2\n) test or Fisher exact test for categorical variables (e.g., sex, race, litigation) and\nt\ntest for continuous variables.\nPrediction models were built up using stepwise logistic regression. First the demographic and injury variables (age, sex, race, SCI, PTA, LOC, litigation, and method of injury) were entered into the model, and only significant predictors (\np\nvalues<0.05) remained in the model; then the corresponding outcome measures within 96\u2009h post-injury were entered into the model. To assess performance of the prediction models, we used Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness-of-Fit test,\np\nvalues (<0.05) and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (\u22650.8).

Details of lifetime TBI history and football exposure were derived from chart review. All players reported at least 1 year of American pro-football exposure.\nControls were identified by systematically reviewing the charts of all patients evaluated at our center for cognitive/behavioral symptoms, starting with the most recent cases, until an age/sex-matched patient was identified who had no documented history of any TBI, head trauma, falls, motor vehicle accidents, military service, boxing, or American football, and who had an appropriate MRI for review (1.5T or 3T with 3D T1 or T2 series with \u22642\u2009mm slice thickness).

Manual horizontal jitter was added to overlapping \u201cgrade\u201d values in the graph to improve visibility.\nBy counting coronal slices and multiplying by slice thickness, the following measurements were taken: pre-forniceal septal length, post-forniceal septal length, CSP length, and CV length. To account for varied head/ventricular sizes, the following measurements were calculated: CSP ratio (CSP length/pre-forniceal septal length),\n6\nCV ratio (CV length/post-forniceal septal length), total septal cyst length (CSP length+CV length), and total septal cyst ratio (total septal cyst length/total septal length). Given the potentially subjective nature of CSP grading, all scans were graded by two raters (MBR and RCG) who were blinded to clinical information, including TBI and football history, at the time of rating. Inter-rater agreement was excellent (weighted Cohen kappa=0.80). The final CSP grade used in the analyses was based on discussion between the raters until consensus was reached.\n\nStatistical analysis\nSummary statistics were generated for baseline characteristics, demographics, and septum pellucidum measurements of players and controls and compared using\nt\ntests for continuous variables, chi-square tests for binary variables, and nonparametric tests of trend for ordered categorical variables (e.g., CSP grade). In clinical-anatomical correlation analyses among players only, correlation between CSP length and Mini Mental Status Exam score, years of football exposure, age, and years since retirement from football was assessed using Spearman rho. CSP length and grade were also compared between players with a history of concussion with loss of consciousness (LOC) compared with players without a history of LOC using\nt\ntests (for CSP length) and nonparametric tests of trend (for CSP grade). Among players, Mini Mental Status Exam score, years of football exposure, age, and years since retirement were compared among players with CSP grade >2 versus \u22642 using\nt\ntests. The threshold for statistical significance was defined as\np\n<0.05."

    "Methods": "Reagents\nAll reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO) unless otherwise indicated.\n\nRodents, CCI treatment, and serum brain samples used in autoimmune profiling\nAutoimmune profiling was carried out using serum obtained through Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved tissue sharing protocols from control and CCI-treated male Sprague Dawley rats (250-300 g; Taconic Farms, Inc., Rockville, MD). The CCI procedure was carried out under 4% isoflurane anesthesia with a stereotaxic impactor (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL) using a 5\u2009mm impactor at a 20 degree angle to a depth of 2\u2009mm at 5\u2009m/sec with a dwell time of 500 msec as described previously.\n2\nHistologic evaluation confirmed that the CCI procedure consistently resulted in lesions that injured the cerebral cortex and the dorsal portion of the underlying corpus callosum. A severe CCI injury was used with the intention of maximizing an autoimmune response. Animals were euthanized and blood was collected 7 d post-CCI. Serum was prepared by centrifugation, mixed with an equal volume of glycerol to stabilize immunoglobulins, and stored at\u221220\u00b0C until used. Control animals received no treatments. Whole rat brain proteome was prepared from snap frozen brains (normal Sprague Dawley rats (250-300 g; Taconic Farms, Inc.). The tissue was thawed and homogenized by Polytron (three times for 10\u2009sec, setting 6-7) in 10 volumes to weight 0.25\u2009M sucrose, 20\u2009mM TES, 1\u2009mM EDTA, 0.6\u2009M KCL (pH 7.0) containing 1\u00d7complete protease inhibitor cocktail. The homogenate was subjected to Potter-Elvehjem (glass/Teflon) homogenization (five down/up strokes) and centrifuged at 4900\u00d7G (4\u00b0C, 15\u2009m) to remove cellular debris. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 150,000\u00d7G (4\u00b0C, 60\u2009m). The supernatant was assayed for total protein (bicinchoninic acid assay [BCA]) and stored as aliquots at\u221280\u00b0C.\n\nHuman samples and sample preparation\nControl plasma and serum\nControl human plasma (sodium ethylenediaminetetraacedic acid (NaEDTA) anticoagulant) and matched sets of plasma (sodium ethylenediaminetetraacedic acid (NaEDTA) anticoagulant) and serum were prepared from single blood draws collected from healthy, normal male and female volunteers (78% Caucasian, 17% African-American, 5% Hispanic) ranging in age from 19 to 50 years old, and with a mean and median age of 25 years and 24 years, respectively (obtained commercially; Innovative Research, Novi, MI). Control samples for investigating differences between plasma and serum consisted of two separate matched sets of plasma and serum, collected from ten males and ten females each for a total of 40 samples.

Patient demographics and clinical variables are presented in\nTable 1\n.\nCerebral cortex\nHuman cerebral cortex (male; 52 years old; African American; cause of death was atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; postmortem interval was 2 h; neuropathologic evaluation revealed brain to be normal) was obtained from the Brain and Tissue Bank for Developmental Disorders of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, University of Maryland (Baltimore, MD). A homogenate of soluble protein was prepared from a wedge of tissue (\u223c5\u2009g), spanning all layers of the frontal cortex, following the procedures described above for rat brain.\nPlatelets\nHuman platelets were prepared from Caucasian male and female normal volunteers (age 20 - 30 years old) as follows. Platelet rich plasma (60\u2009mL average volume, prepared from 450\u2009mL whole blood, Innovative Research) was combined with an equal volume of Tyrode's buffer (137\u2009mM NaCl, 2.7\u2009mM KCl, 1\u2009mM MgCl\n2\n, 1.8\u2009mM CaCl\n2\n, 0.2\u2009mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 12\u2009mM NaHCO\n3\n, and 5.5\u2009mM D-glucose) containing prostacyclin (100\u2009ng/mL) and centrifuged at 1800\u00d7G for 15\u2009min at 15\u00b0C. The pelleted platelets were gently resuspended in 22\u2009mL of the Tyrode's buffer containing 1\u00d7complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) and assessed microscopically for purity (>99% routinely) and appearance (spherical with little sign of activation). Platelet proteins were prepared by three cycles of freeze/thawing and sonication. The extracts were then centrifuged at 14,000\u00d7G for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C, and supernatants collected and assayed for protein content (BCA; Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL). Platelet extracts were diluted in phosphate buffer saline (PBS; pH 7.2) containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for evaluation of PRDX6 by immunoassay and immunoblot.\n\n2D gel electrophoresis\nTwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed according to the method of O'Farrell\n31\nwith modification.\n32\u201334\nA single run generally consisted of eight gels, two of which were silver stained to visualize proteins, while six were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF; Hybond-P PVDF Membrane, GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) for immunoprofiling. These blots were probed with serum from either control rats or animals treated with CCI. Brain homogenates were de-lipidated by mixing one volume protein (2.4\u2009mg/mL) sample with five volumes 2:1 chloroform/methanol followed by centrifugation. Protein samples (routinely 5\u2009mg to 10\u2009mg) were physically recovered as a pad positioned at the aqueous/organic interface; protein recovery was 95\u201399% through the extraction procedure (BCA assay;\nn\n=5). The extracted proteins were dissolved in isoelectric focusing rehydration buffer (1% dithiothreitol, 2% pH 3-10 pharmalytes (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA), 2\u2009M thiourea, 6\u2009M urea, and 1% CHAPS and a trace of bromophenol blue) and applied to pH 3-10, 24\u2009cm isoelectric focusing Immobiline Dry Strips\n\u00ae\n(GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden) (1\u2009mg in 450\u2009\u03bcL/strip). The strips were overlaid with mineral oil and proteins were focused for 22\u2009h at 16\u00b0C using: 30 volts for 12\u2009h, 500 volts for 1\u2009h, 1000 volts for 1\u2009h, and 8000 volts for 8\u2009h.\nUpon completion of the first dimension, proteins were reduced and alkylated by sequentially equilibrating the immobilized pH gradient strips in buffers containing 1% dithiothreitol and 2.5% iodoacetamide (both prepared in 6\u2009M urea, 75\u2009mM Tris-HCL, 29.3% gylcerol, 2% SDS, 0.1% Bromophenol Blue; 15\u2009m each). Second dimension fractionations were performed on 255\u00d7196\u00d71\u2009mm gels (Dalt 12.5%; GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) over 4\u2009h. The gels were then either stained with silver stain\n35\nor transferred to PVDF membrane using a Pharmacia Multiphor II electrophoresis unit (GE Healthcare) operated at 600 volts/cm\n2\n, 400 mA limiting, for 60\u2009m and a 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) buffer system (40\u2009mM MOPS, 10\u2009mM NaAc, 1\u2009mM EDTA) containing 10% methanol.\n\nImmunoprofiling\nFollowing transfer, immunoblots were blocked with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Grand Island, NY) in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (TBS-T; 50\u2009mM Tris, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.6) for 60\u2009min at room temperature and then probed overnight at 4\u00b0C with serum pooled from six to eight control or CCI rats diluted 1:250 in TBS-T/5% FBS. Blots were then washed three times with TBS-T, probed for 3\u2009h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase labeled anti-rat IgG secondary antibody (HAF005, R&D, Minneapolis, MN) diluted 1:5000 in TBS-T, washed three times with TBS-T and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL+Plus; Amersham Searle Corp, Arlington Heights, IL) using a FUJI LAS 3000 imager (Fujifilm Medical Systems, Stamford, CT) and Multi Gauge v3.0 software (Fujifilm). Immunoreactive signals that were unique to CCI blots were mapped to the corresponding protein features on silver-stained gels. Proteins of interest were excised and processed for proteomic analysis. A total of six rounds of immunoprofiling were performed using separate pools of control and TBI serum.\n\nProtein identification by peptide mass fingerprinting\nThe silver stained gel fragments were de-stained with 100\u2009\u03bcL of a 1:1 mixture of 30\u2009mM potassium ferricyanide and 100\u2009mM sodium thiosulfate and rinsed with water until clear. The gel fragments were then equilibrated with 0.2\u2009mL of 100\u2009mM NH\n4\nHCO\n3\n/50% acetonitrile for 45\u2009min at 37\u00b0C, dehydrated in 100\u2009\u03bcL 100% acetonitrile, and dried under vacuum. The dried gel pieces were rehydrated with 40\u2009mM NH\n4\nHCO\n3\n/10% acetonitrile containing 20\u2009ng/\u03bcL trypsin (Trypsin Gold, Mass Spectrometry Grade; Promega, Madison, WI) and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. Peptide fragments were recovered in sequential (60\u2009m, room temperature) extractions with 1.0% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA; 75\u2009\u03bcL) followed by two rinses with 50% acetonitrile/5% TFA (50\u2009\u03bcL each). The three collections were pooled, dried under vacuum, and dissolved in 10\u2009\u03bcL of 1% TFA. The peptides were then purified and concentrated using a C-18 Zip Tip\n\u00ae\n(Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA) and mixed with alpha-cyanohydroxycinnamic acid matrix (10\u2009mg/mL in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA) containing bradykinin (1060.5692 daltons; 50 fmol/mL) and adrenocorticotropic hormone fragment 18-39 (2465.1989 daltons; 150 fmol/mL; AnaSpec, San Jose, CA) as internal standards. Samples were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry using a Voyager MALDI-TOF DE STR instrument (PE Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The mass spectrometer was operated in reflectron mode with an accelerating voltage of 20,000 V, a grid voltage of 76.13% and a guidewire voltage of 0.003%. Peptide mass data were used to query the National Center for Biotechnology Information protein sequence database accessed through the ProteinProspector MS-Fit search engine (\nhttp://prospector.ucsf.edu/prospector/mshome.htm\n). Protein identifications were confirmed in equivalent samples analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry by the W.M. Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, Yale University (\nhttp://keck.med.yale.edu/index.aspx\n).\n\nImmunosorbent electrochemiluminescence assay\nThe single-plex immunosorbent electrochemiluminescence assay (IEA) was developed using 96-well, standard-bind electrochemiluminescence microtiter plates from Meso Scale Diagnostics (Rockville, MD). Combinations of seven monoclonal and five polyclonal anti-PRDX6 antibodies were screened for compatible pairs. A mouse anti-PRDX6 monoclonal antibody (Clone 1A11, GenWay Biotech, catalog #20-007-280008, San Diego, California) and a rabbit monoclonal anti-PRDX6 antibody (Clone EPR3755; Epitomics, catalog # 2769-1, Burlingame, California) were selected for optimization as capture and primary antibodies, respectively. The monoclonal capture antibody was first purified by Protein G affinity chromatography (Protein G HP SpinTrap; GE Healthcare BioSciences; vendors protocol) to remove glycerol, and then coated to the plates at a concentration of 4\u2009\u03bcg/mL in PBS (25\u2009\u03bcL/well, overnight, 4\u00b0C). The plates were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 2\u2009h at room temperature. The wells were then washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T), and the samples (diluted in PBS-1% BSA) were added to wells in a total volume of 100\u2009\u03bcL/well containing 25\u2009\u03bcL plasma or serum and dilutions of either platelet and brain extracts. The standard curves were established using serial dilutions of PRDX6 recombinant human protein (catalog #GWB-F65D50; GenWay Biotech) in a final volume of 100\u2009\u03bcL/well. Standard curves were prepared in PBS-1% BSA containing either 25% chicken plasma or 25% horse serum (both from Innovative Research) to control for the non-specific effects of serum or plasma matrix. These matrices were selected from a variety of species samples (Innovative Research) based upon their ability to: 1) mimic the backgrounds calculated for corresponding human samples, and 2) not interfere with the performance of recombinant PRDX6 protein standard in the IEA.\nPlates were incubated for 2\u2009h at room temperature and washed three times in PBS-T. Following the addition of primary antibody (2\u2009\u03bcg/mL in PBS-1% BSA, 25\u2009\u03bcL/well) plates were incubated for 1\u2009h at room temperature and washed three times in PBS-T. The plates were then treated with goat anti-rabbit MSD Sulfo-Tag antibody (MSD, R32AB-1; 2\u2009\u03bcg/mL in PBS-1% BSA, 25 uL/well, 60\u2009min, room temperature). After three final PBS-T washes, the plates were developed with 150 uL/well of MSD Read Buffer T with Surfactant (MSD) and electrochemiluminescence read using a SECTOR Imager 6000 (MSD). The assay can detect 0.7\u2009ng/mL (lower limit of detection) and is quantitative to 1\u2009ng/mL (lower limit of quantitation) as defined by three and 10 times the standard deviation of readings obtained for 0\u2009pg/mL standard, respectively (\nn\n=10). Intra- and inter-assay variability were 4% and 13%, respectively (\nn\n=10).\n\nOne-dimension immunoblotting\nOne-dimension (1D) immunoblot analyses were performed by standard methods as previously described.\n36\nProteins resolved by SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (iBlot\n\u00ae\nGel Transfer Stacks; Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). Membranes were blocked with 50\u2009mM TBS-T containing 5% FBS (blocking buffer). Blots were probed overnight (4\u00b0C) with rabbit monoclonal anti-PRDX6 antibody (Clone EPR3755; Epitomics) diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer. The blots were washed three times in TBS-T and incubated (two hr, room temperature) with horseradish peroxidase labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (#31210, 1:5000 in TBS-T; Thermo, Rockford, Il). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent system (ECL+Plus; Amersham Searle Corp, Arlington Heights, IL) using a FUJI LAS 3000 imager. Digital imaging quantification was performed with Multi Gauge v3.0 software (FujiFilm Medical Systems USA, Inc., Stamford, CT).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nAnti-PRDX6 immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described\n2\non sections of rat cerebral cortex (paraformaldehyde-fixed) using rabbit anti-PRDX6 antiserum (GWB-007PE6; GenWay Biotech; 1:250 dilution), or mouse monoclonal anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (MAB360; Millipore; 1:1000) for co-localization to astrocytes. Alexa Fluor\n\u00ae\n488 donkey anti-rabbit (green) or Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse (red) detection antibodies (Invitrogen; 1:100 dilutions) were used to visualize PRDX6 and GFAP, respectively. Additional analyses of cellular co-localization were carried out using antibodies directed against Iba-1 (ab15690; Abcam, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1:1000) and ED-1 (MCA341R; AbD Serotec, Raleigh, North Carolina; 1:150) for quiescent and activated microglia, respectively; and NeuN (MAB377; Millipore; 1:1000) for neurons. These data (not shown) confirmed that PRDX6 is primarily associated with astrocytes in rodent brain.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test. Differences were considered significant at a\np\nvalue of less than 0.05. Univariate ANOVAs were conducted to examine effects of mTBI on PRDX6 levels in injured patients, compared with controls at each time, between males and females, and among imaging groups."

    "Methods": "Participants\nSixty-one patients with mTBI who presented to the emergency department (ED) of University of Malaya Medical Center (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia) for a consecutive 11-month period between April 1, 2013 and March 1, 2014 were prospectively recruited for this study. Patients were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria as presented in\nFigure 1\n. For the purposes of this study, mTBI was defined as acute TBI, consisting of nonpenetrating head trauma resulting in one or more of the following: confusion/disorientation; loss of consciousness (LOC) less than 30\u2009min; post-traumatic amnesia (PTA; less than 24\u2009h in duration) and/or transient focal neurological signs or seizures; and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 13\u201315\u2009upon acute clinical evaluation. The flow of the study is presented in\nFigure 2\n.

Cross-sectional images of the brain were obtained craniocaudally from the base of skull to vertex. Scan parameters used were 120\u2009kVp, 300\u2009mAs, and collimation of 16\u00d70.75\u2009mm with standard brain and bone windowing. A neuroradiologist (N.R.) and a neurosurgeon (V.N.) who were blinded to the clinical diagnosis independently evaluated the images for each patient, and only patients who were deemed not requiring surgical intervention were included in this study. All subjects gave informed consent as required by the institutional research ethics committee and the hospital ethics committee (UM/EC Ref: 947.15)\n\nStudy protocols\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropsychological assessments were performed at admission and repeated again at 6 months post-trauma (\nFig. 2\n). Healthy control participants were subjected to the same protocols as patients upon admission (i.e., MRI and neuropsychological assessment).\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging data acquisition\nAll consented subjects were imaged on a 3T MRI scanner (Signa HDx; General Electric, Harvey, IL) using an eight-channel head coil. The imaging protocol included: 1) axial T1-weighted three-dimensional fast spoiled gradient echo (FSPGR; repetition time [TR]=minimum 6.7\u2009ms; echo time [TE]=minimum 1.9\u2009ms; field of view [FOV]=31\u2009mm; matrix=256\u00d7256; slice thickness=1.2\u2009mm; slice overlap=0.6\u2009mm with image scan time of 3\u2009min 48\u2009sec); 2) axial T2-weighted fast spin echo; TR=4240\u2009ms; TE=102\u2009ms; FOV=24\u2009mm; matrix=512\u00d7384; thickness=5\u2009mm; spacing=1.5\u2009mm; and image scan time of 2\u2009min 30\u2009sec; and 3) coronal gradient echo (TR=655\u2009ms; TE=20\u2009ms; flip angle=15\u2009degrees; bandwidth=31.25; FOV=24\u2009cm; matrix=320\u00d7256; thickness=5.0\u2009m; spacing=1.5\u2009mm; and image scan time of 2\u2009min 7\u2009sec. The DTI sequence was obtained using these parameters: TR=13,000\u2009ms; TE=81.2\u2009ms; FOV=24\u2009mm; matrix=128\u00d7128; slice thickness=3.0\u2009mm; 32 directions; diffusion-weighted factor, b=700\u2009s/mm\n2\n; and image scan time of 7\u2009min 22\u2009sec.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging analysis\nTract-based spatial statistics\nVoxel-wise statistical analysis of the diffusion-weighted data was carried out using TBSS,\n37\npart of the FSL (v5.0.6; University of Oxford, Oxford UK) software package. Initial preprocessing involved corrections for head movement and eddy currents, brain tissue extraction, and fitting of the diffusion tensor model. These were carried out using the FSL eddy_correct, bet, and dtifit tools, respectively. The standard TBSS analysis workflow was followed (V 1.2;\nhttp://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/TBSS/UserGuide\n), with the following specific options: nonlinear registration to the FMRIB58_FA standard-space image; generation of a study-specific mean FA image for skeletonization; and a 0.2 threshold for the mean FA skeleton.\nThe voxel-wise statistical analysis was carried out using the FSL randomize tool. A two-group unpaired\nt\n-test design was used for comparing admission scans of control and mTBI subjects. A paired\nt\n-test design was used for comparing admission and follow-up scans of mTBI subjects. These statistical analyses were carried out separately for FA, MD, and RD values. In all cases, cluster-based thresholding was used, and 0.05 was adopted as the threshold for significant clusters.\nRegion of interest\nIn addition, we obtained mean FA, MD, and RD for all tracts identified on TBSS using region of interest (ROI) analysis. The image-processing pipeline consisted of preprocessing, image registration, and analysis, utilizing the FSL (v5.0.6; University of Oxford) and AFNI (v2011_12_21_1014; National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD) software packages. Initial preprocessing involved corrections for head movement and eddy currents, brain tissue extraction, and fitting of the diffusion tensor model. These were carried out using the FSL eddy_correct, bet, and dtifit tools, respectively. For image registration, the FSL tool fnirt was used to carry out nonlinear spatial registration of each subject to the FMRIB58_FA standard-space image, using the built-in FA_2_FMRIB58_1mm config file. This was assumed to be spatially compatible with the International Consortium of Brain Mapping (ICBM) DTI-81 atlas. Postregistration, composite axial slice images of the underlying FA and ICBM atlas tract outlines were generated at z=42 and z=82 for each subject. An experienced neuroradiologist (N.R.) verified the overall registration quality of these images. Finally, the AFNI 3dROIstats tool was used to map the predefined ROIs to each individual subject and calculate the median FA, MD, and RD values for each tract.\n\nNeuropsychological assessment\nAll subjects underwent cognitive assessment using the Screening Module of the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (S-NAB Form 1), which was performed by the neuropsychologist once the patient had recovered to a GCS score of 15, which occurred with an average turnaround time of 4.35\u2009h (SD, 7.08) between time of trauma and full GCS recovery. The S-NAB comprises a comprehensive set of neuropsychological tests (refer to\nTable 1\n), with demographically corrected norms for adults between the ages of 18 and 97 years, assessing orientation and five cognitive domains (i.e., attention, memory, language, and visuospatial and executive functions). This battery consists of 12 individual tests across the five domains aforementioned. From these 12 tests, a total of 16\nT\nscores are derived, 14 of which contribute toward five separate Screening Index (domain-specific) scores and one Total Screening Index score.\n38\nThe same subtests were repeated at 6 months by the same neuropsychologist using the S-NAB Form 2 in order to minimize practice effects.\nTable\n1.\nList of S-NAB Module Subtests and Areas of Cognitive Domains Assessed\nNeuropsychological assessment (S-NAB Form 1 and Form 2)\nList of S-NAB module tests\nDomains assessed\nScreening Orientation\nOrientation\nScreening Digits Forward\nAttention\nScreening Digits Backward\nAttention/Working Memory\nScreening Numbering and Letters\nAttention\nScreening Shape Learning Immediate Recognition\nMemory\nScreening Story Immediate Recall\nMemory\nScreening Delayed Shape Learning Delayed Recognition\nMemory\nScreening Story Learning Delayed Recall\nMemory\nScreening Naming\nLanguage\nScreening Auditory Comprehension (three subtests)\nLanguage\nScreening Design Construction\nVisuospatial\nScreening Visual Discrimination\nVisuospatial\nScreening Word Generation\nExecutive Function/Verbal Fluency\nMazes\nExecutive Function\nOpen in a separate window\nS-NAB, Neuropsychological Assessment Battery-Screening.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAn independent-samples\nt\n-test was used to establish whether mean values of FA, MD, and RD of selected WM tracts were significantly different between healthy control and mTBI groups during the acute phase (or baseline exam). The same test was also used to investigate whether patients (at admission) performed differently from healthy control participants on the neuropsychological assessment. A paired\nt\n-test was used thereafter to ascertain how the WM tracts had changed over time. TBSS skelotonized image of the significant changes observed over time were processed to better visualize any signifcant changes. Spearman's rho correlation coefficient was used to examine the association between WM ROIs (nine selected tracts) and NP over the different phases. Last, a simple frequency analysis of neuropsychological performance at 6 months post-trauma was performed to determine the types of changes observed in neuropsychological status longitudinally (improved, unchanged, or worsened)."

    "Methods": "Animal preparation\nAll animal procedures follow the ARRIVE guidelines and were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of the University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio (San Antonio, TX). Induction of TBI was done as previously described.\n29\nThree groups of animals were studied: 1) vehicle treated (\nN\n=6); 2) acute MB treated (\nN\n=5), where MB was given at 1 and 3\u2009h post-TBI; and 3) delayed MB treated (\nN\n=10), where MB was given 24\u2009h post-TBI. Note that the lesion volume and behavioral measures data from vehicle and acute MB treatment groups have been previously published.\n25\nT\n2\n, ADC, FA, and CBF in the acute MB treatment group have not been previously published.\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats (250\u2013350\u2009g) were anesthetized initially with 5% isoflurane mixed with room air and maintained at 1.2% isoflurane throughout all surgical and imaging procedures. The animal was secured in a stereotaxic frame and an incision was made as posterior (at the level of the cerebellum) from the impact site as possible to prevent artifacts during MRI acquisition, and the periosteum was removed over the impact site. A diameter 5-mm craniotomy was created over the left forelimb primary somatosensory cortex (S1FL; +0.25\u2009mm anterior and 3.5\u2009mm lateral to bregma), exposing the dura matter. The intact dura matter was impacted using a pneumatic controlled cortical impactor (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, LLC, Fairfax Station, VA) fitted with a \u00d8 3-mm tip (5.0\u2009m/s, 250\u2009\u03bcs dwell time, and 1\u2009mm depth) to mimic a mild focal TBI. After impact, the cranial opening was sealed with bone wax, the scalp sutured closed, and antibiotic ointment applied. Saline was placed under the skin to facilitate removal of air pockets between the scalp and skull to minimize artifacts during MRI acquisition. Buprenex (0.05\u2009mg/kg) was given subcutaneously every 12\u2009h for 3 days for pain.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging\nMRI (Bruker 7-Tesla BioSpec; Bruker Corporation, Billerica, MA) was acquired on the day of the TBI procedure (1\u20133\u2009h post-TBI), and again on days 2, 7, and 14 post-TBI onset to longitudinally monitor lesion volume. The animal was anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane and secured in a MRI-compatible stereotaxic holder with ear and tooth bars. A transceiver surface coil of 2\u2009cm in diameter was placed on top of the rat's head. T\n2\n-weighted images were acquired using a fast spin-echo sequence with repetition time=3\u2009sec (90-degree flip angle), effective echo time=18, 54, 90, and 126\u2009ms, 8 echo train length, seven 1.0-mm thick coronal images, field of view=2.56\u00d72.56\u2009cm, matrix 96\u00d796 and reconstructed to 128\u00d7128, and four transients for signal averaging. Images were coregistered across time points using QuickVol and MRIAnalysisPak software. Lesion volumes were determined as pixels that had T\n2\nvalues higher than the mean plus 2 standard deviations of the value in the homologous contralesional region.\n30\n\nFunctional assessment\nBehavioral assessments were made 1\u20133 days pre-TBI and again 1, 2, 7, and 14 days post-TBI preceding MRI experiments in the same animals. Behavioral tests were not performed on the day of TBI induction owing to incomplete recovery from anesthetic. Sensorimotor function was assessed using the asymmetry forelimb placement (cylinder) test and foot-fault test.\n29\nPrevious behavioral studies have demonstrated that these functional tests have the appropriate sensitivity for this injury model.\n26\u201328\nTesting was conducted 1\u20133 days pre-TBI and again 1, 2, 7, and 14 days post-TBI.\nFoot-fault test\nThe foot fault test is utilized as a measure of neurologcal deficits associated with motor impairment and has been used widely to measure deficits after stroke. In this test, the rat is placed on a grid-like surface and allowed to move freely upon it for 5\u2009min. When an animal places the limbs inaccurately on the grid, the limb falls through and is counted as a foot fault.\nCylinder test\nThe cylinder test provides a way to evaluate a rodent's spontaneous forelimb use and is commonly used to evaluate motor/sensory behavior. A rat is placed in a Plexiglas cylinder and the rat will actively explore the vertical surfaces by rearing. The number of individual limb placements and simultaneous placements are observed for each limb. Unilateral brain damage will result in an asymmetry in forelimb use.\n\nStatistical analysis\nUnpaired\nt\n-tests were used to compare T\n2\nlesion volumes between vehicle- and MB-treated groups. Mann-Whitney's U tests were used to compare differences in asymmetrical limb use and the percentage of foot faults between vehicle- and MB-treated animals. Values are presented as mean\u00b1standard error of the mean. Statistical significance was set at\np\n<0.05. Multiple regression analysis was performed to determine the correlation between MRI-determined lesion volume and asymmetry scores and foot-fault scores."

    "Methods": "Animals and housing\nMale and female C57BL/6J mice seven weeks of age were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and group-housed (3\u20135 mice in same-sex cages for study duration) in the same room of Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care\u2013accredited facilities with a standard 12-h light-dark cycle. Standard rodent chow and water was available\nad libitum\n, and mice were allowed to acclimate after arrival for at least 1 week before sham or CCI procedures. Surgical procedures and behavioral testing were performed by female investigators,\n32\nand all behavioral testing took place during the light phase of the cycle. Procedures were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (Bethesda, MD).\n\nControlled cortical impact and sham procedures\nCages of mice were randomly assigned to sham (male,\nn\n=18; female,\nn\n=18), mild CCI (male,\nn\n=18; female,\nn\n=19), or severe CCI (male,\nn\n=18; female,\nn\n=17) conditions, and each mouse was weighed before surgical procedures. Male and female mice weighed 20\u201328 and 15\u201320\u2009g at the time of procedures, respectively, and female mice were at random (undetermined) stages of the estrous cycle. All CCI or sham procedures were performed in an aseptic manner, as previously described.\n33\nInduction of anesthesia was achieved in a rodent volatile anesthesia box with 3% isoflurane in 100% oxygen. Once corneal and paw-withdrawal reflexes were absent, protective eye ointment (Lacri-Lube\n\u00ae\n) was applied, head hair clipped, and mice were placed into a standard rodent stereotaxic device and secured into position with an incisor bar and ear bars (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL). Maintenance of anesthesia was achieved with 1.5% isoflurane/oxygen administered by a flow-through nose cone, and body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C throughout the procedure using an isothermal heating pad with feedback controller (Stoelting). A unilateral 5-mm craniectomy over the parietal cortex was performed with a high-speed drill. The CCI device (Impact One\n\u2122\n; Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) is an electronically controlled, electromagnetically driven impactor, fitted with a 3.0-mm-diameter steel tip and mounted on a stereotax micromanipulator. The tip of the impactor was centered over the injury site (2.5\u2009mm posterior to bregma and 1.5\u2009mm left of midline) at a 15-degree angle relative to the sagittal plane, and the injury was produced with the following parameters: 5.0\u2009m/sec velocity with a dwell time of 0.1\u2009sec, and a depth of 1.0\u2009mm (mild CCI) or 2.0\u2009mm (severe CCI). Postinjury, the skin incision was closed with a silk suture and mice were placed into a warm, clean housing cage and monitored until ambulatory. Sham-operated mice underwent all described procedures except the cortical impact.\n\nOpen field\nAll mice were tested in an OF environment for 20 minutes on days 1, 7, 14, and 21 post-CCI or sham procedures. The OF arena was 40\u00d740\u2009cm with opaque black walls (Stoelting) and a light level of approximately 175 lux. Mice were individually placed into the center of the OF, and a camera above the apparatus recorded activity in the apparatus and was connected to a computer with Any-Maze tracking software (Stoelting). The software detected and tracked the mouse and reported total distance traveled, average speed, number of mobile episodes (with mobility defined as at least 35% of the animal moving for at least 2\u2009sec), and distance traveled in a software-defined 20\u00d720\u2009cm center region of the arena (expressed as a percent of the total distance traveled). Additionally, the arena was equipped with photobeam arrays positioned on either side of the apparatus, allowing the measurement of vertical rearing.\n\nRotarod\nMotor coordination was assessed on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, and 21 post-CCI or sham procedures on an accelerating rotarod (Ugo-Basile, Collegeville, PA). Before the first trial on day 1 post-TBI or sham surgery, mice were placed on the slowly rotating rod (four rotations per minute; RPM) and allowed to acclimate to the apparatus for 1\u2009min. After the 1-min acclimation, the rod accelerated from 4 to 60 RPM over a period of 3\u2009min. Latency to fall from the rod (or cling to and rotate with the rod for three consecutive rotations) was recorded for three trials on each testing day, allowing 5\u201310\u2009min of rest with access to food and water between each trial. A mouse that remained on the rod for the entire 3\u2009min was assigned a score of 180\u2009sec for that trial. Scores from the three trials on each testing day were averaged to give a single score for each mouse on each testing day.\n\nY-maze spontaneous alternation\nThe y-maze spontaneous alternation behavior (SAB) test, to assess hippocampal-dependent working (short-term) memory, was performed on postinjury day 10, as previously described.\n34\n,\n35\nThe apparatus consisted of three arms at a 120-degree angle to one another with a triangular central zone. Each arm was 36\u2009cm in length, enclosed by walls 16\u2009cm high, and a small visual cue was placed at the distal wall of each arm. Other objects in the room provided further spatial cues to mice during testing. Each mouse was placed at the end of a randomly chosen arm and allowed to freely explore the maze for 5\u2009min. An animal with nonimpaired working memory is expected to exhibit SAB, visiting all three arms in alternation, not immediately returning to either of the arms that had been most recently explored. An overhead camera linked to Any-Maze computer software (Stoelting) recorded movements of the mouse and reported the distance traveled by each mouse during the test. Visits to arms were manually scored; a visit to an arm of the maze was counted when all four paws of the mouse entered the arm. An alternation was counted when the mouse visited three different arms consecutively, and the percent correct alternation was calculated as\n.\n\nMorris water maze\nSpatial learning and memory was assessed by standard MWM\n36\ntraining trials on postinjury days 23\u201326 followed by a probe trial approximately 1\u2009h after the final training trial. The apparatus was a circular white tank 122\u2009cm in diameter, filled with water (23\u00b11\u00b0C) to a depth of approximately 30\u2009cm. A transparent acrylic platform (11\u2009cm diameter) was submerged approximately 1.0\u2009cm below the surface of the water and was located approximately 15\u2009cm from the edge of the maze. A ceiling camera directly over the water maze was connected to a computer with Any-Maze tracking software (Stoelting). Within the software, the water maze was divided into four equal quadrants, with the platform located in the northwest (NW) quadrant. Large visual cues (black and white geometric shapes) were positioned around the apparatus in locations that could be viewed by mice during testing. Each mouse received four training trials (with an intertrial interval of 4\u20135\u2009min) for 4 days. Four start positions were designated along the perimeter of the tank, and the order in which these positions were used was changed each day. For each training trial, the mouse was gently placed in the designated start position, facing the wall. Mice were allowed 60\u2009sec to locate the platform using the spatial cues in the room, after which the animal remained on the platform for 15\u2009sec. If the mouse did not find the platform in the allotted 60\u2009sec, it was gently guided to the platform and allowed to remain there for 15\u2009sec and received the maximum score of 60\u2009sec for that trial. After each trial, mice were towel dried and placed into a heated cage. Latency to platform, distance swam during the test trials, and swimming speed were recorded by the software and averaged over the four trials each training day.\nApproximately 1\u2009h after the final training trial on postinjury day 26, a single probe trial was conducted in which the platform was removed from the tank and the mouse was placed against the wall, opposite the former location of the platform. The mouse was allowed to swim for 60\u2009sec, during which time the software recorded the amount of time spent in the NW quadrant (that previously housed the platform), number of times the mouse crossed the previous exact location of the platform, and amount of time spent in the precise platform location.\nBeginning on day 27 postinjury, reversal training trials were conducted to assess behavioral flexibility. These trials were conducted identically to the original training trials on postinjury days 22\u201326, except the platform was moved to the opposite quadrant (southeast; SE) of the apparatus. A reversal probe trial in which the platform was removed from the tank was conducted approximately 1\u2009h after the final reversal training trial on postinjury day 30.\n\nHistological assessment of injury\nImmediately after the conclusion of behavioral testing on day 30 postinjury, mice were deeply anesthetized (60\u2009mg/kg of ketamine with 60\u2009mg/kg of xyalzine, intraperitoneally) and transcardially perfused with 0.1\u2009M of phosphate buffer followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1\u2009M of phosphate buffer. Brains were postfixed for 24 hours in 4% PFA, followed by 24 hours of cryoprotection in 20% sucrose solution in 0.1\u2009M of phosphate buffer. After cryoprotection, each brain was blocked identically, weighed, frozen in powdered dry ice, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\nEight of the brains from each sex and injury group were randomly chosen for lesion volume analysis. A Leica cryostat was used to cut serial sections through the lesion site 30\u2009\u03bcm thick; sections were stained with cresyl violet. Slides were scanned with an Epson scanner, and the area of serial sections at 540-\u03bcm intervals (approximately 10 sections for each brain) was measured with ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD).\n37\nLesion area for each section was calculated as the area of the contralateral hemisphere minus the area of the ipsilateral hemisphere. The sum of the area values for each mouse brain was multiplied by 0.54\u2009mm (the distance between each measured section) to estimate lesion volume.\n38\n\nStatistical analyses\nEffects of injury and sex on behavioral measures were evaluated using SPSS software (version 20; IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY). A mixed-design three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on measures from tests on which mice were tested repeatedly over time (rotarod, OF, and MWM training and reversal training trials), with injury (sham, mild CCI, and severe CCI) and sex (male, female) as between-subjects variables and test day as a within-subject variable. Wilks' lambda F-statistics resulting from multivariate tests with measures from each testing day as separate dependent variables are reported. When interaction effects were significant, subsequent univariate two-way ANOVAs were performed for each day, and Bonferroni-adjusted\nt\n-test values were used to determine significant differences between groups.\nFor lesion volume data and for tests that were only performed at one time point (MWM probe trial measures, MWM reversal probe trial measures, and Y-maze test), two-way ANOVAs with sex and injury as between-subjects variables were performed and Bonferroni-adjusted\nt\n-test values were used to determine specific group differences. For data that failed to meet the homogeneity of variance assumption as assessed by Levene's test of equality of error variance, variables were transformed to square root or reciprocal values. Transformed variables passed homogeneity of variance tests. Where main statistical effects of sex were found, effect size (Cohen's\nd\n) was calculated as\nwhere\n.\nFinally, variability of behavioral data was compared between injury and sex groups. To control for potential differences in scale across the behavioral measures, the coefficient of variation (CV; standard deviation/mean) for each of the six treatment groups was calculated separately for each behavioral variable for which an ANOVA was performed. Repeated measures (e.g., distance traveled in OF) were collapsed across days to yield a single CV for each treatment group for that variable. A two-way (injury\u00d7sex) ANOVA was performed to compare mean CVs for each group. Additionally, Levene's test for equality of variances was conducted to compare the distributions of CVs for each group\n11\n,\n39\n: The median CV for each treatment group was determined, and absolute values of the differences between the CVs for each behavioral measure and the median were calculated. A two-way ANOVA with sex and injury as between-subjects variables was performed on these values.\nData summarized in all figures represent the mean\u00b1standard error of the mean (SEM), and results were considered significant when the\np\nvalue was less than or equal to 0.05. For ease of viewing, results from behavioral tests measured over multiple days (i.e., OF, rotarod, and MWM) are divided into two panels on a single figure, with comparisons between mild CCI and sham controls on one panel, and comparisons between severe CCI and sham controls on a separate panel. The same group of sham controls are represented on both panels of these figures."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAdult male Sprague-Dawley rats (320\u2013380\u2009g) were randomly divided into four groups: sham injury with normothermia (SNG; 37\u00b0C,\nn\n=40); sham injury with hypothermia (SHG; 32\u00b0C,\nn\n=40); TBI with normothermia (TNG; 37\u00b0C,\nn\n=40); and TBI with hypothermia (THG; 32\u00b0C,\nn\n=40). All animal procedures were approved by the animal care and experimental committee of the School of Medicine at Shanghai Jiaotong University (Shanghai, China). Rats were housed in individual cages in a temperature- and humidity-controlled animal facility with 12-h light/dark cycle. Rats were housed in the animal facility for at least 7 days before surgery and were given free access to food and water during this period.\n\nSurgical preparation\nRats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 10% chloral hydrate (3.3\u2009mL/kg). Rats were mounted in a stereotaxic frame, an incision was made along the midline of the scalp, and a 4.8-mm diameter craniectomy was performed on the left parietal bone (midway between the bregma and lambda). A rigid plastic injury tube (modified Leur-loc needle hub, 2.6\u2009mm inside diameter) was secured over the exposed, intact dura using cyanoacrylate adhesive. Two skull screws (2.1\u2009mm diameter, 6.0\u2009mm length) were placed in burr holes, 1\u2009mm rostral to the bregma and 1\u2009mm caudal to the lambda. The injury tube was secured to the skull with dental cement. Bone wax was used to cover the open needle hub connector after the dental cement hardened (5\u2009min). The scalp was closed by sutures and animals were returned to their cages for recovery.\n\nLateral fluid percussion brain injury\nA fluid percussion device (Virginia Commonwealth University Biomedical Engineering, Richmond, VA) was used to create TBI, as described in detail previously.\n19\n,\n20\nRats were subjected to TBI 24\u2009h after the surgical procedure to minimize the possible confounding factors of surgery. In brief, the device is consisted of a Plexiglas cylindrical reservoir filled with 37\u00b0C isotonic saline. One end of the reservoir had a rubber-covered Plexiglas piston mounted on O-rings, and the opposite end had a pressure transducer housing with a 2.6-mm inside diameter male needle hub opening.\nOn the day of TBI, rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (3.3\u2009mL/kg, i.p.) and endotracheally intubated for mechanical ventilation. The resulting pressure pulse was measured in atmospheres (atm) using an extracranial transducer (Statham PA 85-100; Gloud, Oxnard, CA) and recorded on a storage oscilloscope (Tektronix 5111; Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). The suture was opened and bone wax was removed. Rats were disconnected from the ventilator, and the injury tube was connected to the fluid percussion cylinder. Then, a fluid pressure pulse was applied for 10\u2009ms directly onto the exposed dura to produce moderate TBI (mTBI; 2.1\u20132.2 atm). The injury was delivered to within 10\u2009sec after disconnecting from the ventilator. After the initial observation of apneic episodes, rats were ventilated with a 2:1 nitrous oxide/oxygen mixture without isoflurane and rectal and temporalis muscle temperature were recorded. Then, the needle hub, screws, and dental cement were removed from the skull and the scalp was sutured closed. Rats were extubated as soon as spontaneous breathing was observed. Sham TBI group rats were subjected to the same anesthetic and surgical procedures as those in the other group, but without being subjected to injury. Throughout the procedure, mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was monitored continuously and blood gases were measured 15\u2009min before and after fluid percussion injury (FPI).\n\nManipulation of temperature\nFrontal cortex brain temperature was monitored with a digital electronic thermometer (model DP 80; Omega Engineering, Stamford, CT) and a 0.15-mm diameter temperature probe (model HYP-033-1-T-G-60-SMP-M; Omega Engineering) inserted 4.0\u2009mm ventral to the surface of the skull. The probe was removed before FPI and replaced immediately after injury. Rectal temperatures were measured with an electronic thermometer with analog display (model 43 TE; YSI, Yellow Springs, OH) and a temperature probe (series 400; YSI). A brain temperature of 32\u00b0C was achieved by immersing the body of the anesthetized rat in ice-cold water.\n21\nSkin and fur of all animals were protected from direct contact with water by placing the animal in a plastic bag (head exposed) before immersion. Animals were removed from the water bath when brain temperature was reduced to within 2\u00b0C of the target temperature. It took approximately 30\u2009min to reach the target brain temperatures, which were maintained for 4\u2009h under general anesthesia in room temperature by intermittent application of ice packs, as needed. A brain temperature of 37\u00b0C was achieved under general anesthesia with a heating blanket.\n\nHematoxylin and eosin staining\nRats were subjected to deep anesthesia by 10% chloral hydrate. At 24\u2009h post-TBI, all rats were perfused transcardially by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Brains were removed, further fixed at 4\u00b0C overnight, and immersed in 30% sucrose/PBS at 4\u00b0C overnight. Specimens were mounted in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) compound. Serial sections were obtained in a cryostat and stained with toluidine blue for 30\u2009min and then 2\u20133 drops of glacial acetic acid. Once the nucleus and granulation were clearly visible, sections were mounted in Permount or Histoclad.\nSections were cut in a microtome and adhered to glass slides with polylysine. Images of the ipsilateral hippocampus were captured at 100\u00d7 by using a microscope (Nikon Labophot; Nikon USA, Melville, NY). Specimens were examined by two pathologist (blinded to group conditions) to identify cell death based on characteristic cellular morphological changes. There were eight rats in each of the four groups.\n\nTerminal deoxynucleoitidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling staining\nTerminal deoxynucleoitidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) was used to detect cell death in the ipsilateral hippocampus. TUNEL assay was performed according to the manufacturer's directions by using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). In brief, sections were washed for 30\u2009min, 10\u2009min each. Then, sections were incubated in 0.1% Triton-X and 0.1% sodium citrate and rinsed thrice with PBS for 10\u2009min each time. Sections were incubated in 0.3% H\n2\nO\n2\nin PBS/0.1% Tween-20 for 30\u2009min to inhibit endogenous peroxidase activity and then rinsed with PBS. Sections were then incubated with 50\u2009\u03bcL of TUNEL reaction mixture (In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Fluorescein; Roche) in a humidified atmosphere for 60\u2009min at 37\u00b0C in the dark. Then, sections were rinsed thrice with PBS. Sections were then observed under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon TE300; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Negative control was carried out by incubating of sections in 50\u2009\u03bcL of label solution without terminal transferase instead of TUNEL reaction mixture per well. At least 10 randomly selected microscopic fields were used for counting the TUNEL-positive cells (200\u00d7 magnifications). Cell counting was conducted by an investigator blinded to group conditions. There were 8 rats in each of the four groups.\n\nDetection of autophagy-related proteins microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 and Beclin-1\nImmunohistochemical analysis was performed on 4-\u03bcm-thick formalin-fixed cryosections in the ipsilateral hippocampal injury region to determine the immunoreactivity of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) and Beclin-1.\n\nImmunohistochemical analysis\nThe 4-\u03bcm-thick formalin-fixed, OCT-embedded sections were subjected to immunofluorescence analysis to determine immunoreactivity of LC3 and Beclin-1. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3% H\n2\nO\n2\nfor 5\u2009min, followed by a brief rinse in distilled water and a 15-min wash in PBS. Sections were cooled at room temperature for 20\u2009min and rinsed in PBS. Nonspecific protein binding was blocked by incubation in 5% horse serum for 40\u2009min. Sections were incubated with primary antibodies (Abs; anti-LC3 [CST3868], anti-beclin-1 [CST3738], and anti-IgG [immunoglobulin G], all diluted 1:200; Suzhou Ard Biological Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) for 1\u2009h at room temperature, followed by a 15-min wash in PBS. Sections were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate/cyanin 3\u2013conjugated IgG (1:500 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 60\u2009min at room temperature. For negative controls, sections were incubated in the absence of a primary Ab. Ten microscopic fields per each section were photographed randomly for counting the LC3 and Beclin-1-positive cells (200\u00d7 magnifications, Nikon TE300; Nikon). An investigator blinded to group conditions collected all nonbiased stereological data for the study. There were 8 rats in each of the four groups.\n\nWestern blot analysis\nFour animals were run at each time point. Frozen brain samples were mechanically lysed in 20\u2009mM of Tris (pH 7.6), containing 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 1\u2009mM of phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, and 0.11\u2009IU/Ml of aprotinin (all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo). Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000\ng\nfor 20\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. Protein concentration was estimated by Bradford's method. Samples (60\u2009\u03bcg/lane) were separated by 12% SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The membrane was blocked with 5% skimmed milk for 1\u2009h at room temperature and incubated with primary Abs against LC3 and Beclin-1 (1:1000 dilutes, respectively, both from CST, Inc., Danvers, MA) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (diluted 1:10,000; Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the loading control. After the membrane was washed three times in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)+Tween-20 (TBST) for 10\u2009min each, it was incubated in the appropriate horseradish-peroxidase\u2013conjugated secondary Ab (diluted 1:10,000 in TBST) for 2\u2009h. Then, the membrane was washed three times in TBST for 10\u2009min each. Blotted protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence Western blot detection reagents (Millipore, Kankakee, IL) and exposed to X-ray film. Developed films were digitized using an Epson Perfection 2480 scanner (Seiko Corp, Nagano, Japan). Results were quantified by Quantity One Software (Bio-Rad). Band density values were calculated as a ratio of LC3 and Beclin-1/\u03b2-actin, and values from SNG were used as 100%.There were 8 rats in each of the four groups.\n\nTransmission electron microscopy\nSamples for electron microscopy were fixed in phosphate-buffered glutaradehyde (2.5%) and osmium tetroxide (1%). Dehydration of the cortex was accomplished in acetone solutions at increasing concentrations. Tissue was embedded in an epoxy resin. Semithin (1-\u03bcm) sections through the sample were then made and stained with toluidine blue. Then, 600-\u00c5-thin sections were made from a selected area of tissue defined by the semithin section, and these sections were stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate. The ultrastructure of the brain was observed under a transmission electron microscope (JEM-1200X; JEOL, Peabody, MA). There were 8 rats in each of the four groups.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data are presented as mean\u00b1standard error of the mean. SPSS software (17.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for statistical analysis of the data. All data were subjected to one-way analysis of variance. Post-hoc comparisons were made using Tukey's test. Statistical significance was inferred at\np\n<0.05."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nAll animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals and were approved by the University of Washington Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nUpdated electromagnetic spinal cord injury device\nThe original OSU ESCID was updated in several ways to decrease sources of variability and to allow increased flexibility for producing a variety of injury types, including thoracic, cervical, and cortical contusions.\n20\nSpecific changes to the mechanics of the device include an update to the injury probe linkage to include a Lucite platform that is threaded directly in line with the injury probe. This provides a more rigid reference point for the non-contacting position sensor (KD-2306; Kaman Precision Products, Colorado Springs, CO), and allows for rapid modification of the reference gap when injury displacement calibration is modified between mice and rats. A threaded plate used to control the displacement has been modified to include a compression collar, which allows the displacement plate to be loosened during calibration and tightened during injuries to prevent even minor rotation of the disk (\nFig. 1A\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nCervical contusion injury device.\n(A)\nImage of magnetic coil shaker, depth adjustment, force, and position sensors.\n(B)\nSchematic timeline of the control signal sent to the magnetic coil.

Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\n\nCervical spinal cord hemi-contusion\nA total of 23 female Long Evans rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) were divided into four groups: spinally intact (\nn\n=5), sham operated (\nn\n=5), 0.6\u2009mm displacement (\nn\n=6), and 0.8\u2009mm displacement (\nn\n=7). Animals ranged from 279-301\u2009g at time of injury. Members of the spinally intact group did not undergo a surgical procedure, while members of the sham group received a laminectomy, as well as a non-injurious contact of the injury probe to the exposed cord to control for the laminectomy and preparatory \u201ctouch\u201d that occurs before the actual injury is delivered. Members of the 0.6\u2009mm and 0.8\u2009mm displacement group received a laminectomy and spinal cord injury of the specified compression.\nRats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injections of 80\u2009mg kg\n\u22121\nof ketamine (Pfizer, New York, NY) and 10\u2009mg kg\n\u22121\nof xylazine (Lloyd, Shenandoa, IA). A supplemental dose of ketamine was given if necessary. Further, rats received eye lubrication twice throughout the procedure and their hydration was maintained with Lactated Ringer's solution delivered subcutaneously (Baxter, Deerfield, IL). All surgical procedures were performed on a heated pad to maintain optimal body temperature.\nAn incision was made in the skin and muscle overlaying cervical segments C3-C5; muscle was then removed from the C3-C5 vertebral columns and lamina using a curette. A hemi-laminectomy was then performed on the left side of vertebral segment C4 which exposed approximately 4\u2009mm of the spinal cord, slightly larger than the tip of the injury probe. Rats were then placed in a stereotactic frame with clamps on the spinous processes at segments C3 and C5 for stabilization during the injury procedure.\nAn electromagnetic probe (2\u2009mm end diameter; Ling Dynamics, Inc., Naerum, Denmark) was oscillated in air and lowered to the surface of the exposed cord centered over the dorsal root entry zone. The probe tip was lowered into the cord until a common starting force of 4\u20136 kdyne was achieved for all animals (\nFig. 1B, 1C\n). Data were sampled at 1\u2009kHz and recorded using a USB-6229-BNC DAQ device (National Instruments Austin; TX). Subsequently, animals in the injury groups received a high-velocity injury where the spinal cord was displaced by 0.6\u2009mm or 0.8\u2009mm for over 14\u2009msec (\nFig. 1E\n). Rats in the sham group did not receive an injury. Following this, all animals were removed from the spinal frame and their exposed spinal cord was packed with gel-foam followed by closure of muscle in three layers and the skin.\nAll rats were immediately moved to a post-operative heating pad where they received warmed Lactated Ringer's solution (Baxter, Deerfield, Il) as well as buprenorphine subcutaneously (0.05\u2009mg kg\n\u22121\n). Rats continued to receive buprenorphine twice daily for 2 d.\n\nBehavioral tasks and training paradigm\nSeveral weeks before rats received their spinal cord injuries they were trained to comfortably walk across a CatWalk (Noldus, Leesburg, VA),\n21\nas well as perform a forelimb asymmetry use task\n22\nand cereal manipulation task.\n18\nThese tasks were specifically chosen in order to measure motor functions ranging from basic locomotion to precise digit manipulation. Once rats were proficient at completing these tasks, they were filmed doing so for pre-injury data collection.\n\nIBB cereal manipulation task\nThe cereal manipulation task, also known as the IBB\n18\nwas used to measure changes to proximal forelimb and fine digit manipulation once per week after injury over the course of a 12-week recovery period. Animals were placed in a clear acrylic cylinder and given both donut shaped cereal (Froot Loops; Kellogg's, Battle Creek, MI) and spherical shaped cereal (Reese's Puffs; General Mills, Minneapolis, MN). They were filmed as they picked up and manipulated each piece of cereal for consumption (two pieces total) focusing on the left, ipsilateral to injury, forelimb. For scoring purposes, an individual blinded to the injury groups watched the video footage at 40% of normal speed and checked off specific functional features of the left forelimb using the published 9-point scale.\n18\nThe scores for each week were then averaged across all animals within a group and compared across other groups and post-injury time-points. Sub-scores also were compared across groups by converting each qualitative sub-score to a value as follows: completely unable to achieve normalcy (aberrant)=0; partially able to achieve normalcy (anomalous)=0.5; and completely able to achieve normalcy (normal)=1. The volar and non-contact volar sub-scores were combined due to their close relation and converted to a more discrete numeric scale linearly distributed across a ranged from 0 to 1 as follows: zero was assigned for almost always volar and no non-volar contact; 0.1429 for almost always volar and some non-volar contact; 0.2857 for some volar and some non-volar contact; 0.4286 for some volar and almost always non-volar contact; 0.5714 for some volar and no non-volar contact; 0.7143 for no volar and almost always non-volar contact; 0.8571 for no volar and some non-volar contact; and 1.000 for no volar and no non-volar contact. All sub-scores were averaged across the spherical and doughnut cereal types.\n\nForelimb asymmetry use task\nIn order to evaluate the changes in forelimb preference over the course of recovery,\n22\n,\n23\nanimals were tested on a forelimb asymmetry use task once per week. Rats were placed in a clear, acrylic cylinder and were observed for up to 5\u2009min, while a scorekeeper recorded the number of times rats reared up and made contact with the sides of the cylinder with either their ipsilateral, contralateral, or both forelimbs (dual-limb) for 20 contacts. The score was calculated by adding the number of independent ipsilateral contacts with half the number of dual-limb contacts and dividing by the total number of contacts. This was done to apply a handicap for dual-limb weight support. This was then averaged across all rats in each of the groups and the resulting values compared across groups.\n\nCatWalk task\nThe CatWalk task was used to assess changes in basic locomotor features that focused on both proximal and distal upper limb function over the course of a 12-week recovery period. In a dark room, rats were trained to walk across an enclosed, 120\u2009cm long glass walkway (Noldus, Leesburg, VA) with light transmitting through the glass walkway from below to illuminate the paw placement of all four paws. These paw prints were then reflected off an angled mirror and recorded by a camera that was connected to a computer. Each rat performed three crossing/day for up to 3 days/week to ensure enough crossings were collected for analyses. The CatWalk program software (Noldus, Leesburg, VA) then calculated six metrics for all four limbs of each run and each rat. For the purposes of this study we focused on the ipsilateral forelimb which exhibited the greatest motor deficits from the injury. These metrics include:\n\u2022\u2002Duty cycle: The percentage of time that an animal's limb is in the stance phase during the total time for each step cycle (i.e., stance duration/total step duration).\n\u2022\u2002Print area: The area (in pixels) of an animal's paw print.\n\u2022\u2002Swing duration: The period (in seconds) that an animal's limb is off the ground in swing.\n\u2022\u2002Swing speed: The speed (pixels/sec) at which an animal's limb moves from push off to paw strike (swing).\n\u2022\u2002Stand duration: The period (in seconds) that an animal's limb is placed on the ground in stance.\n\u2022\u2002Stride length: The distance (in pixels) between consecutive paw strikes.\nUsing custom Matlab software (MathWorks, Natick, MA), the above metrics were averaged across all runs for two consecutive weeks (i.e., Weeks 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 5 and 6, etc.) and then normalized to a percentage of each rat's pre-injury value. These values were then averaged across all rats/group, with the resulting averages compared across groups.\n\nPerfusions and tissue preparation\nThirteen weeks after spinal cord injury, rats were deeply anesthetized with Beuthanasia (200\u2009mg kg\n\u22121\n), intraperitoneally. Fully sedated rats were immediately transcardially perfused first with \u223c300\u2009mL of 0.9% saline followed by 300\u2009mL of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffered saline (pH, 7.4). The cervical spinal cord was then dissected and stored in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4\u00b0C overnight. For the following 3 d, spinal cords were moved through a sucrose buffer gradient of 10%, 20%, and 30%, 24\u2009h/buffer in 4\u00b0C. Tissue was then blocked into three different blocks with the first encompassing the lesion site and 1\u2009mm rostral and caudal to the injury. The second and third blocks encompassed 3\u2009mm of tissue immediately rostral and caudal to the lesion block, respectively. These blocks were frozen separately into Tissue Tek O.C.T. mounting media (Sakura, Netherlands) using liquid nitrogen and methylbutane. Each block was cut using a cryostat into 40\u2009\u03bcm thick coronal sections that were stored free floating in phosphate buffered saline (pH, 7.4) at 4\u00b0C. The cords of one rat/group were blocked and cut longitudinally in order to get a global view of the tissue.\n\nTissue processing\nMyelin staining\nEvery sixth section (240\u2009\u03bcm) from blocks 1\u20133 were mounted onto subbed slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) coated with chrom-alum (Fisher Scientific) and gelatin (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Slides were then fume fixed with 4 or 16% paraformaldehyde (Macron Chemicals, Center Valley, PA) to ensure tissue adherence. Sections then underwent a series of alcohol incubations for dehydration beginning with 5\u2009min in water, followed by 5\u2009min each in 70% ethanol, then 95% ethanol, then 100% ethanol, and completed with a xylene incubation for 10\u2009min. Tissue was then rehydrated stepwise following the above procedure, inverted. Sections were then incubated for 10 mins in an aqueous myelin dye (Eriochrome Cyanine R; Fluka, St. Louis, MO) and differentiated for 1\u2009min in 1% ammonium hydroxide (Fisher Scientific) after washing in water. Sections were dehydrated once again following the same stepwise ethanol gradients described above: 5\u2009min each in 70% ethanol, 95% ethanol, 100% ethanol, and 10\u2009min in xylene. Slides were coverslipped with Permount (Fisher Scientific) and then scanned using a high resolution whole-slide Nanozoomer scanner (Hamamatsu, Japan).\nMyelin spared area and lesion void\nQuantitative morphology was conducted by a blinded operator. Using custom-Matlab software (MathWorks) contours were drawn around the region of ipsilateral spared tissue (gray+white matter) and gray matter of each mounted and stained section to determine ipsilateral spared gray and white matter. In order to represent the rostro-caudal extent of the lesion voids, slices were aligned at the central canal. A value of \u22121 was assigned for the lesion area and value of+1 was assigned to gray matter; white matter was assigned a value of 0 and all the slices containing a cystic void were then summed together to create a heat map of both the injury void and the spared gray matter. The maximum number of slices containing a cystic void was 14 which spread across 3.36\u2009mm of tissue in the rostral-caudal dimension. Negative values (-1 to -14) were mapped in the yellow-red color space denoting the injury void regions spanning 1 (yellow) to 14 (red) sections. Positive values were mapped to the blue-green color space denoting spared gray matter spanning 1 (blue) to 14 (green) sections.\nQuantification of myelinated and non-myelinated regions\nMyelin stained sections were photographed at high resolution and imported into Matlab. Color images were converted to grayscale intensity images and the intensity was normalized. A blinded observer created electronic contours for analysis. After the gray matter and void contours were subtracted from the slice boundaries, the remaining white matter was separated into non-myelinated and myelinated regions by assigning pixels darker than the median image histogram as myelinated, and lighter tissue as non-myelinated. This analyses was performed on tissue for all animals with the tissue cut in cross-sections (N \u2013 1 for each group).\nCresyl violet staining\nFollowing the imaging of the sections stained with myelin dye, slides were de-coverslipped using an overnight incubation in xylene. Tissue was then rehydrated through a stepwise series of decreasing ethanols (100%, 95%, 70%) for 5\u2009min each, then a 5\u2009min incubation in water followed by a 10\u2009min incubation in 1% ammonium hydroxide (Fisher Scientific), which removed the myelin stain (luxol fast blue). Sections were then briefly rinsed in water then incubated in cresyl violet stain (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 3\u2009min. Following this step, sections were twice rinsed with water, then quickly dehydrated in a stepwise manner for 2\u2009min each in 70% and 95% alcohol. The cresyl violet was then briefly differentiated in 250\u2009mL of 95% alcohol containing five drops of glacial acetic acid (Fisher Scientific). Once differentiation was sufficient, sections continued through a stepwise dehydration process rinsed for 5\u2009min each in 95% and 100% ethanol, followed by a final 10\u2009min incubation in xylene. Slides were then coverslipped using Permount.\nMotoneuron counts\nThe rostro-caudal spread of spared motoneurons was then determined for a total of 4.32\u2009mm rostral and caudal from the epicenter. All cells with a diameter of \u226525 micrometers were included in the counts.\n24\nIndividual slices were binned into groups of three on either side of epicenter to account for any gaps due to tissue loss during processing. This analysis was performed on tissue for all animals with cross-sectionally cut tissue (Total group N \u2013 1).\nTrichrome stain\nA trichrome stain was performed to stain for collagen fibers indicating glial scarring. Every sixth section (240\u2009\u03bcms) from a representative animal in each group was stained. Sections initially stained with cresyl violet were de-coverslipped via an overnight incubation in xylene. Sections were then rehydrated in decreasing ethanol percentages (100%, 95%), then cresyl violet stain was removed using a 10\u2009min incubation in 250\u2009mL of 95% ethanol with five drops of glacial acetic acid. Rehydration of the sections then continued to 70% ethanol followed by 5\u2009min in water. Sections were then stained with Weigert's iron hematoxylin working solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10-15\u2009min, followed by a wash with distilled water. Next, sections were stained in Beibrich scarlet-acid fuchsin solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10\u201315\u2009min then washed with distilled water. Sections were then differentiated in phosphomolybdic-phosphotungstic acid solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10\u201315\u2009min, then immediately transferred to aniline blue solution and stain (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5\u201310\u2009min. Sections were then rinsed in water and differentiated in 1% acetic acid solution for 2\u20135\u2009min. Lastly, sections were dehydrated stepwise in 70%, 95%, 100% alcohol, followed by xylene, then coverslipped using permount mounting media (Fisher Scientific).\n\nStatistical analyses\nBoth Matlab (MathWorks) and SPSS software (IBM, Armonk, NY) were used for statistical tests. A Lilliefors test of normality was performed in Matlab to determine if the data were normally distributed, and this guided the use of parametric or non-parametric tests as described below. Two sample\nt\n-tests compared the average and peak of the position and force trajectories during the hold phase across 0.6\u2009mm, and 0.8\u2009mm injury displacement groups. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests compared among the different groups and if significant were followed by post hoc test with Bonferroni correction at individual post-injury time-points for the CatWalk, forelimb use asymmetry test, and the IBB task (combined sub-scores only). For comparisons of the individual sub-scores, the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test with Bonferroni corrections were used. Repeated measures ANOVAs also were used on the CatWalk, Forelimb use asymmetry test, and IBB (combined sub-scores) to compare the overall course of recovery within each group. The sham and intact groups were compared across all tasks and were not found to be significantly different, thus further comparisons focused on the non-surgical control group and the two injury severities. Power analyses were completed on the more variable measurements using G*Power, which confirmed sufficient power."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nHuman brain tissue was acquired for analysis from the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board approved Brain Trauma Research Center and the Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC) tissue banks. Brain biopsy tissue from patients with severe TBI who underwent a decompressive craniectomy for their injury was resected from the pericontusional area of the temporal and/or frontal cortex and flash frozen with liquid nitrogen. Samples were kept frozen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for Western blot analysis and/or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for immunohistochemistry as described in previous studies.\n21\u201325\nPostmortem control samples of frontal cortex tissue from subjects without neurodegenerative disease were processed in a like manner.\n\nWestern blotting\nCrude membrane fractions were used for Western blot analysis. Briefly, brain tissue was thawed on ice, then placed in buffer (10\u2009mM Tris buffer, pH 7.6, 0.5M MgCl\n2\n) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (P8340, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 15\u2009min, then sonicated. Tonicity restoration buffer (5M NaCl) was added to the sonicated tissue followed by centrifugation at 300\u00d7\ng\nat 4\u00b0C. The resultant supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000\u00d7\ng\nat 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was discarded; resuspension buffer (0.25M mannitol, 1M sucrose, 10\u2009mM Tris-HCl, 0.1M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and protease inhibitor cocktail) was added to the pellet followed by sonication to resuspend the tissue. Protein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA).\nCrude membrane fractions were prepped in a solution of 2\u00d7Bio-Rad Laemelli sample buffer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) premixed with B-mercaptoethanol and extra lysis buffer, heated in a 37\u00b0C water bath for 30\u2009min, then loaded into NuPAGE Novex 3\u20138% Tris-Acetate Gels (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Crude membrane fractions from MDCKII cell lines overexpressing human ABCC1 and ABCB1 (kindly provided by Prof. Piet Borst, Netherlands Cancer Institute) were added to respective gels to serve as positive controls, as well as a fluorescently labeled molecular weight marker (Odyssey protein molecular weight marker 10\u2013250\u2009kDa, Li-COR, Lincoln, NE). Electrophoresis was performed at 200V constant in Tris/Acetate/SDS running buffer.\nProteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) using 30V constant at 4\u00b0C overnight. Membranes were washed, blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer (Li-COR) for 1\u2009h and rewashed. Membranes were then incubated in 1:20 dilutions of rat monoclonal antibody against human ABCC1 (P33527, Enzo Life Sciences, Inc., Farmingdale, NY) or mouse monoclonal antibody against ABCB1 (C219, EMD Millipore) at 4\u00b0C overnight. For comparison of sample loading, an antibody against human \u03b2 actin (A2066, Sigma-Aldrich) was also added at a 1:1000 dilution. Washed membranes were then incubated in green fluorescent-conjugated secondary goat antirat antibody (1:5,000) for ABCC1 or goat antimouse antibody (1:15,000) for ABCB1, and red fluorescent-conjugated goat antirabbit antibody (1:20,000) for \u03b2 actin.\nAfter additional washes, membranes were imaged using an Odyssey scanner and images optimized and quantified using Odyssey Imager Software (Li-COR). Protein bands of interest were identified using positive controls from overexpressing MDCKII cell lines, and relative fluorescent intensity (RFI) for each target protein was quantified against a linear standard curve (r\n2\n=0.9917, 0.9262, 0.9573 for ABCC1, ABCB1, and \u03b2 actin, respectively). To account for loading differences, band intensities are reported as a ratio of actin band intensity within each lane.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nFixed specimens were paraffin embedded, cut into 10\u2009\u03bcm sections, and mounted onto glass slides. Slides were deparaffinized and rehydrated, followed by antigen retrieval using a decloaking solution (Antigen Decloaker, Biocare Medical, Concord, CA). Sections were then blocked in a 3% serum solution for 30\u2009min before incubation in a 1:20 dilution of rat monoclonal anti-ABCC1 antibody (P33527, Enzo Life Sciences, Inc.) or a 1:20 dilution of mouse monoclonal anti-ABCB1 (JSB-1, ABCAM, Cambridge, MA) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Negative control slides were prepared in similar fashion but without primary antibody (primary delete).\nSlides were washed then incubated in appropriate secondary antibody for 1\u2009h at room temperature, then in Peroxidase Vectastain ABC solutions (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Immunohistochemical labeling was visualized using 3, 3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) per manufacturer's instruction (ImmPACT DAB, Vector Laboratories). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and coverslipped using Permount (Thermo Scientific).\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented as mean\u00b1standard deviation (SD) or median (range) where appropriate. Western blot data are presented as ratios of the RFI of the target protein in relation to \u03b2 actin, with between group differences determined using the Mann-Whitney rank sum test. Immunohistochemical data were analyzed qualitatively. A\np\n<0.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "Animal work was approved by the Northern Stockholm Animal Ethical Committee and performed in accordance with the Helsinki declaration.\n\nSurgery\nFemale Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (Scanbur, Germany) weighing 200\u2013275\u2009g were used. Rats were subjected to spinal contusion injury (\nn\n=90) using a dedicated instrument (NYU Impactor; Keck Center for Neuroscience,) as previously described.\n5\n,\n35\n,\n36\nPrior to surgery, animals received analgesics (buprenorphine 0.015\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneally; Temgesic;). Under anesthesia (isofluorane), the dorsal surface of the spinal cord was exposed by laminectomy of the spinal column at T10 and the caudal half of T9 (sham injury;\nn\n=10). By dropping a 10\u2009g weight from a height of 12.5 or 25\u2009mm onto the spinal cord a mild (\nn\n=30) or moderate (\nn\n=58) contusion injury, respectively, was induced. Mild injury was used in one part of the study, because such animals are able to support their own weight with the hind limbs, which allows sensory testing and automated locomotor assessment. Typically, a moderate injury results in none to a few animals being able to weight support and does not allow the above behavior tests. However, once the experiment with sensory tests had been performed, we returned to using a moderate injury, as used in our original study, because such animals have less intrinsic variability in locomotor recovery and a more robust cytokine response originating from the injured spinal cord.\nAfter surgery, analgesic treatment (buprenorphine 0.015\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneally; Temgesic) was administered once daily for 3\u2009d and prophylactic antibiotics (0.6\u2009mg/kg trimethoprim; Borgal, Hoechst AG, ) for 7\u2009d. In animals with spinal cord injury, bladders were emptied manually twice daily until the animal regained bladder function. Animals had access to food and water ad libitum and were housed three per cage. The temperature was maintained at 24\u201326\u00b0C and lights were on for 12\u2009h.\n\nImatinib preparation\nImatinib tablets were grinded and mixed with 0.1\u2009M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The suspension was brought to 37\u00b0C for 5\u2009min and then spun at 13,000\u2009rcf. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and later delivered per os at a dose of 250\u2009mg/kg using gavage. Imatinib treatment was begun 4, 8, or 24\u2009h after injury and continued daily for 14\u2009d. Each daily dose was divided into one third in the morning and two thirds in the afternoon. This dose corresponds to 800\u20131000\u2009mg given once per day in patients\n37\n,\n38\n(European medicines Agency Glivec report), and was originally chosen due to being most effective in a mouse stroke model and also later in a rat multiple sclerosis model.\n14\n,\n17\n\nSerum sampling\nRats were put in a cage heated by a heating pad for 15\u2009min prior to blood sampling, performed with the animal in a plastic constrainer. A total of 250\u2009uL was obtained from the tail vein and kept at room temperature for 20\u201330\u2009min to allow clotting. Subsequently, the tube was spun at 4800\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was collected and transferred to \u221280\u00b0C.\n\nBladder recovery\nAfter partial spinal cord injury, rats transiently lose the ability to empty their bladders. We manually emptied the bladders by applying gentle upward pressure on the bladder region of the lower abdomen using the index and middle fingers. Urine volumes were recorded.\n\nOpen field locomotion\nWe used the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scoring system to assess hind limb function in an open field. Scores 0-9 span from no hind limb function to extensive movement capability with weight support. Scores of 10\u201321 define increasing coordination of gait and additional parameters (also included in the BBB subscore) to normal gait (score 21).\n39\nWe also used the BBB subscore, which is based on paw position, toe clearance, trunk stability, and tail position.\n40\nEach animal was scored during 4\u2009min/per session (commonly weekly sessions) by two experimenters blinded to treatment. Animals were monitored for 10 weeks in the 4\u2009h delay experiment and for 11 weeks in the 8 and 24\u2009h delay experiment.\n\nAutomated locomotion\nWe used an automated paw placement detection walkway (Noldus Catwalk system; ) Weeks 8, 9, and 10 to evaluate limb coordination, denoted \u201cregularity index.\u201d We also evaluated base of support (width in between paws), stride length (length in between placements of a paw in cm), and paw area. The rats were required to perform three complete runs, defined as continuous locomotion through the measurement area on the walkway. The scores were then averaged and normalized to pre-surgical measurements.\n\nMechanical sensitivity\nWe determined hyposensitivity or hypersensitivity to mechanical stimuli from Weeks 2 to 7 by applying von Frey filaments to the hind paws (\nn\n=10/group). Prior to surgery, rats were habituated to the testing environment, consisting of a Plexiglas enclosure on top of a wire mesh floor. At the time of testing, rats were allowed to habituate for 30\u2009min and then tested with calibrated von Frey filaments, applying approximately logarithmical incremental forces (0.4, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0, and 15\u2009g), according to the \u201cup-down\u201d method.\n41\nA brisk paw withdrawal counts as a positive response and a 50% probability of withdrawal is calculated based on measures from both hind paws, averaged into one score per animal, and normalized to pre-surgery measurements.\n\nCold sensitivity\nHypersensitivity to cold stimuli was tested by directing a cold spray to the hind paws (\nn\n=10/group). Moving the affected hind limb or a localized transient skin twitch were regarded as normal responses to cold. Hypersensitivity was defined as moving away from the cold spray or moving away and vocalizing.\n\nTissue preparation\nAnimals were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused via the ascending aorta with 50\u201375\u2009mL of calcium free Tyrode solution, containing 0.1\u2009mL of heparin, followed by 250\u2009mL 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1\u2009M PBS. Spinal cord, thymus, spleen, and bone marrow were removed and post-fixed for 1\u2009h in the same fixative. The post-fixed tissues were rinsed and cryoprotected in 0.1\u2009M PBS containing 10% sucrose for 4\u2009d with one exchange of the solution. The spinal cord was divided into segments, embedded in freezing medium (NEG 50; Richard-Allan Scientific, ) and frozen on dry ice. Frozen segments were sectioned on a cryostat to produce 20-\u03bcm thick cross-sections for immunohistochemistry. Spleen, thymus, and bone marrow were prepared and sectioned in a similar manner.\n\nImmunohistochemistry and autofluorescence\nPrimary antibodies against ED1, CD206, and CD8 were used to visualize macrophages, and antibodies against OX-6 to visualize major histocompatibility complex class 2 (MHC-II). Slides were incubated in blocking solution containing 0.1\u2009M PBS and 1.5% serum (same species as the secondary antibody) prior to incubation with a primary antibody in 0.3% Triton-X 100 in 0.1\u2009M PBS overnight at 4\u00b0C. The secondary antibody (DyLight\u2122 555, Jackson Laboratories, ) was diluted in 0.3% Triton-X 100 in 0.1\u2009M PBS and sections were incubated for 1.5\u2009h in room temperature. Mounting medium contained an anti-fading agent (ProLong Gold\n\u00ae\n[with or without DAPI], Invitrogen, ).\nAutofluorescence was noted in control sections from the immunohistochemistry studies in the absence of primary, as well as secondary, antibodies, using epifluorescence microscopy (Nikon Eclipse1000; ; excitation, 450\u2013490; emission, 515\u2013565). Since such autofluorescence was mainly confined to macrophages in imatinib-treatmed animals, this parameter was also quantified.\nIn spleen and bone marrow, ED1 and autofluorescence intensity was measured from sections originating from spinal cord injured animals with (\nn\n=8) and without (\nn\n=8) imatinib treatment 7\u2009d after surgery, as well as from uninjured animals at Day 7 with (\nn\n=4) and without (\nn\n=4) imatinib treatment. The region measured in spleen was the red pulp (areas containing monocytes) and in bone marrow constituted the whole transverse section.\nAnalysis of immunoreactivity intensity and autofluorescence from the injury site of the spinal cord was measured from sections originating from spinal cord injured animals with (\nn\n=8) and without (\nn\n=8) imatinib treatment at Day 7 and with (\nn\n=7) and without (\nn\n=7) treatment at Day 1. The regions measured ED1 (the whole transverse section), Clusters of differentiation (CDxxx; the area of the injury site that displayed immunoreactivity), and autofluorescence (equally sized area boxes). SMI-312 dense area and number of OX6 positive cells, were measured from the same animals used for immunoreactivity measurements. A minimum of three sections, originating from 3\u2009mm of the center of the injury site, was used for all spinal cord injury analysis. Intensity and area measurements were performed using Fiji (\nwww.fiji.sc\n), the experimenter was blinded to section identity during time of measurement, and background was subtracted from all final measurement values of intensities.\n\nBiochemical biomarker analysis\nLevels of cytokines and chemokines were analyzed in rat serum, collected at Days 1, 3, and 7 after surgery using immunoassay kits. The experimental groups analyzed were uninjured animals for baseline measurements (\nn\n=6), spinal cord injured animals with (\nn\n=9) and without (\nn\n=9) imatinib treatment, sham-injured animals (\nn\n=10), and uninjured animals with (\nn\n=4) and without (n=4) imatinib treatment. The cytokine/chemokine kits were tested and validated following manufacturer's instructions. Rat monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-3\u03b1 levels were measured using custom made kits and concentrations of INF-\u25a1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC)/growth-regulated oncogenes (GRO) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF; Cat No N05044-1) using a multiplex (10-plex) immunoassay kit (MesoScale Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD).\nSamples were randomized before assay procedures. Plates pre-coated with antibodies towards the analytes of interest were blocked with the provided diluent for 60\u2009min and washed; thereafter, serum samples diluted 1:4 in assay diluents were added to the wells and the plates were incubated for 2\u2009h. Following washing of the plates, secondary antibody mixtures (MSD Sulfo TAG; Mesoscale Discovery) were added, and the plates were incubated for an additional 1.5\u2009hrs. All incubations were performed at room temperature. After a final washing step, read buffer (2X) was added and the plates analyzed (SECTOR Imager, SI6000, MesoScale Discovery). Lower limits of quantification were 52\u2009pg/mL for IL-1\u03b2 and IL-2, 42\u2009pg/mL for IL-5 and IL-6, 1\u2009pg/mL for IL-4, 11\u2009pg/mL for KC/GRO, and 4.3\u20136.1\u2009pg/mL for TNF, INF-\u25a1, IL-10, and IL-13. Lower limits for quantification were 39\u2009pg/mL for MIP-3\u03b1 and 624\u2009pg/mL for MCP-1 using the custom made plate.\n\nStatistical analysis\nA two-tailed Student's\nt\n-test was used for statistical analysis of immunolabeled sections with respect to intensity and area of labeling, and numbers of cells. Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's multiple comparison test was used for statistical analysis of BBB scores,\n42\nregularity index measurements, paw areas, base of support measurements, stride lengths, residual urine measurements, and mechanical hypersensitivity measurements. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze the BBB subscore. Friedman test with Dunn's multiple comparison test was used to analyze cytokine measurements for individual groups over time. Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparison test was used to analyze cytokine measurements for three groups at one time-point. Linear regression analysis was used to determine correlations between axonal rescue and cytokine measurements, as well as between autofluorecence measurements of cord and spleen to MIP-3\u03b1 measurements after imatinib treatment."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll experimental procedures were approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with the guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Animals were housed up to two rats per cage in the University of Pittsburgh vivarium with a 12:12 light/dark photoperiod and provided food and water ad libitum. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) weighing 300-350\u2009g were used in this study.\n\nCCI\nAnimals were randomly assigned to receive either sham or CCI injury. SNARE protein abundance was evaluated by immunoblotting at 6\u2009h, 1 d, one week, two weeks, and four weeks post-injury, and SNARE protein localization was visualized by immunohistochemistry at two weeks post-injury. Changes in SNARE protein levels have not been evaluated after TBI, and in order to assess temporal alterations, we selected multiple acute and chronic time-points post-injury (\nn\n=6 per injury condition at each time-point). The time-course of 6\u2009h to four weeks post-injury was selected to assess SNARE protein abundance at time-points preceding and subsequent to established impairments in hippocampal neurotransmitter release after CCI.\n13\u201315\nAdditionally, the time-course was designed to evaluate SNARE protein changes at time-points similar to the temporal progression of CA1 subfield synaptic density reductions and recovery described after CCI.\n32\nBased upon the SNARE protein immunoblot findings and the onset of impaired neurotransmission,\n14\nultrastructural intrasynaptic vesicular properties were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy at one week post-injury (\nn\n=6 per injury condition), a time-point with established deficits in evoked acetylcholine and dopamine release after CCI.\n14\n,\n18\n,\n19\nRats were anesthetized using 4% isoflurane with a 2:1\u2009N\n2\nO/O\n2\nmixture in a ventilated anesthesia chamber. Following endotracheal intubation, the rats were mechanically ventilated with a 1\u20131.5% isoflurane mixture. Animals were placed in a stereotaxic frame in the supine position and body temperature was monitored by rectal thermistor probe and maintained at 37\u00b0C with a heating pad. Following a midline incision, the soft tissues were reflected and a 7\u2009mm craniectomy was completed between bregma and lambda and centered 5\u2009mm lateral of the sagittal suture to expose the dura mater over the right parietal cortex. Control sham injury animals were subjected to anesthesia and surgical procedures, but did not receive a TBI. The CCI injury device is a small bore (1.975\u2009cm) double-acting stroked-constrained pneumatic cylinder with a 5.0\u2009cm stroke. An impactor tip (6\u2009mm in diameter) was set to produce a tissue deformation of 2.7\u2009mm at a velocity of 4\u2009m/sec with a dwell time of 150 msec. Following sham or CCI injury, the scalp was sutured, anesthesia stopped, and the righting time of each animal was monitored and recorded. Once ambulatory, the animals were returned to their home cage.\n\nBrain tissue preparation for western blot analysis\nA total of 12 rats (\nn\n=6 for each injury condition at each time-point) received an overdose of Fatal-plus (intraperitoneally, 100\u2009mg/kg sodium pentobarbital, Vortech Pharmaceuticals, Dearborn, MI) and were euthanized at 6\u2009h, 1 d, one week, two weeks, or four weeks following sham or CCI injury. After removal of the brain, the ipsilateral hippocampus was rapidly dissected on a chilled ice plate, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Samples were homogenized in lysis buffer (0.1\u2009M NaCl, 0.01\u2009M Tris-Cl, 0.001\u2009M EDTA, pH 7.6) with protease inhibitor cocktail kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The homogenized samples were centrifuged at 12,000\u00d7g at 4\u00b0C for 10\u2009min and the supernatants were collected. The protein concentration was determined by a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) using a 96-well microplate reader (Biotek, Winooski, VT).\n\nBrain tissue preparation for immunohistochemistry\nA total of 12 rats (\nn\n=6 for each injury condition) received an overdose of Fatal-plus (intraperitoneally, 100\u2009mg/kg sodium pentobarbital) at two weeks following sham and CCI injury. Animals were transcardially perfused with saline, followed by a mixture of 10% neutral buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The brains were post-fixed for an additional 24\u2009h in 10% neutral buffered formalin, and subsequently cryoprotected with 30% sucrose in 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 48\u2009h at 4\u00b0C. The brains were frozen in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) and cut into 35\u2009\u03bcm thick coronal sections on a cryostat (Leica Microsystems Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL). Sections between \u22122.5\u2009mm and \u22125.0\u2009mm bregma were selected and processed for immunofluorescence staining.\n\nBrain tissue preparation for transmission electron microscopy\nA total of 12 rats (\nn\n=6 for each injury group) received an overdose of Fatal-plus (100\u2009mg/kg sodium pentobarbital, intraperitoneally) at one week following sham or CCI injury. Animals were transcardially perfused by gravity feed with saline, followed by a mixture of 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1\u2009M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The brains were removed and placed in cold infusate for an additional 24\u2009h. A 1\u2009mm cubic block of tissue was dissected from the ipsilateral hippocampus to include the CA stratum radiatum (Rad), stratum lacunosum moleculare (LMol) and the molecular layer dentate gyrus (MoDG;\nFig. 5A\n).\n34\nThe tissue block was dissected at approximately \u22124\u2009mm bregma, the epicenter of injury. Tissue blocks were post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1\u2009M sodium phosphate buffer, stained with uranyl acetate, and cut at a thickness of 70\u2009nm. Six randomly selected sections were used for imaging and quantification.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 5.\nControlled cortical impact (CCI) altered vesicular distribution in the presynaptic nerve terminal at one week post-injury.\n(A)\nAdapted image of a stereotaxic plate diagram\n34\ndepicting the hippocampal layers in which synaptic vesicle properties were evaluated (black box).\n(B)\nRepresentative transmission electron micrographs of presynaptic nerve terminals (NT) in the hippocampus of sham and CCI brain-injured rats.

Dendritic spine (Sp).\n(C)\nCCI injury resulted in a significant reduction in the number of synaptic vesicles at one week post-injury, compared with sham injury (*\np\n<0.05, Student's\nt\n-test).\n(D)\nActive zone length was not different between sham injury and CCI injury.\n(E)\nEvaluation of vesicular frequency as a function of distance demonstrates that CCI produced a significant reduction in vesicle number within 150\u2009nm of the presynaptic active site, compared with sham-injury (#\np\n<0.01, *\np\n<0.05, post hoc\nt\n-tests following repeated measures one-way analysis of variance). Vesicle number, active zone length, and vesicular frequency were assessed in 20 randomly selected presynaptic terminals for each animal (\nn\n=6 sham-injured and\nn\n=6 brain-injured rats).\n\nImmunoblotting\nTo evaluate SNARE protein monomers, hippocampal homogenates were boiled for 10\u2009min prior to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). SNARE complex formation was assessed in unboiled protein samples to retain high molecular weight complexes, and were defined as SNAP-25 and syntaxin immunoreactive material greater than 50kDa that was absent from boiled samples as previously described.\n29\n,\n30\n,\n35\u201338\nProtein samples (20\u2009\u03bcg) and molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) were separated using SDS-PAGE. The resolved proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The blots were incubated in 5% nonfat dry milk in tris-buffered saline (blocking solution) for 1\u2009h. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. The primary antibodies utilized were: goat anti-SNAP-25 (Millipore, Billerica, MA), rabbit anti-Syntaxin (Life Span Bioscience Inc., Seattle, WA), rabbit anti-CSP alpha (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), rabbit anti-VAMP2 (Life Span Bioscience Inc.). The following day, the membranes were washed with 1\u00d7TBS buffer, incubated in blocking solution for 1\u2009h, and incubated for 1\u2009h with directly conjugated horse radish peroxidase secondary antibodies diluted in blocking solution. The secondary antibodies utilized were goat anti-mouse, goat anti-rabbit, and donkey anti-goat horse-radish peroxidase conjugated antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA). Proteins were visualized with a chemilluminescence detection system (Supersignal; Pierce). To confirm equal loading, the membranes were stripped and reprobed with mouse anti-\u03b2 actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Sham and CCI brain-injured samples were loaded in the same gel for comparison. Blots were exposed to autoradiographic x-ray film between 10\u2009sec to 5\u2009min and the optic density was quantified using SCION ImagePC (Frederick, MD) software. Values are presented as the ratio of optic densities of injured samples as a percentage of sham control for each time-point.\n\nImmunofluorescence staining\nConfocal microscopy was performed to evaluate changes in SNARE protein immunoreactivity after CCI. A two week time-point was selected for immunohistochemistry as reductions were observed in multiple SNARE proteins at the two week time-point by immunoblot. Immunohistochemical staining was completed in 24-well culture plates on free-floating tissue sections. At least four sections per animal spanning the hippocampus were rinsed with 0.1\u2009M PBS buffer and blocked with 10% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1\u2009M PBS for 1\u2009h. Sections were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the same rabbit anti-CSP alpha (Abcam), rabbit ani-VAMP2 (Life Span Bioscience Inc.), and goat anti-SNAP-25 (Millipore) antibodies utilized for immunoblot analysis. On the following day, sections were rinsed with 0.1\u2009M PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies directly conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 and 594 fluorophores (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Inc.) for 1\u2009h. Labeled sections were rinsed with 0.1\u2009M PBS, incubated with DAPI (Vectashield; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) mounted on Superfrost slides (Fisher Scientific), and stored at 4\u00b0C. Control experiments, in which primary antibodies were omitted, were completed in parallel to confirm antibody specificity. Images were acquired on a C2 confocal microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY). Representative images in the figures are maximum intensity projection images collected as a\nz\nstack (1.5\u2009\u03bcm step size) at 20\u00d7magnification.\n\nTransmission electron imaging and quantification\nFor each animal, 20 randomly selected synapses were imaged in six sections using a transmission electron microscope (JEOL 1011; Peabody, MA). The methodology for quantification was based upon previously published reports evaluating synaptic vesicular properties.\n23\u201326\n,\n39\u201342\nThe synapses were imaged at 100,000\u00d7magnification and the acquired images were utilized for quantification. To examine vesicle number, the area within 450\u2009nm of the active zone was defined and the total number of vesicles was manually counted in each imaged synapse using Metamorph software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The length of the active zone, defined by a thickened presynaptic membrane with electron dense material in alignment with the postsynaptic membrane, was measured in each synapse using Metamorph software. Mean vesicle number and active zone length values were calculated for each animal and used to calculate the average value for the injury group. To assess vesicular distribution, the shortest distance between the center of a vesicle and the active zone was measured for every vesicle, within 250\u2009nm of the active zone, with Metamorph software. Vesicles smaller than 25\u2009nm were excluded to prevent inclusion of microtubules, which have a cross-sectional diameter of 20\u2009nm and could not be differentiated from vesicles in the electron micrographs.\n24\nTo evaluate alterations in vesicle number as a function of distance, 50\u2009nm bins were designated and used to determine changes in vesicle frequency in 50\u2009nm intervals from the active zone. The bin for distance 0-50\u2009nm encompasses vesicles that were in the fusion or docking process, or in a position primed for docking. A mean vesicle frequency for each 50\u2009nm bin was determined for each animal, and used to calculate the average vesicle frequency in that distance bin for that group.\n\nStatistical analyses\nAll quantification was completed by an investigator blinded to the injury conditions of each animal. Data are presented as mean\u00b1standard error of the mean (SEM). Quantification of total vesicle number and active zone length were compared using a Student's\nt\n-test. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to compare the cumulative distribution of synaptic vesicle frequency. A repeated measures one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Bonferroni post hoc\nt\n-test was used to compare synaptic vesicle frequency as a function of distance from the active zone. Immunoblot data for each SNARE protein were compared by two-way ANOVA followed by a Bonferonni post hoc\nt\n-test, when appropriate. Statistical tests were completed using Graphpad (Graphpad, La Jolla, CA). A\np\nvalue of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all comparisons."

    "Methods": "All study protocols were approved by the East of England (Essex) NHS Research Ethics Committee (ref 11/EE/0075). Assent from patients' next of kin was obtained. Eligible patients were adults (>18 years) admitted post-TBI with contusions evident on computed tomography (CT) imaging and requiring neurointensive care treatment. Patients were classified as having severe injury if the presenting Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was less than or equal to 8.9Severity of injury based on the initial computed tomography (CT) scan was graded using the modified Marshall scoring system.10All patients received sedation (with or without neuromuscular blockade) and mechanical ventilation, together with multi-modality monitoring, and were managed according to a standardized tiered therapy protocol.11Recovery at 6 months was measured on the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and dichotomized as good (GOS 4 or 5) or poor (GOS 1\u20133) outcome.12\n\nMonitoring\nInvasive neuromonitoring was inserted at two sites for each patient with the intention of having a microdialysis catheter within radiologically normal white matter and another within pericontusional brain, but avoiding the hemorrhagic core. On admission, a triple-lumen cranial access device (Technicam, Newton Abbot, UK) was placed in the right or left frontal region as standard in our unit. An ICP monitor (Codman, Raynham, MA), a brain-tissue oxygen probe (Licox Neurosciences, Andover, UK), and a microdialysis catheter (CMA 71; 100-kDA molecular weight cutoff) perfused with 3.5% (w/v) human albumin solution (Pharmacy Manufacturing Unit, Ipswich Hospital NHS Trust, Ipswich, UK) in central nervous system (CNS) perfusion fluid were introduced through the access device. After assent, up to three further invasive monitors, at least one of which was a microdialysis catheter (CMA 71 and perfused with 3.5% albumin solution, as described above) were placed in proximity to a contusion, either through a second cranial access device or twist drill holes. If the first set of monitors happened to be placed adjacent to a contusion, the second set were inserted in radiologically normal brain on the contralateral frontal region. In patients requiring an emergent craniotomy for an acute subdural hematoma (SDH), the pericontusional monitoring was placed adjacent to underlying contusions under direct vision at the end of surgery, tunneled through the scalp.\n\nSample analysis\nHourly microdialysates were pooled into 8-h samples. All samples were analyzed using the Milliplex Multi-Analyte Profiling Human MMP five-plex (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-9, and MMP-10) analyte premixed kit (Millipore, St Charles, MI), according to the manufacturer's instructions. All samples were assayed in duplicate wells (25\u2009\u03bcL per well), and the mean of these results was used. Plates were read using a Luminex 200 analyzer (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX) running STarStation software (Applied Cytometry Systems, Sheffield, UK). Protein concentrations were calculated by reference to an eight-point spline fit curve for each MMP.\n\nStatistical analysis\nTo mitigate the effects of different monitoring periods in each patient, the mean concentrations of each MMP in the first 72\u2009h postinjury (<72\u2009h) and in the subsequent 72\u2009h (>72\u2009h) were calculated for each patient. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with MMP concentration as the dependent variable, and site of monitoring (normal vs. injured) and time (<72\u2009h vs. >72\u2009h) as the independent variables, was then applied for each MMP separately. Univariate subgroup comparisons were analyzed with the independent-samples\nt\n-test. All calculations were performed in R software (v3.0.2,\nwww.r-project.org\n) and considered significant at 5%."

The anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA).\n\nTBI model\nThe parasagittal fluid percussion injury (FPI) model was produced using male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats weighing 270 to 320\u2009g (Charles River Laboratories, Raleigh, NC). All experimental procedures were in compliance with the\nNational Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\nand approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee in the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. All feasible measures were taken to reduce animal suffering and the numbers of animals used for these experiments.\nThe basic surgical preparation for brain injury was performed according to the previously described methods.\n10\n,\n11\nAnimals were maintained for at least 7 days before the experiment in a temperature-regulated room (23\u201325\u00b0C) on a 12\u2009h light/dark cycle. The rats were fasted, but allowed free access to water overnight before the procedure. Moderate TBI was produced with fluid-percussion pressure levels of 2.0\u00b10.2 atmospheres (atm). Rats were anesthetized with 3.0% isoflurane in a gas mixture of 70% N\n2\nO and 30% O\n2\n. The femoral artery was cannulated to deliver pancuronium bromide (0.5\u2009mg/kg, intravenously) every 1\u2009h during the surgical procedure to immobilize the rats.\nAn endotracheal tube was inserted, and the rats were mechanically ventilated with 70% N\n2\nO, 0.5% - 1.5% isoflurane, and a balance of O\n2\n. The animals were then placed in a stereotaxic frame, and a 4.8\u2009mm craniotomy was made over the right parietal cortex (3.8\u2009mm posterior to bregma, 2.5\u2009mm lateral to the midline). A plastic injury tube (18 gauge modified Precision Glide needle hub, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) was placed over the exposed dura and fixed with dental acrylic.\nBefore and after TBI, blood gases and mean arterial blood pressure were monitored and maintained at physiologic levels. Brain temperature was monitored with a thermistor probe placed in the left temporalis muscle, whereas core temperature was determined with a rectal thermometer. Brain temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C with self-adjusting feedback heating lamps. Blood gases, blood glucose, and hematocrit values were monitored 15\u2009min before TBI, 15\u2009min after TBI, and then once every hour for up to 4\u2009h after TBI. All animals were maintained within physiologic ranges for mean arterial pressure (120\u2013140\u2009mm Hg), pO\n2\nblood gas levels (105\u2013170\u2009mm Hg), pCO\n2\nblood gas levels (35\u201345\u2009mm Hg), and blood pH (7.38\u20137.41).\nThree sets of tissue samples from a total of 56 rats were prepared for biochemical, confocal, and EM studies, respectively. The biochemical samples were prepared from a series of sham-operated control rats and rats subjected to TBI followed by 4\u2009h and 1, 3, 5, and 15 days of recovery. The confocal microscopic sections were prepared from another series of sham-operated control rats and rats subjected to TBI followed by 1, 3, 5, and 15 days of recovery. The EM sections were prepared from the third series of sham-operated control rats and rats subjected to TBI followed by 3 and 15 days of recovery.\nFor the biochemical analysis, we performed a sample size estimate using SigmaStat with a power of 0.80, indicating that there was an 80% chance of detecting a statistical difference between groups. Based on this analysis, four animals in every sham-operated control or post-TBI experimental group were used for preparing all three sets of tissue samples. Sham-operated rats were subjected to identical surgical procedures, but without the fluid-percussion injury pulse.\nAfter TBI, anesthesia was discontinued, and the animals were returned to their cages. At the recovery time point to collect brain samples, the animals were anesthetized, tracheotomized, and artificially ventilated with 70% N\n2\nO, 0.5\u20131.5% isoflurane, and a balance of O\n2\n. A 50\u2009mL centrifuge tube with an open bottom was embedded into a skin incision on the top of the skull and then filled with liquid nitrogen while the respiration was maintained with the ventilator. Brains were carefully removed from the liquid nitrogen-frozen heads with a saw, a hammer, and a chisel. The right, injured ipsilateral parietal cortex was dissected in a glove box freezer (\u221212\u00b0C) as described previously.\n12\nThis brain dissection method prevents brain biochemical changes during the processes of decapitation and isolation of brains from the skull.\n12\nFor confocal microscopy, animals were anesthetized and ventilated with a respirator. They were then perfused via ascending aorta with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), sectioned with a vibratome, and stored in an anti-freeze solution at \u221220\u00b0C until use. For EM, rats were perfused with ice-cold 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1\u2009M cacodylate buffer.\n\nConfocal and electron microscopy\nFor light microscopic examination, 50 \u03bcm vibratome sections were stained with acid fuchsin and celestine blue. Brain sections at bregma \u22123.60\u2009mm of the hippocampal level were examined by light microscopy.\nFor confocal microscopy, double-labeled fluorescence immunocytochemistry was performed on coronal brain sections (50\u2009\u03bcm) according to the method described in our previous studies.\n6\nBecause FPI damages the lateral neocortical and hippocampal CA3 areas,\n11\nbrain sections at the hippocampal level (bregma\u22123.6\u2009mm) were used for confocal microscopic studies. Briefly, after washing and blocking, brain sections were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with a primary antibody (e.g., Invitrogen LAMP2A antibody or a cell marker antibody, 1:250 dilution in TBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 3% bovine serum albumin). After washing, the sections were incubated either with fluorescein-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:500, Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA) or anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:500, Life technologies) for 1\u2009h at room temperature.\nFor propidium iodide (PI) staining of brain sections, 10\u2009\u03bcL of PI stock solution (1\u2009\u03bcg/mL in PBS) was added to 1\u2009mL of the secondary antibody solution before incubation with secondary antibody. PI can penetrate into all cells after paraformaldehyde fixation, and thus stains all nuclei in paraformaldehyde-fixed brain sections. Dead neurons can often be recognized with PI staining because they have shrunken and polygonal nuclei, and the lack of immunostaining in the cytoplasm.\n6\nSections were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). At the hippocampal level (bregma \u22123.6\u2009mm), the center area of the lateral neocortex, middle segments of hippocampal CA1 and CA3, and middle segment of the DG upper blade were examined with a Zeiss 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY).\nFor EM, coronal brain sections at the same hippocampal level (bregma \u22123.6\u2009mm) were prepared according to the method described previously.\n6\n,\n13\nBriefly, brains after perfusion-fixation were sectioned with a vibratome at 100\u2009\u03bcm. For the conventional EM, brain sections were postfixed for 2\u2009h with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1\u2009M cacodylate buffer immediately, rinsed in distilled water, stained with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate overnight, dehydrated, and embedded between two glass slides with Durcopan ACM. A small piece of embedded tissue section about 2 square millimeters either from the center of the lateral neocortical area or the middle segment of hippocampal CA3 was dissected out from embedded brain sections and mounted onto a resin block. The ultrathin sections were cut, counterstained with lead citrate, and evaluated with a ZEISS 10A Transmission Electron Microscope (Zeiss Inc.).\nFor the ethanolic phosphotungstic acid (EPTA) EM, brain sections were dehydrated in an ascending series of ethanol to 100% and stained for 45\u2009min with 1% phosphotungstic acid (PTA) prepared by dissolving 0.1g of PTA in 10\u2009mL of 100 ethanol and adding 100\u2009\u03bcL of 95% ethanol. Sections were then embedded in Durcupan ACM. Ultrathin sections (0.1 \u25a1m) were prepared and examined with an electron microscope without additional staining.\n\nPreparation of subcellular fractions\nBrain tissue homogenate and subcellular fractions were prepared from sham-operated rats and rats subjected to moderate (2.0 atm) TBI followed by 4\u2009h and 1, 3, 5, and 15 days of recovery according to the method described previously.\n14\nThe TBI ipsilateral neocortical tissues were dissected and chopped into small pieces in a \u221215\u00b0C glove box freezer, and then homogenized on ice with a Dounce homogenizer (35 strokes, 4\u00b0C) in 10 volumes of homogenization buffer: 15 mmol/L Tris pH 7.6, 0.25\u2009mol/L sucrose, 1 mmol/L MgCl\n2\n, 2.5 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA (ethylene glycol-bis [b-amino ethyl ether] tetraacetic acid), 1 mmol/L dithiothreitol, 1.25\u2009\u03bcg/mL pepstatin A, 10\u2009\u03bcg/mL leupeptin, 2.5\u2009\u03bcg/mL aprotinin, 0.5 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mmol/L Na\n3\nVO\n4\n, 50 mmol/L NaF, and 2 mmol/L Na\n4\nP\n2\nO\n7\n.\nHomogenates were centrifuged at 800\ng\nat 4\u00b0C for 10\u2009min to obtain P1 pellets (containing the heaviest cellular components, including the nuclei and secondary lysosomes) and supernatants (S1). The S1 was further centrifuged at 10,000\ng\nat 4\u00b0C for 10\u2009min to obtain crude cell membrane/synaptosomal/mitochondrial pellet (P2) and its supernatant (S2). The S2 were centrifuged again at 165,000\ng\nat 4\u00b0C for 1\u2009h to obtain the cytosol S3 and the microsomal pellet P3 that contains intracellular membrane structures such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), lysosome, and Golgi. All pellet fractions were suspended in homogenization buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Each subcellular fraction was assayed for total protein concentration using the Coomassie Plus assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).\n\nWestern blot analysis\nEqual protein amounts in subcellular fractions were electrophoresed on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) and then transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). The membranes were incubated with 3% BSA in TBS for 30\u2009min, and then overnight at 4\u00b0C with a primary antibody. After washing, the membranes were further incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies for 1\u2009h at room temperature (1:2,000; Cell Signaling Technology, Billerica, MA).\nIn some experiments, the \u03b2-actin levels on the immunoblots were determined as endogenous protein loading controls. The immunoblots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Pierce Biosciences, Rockford, IL) and developed on Kodak X-omat LS film (Eastman Kodak Company, New Haven, CT). Densitometry was performed with Kodak ID image analyses software (Eastman Kodak Company). All Western blot data were expressed as the ratio of the levels of the protein of interest and \u03b2-actin.\n\nDeglycosylation assay\nEach sample solution (10\u2009\u03bcL) containing 10\u2009\u03bcg of P1 fraction, distilled water, and 1\u2009\u03bcL of 10 times glycoprotein denaturing buffer (5% SDS, 0.4M DTT), was denatured by heating at 100\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. After denaturation, the samples were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1\u2009h with a cocktail of enzymes: 2\u2009\u03bcL of 10x G7 Reaction Buffer (0.5M sodium phosphate, pH 7.5 at 25\u00b0C), 2\u2009\u03bcL of 10% NP-40, 2\u2009\u03bcL PNGase F (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), and 4\u2009\u03bcL distilled H\n2\nO. After incubation, SDS sample buffer (five times stock solution) was added to each reaction mixture and then subjected to Western blot analysis.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are expressed as mean\u00b1standard deviation (SD) as a percentage of sham-operated control levels. One-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey\npost hoc\ntest was used for statistical analysis. For comparison of two groups of experimental data, unpaired Student\nt\ntest was used. *\np\n<0.05 between sham and post-TBI groups."

    "Methods": "Selection of risk prediction models\nPerel and colleagues previously conducted a systematic review to identify and assess existing risk prediction models for TBI published up to 2005.\n6\nA total of 53 studies (reporting 102 models) were identified. Of these, the models developed by Signorini and colleagues (1999)\n8\nand Hukkelhoven and colleagues (2005)\n9\nwere reported by the authors to be the \u201cmost clinically useful\u201d for patients from high-income countries with moderate and severe TBI, as they fulfilled the majority of the methodological requirements and showed acceptable performance in external validation.\nThe first stage of the model selection process for the RAIN Study was to update the existing systematic review to identify additional risk prediction models for TBI that had been published since 2006. The systematic review was updated using the original published search strategy and inclusion criteria to identify risk prediction models that: 1) gave an overall prognostic estimation by combining the predictive information from at least two variables (studies could develop new models or evaluate previous ones); 2) used variables collected before hospital discharge; 3) included patients of any age; 4) included patients with any type or severity of TBI; and 5) predicted any outcome. To select models that were most likely to have good performance in a setting of adult patients in the UK, risk prediction models identified from the updated systematic review were additionally assessed against the following eligibility criteria to identify models for external validation in the RAIN Study that: 1) were based on predominantly adult (>16 years) populations; 2) had a sample size of greater than 500 patients in either the development and/or validation dataset; 3) aimed to evaluate outcome regardless of care received during the hospital stay; and 4) were multicenter (or, if single center, UK based).\nEligible models identified from the updated systematic review, plus the two most clinically useful models from the original systematic review, were reviewed by the RAIN Study Steering Group (see\nAcknowledgements\n) to determine if there were any relevant models that had been missed and to select the most appropriate models for external validation in the RAIN Study.\n\nProspective cohort study\nIn order to externally validate the selected risk prediction models, a prospective cohort study was undertaken in adult critical care units (including dedicated neurocritical care units, combined neuro/general critical care units within a neuroscience center and general critical care units outside a neuroscience center). All critical care units in the 32 UK neuroscience centers were invited to participate and also critical care units outside neuroscience centers that participate in the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre Case Mix Programme (ICNARC CMP) \u2013 the national clinical audit for adult critical care in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. All adult patients (ages 16 years or older) admitted to participating critical care units following an actual or suspected TBI, and with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of less than 15 following resuscitation were identified. Patients who were subsequently found to not have a TBI were excluded. The RAIN Study was approved by the NHS Research Ethics Committee for Wales (09/MRE09/10) and the Scotland A Research Ethics Committee (09/MRE00/15). Patients were enrolled without informed consent under the provisions of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000. The Ethics and Confidentiality Committee of the National Information Governance Board gave support under Section 251 of the NHS Act 2006 for permission to hold sufficient patient identifiable data to contact the patient and gain their consent (approval number ECC 2-06(d)/2009).\nThe RAIN Study dataset was developed from the original publications reporting each risk prediction model, any other associated publications and, where available, original study documentation relating to the data sources. Data were entered onto a dedicated secure web portal and were validated centrally for incomplete, inaccurate and inconsistent data. To avoid duplication of data collection, data for the RAIN Study were linked with data for the same patients from the ICNARC CMP and from the Scottish Intensive Care Society Audit Group\u2014the equivalent national clinical audit in Scotland.\nPatients were followed up to six months for mortality by linkage with death registration and for unfavorable outcome (death or severe disability) with the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale administered by postal or telephone questionnaire, using methods based on those employed in previous research studies.\n10\n,\n11\nAlthough a GCS score of less than 15 was an inclusion criterion for the RAIN Study, some patients with suspected TBI were recruited with no GCS recorded, and others that had an initial GCS score of less than 15, either pre-hospital or on presentation at hospital, subsequently improved prior to sedation. Patients from the RAIN Study database were included in the analysis if their last GCS prior to sedation/admission to critical care was less than 15.\nPredictor variables were calculated from the raw data in the RAIN Study database; definitions are provided in\nTable 1\n.\nTable\n1.\nDefinitions of Predictor Variables\nPredictor\nDefinition\nAge\nAge in whole years at the time of TBI, calculated from the date of birth and date of TBI.\nGCS\nThe last recorded GCS prior to sedation, which may have been either the pre-hospital GCS, the first recorded at hospital GCS, or a subsequent measurement prior to sedation and admission to the critical care unit.\nMotor score\nThe motor score component of the last pre-sedation GCS.\nPupil reactivity\nThe first recorded at hospital pupil reactivity, if available, or the pre-hospital pupil reactivity if no first at hospital value was available. Pupil reactivity was recorded for the left and right eye separately and combined as either both reactive, one reactive, or neither reactive. If only one eye could be assessed, pupil reactivity was assigned as \u201cboth reactive\u201d if this eye was reactive and \u201cneither reactive\u201d if this eye was not reactive.\nMajor extracranial injury\nDefined as an injury requiring hospital admission in its own right.\nPre-hospital hypoxia\nDefined as either a pre-hospital oxygen saturation less than 90%, or pre-hospital hypoxia strongly suspected if there was clinical evidence of hypoxia (e.g., tension pneumothorax) but no pre-hospital oxygen saturation was recorded.\nPre-hospital hypotension\nDefined as either a pre-hospital systolic blood pressure less than 90\u2009mm Hg, or pre-hospital hypotension strongly suspected if there was clinical evidence of hypotension (e.g., multiple trauma with massive blood loss) but no pre-hospital systolic blood pressure was recorded.\nMarshall CT classification\nBased on the first CT scan following the TBI, and defined as: 1) Diffuse injury I\u2014no visible pathology seen on CT scan (first CT scan result normal); (2) Diffuse injury II\u2014basal cisterns present, midline shift 0-5\u2009mm, no high- or mixed-density lesion>25\u2009mL; 3) Diffuse injury III\u2014basal cisterns compressed or absent, midline shift 0-5\u2009mm, no high- or mixed-density lesion>25\u2009mL; 4) Diffuse injury IV\u2014midline shift>5\u2009mm, no high- or mixed-density lesion>25\u2009mL; 5) Evacuated mass lesion\u2014any high- or mixed-density lesion>1\u2009mL surgically evacuated; 6) Non-evacuated mass lesion>25\u2009mL\u2014high- or mixed-density lesion>25\u2009mL not surgically evacuated.\nTraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage\nDefined as a collection of blood between the arachnoid and pia mater either over the convexity or in the basal cisterns.\nOne or more small petechial hemorrhages\nIncludes small petechial hemorrhages at gray-white matter junction, hemispheric white matter, corpus callosum or brainstem.\nObliteration of the third ventricle or basal cisterns\nThird ventricle recorded as \u201cobliterated\u201d or basal cisterns recorded as \u201cabsent.\u201d\nMidline shift over 5\u2009mm\nDefined as degree of displacement of the midline greater than 5\u2009mm.\nNon-evacuated hematoma\nAny high- or mixed-density lesion>1\u2009mL not surgically evacuated.\nExtradural hematoma\nDefined as an accumulation of blood between the skull and dura mater.\nFirst at hospital glucose\nThe first serum glucose value from blood sampled within 12\u2009h of attendance at the first hospital for the TBI.\nFirst at hospital hemoglobin\nThe first hemoglobin value from blood sampled within 12\u2009h of attendance at the first hospital for the TBI.\nOpen in a separate window\nTBI, traumatic brain injury; GCS, Glasgow Coma Scale; CT, computed tomography.\n\nHandling of missing data\nMissing data in the RAIN Study database were addressed with multiple imputation.\n12\n,\n13\nAs the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale is conditional on survival status, the imputation was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, imputation models were specified for predictors and for mortality at six months, considering other fully-observed covariates (such as age and GCS score). In the second stage, for each of the previously imputed datasets, imputation models were specified for the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale for those patients who were either known to be alive at six months or were predicted to be alive by the first stage imputation model, considering fully-observed covariates and intermediate endpoints (such as hospital length of stay). Each multiple imputation model assumed that the data were missing at random, conditional on the variables included in the imputation models. Five imputed datasets were generated at each stage of the imputation,\n13\ngiving 25 imputed datasets in total. All multiple imputation models were implemented in R (\nwww.r-project.org\n) using Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations.\n14\nAs a sensitivity analysis, all analyses were repeated using the original (non-imputed) data.\n\nValidation datasets\nFor the primary analysis, each model was validated in the multiply imputed datasets, using: 1) all patients in the RAIN Study with a last pre-sedation GCS score of less than 15; and 2) only those patients meeting the original inclusion criteria for each model. For the validation of risk prediction models for mortality at six months, the five datasets from the first stage imputation were used. For the validation of risk prediction models for unfavorable outcome at six months, the 25 datasets from the second stage imputation were used.\nAs a sensitivity analysis, the analysis for models predicting unfavorable outcome in all patients in the RAIN Study database\u2014 analysis 1) above\u2014was repeated excluding those patients assigned to the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale category of severe disability that was either pre-existing or not due to the TBI.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe case mix and outcomes of patients reported for the original development sample for each risk prediction model were compared with those in the RAIN Study database that met the original inclusion criteria for the respective model and with all patients in the RAIN Study database.\nEach risk prediction model was validated in each of the five RAIN Study validation datasets using measures of calibration, discrimination and overall fit, as described below. For multiply imputed data, measures of model performance were calculated in each imputed dataset and combined using Rubin's rules.\n12\nChi-square test statistics were combined to calculate an F statistic using the method of Li and colleagues\n15\nDiscrimination was assessed on the C index,\n16\nwhich is equivalent to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.\n17\nCalibration was assessed by graphical plots of observed against expected risk both continuously, using non-parametric locally-weighted sum of squares (LOWESS) smoothers,\n18\nand by categories, in 10 equal-sized groups by predicted risk. The magnitude and direction of miscalibration was assessed using Cox's calibration regression.\n19\nOverall fit was assessed using Brier's score, the mean squared error between the outcome and prediction.\n20\nThe risk prediction models were recalibrated by estimating new coefficients for each model in the full validation dataset. The recalibrated models were assessed using the C index and Brier's score, adjusted for potential optimism from fitting and evaluating the models in the same dataset using Efron's bootstrap method.\n21\nAnalyses were conducted using Stata/SE Version 13.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nExperimental animals were humanely housed and cared for under the supervision of the Institute of Comparative Medicine, and all experimental procedures were conducted under the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Columbia University. WT mice contained a nestin-\u03b4-HSV TK-eGFP transgene, as developed and characterized previously,\n2\n,\n3\nwhich provided GFP labeling of nestin-expressing early neural progenitor cells. ApoE KO and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-ApoE3 and GFAP-ApoE4 transgenic mice maintained on a murine ApoE-null background were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). GFAP-ApoE mice express human ApoE alleles under the control of the GFAP. ApoE KO mice and GFAP-ApoE mice were crossed with nestin-\u03b4-HSV TK-eGFP mice to generate ApoE KO or GFAP-ApoE heterozygous mice with GFP expression in nestin-expressing progenitor cells.\n\nCCI injury\nExperimental injury was induced in eight-week-old (26 males and 21 females) WT, ApoE KO, and GFAP-ApoE transgenic mice as previously described.\n2\nBriefly, mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane with supplemental 1\u2009L flow of oxygen and placed in a stereotactic frame. Body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C using a heating pad (Adroit, Loudon, TN). Following a midline incision on the scalp, the soft tissues were reflected and a 5\u2009mm by 5\u2009mm craniectomy was performed between bregma and lambda, to the left of the sagittal suture, to expose the underlying dura. A cortical contusion injury was delivered using a Leica One Stereotaxic Impactor device (Leica, Houston, TX) to impact the exposed dura with a 3\u2009mm stainless steel impounder tip at a speed of 4.4\u2009m/sec, deformation of 0.7\u2009mm, and dwell time of 0.3\u2009sec. After injury, the scalp was closed with sutures and the animals were removed from anesthesia and allowed to recover.\n\nFluorescent activated cell sorting (FACs)\nSeventy-two h after CCI injury, mice were sacrificed and the hippocampus dissected from both hemispheres of nestin-GFP transgenic animals (\nn\n=8). Individual hippocampi were coronally sectioned into 600\u2009\u03bcm slices and the dentate gyrus extracted from all slices. The digestion media consisted of activated papain: 42\u2009\u03bcL of papain (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ), 27\u2009\u03bcL of 100\u2009mM Cystein-HCl and 6\u2009\u03bcL of 100\u2009mM EDTA in 425\u2009\u03bcL of DMEM/F12. The single-cell suspension was sorted using a MoFlo cell sorter (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) with fluorescent activated cell sorting analysis. RNA was extracted from sorted cells with RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Total RNA was synthesized into complementary DNA (cDNA) with reverse transciptase using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Biorad, Hercules, CA). Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on an Applied Biosystems 7900 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primer sequences for real time PCR were (5\u2032-3\u2032): ApoE Forward, TCCTGTCCTGCAACAACATCC, ApoE Reverse, AGGTGCTTGAGACAGGGCC; GAPDH Forward, CCATTCT CGGCCTTGACTGT, GAPDH Reverse, CTCAACTACATGGTC TACATGTTCCA. All primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA).\n\nTissue homogenization\nForty-eight h after CCI injury, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and underwent transcardiac perfusion with 15\u2009mL of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS;\nn\n=6 for WT;\nn\n=3\u20134 for GFAP-ApoE3 and GFAP-ApoE4;\nn\n=3 for ApoE-KO mice). For comparison of protein levels in the ipsilateral versus contralateral hippocampi of injured CCI mice, individual hippocampi were dissected on ice from ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres and placed in 250\u2009\u03bcL of ice-cold lysis buffer (150\u2009mM NaCl, 20\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 1% IGEPAL, 10% glycerol, 1\u2009\u03bcg/mL leupeptin, 10\u03bcg/mL aprotinin). Tissue was manually homogenized in a 1.5\u2009mL Eppendorf tube using a polypropylene pestle (Kimble Chase, Vineland, NJ), incubated on ice for 15\u2009min, and centrifuged at 16,000\u2009rpm at 4\u00b0C for 20\u2009min. The supernatant was then collected.\n\nWestern immunoblot analysis\nProtein concentration of hippocampal supernatant samples was determined by DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Protein samples were resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE gel (Mini-PROTEAN TGX Gel; Bio-Rad), transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), blocked for 1\u2009h in blocking buffer (5% Blotting-Grade Blocker (Bio-Rad) in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 [TBST]). Membranes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with goat anti-ApoE antibody (1:5000; Millipore, Billerica, MA) or mouse anti-beta-actin antibody (1:5000; Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) in blocking buffer. The membranes were washed three times in TBST, then incubated 1\u2009h at room temperature with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies anti-goat immunoglobulin G (IgG) (1:5000; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) or anti-mouse IgG (1:5000; Jackson ImmunoResearch) in blocking buffer. The membranes were washed three times, and protein was detected using Clarity Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad) and visualized on HyBlot CL film (Denville Scientific, South Plainfield, NJ). Due to similar protein size of ApoE and beta-actin, membranes were stripped with 0.02% NaN\n3\nin 5% blotting-grade blocker in TBST at room temperature for 1\u2009h before beta-actin antibody binding. Protein bands were quantified by densitometric analysis using ImageJ software and normalized to actin (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nForty-eight h following CCI or sham surgery, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100mg/kg 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyruridine (BrdU; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) then, 2\u2009h later, were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and sacrificed by transcardiac perfusion with 15\u2009mL ice-cold PBS followed by 40\u2009mL ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Whole brains were extracted and underwent overnight fixation in 4% PFA. Post-fixation, whole brains were embedded in 4% agarose gels and serial 50\u2009\u03bcm coronal sections were cut in a series of six sections through the rostro-caudal length of the hippocampus using a vibratome (VT1000S, Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL). For BrdU staining, a set of sections containing every sixth slice was washed with PBS three times, rinsed with water, and denatured with 1N HCl in a 37\u00b0C water bath for 45\u2009min. Sections were then washed with 0.3% Triton X-100/1xPBS (PBST) three times and blocked with 5% normal donkey serum (NDS; Sigma-Aldrich) in PBST at room temperature for 1\u2009h. Sections were incubated with mouse anti-BrdU antibody (1:500, BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA) and rabbit anti-GFP antibody (1:500, Invitrogen) in 5% NDS with PBST overnight at 4\u00b0C.\nThe following day, sections were washed with PBST three times and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch) and Alexa Fluor 594 anti-mouse IgG (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch) in 5% NDS with PBST for 3\u2009h at room temperature. Sections were then washed with PBST twice, PBS twice, then mounted on slides with VECTASHIELD Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and sealed with coverslips. For ApoE staining, a series of one-in-six sections was prepared as above. Sections were washed in PBST three times, blocked in 5% NDS with PBST for 1\u2009h at room temperature, then incubated with goat anti-ApoE (1:50,000; Millipore) in PBST with 0.02% NaN\n3\nat room temperature for 2 d. After 2 d, the sections were washed with PBST three times and with PBS three times, and incubated with biotinylated anti-goat IgG (1:8000; Jackson ImmunoResearch) in PBST with 0.02% NaN\n3\nat room temperature for 2 d. After 2 d, the sections were washed with PBS three times, incubated with ABC Reagent (VECTASTAIN; Vector Laboratories) at room temperature for 1\u2009h, washed with PBS three times, incubated with horse-radish peroxidase-streptavidin and Alexa Fluor 568 tyramide (TSA Kit, Invitrogen) for 15\u2009min, washed with PBS three times, then mounted on slides with mounting medium and sealed with coverslips. For ApoE with co-staining for GFAP or GFP, on Day 5 of the ApoE protocol, instead of mounting the sections, rabbit anti-GFAP antibody (1:200, Dako) or rabbit anti-GFP antibody (1:500, Invitrogen) in 5% NDS with PBST was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. The next day, slides were washed three times with PBST and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch) in 5% NDS with PBST for 3\u2009h at room temperature. Sections were then washed with PBST twice and with PBS twice, then mounted on slides with VECTASHIELD Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories) and sealed with coverslips.\n\nQuantification and statistics\nTo determine the number of GFP- and BrdU-expressing cells in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, an unbiased stereological approach was used (\nn\n=3\u20134 per mice per group for sham;\nn\n=5\u20136 mice per group for CCI). A set of sections containing one in every sixth coronal slice, spanning the rostral 75\u201380% of the hippocampus, were immunostained and visualized using a Zeiss microscope (Zeiss Axio Imager M2, Thornwood, NY) with a Hamamatsu camera (Hamamatsu Orca-R2; Bridgewater, NJ). The cells were counted using an optical fractionator and stereological image analysis software (StereoInvestigator; MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT). The subgranular zone, our area of interest, was outlined under a 20\u00d7 objective lens. The stereological software selected sample frames (70\u2009\u03bcm\u00d770\u2009\u03bcm) at random, and cells in the counting frames (40\u2009\u03bcm\u00d740\u2009\u03bcm) were counted under a 63\u00d7 oil-immersion objective. Co-localization of GFP and BrdU also were performed with the 63\u00d7 oil-immersion objective. The cell number was estimated by the software using weighted section thickness to yield an absolute number of total cells within the rostral 75\u201380% of the dentate gyrus. Data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software, LaJolla, CA).\nFor cell counts in sham SGZ, CCI ipsilateral SGZ and CCI contralateral SGZ were compared using one-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc analysis with Tukey's multiple comparison test. Both ipsilateral and contralateral are included in SGZ cell counts because there was no statistical difference between ipsilateral and contralateral sides in sham-injured mice. For comparison of ApoE expression in ipsilateral and contralateral dentate gyrus by Western blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), paired\nt\n-test was performed. A\np\nvalue of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Images were obtained with a Leica Confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP5 MP, Buffalo Grove, IL)."

    "Methods": "Nanoparticles and gel plug delivery system\nNanoparticles\nNanoparticles were formulated at Clemson University (Bioengineering Department) using the nanoprecipitation method as described previously.\n44\n,\n45\nBriefly, 50:50 poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) was mixed with polyethylene glycol\u2013polylactic acid (PEG-PLA) copolymer, and 17-\u03b2 estradiol (E2) (Sigma E2758) in a 10:2.5:1 (wt) ratio. The vehicle control batch was loaded with 0.9% saline. This was dissolved in acetone to obtain a 5\u2009mg/mL polymer solution.\nThis solution was added drop-wise to 20\u2009mL of de-ionized water in an ultrasonic water bath and sonicated for 30\u2009min. The formed particles were then separated by centrifugation (7500 rcf) for 2\u2009h, washed three times with de-ionized water, lyophilized overnight, and then each batch was evaluated for particle size (dynamic light scattering), load efficiency, and zeta potential to ensure consistency among batches. Nanoparticles were stored in sucrose at \u221220\u00b0C.\nGel plug delivery system\nGel plugs (0.6% SeaPlaque agarose in phosphate buffered saline [PBS]) were made by dissolving lyophilized E2 loaded PLGA nanoparticles at either 25\u2009\u03bcg or 2.5\u2009\u03bcg dose (or saline loaded vehicle control) in 50\u2009\u03bcL sterile filtered PBS. The gel (final volume 50\u2009\u03bcL) was set in PCR amplification tubes overnight to harden. Before insertion into animals, gels were sterilized under tissue culture ultraviolet lamp for 15\u2009min.\n\nRat model\nAll animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee's guidelines and performed under the protocol ARC #2079. Adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighing 200\u2013250\u2009g were used. Five groups, each with\nn\n=6 animals per group, were included in this study as follows: (1) na\u00efve, (2) sham, (3) injury+nanoparticle vehicle control (Inj+Veh), (4) injury+25\u2009\u03bcg E2 nanoparticle (Inj+25\u2009\u03bcg E2), and (5) injury+2.5\u2009\u03bcg E2 nanoparticle (Inj+2.5\u2009\u03bcg E2). The na\u00efve group was used to establish a baseline for cytokine/chemokine expression. Inclusion of this group was intended to aid in identifying analytes that are changed in neurotrauma, rather than as a result of the laminectomy procedure.\nTo generate the SCI model, animals were anesthetized with ketamine (100\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (5\u2009mg/kg), and a laminectomy was performed at thoracic vertebrae 9 and 10 (T9 and 10); the dura mater was left intact. The spine was immobilized with a spinal stereotactic device, and a moderate to severe SCI was induced by the weight-drop model.\n46\nA weight of 5\u2009g was dropped from a height of 8\u2009cm onto an impounder (0.3\u2009cm in diameter) placed on the dural surface of the spinal cord. Sham animals underwent only a T9 and 10 laminectomy.\nImmediately after the injury induction, the sterile gel plug was placed directly on the dural surface of the contused spinal cord, filling the space voided by the laminectomy (\nFig. 1\n). The incision was sutured, and animals were monitored for 6\u2009h until euthanasia. At the 6\u2009h time point, animals were deeply anesthesized with isoflurane, and whole blood was drawn via cardiac puncture into ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-coated tubes for E2 concentration analysis and cytokine profiling. CSF was collected via cisterna magna puncture and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for cytokine profiling via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). For CSF analysis, only clear samples completely devoid of blood contamination were analyzed.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\n(\nA\n) Polyethylene glycol (PEG) decorated poly D lactide co-glycolide polymeric micelle nanoparticle loaded with 17-\u03b2 estradiol (E2).

(\nD\n) Placement of gel plug on spinal cord lesion. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nAnimals were decapitated, and a necropsy was performed to collect a 1\u2009cm section of spinal cord taken centered on the lesion site (0.5\u2009cm caudal to lesion epicenter taken with 0.5\u2009cm rostral to epicenter). It was observed at necropsy that all gel plugs remained in place, and the gel plug was removed and discarded before tissue collection. Tissue was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until processing. Na\u00efve animals were euthanized in identical fashion, and samples were taken at same time of day as in the experimental animals to control for potential circadian effects on cytokine/chemokine levels.\n\nEstrogen plasma and tissue concentration\nWhole blood drawn via cardiac puncture was collected into EDTA containing tubes (final concentration EDTA 1.5\u2009mg/mL) and placed immediately on ice. Whole blood samples were spun at 10,000\u2009rpm in a Sorvall Legend Micro21 bench top centrifuge, and plasma was collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. 17-\u03b2 estradiol (E2) concentration was determined using a commercially available ELISA kit (Calbiotech Estradiol ELISA ES180S), samples were run undiluted, and kit directions were followed exactly. Spinal cord tissue homogenate (aliquot of identical sample as used for cytokine profiling) was diluted either 1:100 for the 25\u2009\u03bcg E2 dose or 1:10 for the 2.5\u2009\u03bcg E2 in 6% bovine serum albumin, and samples were run on the same ELISA kit as plasma analysis. Using protein concentration data gathered from Bradford assay, tissue sample E2 concentration was then converted from pg/mL to pg/\u03bcg total protein to account for differences in protein concentrations between samples.\n\nCytokine profiling\nTissue\nSpinal cord tissue samples were homogenized in 400\u2009\u03bcL of ice cold PBS with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma P1860, final dilution 1:200). Samples were homogenized with a Polytron handheld tissue homogenizer, set at maximum speed for 30\u2009sec on ice. Samples were then sonicated briefly and spun at 10,000\u2009g for 20\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. Supernatants were analyzed via Bradford assay for protein concentration, and samples were then normalized to a final protein concentration of 8\u2009\u03bcg/mL with homogenizing buffer.\nNormalized samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C and then shipped on dry ice to Eve Technologies (\nwww.evetechnologies.com\n) and run undiluted on the cytokine/chemokine 27-plex discovery assay that included: Eotaxin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), fractalkine, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1 \u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-17A, IL-18, IP-10, GRO/KC, interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, G-CSF, GM-CSF, MCP-1, leptin, LIX, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-2, RANTES, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).\nPlasma\nPlasma samples collected at necropsy were stored at \u221280\u00b0C and then shipped on dry ice to Eve Technologies. Samples were run undiluted on the rat cytokine/chemokine 27-plex discovery assay.\nCSF\nCSF was taken at necropsy, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, stored at \u221280\u00b0C, and then shipped on dry ice to Eve Technologies. Samples were run undiluted on the rat cytokine/chemokine 27-plex discovery assay. Three groups (sham, Injury+25\u2009\u03bcg, Injury+2.5\u2009\u03bcg) contained only\nn\n=5 samples because of blood contamination.\n\nWestern Blot S100\u03b2\nAn aliquot of the spinal cord tissue homogenate that was used for cytokine profiling was used for Western blotting,\nn\n=6 samples representative of the six animals per group (\nn\n=24 total samples included in analysis). Using the data from the Bradford assay for protein estimation, samples were diluted to 1.0\u2009\u03bcg/\u03bcL protein concentration with sample buffer (62.5\u2009mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 6.8, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 5\u2009mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) and boiled for denaturation. Then 12.5\u2009\u03bcL (12.5\u2009\u03bcg total protein) of each sample were loaded into 4\u201320% precast gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and resolved at 100 V for 1 and 1/2\u2009h. Immunoblotting was performed as described in a previous laboratory publication.\n47\nThe resolved gel was transferred to Immobilon\u2122-polyvinylidene fluoride microporous membranes (Millipore, Bellerica, MA). The membranes were blocked for 1\u2009h with nonfat dry milk powder in wash buffer (0.1 % Tween-20 in 20\u2009mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.6). Immunoblotting was then performed with primary antibody Anti-S100\u03b2 (Abcam rabbit monoclonal #ab52642) at 1:1000, overnight at 4\u00b0C, and Anti-\u03b2-Actin (Sigma mouse monoclonal #A2228) at 1:10,000 room temperature for 1\u2009h. The membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase tagged secondary antibodies (dilution 1:2000) tagged with (primary goat anti-mouse or primary goat anti-rabbit antibodies) at room temperature.\nChemiluminescent reagents (ECL Prime, GE Healthcare) were used to detect the immunoreactive bands on the membranes, and the images of protein bands were captured via Alpha Innotech FluorChem FC2 Imager. The immunoreactive bands were then quantified using NIH's Image J software. Given multiple gels were used to accommodate all of the samples, the data were analyzed as a percent of control. Sham animals were defined to be 100% and the relative band intensity of the remaining animals was normalized to the average of the sham group per gel.\n\nStatistical analysis\nTo test our hypothesis that E2 may significantly decrease IL-6, MCP-1, and GRO-KC, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 with a Tukey multiple comparison post-test to determine any differences between sham, Inj+Veh, Inj+25\u2009\u03bcg E2, and Inj+2.5\u2009\u03bcg E2 treated groups. Each test was conducted for each marker in the plasma, tissue, and CSF compartments such that nine one-way ANOVAs were run. Significance was defined as\np\n<0.05.\nIn addition, as a screening tool to assess the remaining markers, the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to detect differences among na\u00efve, sham, Inj+Veh, and Inj+E2 treated groups. SAS 9.3 software was used to perform the analysis. Each matrix was treated as a separate group, and all of the analytes reported were included in the analysis, such that for plasma, 75 comparisons were made; in CSF, 64 comparisons were made; and in tissue, 75 comparisons were made. Significant differences were defined as\np\n<0.05.\nA false discovery rate (fdr) correction was made to account for the multiple comparisons made within each statistical test. Both the uncorrected exact\np\nvalue and the fdr corrected exact\np\nvalues are shown for significant\np\nvalues Inj+Veh vs. Inj+25\u2009\u03bcg / Inj+2.5\u2009\u03bcg in tabular form (\nSupplementary Tables 1\u20133\n; see online supplementary material at\nftp.liebertpub.com\n)."

    "Methods": "Materials\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats (275\u2013300\u2009g) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Guanabenz was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Antibodies (Abs) for phospho-eIF2\u03b1 (p-eIF2\u03b1; Ser51) and total eIF2\u03b1 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA), and the Ab for \u00df-actin was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Abs for NeuN and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) were purchased from Millipore (Billerica, MA).\n\nProduction of cortical impact injury and drug administration\nSurgical procedures were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee and were conducted in accord with the recommendations provided in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Protocols were designed to minimize pain and discomfort during the injury procedure and recovery period. An electromagnet-driven CCI device was used to cause brain injury, as previously described.\n9\n,\n39\n,\n40\nBriefly, animals were anesthetized using 5% isofluorane with a 1:1 O\n2\n/N\n2\nO mixture, mounted on a stereotaxic frame, and a midline incision was made. Bilateral 6-mm craniectomies were produced midway between the bregma and lambda with the medial edges of the craniectomies 1-mm lateral to the midline. Although lateral CCI has been demonstrated to cause axonal damage, a key pathological component of TBI, this damage is predominantly found in the ipsilateral hemisphere. It has been shown that the presence of bilateral craniectomies shifts intracranial strain distribution to the contralateral hemisphere and causes increased contralateral axonal damage.\n41\n,\n42\nAs such, bilateral Craniectomies were chosen in order to increase the likelihood of contralateral hippocampal damage. Rats received a single impact (2.5-mm deformation) on the right parietal lobe with an impact velocity of 5\u2009m/sec. Core body temperature was maintained at 37\u201338\u00b0C by use of a heating pad. Animals were given time to recuperate in a warming chamber before being returned to their home cages. Animals were weighed daily postinjury for the first 3 days, then weekly thereafter.\n\nPrimary neuronal culture and drug treatment\nCortical tissues from embryonic Sprague-Dawley rats (E17\u2013E19) were dissected and dissociated, as described previously.\n43\nNeurons were plated at a density of approximately 650,000 cells per well in 24-well poly-\nd\n-lysine-coated plastic culture dishes and maintained in a humidified CO\n2\nincubator at 37\u00b0C. Cells were cultured for 7 days in neurobasal medium supplemented with 2\u2009mM of glutaMAX, 2% B-27, and penicillin-streptomycin before use. A stock solution of guanabenz (20\u2009mM) was prepared in sterile water, then diluted in conditioned media before addition to cells. Cells were incubated for 2\u2009h, after which they were placed on ice, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed in 60\u00b0C sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer. Resultant samples were sonicated to disrupt DNA and centrifuged at 20,000\ng\nfor 30\u2009min. Supernatant solution was removed and used for western blot analysis. Experiments were repeated three times.\n\nTissue sample preparation\nAt the indicated time points postinjury, hippocampal tissues were quickly removed while submerged in ice-cold artificial cerebral spinal fluid (10\u2009mM of HEPES [pH 7.2], 1.3\u2009mM of NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 3\u2009mM of KCl, 124\u2009mM of NaCl, 10\u2009mM of dextrose, 26\u2009mM of NaHCO\n3\n, and 2\u2009mM of MgCl\n2\n) containing phosphatase inhibitors (2\u2009mM of sodium fluoride, 2\u2009mM of sodium molybdate, and 1\u2009mM of sodium orthovanadate). Tissues were homogenized (20 strokes) in 10 volumes of a buffer containing 10\u2009mM of Tris (pH 7.4), 1\u2009mM of ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 1\u2009mM of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.5\u2009mM of dithiothreitol (DTT), phosphatase inhibitors (0.1\u2009\u03bcM of okadaic acid and 1\u2009mM of sodium orthovanadate), and protease inhibitors (1\u2009mM of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF] and 10\u2009\u03bcg/mL of leupeptin) using a motorized Teflon-glass homogenizer. Samples were immediately aliquoted and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C.\n\nWestern blotting\nTo examine whether TBI causes ER stress, rats were injured then euthanized at 3\u2009h, 24\u2009h, or 3 days postinjury (\nn\n=4/time point) and hippocampi removed and homogenized (20 strokes) in 10 volumes of a buffer containing 10\u2009mM of Tris (pH 7.4), 1\u2009mM of EGTA, 1\u2009mM of EDTA, 0.5\u2009mM of DTT, phosphatase inhibitors (0.1\u2009\u03bcM of okadaic acid and 1\u2009mM of sodium orthovanadate), and protease inhibitors (1\u2009mM of PMSF and 10\u2009\u03bcg/mL of leupeptin) using a motorized Teflon-glass homogenizer. Hippocampal tissue extracts were sonicated (5 pulses of 1\u2009sec each) using a Sonics Vibracell sonicator (Sonics & Materials, Inc., Newtown, CT) and a 0.4-mm-diameter probe. The amount of protein in each sample was determined by a Micro BCA assay (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard. Samples were denatured at 95\u00b0C for 3\u2009min in 1\u00d7NuPage SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Equal amounts of protein were loaded, electro-phoresced, and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) using the NOVEX X-Cell II system (Invitrogen, Burlingame, CA) and the buffers provided by the vendor. Activation of ER stress was evaluated by examining phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 on Ser51, the site of PERK phosphorylation. Total eIF2\u03b1 and B-actin were used as loading controls. Membranes were blocked overnight in 5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST), followed by a 3-h incubation in primary Abs (0.1\u20130.5\u2009\u03bcg/mL in TBST containing 2% BSA) at room temperature. Membranes were then washed in TBST and incubated at room temperature with alkaline phosphatase\u2013conjugated secondary Abs for 1\u2009h, as recommended by the vendor (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). After extensive washing, immunoreactivity was detected using a chemiluminescence system and quantified using ImageJ software (freely available through the National Institutes of Health [NIH], Bethesda, MD).\n\nDrug preparation and administration\nGuanabenz was dissolved in sterile saline to a concentration of either 2.5 (for the 5.0-mg/kg dose) or 0.25\u2009mg/mL (for the 0.5-mg/kg dose). For testing the influence of guanabenz on cognitive function post-TBI, injured animals were assigned to one of four groups: 1) vehicle; 2) 5.0\u2009mg/kg of guanabenz initiated 30\u2009min postinjury; 3) 0.5\u2009mg/kg of guanabenz initiated 30\u2009min postinjury; or 4) 5.0\u2009mg/kg of guanabenz initiated 24\u2009h postinjury. The 5.0-mg/kg dose was based upon previous studies that demonstrated that guanabenz can reduce ER stress in mice,\n44\n,\n45\nwhereas the 0.5-mg/kg dose reflects the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved dose range for guanabenz. All animals were injected for a total of 3 days, with the stock drug solution diluted such that a consistent volume was administered and a single vehicle group could be prepared as a control. This was done in order to minimize the number of animals required for the study. Injury and injections were staggered such that all animals were tested in the motor and cognitive tasks at the same time postinjury.\n\nAssessment of motor function\nAll behavioral tests were conducted by an experimenter blind to the treatment groups. A vestibulomotor (beam balance) and a motor skill task (paw placement) were used to determine animals' motor performance on days 1\u20133 post-treatment, as described previously.\n39\n,\n46\u201348\nFor beam balance, rats were preassessed by placing them on a narrow wooden beam (1.5\u2009cm wide) and measuring the duration they remained on the beam for up to 60\u2009sec. Animals were given repeated training until capable of balancing on the beam for the entire 60-sec period for three consecutive trials. Postinjury, animals were given three daily trials during which the length of time spent on the beam was recorded. Paw placement was evaluated by placing the animal on a wire grid (opening size of 2\u00d72cm) and counting the number of foot faults out of a total of 50 steps. A foot fault was defined as when a front paw missed and appeared below the plane of the grid. Paw placement was repeated three times to give an average daily score.\n\nAssessment of cognitive function\nRats were tested for their cognitive performance using the novel object recognition (NOR) task, the standard hidden platform version of the Morris water maze (MWM), and a spatial reversal learning task as described previously.\n40\n,\n49\u201351\nAll animals had recovered from the TBI-associated motor dysfunction before performing the cognitive testing. The NOR task assesses recognition memory, which has been previously shown to be impaired post-TBI.\n52\nThe NOR task relies on the behavior that a rat will spend more time exploring a novel object than it does an object with which it is familiar.\n53\nIn this task, animals were pre-exposed to a testing chamber (100\u00d7100\u2009cm box), after which two identical objects were introduced and the rat allowed to explore them for a period of 10\u2009min. Twenty-four hours later, the rat was placed back into the training chamber as done for training; only one of the objects was replaced by a new object that had a different shape, but the same color and relative size. Time spent exploring the novel and familiar objects was recorded during the 4-min testing session with the difference in time spent exploring the novel object used as a measure of memory. For water maze testing, animals were given four consecutive training trials per day for 6 days with an intertrial interval of 4\u2009min. If the animal failed to locate the platform within 60\u2009sec on any given trial, it was led there by the experimenter. Twenty-four hours after the final day of training, rats were tested for their spatial memory using a probe trial in which the platform was removed and the animal allowed to search for a period of 60\u2009sec. Forty-eight hours after completion of training, animals were tested in a reversal learning task. Reversal learning is a type of cognitive flexibility that allows an animal to update learned information in order to make an appropriate behavioral response that is opposite to that previously learned. This form of learning has been demonstrated to be more sensitive to subtle hippocampal damage than initial spatial learning.\n54\n,\n55\nThe platform was moved 180 degrees from its original location and rats given four trials to learn the new location within the maze. All other procedures as well as the extramaze cues remained identical to those used in the standard hidden platform training. Movement within the maze was monitored using a video camera linked to tracking software (Ethovision; Noldus Information Technology, Leesbury, VA).\n\nContusion volume measurement\nAfter completion of the behavioral studies, animals were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (100\u2009mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were removed, postfixed overnight in perfusant, then cryoprotected in a 30% sucrose solution. Cortical tissue loss was estimated essentially as described previously by experimenters kept blind with respect to the treatment groups.\n56\nIn brief, cryosections (40-\u03bcm thickness) spanning the rostral-caudal extent of the injured cortex were selected and stained with cresyl violet by an experimenter given only the animal's identifier code. Images of the resultant slides were then used for tissue loss measurement by a second experimenter. The area of cortical tissue loss for each section was carefully outlined using Adobe Illustrator, with the area of the resultant outlines quantified by ImageJ software (NIH). Contusion volume was calculated using the equation A\n1\n(0.5\n*\nX\n1\n)+A\n2\n[(0.5\n*\nX\n1\n)+(0.5\n*\nX\n2\n)]+A\nn-1\n[(0.5\n*\nX\nn-2\n)+(0.5\n*\nX\nn-1\n)]+A\nn\n(0.5\n*\nX\nn-1\n), where A is the area (mm\n2\n) of the contusion for each slice and X is the distance (mm) between two sequential slices. Once contusion volume had been calculated for each animal, the blind code was broken and group differences assessed.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nFor post-TBI histological evaluation, additional tissue sections generated during measurement of cortical contusion volume were used for immunohistochemistry (IHC). Free-floating slices were incubated overnight in primary Ab (0.5\u20131.0\u2009\u03bcg/mL) in Tris-buffered saline containing 2% BSA, 2.5% normal goat serum, and 0.25% Triton X-100. After extensive washing, immunoreactivity was detected using species-specific secondary Abs coupled to Alexa Fluors. These fluorescently labeled tissue sections were evaluated by a blind observer to identify any potential differences between treatment groups. Fluorescent intensity (FI) measurements for MAP2 disruptions were made in four nonoverlapping regions (100\u00d7100\u2009\u03bcm) per section from both the damaged and nondamaged hippocampus. FI measurements from the damaged area were divided by the FI measurements in the undamaged hippocampus to determine the degree of immunoreactivity reduction.\n\nStatistical analysis\nFor evaluation of behavioral data, repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs; two-way or one-way, as appropriate) and\nt\n-tests were utilized to determine statistical differences. For two-way ANOVAs, either group main effects or interactions of group and trial were used to determine statistical differences. Holm-Sidak's method for multiple comparisons post-hoc test was used to determine data points with significant differences. Western blot results and contusion volume data were evaluated using a one-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc\nt\n-tests to determine data points with significant differences. For data that did not pass a Shapiro-Wilk's normality test, appropriate nonparametric analysis was performed. Data were considered significant at\np\n<0.05 and are presented as mean\u00b1standard error of the mean."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nAdult male Sprague-Dawley rats (275\u2013350\u2009g; Charles River Labs, Raleigh, VA) were used. Rats were housed individually (owing to the presence of indwelling i.v. catheters and EEG head mounts) in a well-ventilated vivarium under a normal 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on 6:00\nam\n\u20136:00\npm\n) with free access to food and water before and after brain injury.\nAll experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR; Silver Spring, MD). Research was conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and other federal statutes and regulations relating to animals and experiments involving animals and adhered to the principles stated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The animal housing facility was accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International.\n\nSurgeries\nDuring surgical procedures, rats were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane vapor and body temperature was maintained at 37.0\u00b0C using a heating blanket (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA).\nElectroencephalographic electrode implantation\nThe epidural EEG electrode was constructed using a 2.5-cm section of insulated Nichrome wire (0.2\u2009mm in diameter, uninsulated at each end; Leico Industries, New York, NY) soldered to a stainless steel screw (0-80\u00d70.32\u2009cm in length; Component Supply Company, Fort Mead, FL). EEG electrode implantation was performed on the anesthetized rat secured on a stereotaxic device. The rat's skull surface was exposed by a mid-line skin incision. Capillary bleeding was cauterized to keep the skull surface dry and clean. Four EEG electrodes (\na\u2013d\n) were symmetrically implanted on the rat skull through tightly fit burr holes over the bilateral frontal and parietal regions of the brain (1\u2009mm anterior and 4\u2009mm posterior to the bregma and\u00b13.5\u2009mm lateral to mid-line) and a reference electrode (\nR\n) was placed posterior to the lambda over the transverse sinus (\nFig. 1A\n). The free end of each electrode wire was soldered to a Dale multi-pin connector (March Electronics, West Hempstead, NY) in the sequence of\na\n,\nb\n,\nc\n, and\nd\n, which corresponded to the left frontal, left parietal, right frontal, and right parietal cortical regions, respectively. Each electrode was individually referenced to the electrode\nR\nto create a four-channel monoreferential EEG recording montage. Screw electrodes were secured on the skull with tissue adhesive and insulated with a layer of dental acrylic. The whole assembly was then firmly attached to rat skull with more dental acrylic. All rats were allowed at least 5 days of recovery before receiving the PBBI surgery.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\n(\nA\n) Illustration of EEG electrode configuration.

(\nC\n) Seizure initiation shown on an expanded timescale. EEG, electroencephalographic; NCS, nonconvulsive seizures.\nIntravenous cannulation\nFor continuous i.v. infusion of C-10068, each rat was prepared with an indwelling catheter into the jugular vein 2 days after the EEG electrode implantation. The i.v. catheter consisted of a 10.5-cm section of PE-50 tubing coupled with a silastic tip (1\u2009cm) at one end. Under a surgical microscope, the right jugular vein was exposed and isolated. The silastic tip of the catheter was inserted into the jugular vein and secured in position by a piece of 4-0 silk suture. The other end of the catheter was guided subcutaneously to exit through the dorsal neck region. The i.v. catheter was then connected to a piece of infusion tubing, which was attached to the EEG swivel system allowing continuous i.v. infusion in awake and unrestrained animals.\nPenetrating ballistic-like brain injury\nThe PBBI apparatus consisted of a PBBI probe (Kadence Science, Lake Success, NY), a stereotaxic frame equipped with a specially designed probe holder, and a hydraulic pressure-pulse generator (4B080; Mitre Corp, McClean VA). The penetrating probe was made of a 20-G stainless steel tube with fixed perforations along one end, which were sealed by a piece of airtight elastic tubing. The probe was secured on the probe holder with the unperforated end attached to the pulse generator, angled at 50 degrees from the vertical axis and 25 degrees counter clockwise from the midline. During surgery, the head of the anesthetized rat was secured in a stereotaxic device for insertion of the PBBI probe. After a mid-line scalp incision, a right frontal cranial window (diameter=4\u2009mm) was created using a dental drill to expose the right frontal pole of the brain (+4.5\u2009mm anteroposterior [AP], +2\u2009mm mediolateral to bregma). The PBBI probe was advanced through the cranial window into the right hemisphere to a depth of 1.2\u2009cm from the surface of the brain. Once the probe was in place, the pulse generator was activated by a computer to release a pressure pulse calibrated to produce a rapid expansion of the water-filled elastic tubing, forming an elliptical shaped balloon (diameter=0.633 mm; expansion duration, \u226440\u2009ms) to a volume equal to 10% of total brain volume. This rapid inflation/deflation of the balloon mimics the generation of a ballistic force shock wave, thereby creating a temporary cavity in the brain. After the balloon was deflated, the probe was retracted from the brain, the cranial opening was sealed with sterile bone wax, and the skin incision was closed with a piece of 4-0 silk suture.\n\nPharmacokinetics of C-10068\nMaterial\nThe chemical compound, C-10068, (+)-(9alpha,13alpha,14alpha)-3-(pentadeuteroethoxy)-17-(trideuteromethyl)morphinan hydrochloride, was developed and synthesized by Concert Pharmaceuticals Inc. and delivered to WRAIR under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement between the two institutions.\nTreatment protocol\nPharmacokinetic studies were performed on na\u00efve rats. The dosing regimen consisted of an i.v. bolus dose using one of the three following doses: 7.5, 15.0, or 20.0\u2009mg/kg (dissolved in saline, 1\u2009mL/kg;\nN\n=2\u20133 per group). Each i.v. bolus dose was immediately followed by an i.v. infusion dose of 8\u2009mg/kg/h for 72\u2009h.\nBlood and brain sample collection\nBlood samples (200\u2009\u03bcL/sample) were collected from the jugular vein immediately after bolus injection and at 1, 4, 24, and 72\u2009h after the initiation of i.v. infusion. At each time point, blood samples were immediately transferred into tubes containing K2EDTA (anticoagulant) and placed on ice. Within 30\u2009min of blood collection, blood samples were centrifuged at 2\u20138\u00b0C for 10\u2009min at 3000\u2009rpm and plasma samples (100\u2013125\u2009\u03bcL) were collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until analysis. After 72-h infusion of C-10068, each rat was deeply anesthetized with an intramuscular (i.m.) injection of a ketamine (70\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (6\u2009mg/kg) mixture and euthanized by transcardial (t.c.) exsanguinations with physiological saline. At the end of the saline perfusion, rat brain was removed from the skull, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until analysis.\nPharmacokinetic analysis\nC-10068 was analyzed using positive ion atmospheric pressure chemical ionization high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry on an AB Sciex API-4000 tandem mass spectrometer. The\nm/z\nratio for the multiple reaction monitoring transition (294.3-234.2) resulted in a sensitive, selective quantitation of C-10068 in complex biological matrices. Gradient separation was performed by eluting C-10068 on a reverse-phase Xbridge phenyl RP 3.5-um 3.0\u00d7100\u2009mm (PN#186003328) analytical column. Samples were processed from matrix by using an acetonitrile protein precipitation extraction followed by vortexing and high-speed centrifugation. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was determined to be 1\u2009ng/mL using a 20-\u03bcL injection volume.\n\nAntiseizure study\nTreatment protocol\nThree doses of C-10068 (1.0, 2.5, or 5.0\u2009mg/kg/h;\nN\n=16\u201317/dose) were tested in the PBBI-induced NCS model. C-10068 was delivered as continuous i.v. infusion (infusion rate at 0.1\u2009mL/h) for 72\u2009h for each animal. A group of PBBI control animals (\nN\n=16) received matching vehicle (normal saline) infusion for 72\u2009h, and sham control animals (\nN\n=4) received a 5.0-mg/kg/h C-10068 infusion for 72\u2009h. All treatments were initiated at 30\u2009min post-PBBI or sham procedures and terminated at 72\u2009h postinjury. Animals were euthanized at the end of the treatment for histopathological analysis.\nElectroencephalographic recordings\nContinuous EEG recordings were performed on awake, freely moving animals housed individually in Plexiglas EEG recording chambers (30L\u00d730W\u00d750H cm) equipped with multi-channel gold contact swivel commutators (Dragonfly Inc., Ridgeley, WV). Each rat was tethered to the swivel commutator by a flexible shielded cable (Plastics One Inc., Roanoke, VA) connected to the Dale connector, which was secured on the rat skull. The swivel commutator was interfaced with an EEG amplifier (Natus Medical Inc., San Carlos, CA). EEG signals were recorded at a sampling rate of 200\u2009Hz and digitized by a computerized data acquisition system (Harmonie software; Natus Medical Inc., San Carlos, CA). EEG recordings with video monitoring were collected from each rat for at least 30\u2009min before PBBI surgery and continued postinjury for 72\u2009h.\nElectroencephalographic analysis\nAn NCS event was defined as rhythmic spike discharges occurring at a frequency of 1\u20134\u2009Hz for at least 10\u2009sec, with the amplitude distinctively greater than background activities.\n42\nVariations of EEG waveforms also included rhythmic sharp waves (\u223c1\u2009Hz) or spike waves at irregular intervals of 0.5\u20132.0\u2009Hz.\n43\nBased on these criteria, the following NCS parameters were included in the statistical analyses: 1) NCS incidence: the number of animals that experienced NCS events within a treatment group, expressed as the percentage of the group; (2) NCS frequency: the number of NCS events experienced by an individual animal; (3) NCS episode duration (sec): the duration of one NCS event; (4) NCS cumulative duration (sec): the sum of NCS episode duration for an individual animal; and (5) NCS onset latency (h): the time lapse between the PBBI and occurrence of the first NCS event. To control for \u201cfloor\u201d effects, vehicle-treated animals that displayed zero incidence of post-traumatic NCS and corresponding ranked pairs in each C-10068-treated group were excluded from statistical analyses of NCS frequency duration, as well as latency.\n17\nNCS parameters are expressed as the mean and standard error of the mean (SEM), when appropriate, in the\nResults\nsection.\nHistopathology\nAt 72\u2009h post-PBBI, EEG recording and treatment were terminated. All rats were deeply anesthetized with an i.m. injection of a ketamine (70\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (6\u2009mg/kg) mixture and t.c. perfused with 0.1\u2009M of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed, fixed for 6\u2009h, and then transferred to 20% sucrose solution for cryoprotection. Coronal sections of the brain (40\u2009\u03bcm thick) were cut through the entire cerebrum (+4 to \u22127\u2009mm AP from bregma). The first set of serial brain sections collected at a 960-\u03bcm interval from each animal was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histological analysis of lesion volume. Digitized images of H&E-stained brain sections were captured at 0.5\u00d7 magnification using an Olympus BX61 microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA). Lesion area on each affected brain section was defined by tracing the perimeter of the lesion cavity (including injured penumbra), and the lesion volume of each brain was calculated using the Cavalieri formula applied to the sequential brain sections (Inquiry Digital Analysis System; Loats Assoc., Westminster, MD).\n\nAntineuroinflammation study\nTo evaluate the effects of C-10068 on neuroinflammation and its possible relationship to its effects on PBBI-induced NCS, brain tissues of vehicle-treated animals and those treated with 5.0\u2009mg/kg/h\u00d772\u2009h C-10068 from the above-described antiseizure studies were processed for immunohistochemistry (IHC) of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and rat major histocompatibility complex class I (OX-18) markers of activated astrocytes and microglia cells, respectively.\nImmunohistochemistry procedure\nTwo sets of serial brain sections were collected at 960-\u03bcm intervals from each animal in vehicle- and C-10068-treated animals mentioned above and stained with GFAP and OX-18. After inactivating endogenous peroxidase activity with hydrogen peroxidase, sections were incubated separately with avidin and biotin solutions (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for blocking nonspecific binding of biotin, biotin-binding protein, and lectins. Sections were then incubated free-floating for 1\u2009h in 0.01\u2009M of PBS (pH 7.4) containing 1% normal blocking serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and one of the specific antibodies (Abs): rabbit anti-GFAP (1:8000; Dako, Carpinteria, CA) and mouse anti-OX-18 (1:6000; AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC). Subsequently, the immunoreaction product was visualized according to the avidin-biotin complex method with the Vectastin elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). All tissue sections were processed simultaneously in batches based on each respective Ab to ensure consistent, uniform staining results. All brain tissue preparation and staining was performed by FD Neurotechnologies, Inc. (Baltimore, MD).\nQuantitative analysis of neuroinflammatory profile\nFor unbiased evaluation of immunohistopathology, quantitative analysis was conducted by an experimenter who was blind to treatment and digital images of GFAP, and OX-18-stained brain sections were captured at uniform criteria for sensitivity and exposure time using the Olympus BX61 microscope. For each set of immunostained brain series, images of all collected sections were taken at 4\u00d7 magnification for evaluations of gross positive staining. Additionally, high-magnification images were captured at 20\u00d7 from regions of interest (ROIs), namely, the perilesional regions (GFAP and OX-18) and the hippocampal regions (GFAP) of the most affected brain sections for quantification of GFAP and OX-18 reactivity in these regions. More specifically, for both GFAP and OX-18 immunostains, two 20\u00d7 images were captured in the perilesional regions (medial and ventral to the lesion) from each of the three brain sections at bregma AP: +2.0, +1.0, and 0.0\u2009mm, yielding a total of six perilesional images for each animal. For GFAP-stained brain series, an additional five 20\u00d7 images were captured in the hippocampus (cornu ammonis [CA]1\u2013CA3 and the dentate) from each of the two brain sections posterior to the injury core site (bregma AP: \u22123.0 and \u22124.0\u2009mm), yielding a total of 10 GFAP-stained hippocampal images for each animal.\nQuantification of GFAP and OX-18 reactivity was performed using thresholding analysis provided by ImageJ software (Version 1.44; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The threshold value for each stain was determined as the maximal positive staining of the IHC target confined within the 20\u00d7 image of ROIs with minimal artifacts. The threshold value generated for each specific stain was applied uniformly across all brain sections of each animal in order to ensure objective quantification. Positive staining on a given image was quantified as the number of pixels detected above the selected threshold value and expressed as the ratio to the total pixels of the entire 20\u00d7 image. The pixel measurement was then automatically converted into area measurement (mm\n2\n) according to the image resolution (pixels per mm) and expressed as the percent area (% area) for a given image. The value of positive staining of the specific protein marker was derived by averaging the percent area of positive staining across all analyzed images for the respective ROI for a given animal.\n\nNeuroprotection study\nAdditional experiments were conducted to evaluate the potential neuroprotective effects of C-10068 on neurobehavioral outcomes. For the neurobehavioral study, the most effective antiseizure dose of C-10068 (5.0\u2009mg/kg/h\u00d772\u2009h) was tested in a separate cohort of animals. These animals were randomly assigned to one of the following three groups: sham (\nN\n=12); PBBI+vehicle (\nN\n=15); and PBBI+C-10068 (\nN\n=15). Motor function was assessed on a rotarod task from 7\u201310 days post-PBBI and cognitive function was evaluated in the Morris water maze (MWM) task from 13 to 17 days post-PBBI.\nRotarod task\nThe Rotamex-5 rotarod apparatus (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) was used to measure animals' motor coordination and balance. Before PBBI, all rats were handled and trained to criteria on the rotarod at fixed-speed increments of 5, 10, 15, and 20\u2009rpm using the procedures described previously.\n44\nBaseline measures (2 trials/speed at 10, 15, and 20\u2009rpm and 60\u2009sec per trial) were collected from each animal on the day before PBBI to ensure consistent performance among all animals. At 7 and 10 days postinjury, the ability of animals to remain balanced on the rotating rod was assessed at sequential fixed-speed increments of 10, 15, and 20\u2009rpm for a maximum of 60\u2009sec each trial (2 trials/speed; 60-sec intertrial interval). The outcome measure was defined as the latency (sec) to fall off the rotating rod.\nMorris water maze task\nSpatial learning and memory abilities were assessed in the MWM test starting 13 days post-PBBI.\n44\nThe swimming pool (75\u2009cm deep; 175\u2009cm diameter) was filled with clear water (\u223c22\u00b0C) to a depth of 60\u2009cm with a clear Plexiglas platform being placed at the center of the northwest quadrant (35\u2009cm from the wall of the pool and 1\u2009cm below the water surface). The platform remained in the same position throughout the experiment. Each animal was given four trials per day for 5 consecutive days (30-min intertrial interval) from 13 to 17 days post-PBBI. For each trial, the animal was placed in the MWM at one of four pseudorandomly determined starting points (e.g., north, south, east, and west) and allowed 90\u2009sec to locate the hidden platform. Once the animal located the platform, it was given a 10-sec rest period before being removed to its home cage, which was kept warm by a heating blanket. Animals that could not locate the platform within the allotted time were gently guided to the platform and also allowed to rest for 10\u2009sec on the platform. All trials were recorded with a digital video-tracking system (Noldus EthoVision XT). Primary outcome measures included: 1) latency (sec) to find the hidden platform; 2) swim distance (cm) to the hidden platform; and 3) swim speed (cm/sec).\n\nStatistical analysis\nTreatment effects of C-10068 on seizure frequency, duration, and latency were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis' ranked analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Mann-Whitney's U tests. Fisher's exact test was used for evaluating a trend in proportions of NCS incidence. Student's\nt\n-test was used for analyzing immunoreactivity of GFAP and OX-18. Pearson's correlation analysis was used for analyzing the relationship between seizure frequency and immunoreactivity of GFAP and OX-18. Behavioral endpoints were compared by one-way or repeated-measures ANOVA, followed by Tukey's post-hoc analysis, as appropriate, or by using paired\nt\n-tests between matched groups. Group differences were considered statistically significant at\np\n<0.05. All data were expressed as mean\u00b1SEM, when appropriate."

    "Methods": "Participants\nInclusion criteria for the soccer players were: participation in at least one season in one of the three highest national levels of German soccer leagues (first, second, or third Bundesliga), being male, age between 40 and 70 years, and right-handed. Exclusion criteria were: history of suspected or diagnosed concussion or other traumatic brain injury, neurological disorder, psychiatric illness, or being left-handed. Thirteen of 16 interested players met study criteria and were included in the study cohort. Three interested players were excluded from participation due to a history of moderate to severe traumatic brain injury sustained outside playing soccer. Of those included in the study, the imaging data of two subjects did not pass quality control due to motion artifacts.\nThe final study group consisted of 11 former professional soccer players (mean age 52.0\u00b16.8 years) who had played at least one season of professional soccer and were still active at a recreational level. A comparison cohort of 14 athletes (mean age 46.9\u00b17.9 years), participating in non-contact sports, was recruited from competitive athletic clubs and group matched on age, handedness, and gender. These subjects were former professional athletes and were still actively participating in the same non-contact sports at the time of the study. Non-contact sports included table tennis (\nn\n=4), running (\nn\n=7), or ballroom dancing (\nn\n=3), all sports with equal physical activity level of intensity to soccer, as measured by maximum oxygen consumption,\n20\u201323\nbut with low exposure to repetitive brain trauma. The comparison cohort exclusion criteria were: history of suspected or diagnosed concussion or other traumatic brain injury, organized training in a contact sport, neurological disorder, psychiatric illness, or left-handedness.\nThe local ethics committee approved the study and written informed consent was obtained from each participant.\n\nClinical information, neurocognitive evaluation, and balance test\nA semi-structured interview was performed to acquire detailed information about training habits and lifestyle, including\nnumber of headings performed per week during the last year prior to the study\n, and\nposition in the field\n. Players were asked how many headers they performed per week during the past 12 months prior to the study. The rationale behind asking for this time period is that self-report is known to be less reliable when asking about a time period that is further in the past. To obtain a lifetime estimate of headers, the number of headers per week during the last year was multiplied by the total years of organized training in soccer. A\nlifetime estimate of headings\nwas calculated by multiplying the estimated number of headers performed during the last year by the total years played.\nAll study participants underwent a brief neurocognitive and balance examination by an examiner who was blinded to the athlete's sport. The following tests were selected for their utility in showing impairments in patients with mild traumatic brain injury: Trailmaking Test (TMT) parts A and B, Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF) test, and Balance Error Scoring System (BESS). TMT A measures visual search and psychomotor speed and TMT B measures these same functions as well as cognitive flexibility.\n24\nThe ROCF test is a measure of visuoconstruction, planning and organization, and visual memory.\n25\nFor this test, participants were asked to reproduce a complex line-drawn figure (copy condition), followed by a 5-min delay (short delay recall condition) and a 30-min delay (delayed recall condition). BESS is a measure of balance consisting of three different positions (double leg, single leg, tandem) on two different surfaces (foam and firm) over 20\u2009sec, respectively. The athlete's performance was rated by the examiner according to a defined protocol.\n26\n\nMR imaging data acquisition\nData acquisition was performed in a supine position on a 3T MR scanner (Magnetom Verio, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) with a 32-channel head coil array. The scanning protocol included the following structural sequences: three-dimensional (3D) magnetization prepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequence acquired in a sagittal orientation and a motion insensitive 3D T2-BLADE sequence acquired in a transversal orientation. Imaging parameters were as follows: MP-RAGE: repetition time (TR)=1800\u2009msec, echo time (TE)=3.06\u2009msec, field of view (FOV)=256\u2009mm, voxel size=1\u00d71\u00d71\u2009mm\n3\n, integrated parallel acquisition techniques (iPAT), acceleration factor 2; 3D T2-BLADE: TR=3000\u2009msec, TE=400\u2009msec, FOV=250\u2009mm, voxel size=1\u00d71\u00d71\u2009mm\n3\n, slices=160, iPAT, acceleration factor 2. MRS was acquired with the following parameters: single voxel point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) using a short TE=30\u2009msec, TR=2000\u2009msec, voxel size=20\u00d720\u00d720\u2009mm\n3\n, 128 averages. The voxel was localized in the posterior cingulate gyrus using anatomical landmarks in all three planes from the 3D MP-RAGE sequence as shown in\nFigure 1A\u2013C\n. Special care was taken to maximize the amount of gray matter in the voxel and to avoid the corpus callosum and the scalp tissue. Each voxel underwent automated optimization including 3D shimming, transmit gain, frequency adjustment, and water suppression. Magnetic field homogeneity was optimized for the selected spectroscopy volume of interest by manual shimming to a line width of <14\u2009Hz full-width half maximum (FWHM) of the water signal. An unsuppressed water spectrum was then acquired using the same parameters except no water suppression and 16 averages. Total time of data acquisition was 5\u2009min. After acquisition, screen shots of the voxel location and spectra were obtained for quality control. The posterior cingulate was selected for the MRS acquisition for several reasons. First, it is the same region measured in a cohort of American football players with chronic repetitive brain injury, which also provides the closest comparison to this cohort of subjects.\n27\nSecond, it has been utilized across a number of other brain injury studies, primarily acute and severe head trauma,\n28\nthus providing a secondary comparison across the spectrum of brain injury. Third, positron emission tomography (PET)\n29\nand functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)\n30\nstudies have also found changes in the posterior cingulate after head injury. Moreover, it is one of the most homogeneous parts of the brain and thus enables excellent technical quality as well as high reproducibility.\n31\nIn addition, placement of the area of interest in this region is also a good indicator of neurochemical changes in other parts of the brain.\n31\n,\n32\nAs a result, neurochemical changes in the posterior cingulate are likely to be conservative such that if we have significant findings in this location, future studies in other brain regions will evince similar if not stronger effects.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\n(A\n) Location of the MRS voxel in the posterior cingulate gyrus, axial plane.\n(B)\ncoronal plane.\n(C)\nSagittal plane.\n(D)\nRepresentative spectra of a senior soccer player using LCModel for analysis and reconstruction.

Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\n\nMR spectroscopy analysis\nSpectra were exported as DICOM files and raw data files were extracted for post-processing. The data file and unsuppressed water file for each subject were then quantified using a user-independent time-domain fitting routine that uses a basis set of concentration-calibrated model spectra of individual chemicals to estimate the concentrations of similar brain chemistry from\nin vivo\nspectral data (LCModel, Provencher). This method exploits the full spectroscopic information of each chemical and not just isolated resonances. A representative spectrum from a soccer player is shown in\nFigure 1D\n. All spectra were quality controlled by examining the line width or FWHM of the unsuppressed water spectrum and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) were calculated for each neurochemical estimation. Only those measures with a CRLB <20% were used for data analysis. The following neurochemicals were quantified: NAA, creatine (Cr), Cho, Glu, GSH, and mI. In addition, lipid and macromolecule resonances were also characterized at 0.9, 1.3, and 2.0\u2009ppm. To account for subject-to-subject variability in coil loading, the unsuppressed water signal for each subject was measured and accounted for and ratios to Cr were calculated in the LCModel output.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAn independent sample\nt\ntest was performed to evaluate differences between the age-matched groups where significance (\np\n), degrees of freedom (\ndf\n), and\nt\nvalue (\nt\n) are reported. MRS neurochemical ratios were correlated with cognitive measures and balance as well as with number of\nheadings performed per week during the last year\nand\nlifetime estimate of headings\nusing Spearman rank correlation. A\np\nvalue <0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA)."

    "Methods": "Recruitment\nSixty-four participants were recruited as part of a larger cohort study on TBI using standardized and approved subject recruitment procedures.\n29\n,\n30\nA convenience sample of Veterans with mTBI resulting from blast exposure, MVAs, or sports injuries were recruited through primary care physicians and the Traumatic Brain Injury Clinic at the Veterans Administration San Diego Health Care System La Jolla. Active duty military participants with mTBI resulting from blast or accidents were recruited from the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Clinic at the Naval Medical Center San Diego. A convenience sample of civilian participants with mTBI were recruited through the University of California San Diego Medical Center Trauma Clinic and through San Diego Sports Medicine and Family Health Center. HC participants were recruited from the local community by ads and flyers. The study received institutional review board approval, and all participants provided informed consent according to Veterans Affairs, University of California San Diego, and Naval Medical Research Center requirements. The mTBI+PCS group was recruited first and the HC group was matched to the clinical group on demographic characteristics of age, education, and gender.\nTable 1\ndisplays participants' demographic characteristics. The final sample included 31 participants with a history of mTBI, with a mean age of 26.6 years (standard deviation [SD]=6.1) and a mean education level of 12.8 years (SD=1.2). HCs constituted 33 participants in the final sample with a mean age of 26.3 years (SD=8.3) and a mean education level of 13.3 years (SD=1.5). The mTBI group included 90.3% male participants whereas the HC group included 93.9% male participants, with Caucasian participants being the majority of both groups. Of the mTBI group, 64% sustained injuries related to blast injury during combat, 16% were injured in MVAs, and 19% sustained sports-related injuries. The groups did not differ significantly on age and years of education; however, because scores on the Weschler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR;\np\nvalues) and Personality Assessment Inventory Anxiety Related Disorders Traumatic Stress Subscale (PAI ARD-T;\np\nvalues) differed significantly, these variables were used as covariates for further analyses.\n31\n,\n32\nTable\n1.\nParticipant Characteristics: mTBI+PCS and HCs\nGroups\nmTBI+PCS M (SD)\nHC M (SD)\np\nvalues\nGroup size\n31\n33\nGender (% male)\n90.3\n93.9\nHandedness (% right)\n93.5\n93.9\nAge at exam\n26.6 (6.1)\n26.3 (8.3)\n0.894\nEducation\n12.8 (1.2)\n13.3 (1.5)\n0.199\nWTAR standard score\n96.13 (16.4)\n107.52 (12.59)\n0.003\nPAI ARD-T\nt\nscore\n59.87 (13.05)\n49.48 (10.26)\n0.001\nDays postinjury\n97.4 (333.7)\nN/A\nOpen in a separate window\nDemographic means and standard deviations are shown.\np\n<0.05 is held as significant.\nmTBI+PCS, mild traumatic brain injury and postconcussive syndrome; WTAR, Weschler Test of Adult Reading; PAI ARD-T, Personality Assessment Inventory Anxiety Related Disorders Traumatic Stress Subscale; HC, healthy controls; M, mean; SD, standard deviation; N/A, not applicable.\nmTBI was defined by standard diagnostic criteria to include a loss or altered state of consciousness for less than 15\u2009min postinjury or a period of post-traumatic amnesia of less than 24\u2009h or a Glasgow Coma Scale rating between 13 and 15.\n33\n,\n34\nAs part of the exclusion criteria, all participants underwent a structural MRI (1.5T GE scanner; GE Healthcare, Woburn, MA) with a standardized TBI sequence, including a sagittal magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo, axial gradient-echo T2*, axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, axial T2, and axial diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). In order to address potential confounds related to evidence of visible structural changes in the brain (e.g., related to previous injuries), MRI results were reviewed by a board-certified neuroradiologist. Results of the MRI had to be negative for the participant to remain in the mTBI+PCS or HC groups. In addition, available clinical MRI studies for the mTBI+PCS group conducted after the documented injury were examined and also had to be negative for blood product for the participant to qualify for inclusion in the study. Additional exclusionary criteria for all participants were a past history of neurological or psychiatric disorders. Participants were also excluded if they were on medications, such as neuroleptic sedatives, antidepressants, and hypnotics, that may globally increase delta slow-wave activity.\n35\nAll participants underwent a semistructured clinical interview regarding health and neurological history, a battery of neuropsychological tests, and neuroimaging evaluations, including MRI and MEG, at the University of California San Diego Radiology Imaging Lab. To address possible effects of effort and motivational factors on neuropsychological performance, the Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM) was administered to all subjects.\n36\u201338\nIn addition, patterns of performance and embedded indicators of effort were examined. One participant was excluded from analysis owing to questionable performance on the TOMM.\n\nNeuropsychological tests\nAll neuropsychological tests were administered by trained research associates. The results were scored, double scored, and reviewed by a licensed neuropsychologist to maintain reliability. All evaluations were administered in a single session in a quiet room, within 1 week of the MEG and MRI scans. Tests were selected to assess a number of cognitive domains.\n39\nThe WTAR scaled score was used as an indicator of preinjury intellectual functioning and is included in the demographic comparison.\n31\nThe Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) was administered as a measure of psychiatric functioning.\n32\nAs there are potential effects of co-occurring post traumatic stress disorder on cognitive tests, the PAI ARD-T t-score was included as a potential covariate.\n32\nThe California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II) and the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test (BVMT-R) were included as measures of verbal and visual learning and memory.\n40\n,\n41\nAttention, working memory, and concentration were measured using the Letter/Number Sequencing and Digit Span subtests from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III) and the Connors Continuous Performance Test II (CPT-II).\n42\n,\n43\nThe Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) Sorting, Trail Making, Color-Word Interference, and Verbal Fluency subtests were used to evaluate executive functioning.\n44\nProcessing speed was assessed with the WAIS-III Processing Speed Index subtests of Symbol Search and Digit Symbol Coding.\n42\nFinally, motor functioning was measured with the Grooved Pegboard.\n45\n,\n46\nAge-corrected scaled scores or\nt\nscores from the test manuals were used as dependent measures in the analyses.\n\nStatistical analysis of neuropsychological tests\nStandard statistical analysis software (SPSS 12.0 for Windows; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for all neuropsychological data analysis. In order to determine whether the groups were matched, demographic, educational, and trauma-related anxiety characteristics of the mTBI+PCS and HC groups were compared using a univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA; see\nTable 1\n); characteristics that differed significantly (\np\n<0.05) were used as covariates in further analyses. To protect against inflation of type 1 error rate, differences between the mTBI and HCs on the means of 19 neuropsychological dependent variables were evaluated using multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA), followed by a series of univariate analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) to establish which tests accounted for any significant effect found with the MANCOVA.\n47\nWhereas data were collected for 22 different neuropsychological dependent variables, owing to 5 participants not completing the BVMT-R and D-KEFS Sorting subtests, and the high collinearity between the CVLT long-delay free recall variable of the CVLT-II with the other two CVLT-II variables, four variables were removed from the MANCOVA analysis. Box's Test of Equality of Covariance Matrices was used to make sure that the covariance matrices of the dependent variables between the two groups were equal. Pearson's correlations between the dependent variables were performed to test the MANCOVA assumption that the dependent variables would be correlated with one another in the moderate range (0.20\u20130.60).\n48\nThe Partial Eta Squared, \u03b7\np\n2\n, effect size was calculated for the adjusted analyses. Family-wise error rate was addressed using false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons, with resulting\np\nvalue significance level calculated at\np\n\u22640.004.\n49\nA list of the 18 variables included in the MANCOVA analysis can be found in\nTable 2\nbecause those variables were also included in the ANCOVA analysis. The CVLT long-delay forced choice variable is included in\nTable 2\n, but was not a part of the MANCOVA analysis owing to its high collinearity with the other CVLT variables.\nTable\n2.\nNeuropsychological Test Scores in ANCOVA Analysis\nUncorrected means\nmTBI+PCS vs. HC\nmTBI+PCS vs. HC\nNeuropsychological measure\nmTBI+PCS M (SD)\nHC M (SD)\nUncorrected Cohen's\nd\nANCOVA\np\nvalues\nSignificant effect sizes \u03b7\np\n2\nWASI Verbal IQ\n102.4 (13.8)\n111.8 (13.7)\n\u22120.684\n0.285\nNS\nWASI Performance IQ\n110.4 (12.0)\n108.9 (14.0)\n0.115\n0.245\nNS\nCVLT-II 1-5 Free Recall\nt\nscore\n52.61 (8.5)\n55.67 (8.3)\n\u22120.364\n0.494\nNS\nCVLT-II Short Delay Free Recall z-score\n0.24 (0.9)\n0.65 (0.7)\n\u22120.509\n0.039\n0.069\nCVLT-II Long Delay Free Recall z-score\n0.03 (0.9)\n0.45 (0.9)\n\u22120.467\n0.158\nNS\nWAIS-III Letter/Number Sequencing Scaled\n9.9 (2.1)\n10.8 (1.9)\n\u22120.449\n0.893\nNS\nWAIS-III Digit Span Scaled\n10.7 (2.7)\n10.9 (2.3)\n\u22120.080\n0.691\nNS\nCPT Inattention Omissions t-score\n58.4 (34.0)\n57.0 (32.7)\n0.042\n0.893\nNS\nCPT Inattention Commissions t-score\n49.6 (6.6)\n46.6 (9.1)\n0.378\n0.261\nNS\nD-KEFS Trails Number Letter Sequencing Scaled\n8.9 (2.4)\n11.27 (2.3)\n\u22121.008\n0.003\n***\n0.138\nD-KEFS Color-Word Interference Inhibition Scaled\n9.16 (2.1)\n11.64 (2.4)\n\u22121.100\n0.004\n***\n0.132\nD-KEFS Color-Word Interference Inhibition/Switching Scaled\n8.9 (2.6)\n10.4 (2.5)\n\u22120.588\n0.072\nNS\nD-KEFS Verbal Fluency Letter Fluency Scaled\n8.9 (2.3)\n11.9 (2.7)\n\u22121.196\n0.002\n***\n0.152\nD-KEFS Verbal Fluency Category Fluency Scaled\n10.7 (3.2)\n12.8 (2.6)\n\u22120.720\n0.091\nNS\nD-KEFS Verbal Fluency Category Switching Scaled\n9.7 (2.6)\n11.0 (2.5)\n\u22120.510\n0.477\nNS\nWAIS-III Symbol Search Scaled\n11.6 (2.4)\n12.6 (3.2)\n\u22120.354\n0.314\nNS\nWAIS-III Digit Symbol Coding Scaled\n9.2 (2.5)\n11.7 (2.6)\n\u22120.980\n0.004\n***\n0.132\nGrooved Pegboard Dominant Hand Scaled\n9.7 (2.0)\n9.7 (2.5)\n0.000\n0.474\nNS\nGrooved Pegboard Non-Dominant Hand Scaled\n10.0 (2.3)\n9.8 (2.9)\n0.344\n0.569\nNS\nOpen in a separate window\nNeuropsychological test scores comparing mTBI+PCS and HC groups with uncorrected means, standard deviations, and Cohen's\nd\nas well as corrected ANCOVA adjusted analysis (\np\nvalues) and significant main effects (\u03b7\np\n2\n).\n***\np\nvalues indicating significance in ANCOVA adjusted analysis with FDR corrected\np\n\u22640.004.

Electrooculography electrodes were used to detect eye blinks and eye movements. Electrocardiography electrodes were used to detect cardiac motion artifacts. Data were recorded spontaneously at 1000\u2009Hz, with no signal averaging. To increase the likelihood that subjects would be alert during the MEG recordings, participants were given a questionnaire asking how many hours they slept the previous night, how rested they felt, and if there was any reason that they were not attentive and performing to the best of their abilities (owing to headache, pain, and so on); participants were rescheduled as necessary. In addition, eyes-closed sessions alternated with eyes-open sessions, during which MEG technicians were able to monitor eye blinking and closing as an indicator of subjects' cognitive alertness. During the session, MEG technicians could also monitor the amount of alpha-band oscillation, which is consistently associated with tonic alertness. Finally, MEG technicians were able to view participants using a nonrecording video camera during sessions to monitor level of alertness as well as safety.\nAfter data collection, data were processed by MaxFilter to remove environment noise.\n51\u201354\nA Realistic Boundary Element Method head model was used for MEG forward calculation.\n55\n,\n56\nThe BEM mesh was constructed by tessellating the inner skull surface from the T1-weighted MRI into \u223c6000 triangular elements with \u223c5-mm size. A cubic source grid with 5-mm size was used for calculating the MEG gain (i.e., lead-field) matrix, which leads to a grid with \u223c7000 nodes covering the cortical and subcortical gray matter of the whole brain. Registration of MRI and MEG was performed using data obtained from the Polhemus Isotrak system before MEG scanning (Polhemus, Colchester, VT). MEG data were then band-pass filtered for 1\u20136\u2009Hz, mainly focusing on the delta band. Source reconstruction of each session for each subject was performed using the Frequency-Domain VESTAL approach.\n30\n,\n57\n,\n58\nRMS amplitude per grid point was then computed for each subject and saved in a three-dimensional Nifty format file, which was then interpolated into 1\u00d71\u00d71 images in native MR coordinates. RMS reconstructions in native scanner space were then smoothed (5-mm gaussian kernel) and averaged across all sessions for each subject. The averaged and smoothed set of activities was subsequently transferred to MNI 152 space for each subject using FLIRT registration with the FSL software package.\n59\n,\n60\nThe resulting reconstructions in MNI space were then correlated (voxel-by-voxel, 1\u00d71\u00d71 size) across subjects with neuropsychological measures that displayed significant group differences. Uncorrected\np\nvalues were then corrected using FDR correction for multiple comparisons.\n49\nMasks generated from voxels surviving FDR multiple comparisons across voxels were applied to the\nR\n-value volumes for each neuropsychological measure, and surviving voxels of the FDR correction are displayed in the figures shown. An additional clustering analysis was performed to confirm that the voxels that survived FDR correction were members of larger clusters, rather than rogue events. In the additional cluster analysis that corrected multiple comparisons across voxels, the size of the cluster for the corrected\np\n<0.05 was determined by the AlphaSim program in AFNI. Each reported correlation that had an FDR corrected also was confirmed to be in a cluster of size >150 voxels with a\np\n<0.05.\n61\n\nData processing stream for statistical analysis\nResults from the cognitive assessments of the mTBI+PCS and HC groups were compared to determine whether there were any differences between groups. Once the final univariate analysis was performed on specific neuropsychological dependent variables, those showing significant group differences were selected for inclusion in a MEG correlational analysis, in order to determine whether slow-wave RMS amplitude correlated with performance on neuropsychological tests, particularly in regions known to mediate performance on specific cognitive measures."

    "Methods": "Patient selection and data collection\nDeidentified demographic, clinical, and radiological data were analyzed retrospectively from prospectively collected data from longitudinal studies of acute, moderate, and sTBI at Parkland Memorial Hospital (PMH) and Children Medical Center Dallas (CMCD) in Dallas, Texas, from 2005 to 2012. Patients were ages 0\u201317 years, with accidental TBI and a GCS of \u226412 on presentation or after deterioration; thus, some patients had higher initial GCS on admission, but declined within the first 24\u2009h. Patients were excluded if they had suspected abusive head injury, had penetrating brain injury, or were not expected to survive. At UT Southwestern (UTSW) Medical Center, children with traumatic injury ages 0\u201313 years are admitted to CMCD and adolescents ages 14\u201317 years to PMH. Management of TBI is in accord with published guidelines.\n2\nAll subjects were enrolled according to UTSW standards for human research with institutional review board approval with written and informed parental consent. We excluded patients with MRI evidence of hypoxic-ischemic injury (HII) given that TBI patients with coexisting HII may confer a worse prognosis, but recorded their outcomes.\n41\nWe defined HII as diffusion abnormalities on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences in bilateral parietooccipital cortical watershed areas and/or bilateral basal ganglia\u00b1bilateral thalamic regions. Brain MRI FLAIR images from 63 (CMCD,\nn\n=45; PMH,\nn\n=18) patients were analyzed. We considered MRI early if obtained within 0\u201321 days from the injury date. In 1 patient, the MRI was obtained at 28 days.\n\nFluid-attenuated inversion recovery image processing and hyperintensity lesion volume measurements\nConventional MRI and FLAIR sequences were collected on a Philips Intera 1.5T (Philips Healthcare, Andover, MA): field of view, (FOV) 220 mm; matrix size, 512\u00d7512; and 8000\u20131000/2300/120 repetition time (TR)/inversion time (TI)/echo time (TE) at CMCD; and GE Genesis Signa 1.5T scanner (General Electric Medical, Milwaukee, WI); FOV, 200 mm; matrix size, 256\u00d7256; and 8800/2200/130 TR/TI/TE at PMH. Three subjects from CMCD and 4 from PMH were imaged on a 3T scanner. Images were acquired in the axial plane with 5-mm slice thickness and interslice gap of 0.5\u20131.0\u2009mm. Blinded to outcome assessment, FLAIR DICOM images were converted to ANALYZE format using MRIcro\n42\nand processed in a semiautomatic quantitative fashion for total and regional lesion volume analysis using MATLAB software (Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA); the detailed steps were described previously by our group.\n26\nInter-rater reliability for this method of volumetric analysis was shown to be excellent and consistent (0.956;\np\n<0.001). This tool uses signal thresholding and morphological erosion, in combination with human knowledge to segment and quantify hyperintensity lesion volume and whole-brain volume (WBV), illustrated in\nFigure 1\n. We measured all hyperintense hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic lesions abnormalities that met threshold excluding postsurgical or intracranial device tracks. All postprocessed FHLs were cross-referenced with the neuroradiology report; any disagreement was resolved by a blinded pediatric neuroradiologist (M.M.) interpretation. For data analysis, we analyzed hyperintensity lesion volume (HLV) as an index relative to WBV, HLV index (HLVI)=hyperintensity lesion volume/WBV\u00d7100.\n26\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nRepresentation of injury patterns based on anatomical zones of injury and quantitative analysis.

Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\n\nRegional brain injury zone measurements\nThe brain was divided into three major anatomic zones for analysis: zone A=superficial (frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortical gray [GM] and subcortical white matter [WM]); zone B=deep (genu and splenium of the corpus callosum [CC], internal and external capsule, basal ganglia [BG], and thalamus [TH]); and zone C=brain stem (mid-brain, pons, and medulla); lesions in the cerebellum were excluded (\nFig. 1\n). Lesions were grouped into specific brain zones based upon known neuroanatomical structures readily identified on MRI. Lesion volumes within specific brain zones were calculated by manual delineation using the region of interest function, followed by sequential image lesion extraction by each zone. This function allowed the operator, while referencing the processed FLAIR image, to circumscribe the lesion and extract the lesion volume of each zone separately when lesions crossed boarders of zones on the same slice.\n\nFunctional outcome measure\nFunctional outcome was performed approximately 12 months postinjury using the GOS-E Peds, a structured interview that assesses functional abilities in multiple domains post-TBI.\n3\n,\n43\nA neuropsychologist or a trained neuropsychology technician by a face-to-face or phone interview administered the GOS-E Peds with caregivers. Patients who were enrolled early in the study and from PMH were administered the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E), an adult instrument with known validity used to measure functional outcome in adults and used to predict outcome in children before the availability of the GOS-E Peds.\n44\nThe GOS-E Peds is a downward extension of the GOS-E and a valid measure of outcome in children.\n43\nAll GOS-E scores were converted to GOS-E Peds scores for analysis. From the principal study, functional outcome assessments were made in 81 of 113 (72%) subjects from PMH and in 136 of 172 (79%) children from CMCD. The GOS-E Peds score ranges from 1 to 8, with lower scores associated with a better outcome. The 8-point GOS-E Peds is divided into the following categories: 1) upper good recovery: performs all age-appropriate activities as before; 2) lower good recovery: normal activities with mild impairment in social activities or family relationships; 3) upper moderate disability: reduced capacity for school work and moderate impairment in social activities and family relationships; 4) lower moderate disability: requires sheltered work or school environment or unable to attend school and unable to participate in social activities or daily severe disruptions in family relationships; 5) upper severe disability: assistance of another person at home is essential for most, but not all, activities of everyday living or child's ability to interact outside the home is impaired as expected for age; 6) lower severe disability: assistance of another person at home is essential for all activities of everyday living as expected for age; 7) vegetative state: unable to follow simple commands or interact beyond reflexes; and 8) death.\n\nCognitive outcome: Measure\nGeneral cognitive function (i.e., IQ) was assessed by either the Mullen Scales of Early Development, the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Third Edition, or the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Forth Edition according to patient age.\n45\u201347\nIQ has been shown to have a dose-related relationship with severity of TBI, with increasing effects demonstrated as time elapses.\n48\n,\n49\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive analyses of the continuous and categorical data were performed using proportions, frequency distributions, means, and confidence intervals (CIs). Spearman's correlation test was used to investigate the association between two ranked variables. Wilcoxon's rank-sum test was used to test the difference in medians between two samples. Statistical analyses were performed with SAS software (9.3; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC)."

    "Methods": "Mice\nAQP4\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice were generated by targeted gene disruption as described previously.\n23\nExperiments were done on weight-matched littermates (25-30\u2009g) in a CD1 genetic background. Mice were housed at University of California, San Francisco animal facility and provided with normal mouse chow and water. The CCI protocol was approved by the University of California, San Francisco Committee on Animal Research. There are no observable differences between AQP4\n+/+\nand AQP4\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice in baseline phenotype, cerebrovascular anatomy, blood-brain barrier integrity, and brain histology.\n4\n,\n24\nInvestigators were blinded to mouse genotype information in all studies.\n\nCCI model\nMale mice were anesthetized with 2,2,2-tribromoethanol (150\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection; Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, MO). The head was immobilized on a stereotaxic frame and the skull was exposed by a midline incision. A craniotomy of 5-mm diameter was made using a microdrill and trephine over the right fronto-parietal cortex (relative to bregma, 1.5\u2009mm posterior, 2.5\u2009mm lateral), and the bone flap was removed without damage to the dura. Mice were then subjected to CCI using an electric cylinder with a 3-mm round-tip impactor (eCCI model 6.3; Custom Design and Fabrication, Richmond, VA). Zero position was set when the tip touched the dural surface under the guidance of a surgical microscope. The velocity of impact was set at 4.5\u2009m/sec, with an impact depth of 1.7\u2009mm and dwell time of 150 msec. Immediately after injury, the bone flap was repositioned and fixed with tissue glue (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) and the skin was sutured.\n\nInjury volume\nMice were anesthetized and transcardiac perfusion was done with heparinized saline (20 units/mL) and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 1, 3, 7, and 30 d following CCI. The brains were removed from mice and post-fixed overnight in fresh 4% PFA. After cryoprotection in 20% sucrose, brains were frozen in embedding medium (Tissue-Tek; Sakura Finetek USA, Inc., Torrance, CA) and 14-\u03bcm-sections were cut using a Leica Cryostat (Leica Microsystems, Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL). Every 20th section was stained with Cresyl-Violet (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). A total of 15 sections per brain were analyzed by an investigator blinded to the experimental groups. Staining was analyzed using Image J software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and lesion area was calculated as the area of the contralateral hemisphere minus that of the ipsilateral hemisphere. Cavitation, hemorrhage, or loss of normal staining was considered as lesion. Edema area (swelling) was calculated from the difference in contralateral and ipsilateral (injury) hemispheric contours in each section. Corrected lesion area of each section was obtained by subtracting edema area from the primary measured lesion area. Injury volume was determined by integrating the lesion area of different brain section with the use of cylinder and cone rules.\n25-27\n\nBehavioral studies\nThe beam walk test was used to evaluate fine motor coordination up to 7 d after CCI as described previously, with modification.\n28\nBriefly, the beam-walk device contains a narrow wooden beam with 6\u2009mm width and 100\u2009cm length suspended about 40\u2009cm above the ground with soft foam to protect falling mice. All mice were videoed and the tapes were reviewed for right foot faults by an investigator blinded to experimental group and time-point. Mice were trained to walk from one end of the beam to the other for 3 d before injury. The number of foot faults for the right hind-limb was counted over 50 steps. Mice with a basal level of less than 10 faults per 50 steps were selected for experiments. The test was repeated three times consecutively for each mouse and the average was calculated as the percentage of foot faults out of the 50 steps. Mice were sacrificed following completion of the final test at 7 d after CCI.\n\nICP\nA Codman ICP microsensor with 0.5-mm diameter (TC-510; Millar Instruments, Houston, TX) was inserted through a 1-mm burr hole made just anterior to the right coronal suture. ICP was recorded before and at 2, 6, and 24\u2009h after CCI (in different groups of mice) using a MP-150 recording system (Biopac, Santa Barbara, CA). ICP was reported as averaged values over 5\u2009min.\n\nBrain water content\nBrain water content was determined by column densitometry in order to obtain spatially resolved information. A bromobenzene-kerosene gradient was created in a cylindrical column and calibrated with KCl as described.\n29\nAfter removal of the brain (at 0.5, 2, 6, 24, and 72\u2009h) following anesthesia and decapitation, a pre-cooled mouse brain matrix mold with 1.0\u2009mm coronal section slice intervals was used to generate serial 2-mm brain slices. A 2-mm diameter micro-dissection punch (WPI, Sarasota, FL) was used to obtain brain fragments from the injury core, penumbra, and hippocampus for water content measurements. The tissue fragments were placed onto the column and allowed to settle in the gradient for 2\u2009min. Tissue specific gravity was determined from column position referenced to KCl standards. Tissue water content was deduced from the gravimetric data as described previously.\n30\n\nBBB permeability\nBBB permeability was quantified by extravasation of Evans blue dye (Sigma-Aldrich) as described.\n5\n2% Evans blue in saline was injected by tail vein with 1\u2009h before sacrifice (at 2, 6, and 24\u2009h post-CCI). Mice were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with 200\u2009mL of 10\u2009U/mL heparinized saline. Brains were then removed and the two hemispheres were separately homogenized in 1\u2009mL of 50% trichloroacetic acid. The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000\u2009rpm for 20\u2009min and the supernatant was diluted 1:2 in 100% ethanol. Evans blue dye concentration was determined using a fluorescence microplate reader (excitation wavelength 620\u2009nm, emission wavelength 680\u2009nm). The amount of Evans blue per hemisphere was computed using calibration standards (20 to 1000\u2009ng/mL). Extravasated Evans blue also was visualized by fluorescence microscopy in fixed, frozen cryostat sections.\n\nElectron microscopy\nBrain ultrastructure was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy at 6\u2009h after CCI. After anesthesia, mice were perfused transcardially with 250\u2009mL of heparinized 0.1\u2009M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 20 units/mL) followed by 300\u2009mL of fixative (1% paraformaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS; pH 7.4). Samples of parietal cortex from contralateral (control) and ipsilateral (injury) hemisphere in AQP4\n+/+\nand AQP4\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice were prepared for electron microscopy. Following extensive rinsing, the tissue blocks were incubated in an aqueous solution of 1% OsO\n4\nand 5% K\n2\nCr\n4\nO\n7\n(1:1). The samples were dehydrated, incubated in 1% uranyl acetate, and embedded in Durcupan epoxy resin (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland). Ultrathin sections (60-90\u2009nm) were cut from the same blocks and collected on 200 mesh copper grids. The preparations were incubated with 5% uranyl acetate and Reynolds lead-citrate solutions, and viewed under a Philips TM10 transmission electron microscope (Eindhoven, Netherlands) and imaged using a digital camera (MegaView II; Soft Imaging Systems, M\u00fcnster, Germany). All sections were examined and photographed by one of the investigators who was blinded to mouse genotype and the duration of CCI. Astrocytic foot process cross-sectional area was determined using 10 randomly selected transmission electron micrographs containing foot processes adjacent to brain capillaries from 11 AQP4\n+/+\nand AQP4\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice at 6\u2009h after CCI. Images were scanned at a resolution of 600 dpi. Peripheral foot processes were identified by an investigator blinded to genotype information and the area was analyzed using National Institutes of Health Image J software.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are expressed as mean\u00b1standard error. Analysis of significance in the beam-walk test was done using two-way repeated measurements analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc Newman-Keuls test. For other experiments, two-way ANOVA with Newman-Keuls post hoc test was used. Differences were regarded as statistically significant at\np\n<0.05. Analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism (GraphPad Prism Software Inc., La Jolla, CA) statistical software."

    "Methods": "Mild TBI or sham-injury was induced in 6\u20138 weeks old male C57bl6 mice using the previously characterized model of central fluid percussion injury (cFPI).26,27The mice were genetically modified to express yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) under control of the Thy1 promoter (Thy1-YFP-H mice) that induces labeling of a subset of neurons and allows identification of axotomized and structurally intact neurons. Brain slices were harvested following a 1 d or 2 d post-injury or post-sham injury survival period or from na\u00efve mice and used for either whole\u2013cell patch clamp or field potential recordings. All animal procedures were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\ncFPI\nThe cFPI model of mild TBI\n26\nwas used as previously described.\n28\nBriefly, mice were anaesthetized using 2.0% isoflurane in oxygen. Blood oxygenation and the heart and respiratory rates were monitored using a pulse oximeter placed on the right thigh (MouseOx; Starr Life Sciences, Oakmont, PA) and core body temperature maintained at 37\u00b0C using a feed-back controlled heating pad (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). A 3\u2009mm craniotomy centered on the midline and halfway between bregma and lambda was made using a trephine and a plastic hub made from a 20 gauge needle was placed over the craniotomy and secured using cyanoacrylate and dental cement. Following a recovery period to allow isoflurane clearance, the animals were re-anesthetized and brain injury was induced with a 1.7\u00b10.04 atmospheres pressure pulse delivered using a fluid percussion device (Custom Design & Fabrication; Virginia Commonwealth University; Richmond, VA). Sham-injured animals received identical surgical procedures and were attached to the fluid percussion device but without pressure pulse delivery.\n\nPatch clamp recordings\nOne day or 2 d post-injury, sham-injury, and age-matched naive male mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with a cold sucrose slicing solution (in\u2009mM: 2.5\u2009KCl, 1.25\u2009NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 10\u2009MgCl\n2\n, 0.5\u2009CaCl\n2\n, 26\u2009NaHCO\n3\n, 11 glucose, and 234 sucrose) prior to coronal sectioning through somatosensory cortex at 300\u2009\u03bcm. All in vitro and whole\u2013cell patch clamp methods were performed as previously described.\n29\nWhole\u2013cell patch clamp recordings were made from YFP+layer V pyramidal neurons of somatosensory cortex whose axon could be seen either to end in an axonal swelling (axotomized) or descend into the white matter (intact). Recordings were made in normal artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; in\u2009mM: 126\u2009NaCl, 3\u2009KCl, 1.25\u2009NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 2\u2009MgCl\n2\n, 2\u2009CaCl\n2\n, 26\u2009NaHCO\n3\n, and 10 glucose) maintained at 32\u00b0C and in some cases containing 1\u2009\u03bcM tetrodotoxin (TTX). The intracellular solution contained (in mM): 130 K-gluconate, 10 HEPES (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N-2 ethane sulphonic acid), 11 EGTA, 2.0\u2009MgCl\n2\n, 2.0\u2009CaCl\n2\n, 4 Na-ATP, and 0.2 Na-GTP, and in some cases also contained biocytin or Alexa-Fluor 594. Only cells in which the access resistance was <20\u2009M\u03a9, and the input resistance was >40\u2009M\u03a9 were accepted for data collection.\nSpontaneous (s-), evoked (e-) and miniature (m-) EPSCs were recorded in voltage clamp at a holding potential of \u221270\u2009mV with a Multiclamp 700A (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), and digitized at 10\u2009KHz with a Digidata 1440 (Molecular Devices). In order to apply a range of stimulus intensities, the threshold level of stimulation was first determined by varying the current applied during a 40\u2009msec square pulse until the smallest possible response was observed on approximately 50% of stimulus trials. The current was then maintained while the duration of the pulse was increased to 2\u00d7, 4\u00d7, 8\u00d7, and 16\u00d7, and then repeated for a total of three series. The mEPSCs were recorded with 1\u2009\u03bcM TTX in the bathing medium. Mean peak (averaged over 0.3\u2009msec) and area of the response were calculated with Clampfit (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Both sEPSCs and mEPSCs were evaluated with MiniAnalysis (Synaptosoft, Ft. Lee, NJ).\n\nField potential recordings\nField potentials were recorded with tungsten microelectrodes (1\u20133\u2009M\u03a9) using a Cygnus ER-1 amplifier (Cygnus Technology, Inc., Delaware Water Gap, PA), and digitized with a Digidata 1440 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at 5\u2009KHz. The recording electrode was placed in layer II/III of somatosensory cortex, and a concentric bipolar tungsten stimulating electrode was placed in layer VI online directly beneath the recording site. Threshold current level was defined as that required to produce a 0.2\u2009mV amplitude field negativity with a 0.02\u2009msec pulse. After this was identified, this stimulus level was applied 10\u201320 times at 0.1\u2009Hz to look for epileptiform activity. Next, a series of increasing stimulus intensities was applied by increasing the duration of the pulse to 2, 4, 8 and 16 times (\u00d7) threshold. This was repeated for a total of three stimulus presentations that were averaged prior to calculating peak and time to peak.\n\nStatistical analysis\nWe have previously demonstrated the absence of significant differences in patch clamp recordings between na\u00efve and sham-injured animals, and these were accordingly combined into a single group of control animals.\n25\nAnimals exposed to cFPI were divided into a 1 d and a 2 d survival group, and cells used for patch clamp recordings from injured animals were further sub-divided into a group for axotomized neurons and one for structurally intact neurons. Individual cells were used as the experimental unit for analysis of patch clamp data and individual slices for field potential recordings. Group comparisons of continuous variables were made using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Tukey post hoc test; distributions were compared using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test and proportions using a\nz\n-test. Results are reported as mean\u00b1standard error of the mean (SEM) in all figures."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nThe data in this report were collected at two sites: Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, School of Medicine (Wash. U.) and University of California, San Diego (UCSD). Informed consent was obtained in accordance with procedures approved by the local human studies committees.\nBased on the literature,\n26\u201330\nwe defined \u201cchronic\u201d mTBI as three months post-injury. The inclusion criteria at both sites were as follows: isolated traumatic brain injury with or without loss of consciousness (LOC) three months to 5.5 years prior to testing; any persistent post-concussive symptoms; any length of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA); Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13\u201315 at time of injury (if available); and age 18\u201360. Exclusion criteria for both controls and mTBI patients were as follows: neurological or pre-morbid psychiatric disorder (including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] and seizure disorder); alcohol/substance abuse; and gross visual (worse than 20/30 corrected) or hearing problems.\nWash. U. site\nTwenty chronic mTBI patients (nine males) and twenty-two healthy control subjects (10 males) were enrolled to complete two sessions\u2014one involving psychometric testing and eye movement recordings during visual tracking tasks, and one involving structural and functional MRI. All mTBI patients were enrolled from the Wash. U. Concussion Clinic. As a group (\nSupplementary Table S1\n; see online supplementary material at\nwww.liebertpub.com\n) this sample included a high proportion of professionals with a low incidence of premorbid psychological or psychiatric problems. All patients but one experienced LOC, and all experienced PTA. In three patients, the duration of anterograde PTA (aPTA) was longer than 24\u2009h. Four patients had positive MRI findings, of which only three clearly related to TBI. Two patients with positive radiological findings related to TBI also had >24\u2009h PTA. The great majority of patients returned to work (80%).\nExclusion criteria for MRI included: metal objects in body (except objects proven to be safe for 3 Tesla MRI), pregnancy, and severe claustrophobia. Behavioral data for one chronic mTBI patient were incomplete. Two mTBI patients withdrew from the imaging study, one with >24\u2009h aPTA; one patient with both >24\u2009h aPTA and positive radiology was removed from the imaging study due to excessive movement during scanning.\nTherefore, while the group of patients who completed neuropsychological and visual tracking studies included three subjects with prolonged aPTA and three subjects with abnormal radiology (two subjects with both findings, for a total of four subjects), the group that completed the fMRI experiments included only one subject with prolonged aPTA and positive radiology (subject p17) and one subject with positive radiology only (p10). One healthy subject did not participate in the imaging session due to claustrophobia, and one was removed because of excessive movement. Overall, 17 chronic mTBI patients and 20 control subjects were included in the final analysis of the fMRI scans of the visual tracking task. All subjects were compensated for their time ($25/h for MRI sessions and $10/h for the behavioral session).\nUCSD site\nTwenty-five mTBI (21 males) patients and 25 age- and education-matched healthy control subjects (17 males) were enrolled. Patients were recruited mostly from TBI clinics at UCSD, referrals from neurologists, and other mTBI studies conducted at UCSD. Some patients were recruited from community advertisements. Subjects participated in a neuropsychological testing session, and one session in which eye movements were recorded during visual tracking while subject underwent MEG. In this second sample, 95% of patients reported PTA, and 70% of patients reported LOC. Patients were excluded if they were hospitalized for their injury, had an abnormal computed tomography (CT) or MRI (only for patients who went to the emergency department), were intubated, had multiple TBIs, had loss of job due to the injury, had confirmed use of psychotropic or cognitive enhancing medication, or showed evidence of malingering (Test of Memory Malingering). Admission GCS scores and MRI/CT reports at time of injury were unavailable.\nTherefore, the two groups slightly differed in terms of enrollment and severity of mTBI. However, they were similar in terms of level of function (as most patients returned to their original work) and low levels of psychopathology.\nHealthy control subjects at both sites were recruited from the universities' research volunteer databases, while some controls subjects at UCSD were recruited from community advertisements. Control subjects were not related to the mTBI patients and were matched with patients for age and education. Control subjects were required to have no history of TBI, closed head injury, or concussion, as confirmed by Brain Injury Screening Questionnaire (BISQ). Control subjects also were required to have no history of depression or PTSD.\nSupplementary Table S1\npresents information about demographics, socio-economic status, injury variables, and return to work. To insure that the behavioral testing procedure was standardized, the staff performing the measurements at both sites underwent training sessions. The coordinating center (Brain Trauma Foundation) also made a video demonstration of the behavioral battery, which was reviewed by the neuropsychologist at each of the participating sites.\n\nNeuropsychological testing\nThe following neuropsychological tests were administered at both sites: Head Injury Symptom Checklist (HISC), BISQ, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS), PTSD Checklist (PCL-C), California Verbal Learning Test, Second Edition (CVLT-II), Attention Network Test (ANT), Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), the Spatial Span subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale-III, and the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR). The Java version of the ANT\n31\nwas administered on Windows XP personal computer (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). All other tests were administered using a paper version. Post-concussive symptoms were measured using the HISC and BISQ. The results of several tests\u2014HISC, BISQ, CES-D, PCL-C, and ANT\u2014are reported as raw scores as these measures lack normative scores. CVLT test results were converted into Z-scores based on test norms (except the Immediate Recall subtest, which was converted into T-values). CAARS and COWAT scores are reported as T-scores based on norms. The Spatial Span subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale-III, and WTAR are reported as standard scores based on the test norms. Test scores not available as standard Z-scores or T-scores (i.e., raw scores for tests without norms) were converted into Z-scores by subtracting our sample mean and dividing the result by the standard deviation of our sample.\n\nVisual tracking tasks\nDuring the Wash. U. behavioral session and UCSD MEG session, subjects were seated in a darkened room, given instructions, and then asked to perform a shortened practice version of each task before testing. The pursuit target was a red disk moving clockwise in a circular trajectory of 10\u00b0 against a black background (Wash. U. behavioral session and UCSD MEG session) or 6\u00b0 radius (Wash. U. MRI session) at 0.4\u2009Hz. The eye movement analyses presented in this paper are based on the data collected during the behavioral session. We did not observe any practice effect between the behavioral session and MRI session in the Wash. U. sample.\nThree different smooth pursuit tracking tasks were used at both sites (\nFig. 1A and 1B\n). During a TA task, only the target (red circle of 0.5\u00b0 in Wash. U. behavioral session;\nsupplementary Movie 1\n; see online supplementary material at\nwww.liebertpub.com\n) and 0.9\u00b0 in UCSD MEG session was presented on screen.\n32\nUCSD changed the dot size to achieve a smoother dot motion for the MEG display settings.\nDuring a TD task, a distracter disk (a red disk identical to the target but moving with a slightly different circular trajectory) was occasionally presented for 800\u20131200\u2009msec with a random inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 800\u20131500\u2009msec (\nsupplementary Movie 2\n; see online supplementary material at\nwww.liebertpub.com\n). The distracter phase angle always crossed the target phase angle (i.e., the path of the distracter either fell behind or moved ahead of the target), although the target and distracter stimuli always remained distinct throughout the trajectory because of their different radial distances or eccentricities. There were four types of distracter paths, averaged over eccentricities (inside [9.25\u00b0] or outside [10.75\u00b0] of target trajectory): 1) Initial position (ahead; +2.5\u00b0 of phase angle), speed (slower; 0.34\u2009Hz), direction (clockwise); 2) Initial position (behind; \u22122.5\u00b0 of phase angle), speed (faster; 0.46\u2009Hz), direction (clockwise); 3) Initial position (ahead; +2.5\u00b0 of phase angle), speed (slower; 0.34Hz), direction (counterclockwise); 4) Initial position (ahead; +2.5\u00b0 of phase angle), speed (faster; 0.46\u2009Hz), direction (counterclockwise). This task was designed to measure the subject's ability to suppress distracting information, a frequent complaint of mTBI patients.\nDuring a Gap task, the target sometimes disappeared. The subject was instructed to follow the target's movement as closely as possible and anticipate the target's movement if it was not visible. Three gap durations were randomly presented (short, 30\u00b0 [208\u2009msec]; medium, 45\u00b0 [312\u2009msec]; and long, 60\u00b0 [416\u2009msec]), with a random ISI of 1250\u20133250\u2009msec. This task was designed to measure the subject's ability to maintain predictive signals, which are necessary for accurate tracking, in the absence of sensory input. The behavioral data from the gap task and MEG data will be reported in a separate paper.\nDuring all three tasks, a central red dot was presented when the target was not moving (fixation-only periods). During the Wash. U. behavioral session, the central dot blinked before the target started to move and turned green before the block ended (\nsupplementary Movie 1\n). During the Wash. U. behavioral session, eight blocks of the eye movement tasks were presented: two blocks of the TA task, three blocks of the TD task, and three blocks of the Gap task. Each block contained three trials, where each trial consisted of six complete cycles around the circle (2.5\u2009sec duration for each cycle, yielding a trial duration of 15\u2009sec). The three tasks were presented in a different random order for each subject for the first set of blocks (1\u20133). The random task order for the first set of three blocks was reversed for the second set of three blocks (4\u20136). Blocks 7 and 8, which involved the TD task and Gap task, were presented in random order. About 29 visual distracters were presented per block in the TD task (not counting the distracter presented during the first cycle of each trial), and three blocks were run in each subject; thus, a total of 87 distracters were presented for each subject.\nDuring the Wash. U. MRI session, each eye movement task was performed in three separate scans, where each scan lasted for 2.8\u2009min. The order of scans was determined using a Latin square. Each trial of tracking lasted 15\u2009sec, consisting of six 2.5-sec cycles, and was followed by a fixation period (only central red fixation dot presented) of 9\u2009sec, 11\u2009sec, or 13\u2009sec, randomly determined. A random fixation interval allowed us to estimate the BOLD signal during the visual tracking task without assuming a hemodynamic response function.\n33\n,\n34\nSix trials were presented within each scan. Before each MRI scan started, the name of the task was visually presented on screen for several seconds, disappearing with the start of first MRI frame and replaced by the central red fixation dot, which was presented for 8\u2009sec. Eye movements were recorded in all subjects. Eye position signal was of lower quality in two mTBI patients and two controls subjects.\nIn the UCSD session, all three tasks were presented in the same block. Two orders were used: TA, Gap, TD; or TD, Gap, TA. The order of the tasks was counterbalanced across subjects. Each block consisted of 11 complete cycles of the circle (27.5\u2009sec) and was presented three times with the same task order. About 11 visual distracters were presented per block (not counting the distracter presented during the first cycle), and three blocks were run in each subject; thus, 33 distracters were presented to each subject. A nine-point eye position calibration was performed before each block on both sites in all sessions.\nAn example recording for an mTBI (\nFig. 1C\n) and a healthy control (\nFig. 1D\n) subject is shown. Eye data were analyzed similarly to previously published data.\n32\nWe analyzed the mean and standard deviation (SD) of radial error (RE), mean and SD of tangential error (TE), mean phase error, and saccade parameters, including the number of saccades and the mean saccade duration (\nFig. 1C\n). Calculation of tracking parameters during the TA task was based on the entire period of target motion after the first cycle. In the analysis of the TD task, the 500\u2009msec interval preceding distracter onset was separately analyzed from the 1000\u2009msec interval following the distracter onset. In the Wash. U. behavioral session, the software controlling the TA task was identical to the TD task but distracters were not visible. Therefore, the 500\u2009msec interval before distracter \u201conset\u201d in the TA task could be processed as in the TD task. Due to technical problems, only 19\u2009mTBI patients and 20 matched controls were included in the analysis comparing the 500\u2009msec interval before distracter presentation in the TA and TD tasks. In the Wash. U. behavioral session, for each block, the eye analysis software analyzed eye movement traces from the eye with the smaller SD of radial error. This procedure minimized the influence of noise on the data and is justified because ocular dominance should have little influence on visual tracking performance\n35\n,\n36\n; a detailed rationale is described by Maruta and colleagues.\n36\n\nApparatus\nAn infrared eye-tracker (EyeLink 1000; SR Research Ltd, Ontario, Canada) was used to record eye movements binocularly in the Wash. U. behavioral session (sampling at 500\u2009Hz), and monocularly during the Wash. U. MRI (sampling at 500\u2009Hz) and the UCSD MEG sessions (sampling at 1000\u2009Hz). A desktop mount with chin rest was used in the Wash. U. behavioral session, and a long-range mount with head stabilization was used in the Wash. U. MRI and UCSD MEG sessions.\nStimuli were generated on a PC running Windows XP and using Experiment Builder (SR Research Ltd, Ontario, Canada), which allowed online integration with the EyeLink 1000 (SR Research Ltd, Ontario, Canada) eye tracker. Visual stimuli were presented during the Wash. U. behavioral session on a Samsung SyncMaster 2233RZ (Samsung, Ridgefield Park, NJ) LCD monitor (1680\u00d71050 at 120\u2009Hz)\n37\nduring the Wash. U. imaging session on a Boxlight CD715X (Boxlight Corporation, WA, USA) digital light processing (DLP) projector (1024\u00d7768 at 75\u2009Hz) and rear projection screen, and during the UCSD MEG session on a Panasonic PT-D7700 (Panasonic Corporation of North America, Newark, NJ) DLP projector (1024\u00d7768 at 60\u2009Hz).\n\nEye movement data analysis\nAnalysis of eye movement data was performed using in-house software (C\u2009++ and scripts based on Matlab (The MathWorks, Natick, MA). The first cycle from each trial was always discarded. Samples that were marked as blinks or saccades were excluded from analysis. We used the EyeLink 1000 saccade and blink detector. Saccades were detected based on the following criteria: saccade motion threshold=0.1\u00b0; saccade velocity threshold=30\u00b0/sec; saccade acceleration threshold=8000\u00b0/sec\n2\n. A sample was marked as a blink when the pupil size was either very small, or the pupil either was not detected or was severely distorted by eyelid occlusion (SR Research Ltd manual). All blocks with more than 15% of frames marked as blinks were excluded from the analysis (nine blocks [6%] in mTBI patients and four [2.6%] blocks in controls were excluded from the UCSD data, while no blocks were excluded from the Wash. U. data). Eye data were corrected for hardware delays. Delays were measured by a photodiode that was connected to an amplifier that also received transistor-transistor logic pulses linked to the onset of stimulus generation. The hardware delay was 10\u2009msec for the Wash. U. behavioral session and 36\u2009msec for the UCSD session.\n\nImaging sessions at Wash. U. site\nAll MRI scans were collected on a Siemens (Siemens Corporation, New York, NY) 3T Tim-Trio scanner using standard sequences. The first imaging session consisted of structural MRI and DTI scans and roughly 30\u2009min of resting state fMRI scans. The second imaging session consisted of nine (three TA, three TD, three Gap) 5-min scans during which subjects performed the eye movement tasks in a blocked design, with 15-sec visual tracking task periods alternating with variable fixation periods (9, 11, or 13\u2009sec, randomly determined). Structural scans included a sagittal magnetization prepared gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) T1-weighted image (repetition time [TR]=1950\u2009msec; echo time [TE]=2.26\u2009msec; flip angle=9\u00b0; voxel size=1.0\u00d71.0\u00d71.0\u2009mm) and a transverse turbo spin-echo T2-weighted image (TR=2500\u2009msec; TE=435\u2009msec; voxel-size=1.0\u00d71.0\u00d71.0\u2009mm). BOLD contrast was measured with a gradient echo echo planar (EPI) sequence (TR=2000\u2009msec; TE=27\u2009msec; 32 contiguous 4\u2009mm slices; 4\u00d74\u2009mm in-plane resolution).\nDTI scans consisted of two averages of a 64-direction diffusion tensor imaging sequence (voxel size=2\u00d72\u00d72\u2009mm; TR=9200\u2009msec; TE=92\u2009msec; 9\u00d7b-value=0\u2009sec/mm\n2\n; the rest b-value=1000\u2009sec/mm\n2\n). Because this report does not include results from the resting state scans, we only describe the processing of the task scans and DTI. Functional MRI data were preprocessed using standard methods described previously.\n38\n,\n39\nPreprocessing consisted of the following steps: 1) asynchronous slice acquisition was compensated by sinc interpolation to align all slices; 2) elimination of odd/even slice intensity differences resulting from interleaved acquisition; 3) a whole\u2013brain normalization corrected for changes in signal intensity across scans; 4) data were realigned within and across scans to correct for head movement; 5) EPI data were co-registered to the subject's T2-weighted anatomical image, which in turn was co-registered with the T1-weighted MP-RAGE, in both cases using a cross-modal procedure based on alignment of image gradients.\n40\nThe MP-RAGE was then transformed to an atlas-space\n41\nrepresentative target using a 12-parameter affine transformation. Movement correction and atlas transformation were accomplished in one resampling step (resulting in an isotropic 3\u2009mm voxel size) to minimize blur and noise. The first four frames of each scan were eliminated to allow steady-state magnetization, and the remaining frames were concatenated.\nSimilar to the BOLD data, DTI data was preprocessed and transformed into standardized Talairach atlas space. Co-registration of each DTI image set was performed using vector gradient measure maximization.\n40\nThe first acquired, unsensitized (b=\u223c0\u2009sec/mm\n2\n) DTI volume was registered to the T2 image; stretch and shear was enabled (9-parameter affine transform) to partially compensate for subject motion and eddy current distortion. For the initial DTI analyses, white matter was segmented using a fractional anisotropy (FA) threshold of 0.2 or higher. Voxelwise statistical analysis of the FA data was performed using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS).\n42\nTBSS projects all subjects' FA data onto a mean FA tract skeleton, and measures differences between groups using voxelwise statistics.\nThe second imaging session consisted of nine scans (83 frames per scan; 2.8\u2009min duration) during which subjects performed the ocular pursuit tasks inside the MRI scanner. fMRI data from the second imaging session were co-registered with the data from the first imaging session. All functional MR frames in the second imaging session (the task imaging session) with a total head movement score of 0.9\u2009mm or higher, including the frame immediately after the frame that exceeded the movement threshold, were removed from analysis. Head movement values were calculated by differentiating head realignment parameters across frames (which yielded a six-dimensional time series that represents instantaneous head motion) and converting them to a single number using a previously-published method.\n43\nThe blocked-design task scans were analyzed using an assumed hemodynamic response function (HRF) time-locked to the start of each 15-sec task block\n33\nwithin a general linear model (GLM). The GLM included separate regressors for task (TA, TD, or Gap), linear trend, and baseline, and provided an estimate of the magnitude of the BOLD response at each voxel for each task. An additional set of GLMs was computed using a finite impulse response model that did not assume a shape for the HRF. This GLM was used to extract time-courses of the BOLD signal.\n\nfMRI classification analyses\nTo classify healthy controls versus chronic mTBI patients, a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) analysis was employed in which the BOLD signal magnitude was extracted for each patient or control from a region of interest (ROI) that was determined in a completely separate group of patients and controls.\n44\nTo determine the ROIs, we ran 37 voxelwise (17 mTBI, 20 controls) analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedures on the BOLD magnitudes with Task (TA, TD, Gap) and Group (mTBI, controls) as factors, where in each ANOVA one patient or one control subject was excluded. Each of the 37 statistical maps corresponded to the main effect of Group in an ANOVA after correction for multiple comparisons using a high Z-score/low cluster size threshold corresponding to\np\n=0.05 (\nz\nvalue of 4.0 or above, cluster size of 4 voxels). The peak in each ANOVA map with the highest Z-score was selected and used as the ROI in which to measure the BOLD signal magnitude in the patient or control subject that was left out of the ANOVA. This procedure ensures that the classification based on BOLD accuracy was based on an ROI that was created using data that were completely separate from the data for the patient or control subject.\nA second analysis evaluated the accuracy of classification obtained from examining individual differences in BOLD signal response of mTBI patients and controls. The BOLD response during visual tracking in each patient (with respect to a fixation baseline) was compared with the BOLD response in a group of healthy controls (17\nt\n-tests; each patient vs. 20 controls); the variability of the response in each control was assessed against the remaining controls (20\nt\n-tests; each control subject vs. the remaining control subjects) following the procedure developed in.\n45\nThe resulting z-maps were corrected for multiple comparisons (Monte Carlo correction). We counted the number of positive or negative voxels with a\nz\nvalue \u22652.25 for each patient and control subject within the \u201cabnormal\u201d group ROI (i.e., the ROI in which we find group differences). A binary logistic regression was then computed separately on positive, negative, or both negative and positive voxels.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analysis, except for voxel-wise and regional ANOVAs and t-tests of fMRI data, was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics, v.20 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY). We used in-house software to analyze the fMRI data, and results of voxel-wise statistical tests were corrected for multiple comparisons (Monte Carlo correction). Comparisons of eye data parameters and fMRI data were conducted with repeated-measures mixed model ANOVA. A sphericity correction was applied if necessary. The independent samples Mann\u2013Whitney U test was used to compare means for non-normally distributed data, and the independent samples\nt\n-test was used to compare normally distributed data. Tests of normality were performed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Statistical significance was preset at\np\n<0.05."

    "Methods": "Animals\nPregnant New Zealand rabbits were purchased from Robinson Services Inc. (Mocksville, NC) and arrived at the facility one week before giving birth. All of the kits were delivered naturally and remained with their mother after birth. All animals were housed under ambient conditions (22\u00b0C, 50% relative humidity, and a 12-h light/dark cycle), and necessary precautions were taken throughout the study to minimize pain and stress associated with the experimental treatments. Experimental procedures were approved by the Johns Hopkins University Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC).\n\nTBI surgical procedures\nNew Zealand rabbits (\nn\n=98; 31 male and 67 female) were from 19 independent litters. Rabbits from the same litter were randomly distributed into three groups: na\u00efve group (\nn\n=24; 10 male/14 female from 16 independent litters), sham group (\nn\n=24; 7 male/17 female from 14 independent litters), and TBI group (\nn\n=50; 14 male/36 female from 19 independent litters). On P5-7, rabbits were anesthetized with dexmedetomidine hydrochloride (30\u2009\u03bcg/kg, subcutaneously) and placed in a stereotaxic frame. Anesthesia was maintained with 2% inhaled isoflurane. A computer-operated thermal blanket pad and a rectal thermometer allowed maintenance of body temperature within normal limits (\u223c37\u00b0C). Respirations were monitored throughout and there were no episodes of apnea or hypoventilation noted. A midline incision was made to expose the skull, then an 8-mm craniotomy was made on the left hemisphere lateral to the sagittal suture and centered between bregma and lambda. The skull at the craniotomy site was removed without disrupting the underlying dura. A controlled cortical impact (CCI) device was used to injure the exposed cortex. The CCI device used a 6-mm, flat impactor tip and was set at a velocity of 5.5\u2009m/sec, a touching duration of 50\u201360\u2009msec, and a depth of 2\u2009mm. These injury parameters were based on previously published data by our group in postnatal rats.\n7\n,\n16\n,\n17\nInitial pilot studies using 1.5\u2009mm, 2\u2009mm, and 2.5\u2009mm depths identified that the extent of the lesion using a depth of 2\u2009mm in rabbits was comparable to that of our immature rat model with 1.5\u2009mm. This resulted in a moderate to severe lesion without significant mortality. After the injury, the skull was replaced over the injury site and secured with dental cement. The skin was then sutured together and the animals were placed in an animal incubator to recover. The sham group underwent craniotomy without TBI. All kits were returned to their mother and littermates after their recovery from anesthesia. The na\u00efve group did not receive any intervention. We closely monitored all animals post-operatively with weight and health surveillance recordings, as per ACUC guidelines.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nCresyl violet staining and lesion volume estimation\nAt 1, 3, 7, and 21\u2009d after injury, the rabbits were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The brains were removed, post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose. Coronal brain sections (40\u2009\u03bcm) were cut on a frozen sliding microtome and stored in anti-freeze solution at \u221220\u00b0C until use. We mounted sections (1:6 series, 240\u2009\u03bcm apart) on glass slides and stained them with cresyl violet (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) to identify degenerating neurons and confirm the core impact injury of the TBI model. Images were acquired by Intellicam software (Intellicam LLC, Ashland, VA) and analyzed with ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD). The ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres on each section (12\u201315 sections, 1:6 series) were outlined, and the areas were measured and standardized with a grid spacing of 1\u2009mm. The volume of the hemisphere was calculated as \u03a3area\u00d7240. The percentage of lesion volume was estimated as (1 \u2013 ipsilateral hemisphere/contralateral hemisphere)\u00d7100%.\nThe contralateral lateral ventricle of the contralateral hemisphere on each section (12\u201315 sections, 1:6 series) was outlined, and the areas were measured and standardized with a grid spacing of 1\u2009mm. The volume of the contralateral lateral ventricle was calculated as \u03a3area\u00d7240. The ventricular enlargement following TBI was determined by measuring the volume of the contralateral lateral ventricle, compared with the contralateral hemisphere. This was expressed as the percentage of lateral ventricle volume.\nIonized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1)and translocator protein (TSPO) staining\nAt 1, 3, 7, and 21\u2009d after injury, the rabbits were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with saline followed by 4% PFA in PBS. The brains were removed, post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose. Coronal sections (40\u2009\u03bcm, 1:6 series) were incubated in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide solution and blocked in 3% normal goat serum in 0.1\u2009M PBS. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with goat-anti-IBA1 antibody (1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) or goat anti-TSPO antibody (1:100, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Sections were subsequently washed and incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody (1:250; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 4\u2009h at room temperature. Next, the sections were incubated for 2\u2009h in avidin\u2013biotin substrate (ABC kit, Vector Laboratories). All sections were then incubated for 1\u2009min in 3,3'-diaminobenzidine solution (Vector Laboratories). Sections were dehydrated in ethanol and Histo-Clear II (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA) before cover slips were applied with mounting medium. Sections were examined with a Leica DM2500 microscope (Leica Microsystems Inc., Bannockburn, IL).\n\nCell count\nThe staining of microglia was performed on 1:6 series extending from the level of the bregma. Microglia cells in three representative white matter regions, the corpus callosum, corona radiata, and internal capsule at the injured area were counted as previously described.\n18\nOn each section, four images were randomly captured at 40\u00d7 magnification from each white matter region. The number of \u201cactivated\u201d (bushy and round) and \u201cresting\u201d (ramified) microglia were counted as previously described.\n19\nThe ratio of the \u201cactivated cells\u201d (bushy and round) to the total number of microglial cells (ramified+bushy and round) was calculated and compared for the na\u00efve, sham, and TBI groups.\n\nReal-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\nKits from sham and TBI groups were sacrificed at 7\u2009d after surgery along with age-matched na\u00efve controls. The brains were quickly harvested and stored in RNAlater solution (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). The tissues around the injury site (or matched region in the na\u00efve and sham) were micro-dissected and the total RNA was extracted using TRIZOL (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer instructions. RNA samples were quantified using the Nanodrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer. The single-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA) was first reverse transcribed from the total RNA samples using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit with RNase inhibitor (Life Technologies). The real-time PCR was performed with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Life Technologies) using Fast 7500 Real-time PCR systems (Life Technologies). Amplification conditions included 30\u2009min at 48\u00b0C, 10\u2009min at 95\u00b0C, 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15\u2009s and 60\u00b0C for 1\u2009min. Primers were custom designed and ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, Iowa). GAPDH forward 5\u2032TGACGACATCAAGAAGGTGGTG3\u2032; GAPDH reverse 5\u2032GAAGGTGGAGGAGTGGGTGTC3\u2032; TSPO forward 5\u2032 GCTCCCTCTGTAACTGCTTT3\u2032; TSPO reverse 5\u2032 CATAGTGGGAGGCCATGAAG 3\u2032. Comparative Ct method was used to assess differential gene expressions. The gene expression levels for each sample were normalized to the expression level of the housekeeping gene encoding glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) within a given sample (\u0394Ct); the differences between sham, compared with the na\u00efve group or TBI, compared with the na\u00efve group, were used to determine the \u0394\u0394Ct. The 2-\u0394\u0394Ct gave the relative fold changes in gene expression.\n\nNeurobehavior\nNeurobehavioral tests were carried out 1\u2009d and 5\u2009d after TBI. The behavioral assessments were conducted blinded to the injury group. We videotaped each animal for 10\u2009min and scored them on a scale of 0\u20133 (0, worst; 3, best) for posture, movements of head and limbs, and duration and intensity of movements on a flat surface as previously described for rabbits.\n20\nWe also fed the kits rabbit milk with a syringe attached to an artificial nipple and assessed suck and swallow and head turn during feeding on a scale of 0\u20133 (worst-best).\n20\n,\n21\nOlfaction was tested by the intensity of aversive response to a cotton swab soaked with 100% ethanol.\n21\n,\n22\nWe assessed the righting reflex by placing the kits on their backs and recording the number of times they turned from the supine to the prone position in 10 tries. The hops and steps were scaled at 0\u20134 (0, no step or hop; 4, \u226510 steps or 4 hops).\n23\nPain sensitivity was tested by recording the time and intensity of responses to a pinch of the hind feet. Responses were scored on a 0\u20133 scale (from no response to a strong response, such as vigorously kicking the feet and making vocalizations).\n22\n\nNeurodevelopmental tests\nDevelopmental maturation was monitored daily from P1 until the day of sacrifice. The developmental measurements were modified from previously published studies.\n24\nIn brief, we recorded the first day the kits achieved developmental milestones such as eye opening, body elevation (simultaneous fore- and hind-limb elevation), righting reflex, mature gait (walking in a straight line with lifting up of limbs above the ground and lack of circling), cliff avoidance (backward propulsion to avoid the edge of an elevated surface), head elevation for more than 1\u2009min, hopping (for more than half of the duration of locomotion), and locomotion without falling.\n\nOpen field\nThe locomotor activity of the rabbit kits was assessed with the Opto-Varimex-4 Auto Track System (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). The Opto-Varimex consists of an open chamber (23.5\u00d723.5\u00d721\u2009cm) with infrared optical beam sensors composed of a detector and emitter on either side of the cage. The Auto Track system senses motion in the X and Y direction with a grid of infrared beams. Vertical motion (like head movement) is detected by a second set of photocells placed above the kits. Interruptions in the X and Y beams provide the location and distance traveled by the kits. The apparatus was placed in the test room, which has the same conditions as the animal house. The open field test was performed at 8\na.m.\nin the morning and maintained on all test days. Na\u00efve, sham, and TBI kits were placed in the apparatus before surgery and 1 and 5\u2009d after TBI surgery; spontaneous activity was recorded for 10\u2009min. The animals were not disturbed during recording. After the recording, the rabbit kits were returned to their cages. The distance traveled by the kit (cm), resting time (sec), large ambulatory movement (sec), new beam breaks, vertical sensor counts, and speed (calculated as distance traveled/large ambulatory movement) were measured and compared.\n\nT-maze spontaneous alternation\nThe T-maze spontaneous alternation test was modified from previously published methods for rodents.\n25\nNa\u00efve, sham, and TBI rabbit kits ages P14 to P17 (corresponds to \u223c4\u2009d after eye opening) were tested for three consecutive days, four trials per animal per day. The behavioral assessments were conducted blinded to injury group. The first two trials were in the morning and the second two trials in the afternoon, with an interval of 4\u20135\u2009h. Rabbits were handled daily and habituated in the test room 3\u2009h per day for five consecutive days before the test. For each trial, the rabbits were placed in the start area in an in-house\u2013made T-maze (goal arms, 50\u00d710\u00d730\u2009cm; start arm, 50\u00d716\u00d730\u2009cm) and confined for 5\u2009sec before they were allowed to choose a goal arm. The rabbits were considered to have made a choice when they placed all four paws into one arm. Thereafter, the rabbits were allowed to explore the chosen goal arm for 20\u2009sec. Then, they were removed from the goal arm and placed back in the cage before being given the next trial. The inter-trial interval was 5\u2009min. The number of alternations divided by the total number of choices was calculated and averaged.\n\nNovel object recognition\nRetention, or intact memory, was assessed by the novel object recognition test for three consecutive days on P19-21. By this age, the rabbits consistently demonstrate curiosity and exploration of the environment. The protocols were modified from previous publications for rodents.\n26\nThe behavioral assessments were conducted blinded to injury group. Rabbits were handled daily and habituated in the test room for 3\u2009h per day for five consecutive days before the test. For habituation, the animals were placed in the open field (50\u00d750\u00d740\u2009cm) box for 30\u2009min without any objects present. The test was composed of two trials. During the first trial (training trial), rabbits were initially made to face the wall and then released to the open field to explore two identical objects for 5\u2009min. The objects were placed at equal distances to the walls. During the second (testing) phase, one of the previously exposed \u201cold\u201d objects was replaced with a new \u201cnovel\u201d object. The rabbits were allowed to explore these two objects for 5\u2009min. The inter-trial interval was 60\u2009min, during which the animals were placed back in their cages. On each day, we used a completely new set of novel and old objects, and there was no overlap of the objects during the 3\u2009d of testing. The discrimination index for the second trial was used to analyze the cognitive outcomes. Discrimination index=time spent exploring the novel object/(time spent exploring the old object+time spent exploring the novel object)\u00d7100%.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data are presented as mean values\u00b1standard deviation. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or two-way ANOVA was used for group comparisons, followed by subsequent pairwise comparisons with the Bonferroni multiple comparison post hoc test. Statistical significance was set at\np\n<0.05 for all analyses. For analysis of cliff avoidance that had a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d score, Fisher's exact test was used."

    "Methods": "This prospective cohort study enrolled a convenience sample of children and youth (birth to 21 years old) with and without head trauma (Glasgow Coma Scale [GSC] score of 9 to 15) presenting to the emergency department (ED) within 6\u2009h of trauma. The study sites included three EDs: a pediatric Level 1 trauma center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a pediatric Level 1 trauma center in Orlando, Florida, and an affiliated adult Level 1 trauma center in Orlando, Florida. This study was approved by the institutional review board of each institution. Informed consent was obtained from each patient and/or their legal authorized representative prior to enrollment.\n\nEligibility for the study was determined by the treating physician based on the history of blunt head trauma presenting to the ED within 6\u2009h of injury with an initial GCS score of 9 to 15. Eligibility also was prospectively verified by the research team prior to enrollment. Head trauma patients were further categorized into children with TBI symptoms (loss of consciousness, amnesia, disorientation, or change in behavior) and children without TBI symptoms. Head CT scans were performed at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients were excluded if they: 1) had syncope or seizure prior to their head trauma; 2) had known chronic psychosis, neurological disorder, or active central nervous system pathology; 3) were pregnant; 4) were incarcerated; 5) had spinal cord injury; or 6) had hemodynamic instability.\n\nThe trauma control patients included patients presenting to the ED with a traumatic mechanism of injury not involving the head and were hemodynamically stable. The mechanisms of injury were similar to the head trauma group and included orthopedic injuries and motor vehicle collisions (MVCs). The purpose of enrolling trauma controls was to assess the biomarkers against a comparable control group, thereby simulating a real-world setting of trauma.\n\nAll initial patient assessments were made by board-certified emergency medicine physicians (mostly pediatric) trained by a formal 1-h session on evaluating patient eligibility. At the time of enrollment, the study team carefully reassessed every patient to ensure that each patient met inclusion criteria and verified any exclusion. Blood samples were obtained from each head trauma and trauma control patient within 6\u2009h of the reported time of injury. A single vial of approximately 5\u2009mL of blood was collected and placed in a serum separator tube and allowed to clot at room temperature before being centrifuged. The serum was placed in bar-coded aliquot containers and stored in a freezer at \u221270\u00b0C until it was transported to a central laboratory where samples were analyzed in batches using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for GFAP and S100\u03b2. After assessment and treatment in the ED, patients were either discharged home or admitted to hospital based on severity of their injuries, and patient management was not altered by the study.\n\nTrauma patients underwent standard CT scan of the head according to the judgment of the treating physician. CT examinations were interpreted by board-certified radiologists who recorded location, extent, and type of brain injury. Radiologists were blinded to the study protocol but had the usual clinical information. Lab personnel running the samples were blinded to the clinical data.\n\nOutcome measures\nThe primary outcome measure was the presence of intracranial lesions on initial CT scan. Intracranial lesions on CT included any acute traumatic intracranial lesions visualized on CT scan such hemorrhages (epidural, subdural, subarachnoid, ventricular, and parenchymal), contusions, edema, and pneumocephalus but excluded facial fractures and isolated skull fractures without intracranial lesions. The secondary outcome measure included the performance of the biomarkers in trauma controls versus head trauma patients.\n\nData analysis\nDescriptive statistics with means and proportions were used to describe the data. For statistical analysis, biomarker levels were treated as continuous data, measured in ng/mL, and expressed as medians with interquartile range. Data were assessed for equality of variance and distribution. Logarithmic transformations were conducted on non-normally distributed data. Group comparisons for different CT categories were performed using analysis of variance with multiple comparisons using least significant difference correction. ROC curves were created to explore the ability of the biomarkers to detect intracranial lesions on CT scan. Comparison between dichotomous groups was performed using Mann Whitney U. Estimates of the area under these curves (AUC) were obtained (AUC=0.5 indicates no discrimination and an AUC=1.0 indicates a perfect diagnostic test). Classification performance was assessed by sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). GFAP and S100\u03b2 cutpoints were selected based on the ROC curve to maximize the sensitivity and correctly identify as many patients with CT lesions as possible. All analyses were performed using the statistical software package PASW 17.0 (IBM Corporation\n\u00ae\n, Somers NY).\n\nBiomarker analysis\nSerum GFAP levels were measured in duplicate for each sample using a validated ELISA platform (Banyan Biomakers Inc., Alachua, FL). The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for this assay is 0.030\u2009ng/mL and the upper limit of quantification is 50\u2009ng/mL. The limit of detection LOD is 0.008\u2009pg/mL. Serum S100\u03b2 levels were measured in duplicate for each sample using an ELISA platform that is for research purposes only (Banyan Biomakers Inc.). The assay calibrators range from 0.016\u2009ng/mL to 2\u2009ng/mL. LOD of the S100\u03b2 assay at 0.017\u2009ng/mL and the LLOQ at 0.083\u2009ng/mL. Any samples yielding a signal over the quantification or calibrator range were diluted and re-assayed."

    "Methods": "Setting\nThe study was conducted at seven sites: Carolinas Rehabilitation, Carolinas Health Care System in Charlotte, NC (lead site); Indiana University School of Medicine and Rehabilitation Hospital of Indiana in Indianapolis, IN; Kessler Institute of Rehabilitation in West Orange, NJ; Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston, MA; TIRR Memorial Hermann in Houston, TX; The Ohio State University in Columbus, OH; and University of Washington in Seattle, WA.\n\nStudy oversight\nThe study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at each site and registered on\nwww.clinicaltrials.org\n(#NCT00779324). Participants and observers provided informed consent. An external Data and Safety Monitoring Board provided independent oversight. The data coordinating center stored, maintained, and transferred the data to the study statistician at study closure.\n\nParticipants\nParticipant recruitment occurred via referrals, letters from physicians, newsletters, and local brain injury support groups. Persons were eligible if (1) 16\u201375 years old, (2) sustained a nonpenetrating TBI at least 6 months before enrollment, and (3) obtained a score \u22656 on Observer-rated NPI-I Most Problematic. TBI was verified by record review and clinician interview with a requirement to meet at least one of the following criteria: (1) post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) \u226413; (2) GCS Motor <6 off paralytics; (3) any period of loss of consciousness attributable to TBI; (4) post-traumatic amnesia lasting \u226524\u2009h; (5) neuroimaging consistent with TBI; and/or (6) other evidence of TBI-related focal neurological findings. An observer (family member, close friend, or employer) with adequate interaction with the person with TBI to observe irritability was required.\nEnrollment was further contingent on medical and neurological stability, ability to comply with the study protocol, negative pregnancy test, and creatinine clearance >60. Exclusion criteria were: (1) inability to interact and communicate, (2) threat of harm to self or other, (3) diagnosis of other neurologic disorder, (4) schizophrenia or psychosis, (5) seizure in the month before enrollment, (6) concomitant use of typical neuroleptic agents or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (because of potential drug interactions), (7) previous adverse reaction to amantadine, (8) treatment with amantadine during the month before enrollment, and (9) enrollment in the previous single-site amantadine irritability study.\nAll psychoactive medications were on stable dosing for more than 1 month before enrollment with no plans to start or change medications during the 60-day study. Active rehabilitation therapies, behavior treatments, and counseling, if present, had been started at least 1 month before enrollment, and none started during the study. We did not attempt to record and compare groups on therapy involvement because both rehabilitation and psychological therapies may vary considerably in approach and quality among providers and hence there is no accepted method to quantify the impact of these types of therapy. Rather, we relied on random assignment to control for this and other extraneous variables between groups.\n\nProcedures\nDemographic variables, medical history, and injury data were collected by interview and verified by chart review. Measures were completed by the participant, observer, and study physician. These raters remained the same throughout the study participation. The observer rating was the primary study outcome. After baseline assessment and eligibility confirmation, Participants were randomized to receive either amantadine 100\u2009mg every morning and noon or to receive placebo. Weekly calls were made to assess tolerance and encourage compliance. The dose was reduced or terminated either temporarily or permanently when needed for presumed intolerance. Adverse events, changes in concomitant medications, and the remaining number of pills were recorded. Medication compliance was defined\na priori\nas taking 80% or more of the study medication.\nOutcome assessment occurred at day 28\u00b13 days (primary end-point) and day 60\u00b13 days. Day 28 assessment was chosen to allow enough time to observe changes in the person's irritability, accommodate NPI's 4-week observation interval, and allow direct comparison with the previous single-site study. Day 60 assessment was chosen to evaluate the longer-term effect.\n\nRandomization and masking\nGroup assignment occurred through computer-generated block randomization. Randomization was stratified for depression (Beck Depression Inventory\u2013II <13 vs. \u226513), as was also done in Hammond and associates\n4\nsingle-site amantadine irritability study, to ensure balance between the two treatment groups because depression can be independently associated with irritability. Group allocation was concealed. Allocation occurred through the data coordinating center web page. Study coordinators entered eligibility criteria, and if criteria were met, the data coordinating center sent the study coordinator and local pharmacist a study number that identified which study kit to dispense. Placebo and amantadine pills were identical in taste and appearance. All participants, observers, and personnel were blinded to group assignment. Compounding pharmacist and data coordinating center had access to blinding information.\n\nMeasures\nNPI-I Most Problematic and Most Aberrant\nThe NPI is a 40-item rating scale developed to assess 12 behavioral domains.\n5\nOnly the NPI-I domain was used for the study. NPI-I items include: bad temper, rapid mood changes, sudden anger, impatience, crankiness, argumentative. The rater selects the frequency (1\u20133) and severity (1\u20134) of the most aberrant of these behavioral aspect(s) over the preceding month. The NPI score is the product of the frequency and severity.\n5\nWe used the worst item score provided by the rater as NPI-I Most Aberrant.\nIn addition to deriving a NPI score that represented the most aberrant, the rater selected and rated the item most problematic to them (i.e., NPI-I Most Problematic). Analyses used both the NPI Most Problematic (primary efficacy outcome) and NPI Most Aberrant (secondary\npost hoc\nanalysis).\nThe NPI was designed to record caregiver impressions only. We developed a version of the NPI-I to also capture participant impressions. Because of the complexity of this task and expected difficulties of persons with TBI in memory and executive functions, we asked the raters to indicate the frequency and severity of each item rather than provide an overall rating for the domain considering all items together as in the standard administration.\nNPI-I Distress\n6\nThe observer rated the emotional distress (1\u20136) they experience in relation to the participant's behavior. Participants also completed the NPI-I Distress about their own behavior, referred to as Participant Distress.\nGlobal outcome measures\nBroad measures of general emotional and behavioral function were also collected from the three rater perspectives. Global Impression of Change (GIC) was completed by observers and participants. The observers and participants openly discussed their status and progress throughout the trial with each other and their study physician; however, completion of the GIC and the other measures was performed independently. The physician rated the Global Improvement subscale of the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI).\n7\nThe Global Improvement subscale is rated 1 through 7 (1 very much improvement and 7 very much worse). In scoring the CGI, the physicians performed a structured interview to solicit relevant information about general emotional and behavioral function (e.g., irritability, aggression, depression, impulsivity, awareness, initiation, and social interaction) from both the Observers and the Participants, and record their own direct observation and impression. The physicians then considered information obtained from the structured interview in assigning the GCI score.\nOther measures included\nBaseline Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E),\n8\nand baseline Beck Depression Inventory-II.\n9\n\nStatistical methods\nBaseline characteristics were compared between the treatment groups using the Student\nt\ntest to compare the means of variables measured on an interval scale (e.g., age) when appropriate to assume approximate normality and Wilcoxon rank sum test when not. Chi-square tests or Fisher exact tests were used for variables measured on a nominal scale (e.g., sex, race). The SAS\u00ae Enterprise Guide\n\u00ae\n5.1 was used for analyses with a two-tailed\np\nvalue of less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. The\np\nvalue was adjusted for multiple comparisons within the domain of respondent, follow-up interval, and\npre hoc\nversus\npost hoc\nanalyses using the Holm sequential Bonferroni method.\n10\nAn intention-to-treat principle was used. The primary planned analysis compared the change in NPI-I Most Problematic (frequency\u00d7severity) score from baseline to day 28 and baseline to day 60 between the two groups using a Wilcoxon rank sum (Mann-Whitney) test for ordinal data. The same type of statistical analysis was performed on NPI-I Most Aberrant and NPI-Distress. The analyses were repeated using Per Protocol Principle to compare the amantadine and placebo groups with exclusion of those participants with <80% pill count or failure to undergo follow-up NPI-I assessment.\nThe amantadine and placebo groups were compared on baseline characteristics including: age at enrollment, age at injury, years post-injury, number of TBIs, sex, race, cause of injury, GCS score, length of loss of unconsciousness, duration of post-traumatic amnesia, baseline Beck Depression Inventory-II, baseline GOS-E, baseline CGI Severity of Illness, baseline NPI-I Most Problematic score, baseline NPI-I Distress score, and study site. This was done using\nt\ntests for interval data and nonparametric tests for ordinal data.\nA pre-planned secondary analysis compared the percentages of participants considered to have meaningful change in irritability (a decrease of \u22653 points) on NPI Most Problematic, and a\npost hoc\nanalysis of NPI Most Aberrant from baseline to 28 days and baseline to 60 days between the two groups using the chi square. This meaningful change definition was used in the previous single-site study and chosen based on consumer input and investigator clinical experience. Groups were additionally compared for differences in change in Observer and Participant Global Impression of Change and Physician-rated Clinical Global Impressions.\nTrial replication will likely yield a smaller effect, even if the circumstances of the two trials were identical.\n11\nThe single-site study indicated that the probability of the treatment group showing a superior outcome to the control group was 0.70 (\np\u201d=probability (Y>X)=0.70).\nTo adjust for this replication phenomenon in our power calculation, we assumed a slightly smaller effect size of\np\n\u201d=0.63 and a power of 80% (alpha=0.05). Using these values, 78 participants would be needed in each group. Estimating an 8% loss to follow-up, the enrollment target was 84 in each of the two arms (total sample of 168)."

    "Methods": "Participants\nThis clinical trial was registered with\nclinicaltrials.gov\n(assigned identifier: NCT00409448). The study was conducted at five major trauma centers in the Central and Western regions of the United States and was approved by the institutional review board of each of institution. Eligibility criteria included age between 12 and 17 years and overnight hospitalization for a complicated mild-to-severe TBI\n14\nwithin the previous 1\u20136 months. Eligibility requirements included documented alteration of neurological functioning as measured by a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score less than 13 or evidence of neurological insult based on imaging findings documenting a TBI-related intracranial lesion (depressed skull fracture, subdural/epidural/subdural/subarachnoid hemorrhage) or intraparenchymal abnormality (contusion, hemorrhage, diffuse abnormality such as edema, or diffuse axonal injury) as observed on magnetic resonance imaging or computerized tomography, English as the primary language spoken in the home, availability of the adolescent to participate in the intervention, and family residence within a 3-h drive of the hospital. Exclusionary criteria included: 1) insufficient recovery to participate in the intervention (e.g., was in a minimally responsive state); 2) psychiatric hospitalization for child or parent during the year preceding the injury; 3) residence in an area without high-speed Internet access; 4) child residence outside the home (e.g., detention facility); or 5) diagnosis of significant intellectual disability before the injury. As detailed in\nFigure 1\ndepicting the CONSORT flow chart, 52 potential participants were excluded after screening owing to failure to meet one or more of the inclusion/exclusion criteria.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nCONSORT flow diagram.\n\nBaseline and follow-up assessments\nAfter obtaining informed consent from the parents and assent from the teen, study personnel completed the baseline assessment at the family's home. During this assessment, the primary caregiver provided demographic and background information and completed parent-report measures of child behavior problems. As detailed elsewhere,\n14\neach family was given a new computer, Web camera, and high-speed Internet access along with the links to TBI resources on the Web. Follow-up assessments were completed immediately post-treatment (6 months postbaseline) and at 6 and 12 months post-treatment, and included the same behavioral assessments that were administered at baseline.\nParticipating families were randomly assigned to one of two Internet-based interventions: 1) CAPS, a 6-month Web-based, family-centered intervention that focuses on problem solving, communication, and self-regulation, and 2) IRC group, a comparison group that received a self-guided, information-based program. Randomization was stratified on race and gender. Strata were nonwhite females, white females, nonwhite males, and white males within each site. A SAS program was created using permuted block sizes for each of the randomizations. A sealed envelope with the family's group assignment was handed to participants at completion of the baseline visit. In this fashion, group assignment was concealed from the research coordinators completing the assessments.\n\nTreatment groups\nCounselor-assisted problem solving intervention\nFour clinical psychologists served as the counselors in the CAPS program. A detailed treatment manual (available from the first author) provided detailed session objectives. All therapists participated in weekly supervision calls throughout the course of the project to maintain treatment fidelity. Adherence to session objectives was verified by end-of-session checklists completed by the psychologists and participating parents.\nParticipants in the CAPS group had an initial face-to-face session with the psychologist in the family's home. This 90-min meeting included a background interview, overview of the program, and identification of child and family goals. The family was also taught to log onto the CAPS website and access available treatment modules and to log onto Skype for the subsequent videoconference sessions.\nSubsequent CAPS sessions were completed online and consisted of a self-guided online portion and subsequent synchronous Skype sessions with the therapist. During Skype sessions, the therapist reviewed skills and employed the problem-solving process to develop a plan to address a family-identified goal. The teen with TBI and one parent or caregiver were required to participate in each of the eight core sessions and both parents and school-age siblings, when present in the home, were also encouraged to participate.\n14\nInternet resource comparison intervention\nIRC families received access to a home page with links to online resources, but not access to the CAPS content. Resources included links to local, state, and national brain-injury associations and to sites specific to pediatric brain injury, such as the Center on Brain Injury Research and Training, Brain Injury Partners, and the National Database of Educational Resources on Traumatic Brain Injury. IRC families were instructed to spend 1 or more hours per week visiting these online resources and to track the sites that they visited. At follow-up, parents provided information about the TBI-related websites visited and the time spent at each site.\n\nFollow-up assessments\nFollow-up assessments were scheduled an average of 6, 12, and 18 months after the baseline assessment and included readministration of the measures that were completed at the baseline assessment. To equate the time between baseline and follow-up assessments between groups and to maintain concealment of group assignment, follow-ups were scheduled without knowledge of whether the participant had completed the treatment protocol.\n\nMeasures\nFamily socioeconomic status\nCensus tract family income data were obtained from the 2008 census and matched to each participant based on the ZIP code of their home address at baseline. Median census tract family income was a continuous variable that served as a proxy variable of family SES in the analytic models.\n15\n,\n16\nGrade level\nGrade level at baseline was dichotomized into high school (grades 9\u201312) or middle school (grades 6\u20138) for each study participant.\nBehavioral outcomes\nParents/primary caregivers completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), a parental report that focuses on problematic behaviors in everyday settings. The CBCL provides Externalizing, Internalizing, and Total Behavior Problem composites, as well as a number of subscales within each domain. Composites were reported as T scores with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10, with higher scores indicating more-significant behavior problems. Analyses focused on the Internalizing and Externalizing Scales. Follow-up exploratory analyses of the subscales comprising the internalizing and/or externalizing scales were conducted to elucidate the nature of the effects. Comparisons across groups for subscale scores on specific domains were reported in raw form, controlling for participant age and gender owing to the restricted range of the T scores.\n17\n\nStatistical analyses\nSummary statistics as well as analysis of variance and chi-square (\u03c7\n2\n) and Fischer's exact tests were used to compare the groups on baseline demographic, injury, and behavioral characteristics. Similar analyses were conducted to examine baseline differences between those who completed the study and those who dropped out. Mixed-models analyses for continuous variables, using random intercepts and slopes, were conducted to examine the maintenance of treatment effects over time. Mixed modeling has the advantage of retaining participants who are missing data for one or more assessments. All participants who completed the baseline assessment, regardless of whether they received the intervention or completed subsequent follow-ups, were included in the analyses. To test the primary hypotheses of the moderating effects of family SES and grade level (high school vs. middle school) on behavior, we initially modeled two separate interactions: treatment group\u00d7income\u00d7time since baseline and then treatment group\u00d7child's grade level\u00d7time since baseline. When a significant interaction was detected, post-hoc analyses were conducted to elucidate the nature of the interaction effects. Secondary analyses were conducted to: 1) test whether participants experiencing higher levels of behavior problems at baseline, as defined by a T score of 60 or above on the CBCL Internalizing or the Externalizing Problems, showed greater improvement over time in the CAPS group, and 2) examine whether treatment dose, as defined by number of sessions, was associated with treatment response within the CAPS group. Effect sizes (presented as standardized estimates [\u03b2]) and the variance of each outcome explained by the model (presented as\nR\n2\n) are reported. An alpha level of\np\n<0.05 signified significance. All analyses were conducted using SAS software (version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC)."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nThis retrospective analysis was performed on data from 84 adults with blunt severe TBI (sTBI; Glasgow Coma Scale score \u22648) requiring a ventriculostomy presenting to a Level I trauma center (University of Florida Trauma System, Shands Hospital, Gainesville, Florida) from 2007 to 2010. For image analyses, 76 patients were included for whom both admission and follow-up CT scans were available (eight patients without follow-up imaging were excluded from the analyses). This group of patients included 57 males and 19 females, with an average age of 40 years (SD=15.1; range, 18\u201375).\nTo test normal LVV asymmetry, a control group including 74 random patients from University of Florida Shands Hospital (26 patients) and the University of P\u00e9cs Department of Neurosurgery (48 patients) without a history of moderate or severe TBI nor any pathological CT alteration were added to the study (40 males, average age 57.27 years; SD=18.68; range 18\u201393).\nApproval to conduct this study was received from the institutional review boards of the University of Florida and the University of P\u00e9cs. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants (or a legally-authorized representative) in the study.\n\nImaging\nAdmission CT scans were performed within 3\u2009h on average after injury (average=2.44, range, 1\u20137; SD=1.56\u2009h). An average of three follow-up scans within the first 10\u2009d of sTBI were available. Routine head trauma imaging protocol was performed on Toshiba Aquilion One helical CT scanner (Toshiba Medical Systems, Otawara, Japan). For present study, the standard, non-contrast head scans were used, acquired with the following parameters for both admission and follow-up scans: slice thickness=5\u2009mm, axial slices; kVp=120; mAs=300; field of view=512*512 pixels (227.33\u2009mm * 227.33\u2009mm).\nScans of same parameters were acquired in the control group.\n\nImage analysis\nLateral ventricle volume (LVV) measurement\nComputer-assisted manual volumetric measurement was conducted using Osirix\u2122 5.8.5 [open source] Imaging Software (\nwww.osirix-viewer.com\n).\n16\nLeft and right lateral ventricles were manually outlined (by A.T.) in each slice using the \u201cpencil\u201d (freehand region of interest) tool (\nFig. 1\n). Based on the outlined areas and slice thickness information, a three dimensional (3-D) reconstruction and volume estimation of the lateral ventricle was performed. Choroid plexus and intraventricular hemorrhage were included in ventricle outlines, if present.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nIllustration of manual lateral ventricle outlining. Left and right lateral ventricles were separately manually outlined based on image anatomy and contrast in each relevant slice. (Present image shows outlining of the left ventricle in one slice.) Then, using outlined areas from each slice and slice thickness information the software performed three-dimensional reconstruction and volume calculation of each lateral ventricle separately.\nInter- and intra-rater reliability of LVR measurement\nInter- and intra-rater reliability of LVR measurement was determined using Intraclass Correlation Coefficient.\n17\nLVRs were measured on 10 random traumatic CTs twice by \u201crater 1\u201d (A.T.) for intra-rater analysis, and once by \u201crater 2\u201d (S.R) for inter-rater analysis. Two-way model, absolute agreement type was applied, and both single and average measurement reliability was calculated. Analysis was run in MedCalc statistical software, version 15.4 (MedCalc Software bvba, Ostend, Belgium).\n18\nLateral ventricle volume ratio (LVR) calculation\nLateral ventricular asymmetry was quantified by dividing the larger LVV by the smaller, which we term the LVV ratio (LVR). For each sTBI patient's admission scan, the LVR was calculated. Evaluators were blinded to later patient CT scans, clinical information and outcomes.\nLVR also was calculated in each control patient to assess normal lateral ventricular asymmetry.\nMidline shift assessment\nMidline shift was measured as the distance between skull midline (line between anterior and posterior attachment of the falx to the skull) and the septum pellucidum at the level of the foramina of Monro. A midline shift greater than 5\u2009mm was considered significant. Midline shift was evaluated on all (admission and follow-up) scans of the sTBI patients.\n\nStatistics\nROC analysis of LVR and midline shift development\nTo determine the best admission scan LVR threshold that may be associated with the development of midline shift, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis\n19\n,\n20\nwas performed using LVR as variable and midline shift development as the classification variable as follows: negative group (patients with no significant midline shift on admission or follow-up scans) and positive group (patients with no significant midline shift on admission scan but with significant midline shift present on any follow-up scans). Thus, patients with significant midline shift on admission scan were excluded from this test. ROC analysis was performed according to DeLong and colleagues\n21\n(i.e., an exact binomial confidence interval for the area under the curve was calculated). ROC analysis was performed using MedCalc statistical software.\n18\nOdds ratio and relative risk test for \u201chigh LVR\u201d and midline shift development\nThe LVR threshold of best sensitivity and specificity yielded by ROC analysis (see above) was then used to define the \u201chigh admission LVR\u201d and \u201clow admission LVR\u201d patient groups. Odds ratios (OR) and relative risk (RR) ratios were calculated taking the \u201chigh admission LVR\u201d group as the exposed group; the \u201clow admission LVR\u201d group as the control group; patients with no midline shift on admission or follow-up scans as good outcome cases; and patients with no significant midline shift on admission scan but with significant midline shift on any follow-up scans as poor outcome cases using MedCalc statistical software.\n18"

All information was collected via patient/collateral report or, when available, via inspection of medical records.\nGCS, Glasgow Coma Scale; PTA, post-traumatic amnesia; LOC, loss of consciousness; CT, computed tomography; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; F, female; TBI, traumatic brain injury; SAH, subarachnoid hemorrhage; M, male; N/A, not available; SDH, subdural hemorrhage; EDH, epidural hemorrhage; UVA, unmotored vehicle accident.\nParticipants were classified as A) mild when GCS was 13\u201315, acute CT findings were unremarkable and no focal lesions were visible on a chronic MRI, LOC was 30\u2009min or less and PTA was shorter than 24\u2009h; or B) moderate-severe, when GCS was less than 12, positive acute CT findings or chronic intracranial abnormality defined as focal lesions visible on MRI were present, LOC was longer than 30\u2009min, and PTA longer than 24\u2009h. If only one of these criteria was met (i.e., GCS lower than 13, LOC longer than 30\u2009min, PTA longer than 24\u2009h or presence of any trauma-related abnormality), it was sufficient to exclude the patient from the mild TBI group and to classify them as moderate-severe (\nTable 1\n). As these are all common occurrences following TBI, perhaps not surprisingly 18 out of 21 participants were assigned to the moderate to severe group and only three to the mild group. However, it is important to mention that other classification systems would lead to different characterizations of the sample; in particular, those participants who are assigned to the moderate-severe group merely due to the presence of skull or intracranial abnormalities would be defined as complicated-mild TBI or high-risk mild TBI patients.\n37\n,\n38\nAll TBI participants were cleared for contraindication to MRI scanning.\nNormal healthy comparison participants (NC;\nn\n=\u200921) were sampled from a large existing database of participants scanned at the University of Illinois on the same scanner model. Participants in this database were recruited from the community of Urbana-Champaign, Illinois. For NC participants, eligibility criteria included: 1) right handedness (at least 75% on the Edinburgh Handedness Questionnaire); 2) age between 18 and 80; 3) no previous history of psychiatric and neurological illness or traumatic brain injury; 4) a score >27 on the Mini-Mental State Exam; 5) normal or corrected-to-normal vision of at least 20/40 and no color blindness; and 6) suitability for MRI environment. Each TBI patient was matched pairwise with a NC participant for sex, age, education and handedness. A two-tailed\nt\n-test revealed that the TBI and NC groups did not significantly differ in age (\nt\n=\u200920,\np\n>\u20090.5) or education (t\u2009=\u200920,\np\n>\u20090.5;\nTable 1\n).\nAll participants signed a written informed consent and were compensated for their participation. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at University of Iowa and the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign.\nNeuroimaging data\nFor both groups, all neuroimaging data were collected during a single session. Data for TBI participants were acquired at the University of Iowa on a 3T whole-body MRI scanner (Magnetom TIM Trio; Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) operated with a 12-channel RF head receive coil. High resolution T1-weighted brain images were acquired using a three-dimensional (3D) Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo Imaging (MPRAGE) protocol with 208 contiguous coronal slices, echo time (TE)\u2009=\u20093.04\u2009msec, repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u20092530\u2009msec, field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u2009256\u2009mm\n2\n, voxel size\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm\n3\n, and flip angle\u2009=\u200910\u00b0. T2*-weighted resting state data were collected with a fast echo planar imaging (EPI sequence) with BOLD contrast (6\u2009min, TR\u2009=\u20092000\u2009msec, TE\u2009=\u200930\u2009msec, 31 slices acquired in ascending ordervoxel size: 3.4\u2009\u00d7\u20093.4\u2009\u00d7\u20093.5mm, 64\u2009\u00d7\u200964 matrix, flip angle\u2009=\u200975\u00b0).\nMRI data for the NC group was collected using a 3T Siemens Trio Tim system at the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign. High resolution T1-weighted brain images were acquired using a 3D MPRAGE protocol with 192 slices (TE\u2009=\u20093.32\u2009msec, TR\u2009=\u20091900\u2009msec, FOV\u2009=\u2009230\u2009mm\n2\n, voxel size\u2009=\u20090.9\u2009mm\n3\n, and flip angle\u2009=\u20099\u00b0). Resting state images were acquired with a fast EPI sequence (6\u2009min, TR\u2009=\u20092000\u2009sec, TE\u2009=\u200925\u2009msec, 35 slices acquired in ascending order, voxel size 3.4\u2009\u00d7\u20093.4\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u2009mm, 64\u2009\u00d7\u200964 matrix, flip angle\u2009=\u200980\u00b0). During resting state data collection, all participants were instructed to keep their eyes closed.\nPre-processing\nFunctional MRI data pre-processing was carried out using FSL 5.0.4 (FMRIB's Software Library,\nwww.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl\n).\n40\nThe investigator who conducted the analysis was not blinded to whether the data analyzed was collected from TBI or NC participants. High-resolution T1 images were skull stripped using BET and the resulting masks were further manually inspected and corrected.\n41\nEPI data were then motion corrected using MCFLIRT, and brain extracted and spatially smoothed using a full width at half maximum 6.0\u2009mm Gaussian kernel. Single-subject independent component analysis (ICA) was computed with MELODIC and each component was visually inspected and manually classified as signal (components of interest) or noise (e.g., collection artifacts, signal of non-neural origin) by two independent raters using a custom-made graphic user interface (\nhttps://github.com/ktera/fmri-ica-gui\n).\n42\u201344\nA moderator, who made the final classification, further rated components on which the two raters did not achieve agreement. Inter-rater reliability analysis using Cohen's kappa statistics was performed to determine consistency among raters, and it was found that \u03ba\u2009=\u20090.759, with a disagreement of 9%, interpreted as substantial agreement.\n45\nThe following steps included temporal filtering for frequencies below 0.008 and above 0.1\u2009Hz, nuisance regression with FEAT (using nuisance ROIs placed in white matter and cerebrospinal fluid of the left ventricle and six motion parameters), global signal regression and volume censoring based on a conjunction of BOLD signal spikes and motion.\n46\nNo volumes were scrubbed from any of the participants EPI data, likely due to ICA denoising and the use of the simultaneous nuisance regression approach suggested by Hallquist and colleagues.\n47\nSpatial normalization of the functional images to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) 2-mm template brain was computed using the boundary based registration algorithm.\n48\nRegistration from MPRAGE to MNI space was computed using FNIRT with the default 10\u2009mm warp resolution. The two resulting transformations were concatenated and applied to the original EPI data to transform it into standard MNI space. This process allowed to better account for local anatomical variability due to atrophy and ventricle deformation.\n49\n,\n50\nA research specialist with extensive experience in processing and analyzing neuroimaging data collected on neurological patients with focal lesions and blinded to diagnosis examined each participant's T1 for visible trauma-related focal lesions and identified eight participants who clearly showed distinct regions of atrophy possibly due to head contusion. Focal lesions were hand traced using FSLVIEW and the resulting masks were used during spatial normalization with FNIRT in order to increase the quality of the fit to the MNI brain.\nData for the TBI and NC groups were collected in separate scanners and with two slightly different protocols. In order to clarify the possible confounding effect of the multi-site acquisition, signal-to-noise (SNR) analysis was performed to determine if the marked differences between the two groups could be explained by different scanner properties (\nsupplementary text\nand\nTables S1\nand\nS2\n; see online supplementary material at\nwww.liebertpub.com\n).\nSeed analysis\nRSNs generated by Smith and colleagues\n9\nand available at\nhttp://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/analysis/brainmap+rsns\nwere used as network ROIs (also known as \u201cseeds\u201d) during the seed analysis. The RSNs were derived applying group ICA to extract 20 components from a 36 subjects rs-fMRI dataset, and were found to match considerably to 10 components resulting from group ICA carried out on the 29,671-subject BrainMap activation database.\n9\nIn addition, these components highly resemble the ones generated by the Group ICA analysis performed by Stevens and colleagues\n18\non a mild TBI sample, thus eliminating the potential concern in employing FC maps derived from a healthy sample to study a clinical population dataset.18 In particular, from the Smith database we selected as seeds RSN 420 (DMN), 620 (SMN), 820 (ECN), and 920 and 1020 (right and left FPN, respectively;\nFig. 1A\n).\n9\nBoth ECN and FPN have been found to be crucial for externally-focused attention, and thus were selected as examples of EONs, while the DMN served as the ION, and the SMN as a sensory network.\n12\n,\n15\nIn addition, in order to better investigate inter-hemispheric FC differences between TBI patients and control participants, for each RSN, FSL was used to create symmetrical left and right lateralized seeds, only including network regions situated in one hemisphere (excluding the left and right FPNs, as they already showed strong lateralization;\nFig. 1B\n). Lateralized maps were utilized for the seed analysis. All ROIs were generated from the Smith network maps with a threshold of Z\u2009>\u20092.33.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nFive resting state networks (RSNs)\n9\nwere selected as regions of interest (ROIs) for the seed analysis. For each RSN, FSL was used to generate symmetrical left and right lateralized seeds, only including network regions situated in one hemisphere. Given their already strongly lateralized nature, left and right fronto-parietal network map were not modified before being used as ROIs. A threshold of Z\u2009>\u20092.33 was applied to all maps to create network-based ROIs. The networks are shown on the transverse plane\n(A)\nand on the sagittal plane\n(B)\n. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nThe concatenated transform obtained during pre-processing was applied to transform the seeds from MNI to native space and again to transform the seed correlation maps to MNI space. ROI correlation analysis included computing voxel-wise Pearson coefficients between the corrected average time series extracted from a given seed network with the corrected time series for each voxel in the brain; in order to ensure a normal distribution of the r values, MATLAB (2014a, The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts) was used to transform the resultant statistical maps to Fisher's z-scores.\n51\nA four-dimensional image file was created by concatenating individual network seed maps and FSL's flameo tool was used to perform a between participants ordinary least-square regression.\n52\nTo determine statistical significance and account for multiple comparisons, each network seed map was thresholded at Z\u2009>\u20093.11, with a cluster significance of\np\n<\u20090.05. For each network seed, the resulting Z-statistic map represented a group average and a contrast of group differences. After visual inspection, anatomical labels were assigned by referencing the Harvard-Oxford Cortical and Subcortical Structural Atlases in the FSL analysis package.\n53\n,\n54\nIn order to obtain correlation values between different ROI pairs, the mean time series of all voxels contained in each ROI was extracted and correlated with the mean time series of all other ROIs. The resultant Pearson coefficient was then converted into a Fisher's z-score as was done for the voxel-wise analysis. Functional connectivity matrices and connectivity dendrograms were separately generated for each group using the obtained Fisher's z-values and Matlab's heatmap, linkage, and dendrogram functions. Further statistical analysis on these data was carried out using SPSS (released 2012, IBM SPSS Statistics for MacIntosh, Version 21.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).\nLastly, in order to verify whether inter-hemispheric FC differences between groups were due to the presence of trauma-related focal lesions in the TBI sample, the same analyses were repeated eliminating the participants with lesions from the TBI sample and their match from the NC group.\n\nExperiment 2\nParticipants and behavioral data\nParticipants included the same 21 TBI participants from experiment 1. Each of the TBI participants were administered a paper version of the Rey Osterrieth Complex Figure Test-Copy (ROCFT-C) and the Rey Osterrieth Complex Figure Test-Delayed Recall (ROCFT-DR). As no comparable neuropsychological behavioral data were collected for all of the NC group, TBI participants' ROCFT scores were z transformed in order to compare their performance with the population mean.\nThe ROCFT score collected for the TBI participants were z-transformed using internally generated normative data.\n55\nInspection of the standard scores revealed that 75% of the sample placed below average (Z\u2009<\u20090), with 29% one SD below average (Z\u2009<\u20091) and 15% two deviation standards below mean (Z\u2009<\u2009\u22122;\nTable 2\n). For the subset of the TBI group for whom GCS information was available (\nn\n=\u200910), there was no correlation between GCS and performance on the ROCFT-C (r\u2009=\u2009\u22120.211,\np\n=\u20090.559), nor between GCS and ROCFT-DR (r\u2009=\u20090.254,\np\n=\u20090.478). As the ROCFT\u2013DR has been found to be more strongly associated with executive functions than ROCFT-C, the former measure was regarded as more inclusive and globally representative of TBI patients' functioning, and used as a covariate of interest to investigate how inter-hemispheric FC may correlate with neuropsychological measures.\n56\nTable\n2.\nPerformance on the Rey Osterrieth Complex Figure Test\nRey Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (z-scores)\nCopy\nDelayed recall\nMean\n\u22120.641\n\u22120.705\nSD\n1.294\n1.114\nZ\n>\u20091 (N)\n2\n2\n\u22122\u2009<\nZ\n<\u2009\u22121 (N)\n3\n6\nZ\n<\u2009\u22122 (N)\n2\n3\nOpen in a separate window\nSD, standard deviation.\nAnalysis of the relationship between FC and RCFT-delayed performance\nFSL's flameo tool was used to perform an ordinary least square regression entering as a factor the demeaned z-scores for the ROCFT-DR.\n52\nThe association between FC and performance of TBI participants in the ROCFT-DR was assessed by examining the correlation between normalized performance scores and FC in network seed maps.

    "Methods": "Animals\nA total of 59 Fischer rats (male,\nn\n=26, and female,\nn\n=33; Harlan Laboratories, Inc., Frederick, MD) were included in the study. All animals were first acclimatized to handling and behavioral testing equipment and then were evaluated for baseline function. Subsequently, they received moderate (12.5-mm) contusion injuries followed by locomotor recovery assessment every week post-SCI using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) open-field locomotor test and every other week using CatWalk and GridWalk analysis until endpoint (13 weeks post-SCI). Rats were housed in pairs in the animal facility and maintained under conditions of constant temperature and humidity on a 12-h light/dark cycle. Mean age and weight for males and females at the time of injury was 14.22 weeks and 260.36\u2009g for males and 18.02 weeks and 193.14\u2009g for females. Temporal weight recordings of animals through the course of the study are shown in\nFigure 1\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nMale rats are significantly heavier than female rats throughout the study. This study considers the weight of the animal to be a covariate with gender given that it may interfere with the locomotor measures. This figure shows the progression of the animal weights throughout the study. Error bars indicate standard error of the mean. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was done on these data and showed that the difference in weights throughout the study was significant. The three asterisks indicate\np\n<0.001.\n\nPreoperative preparation\nAdult female and male Fischer rats were housed according to National Institutes of Health guidelines and the Guide for the Care and Use of Animals. All animal procedures were approved by the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Miami, FL). Before surgical procedures, animals were weighed and anesthetized with a mixture of 2% isoflurane and 30% oxygen. An adequate level of anesthesia was determined by monitoring the corneal and hindlimb withdrawal reflexes. The backs were then shaved and aseptically prepared with chlorhexidine (Phoenix Pharmaceutical Inc., St. Joseph, MO). Lacrilube ophthalmic ointment (Allergan Pharmaceuticals, Irvine, CA) was applied to the eyes to prevent drying. Throughout surgery, rats were kept on a homeothermic blanket system (Harvard Apparatus Ltd., Kent, UK) to maintain body temperature at 37\u00b10.5\u00b0C as assessed by a rectal probe.\n\nModerate thoracic spinal cord contusion injury\nRats were subjected to a moderate contusion injury using the MASCIS impactor.\n57\nA laminectomy at thoracic vertebra T8 exposed the dorsal surface of the spinal cord underneath without disrupting the dura mater. Stabilization clamps were placed around the vertebrae at T7 and T9 to support the column during impact. The exposed spinal cord was moderately injured by dropping a 10.0-g rod from a height of 12.5\u2009mm. The contusion impact height, velocity, and compression were monitored. Animals were excluded immediately when height or velocity errors exceeded 7% or if the compression distance was not within the range of 1.25\u20131.75\u2009mm. A total of 6 animals (2 males and 4 females) were immediately excluded from the study because of poor impact parameters. An additional 2 male rats were also excluded from the study because of either a bladder rupture at 7 days post-SCI or pre-endpoint death at 14 days post-SCI. After injury, muscles were sutured in layers and the skin closed with metal wound clips.\n\nPostoperative care\nRats were allowed to recover in a warmed cage with water and food easily accessible. Gentamicin (5\u2009mg/kg, intramuscular; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) was administered immediately postsurgery and then daily for 7 days. The analgesic, Buprenex (0.03\u2009mg/kg, subcutaneous [s.c.]; Reckitt Benckiser, Richmond, VA), was delivered postsurgery and daily for 2 days. Lactated Ringers (5 cc, s.c.) was given twice a day for 7 days, or longer if needed. Bladders were manually expressed by gentle abdominopelvic compression twice-daily (Crede's method) until bladder function returned. There was no difference in bladder care between male and female rats. Signs of hematuria or bladder infection (either blood in urine or cloudy urine) were observed in 86.3% of males and 79.3% of females initially post-SCI. Using a Pearson's chi-square test, this difference was not statistically significant, and the condition resolved quickly over time. Animals had access to food and water\nad libitum\n. Animals were caged in pairs with Alpha Dri\n\u00ae\nbedding (changed three times a week) and were provided water bottles with long curved sipper tubes.\n\nBehavioral testing\nBBB and BBB subscore\nHindlimb motor function was assessed using the open-field (BBB) scale,\n58\na test developed to assess deficits and recovery after thoracic contusion injuries. Hindlimb function was scored from 0 (no observable movements) to 21 (normal locomotion). Individual rats were placed in a metal elliptical enclosure, allowed to accommodate to the enclosure, and then observed for 4\u2009min by two trained observers. This test was performed weekly for the 13-week duration of the experiment.\nA BBB subscore analysis was performed as previously described.\n59\nFor the BBB subscore, only animals that achieved consistent weight support were analyzed.\n60\nBBB subscores were assigned while monitoring performance during the BBB test. Subscores were assigned as follows: paw position: parallel paw rotation at initial contact (1 point/limb) and liftoff (1 point/limb); toe clearance: occasional clearance (<50% of the time, 1 point/limb), frequent clearance (51\u201395%, 2 points/limb), consistent clearance (>95%, 3 points/limb); tail position: down (0 point), alternating (1 point), up (2 points); and trunk stability (1 point). The cumulative scores for each hindlimb and tail position were summed to yield a single score (maximum of 13 points per rat). The BBB subscore was calculated from the weekly BBB test scoring forms for the 13-week duration of the experiment.\nGridWalk test\nFor the GridWalk behavior test, deficits in descending fine motor control were examined by assessing the ability of the animals to navigate across a 1-m-long runway enclosed in a clear Plexiglass chamber with irregularly assigned gaps (0.5\u20135.0\u2009cm) between round metal bars, as described previously.\n61\nPretraining procedures included acclimating the rats to the GridWalk by giving them treats, having low lights, talking to them in low tones, petting them, and having them walk across the grid for two runs for 6\u2009min for 4 days. Rats were also trained to follow the scents of treats, Q-tips, and water bottles. Crossing the runway required that the animals accurately place their limbs on the bars. In baseline and postinjury testing, six crossings were analyzed. The number of footfall errors (where the hindlimb failed to grasp a bar and instead fell between them) was counted in each crossing, and a mean error rate was calculated and expressed as a percentage of the total hindlimb steps. This test was performed preinjury (baseline) and then every other week, starting at 3 weeks postinjury, for the 13-week duration of the experiment.\nCatWalk gait analysis\nGait was analyzed during overground locomotion using the CatWalk device (Noldus Information Technology Inc., Leesburg, VA),\n62\nwhere the walking patterns of all four limbs were filmed from underneath while the animal crossed an enclosed walkway. The walkway had a glass floor in which light was shone from one of the long edges. Paw-floor contact showed up brightly, whereas the rest of the floor appeared dark. A good run was determined when a rat took three or more consecutive steps without stopping while crossing the walkway, and the average of all the good runs per animal were then analyzed. Using the CatWalk software (v10.1), paw prints were labeled and 176 different parameters were analyzed for baseline and at endpoint. Thereafter, 10 parameters of interest were longitudinally analyzed for each time point: base of support; stride length (forelimbs); stride length (hindlimbs); speed; regularity index; support diagonal; support fours; couplings of diagonal paw pair; single stance; and hindlimb swing. Rats that were not able to take weight-supported hindpaw steps (BBB <10) and instead dragged their torso across the walkway were excluded from the analysis of these 10 parameters and are summarized in\nTable 1\n. In performing the CatWalk, these animals relied upon their forelimbs for forward propulsion, dragging the rest of their body when traversing the walkway. This locomotor behavior made it difficult to accurately count the number of hindlimb steps. Therefore, in order to include all the animals in comparative CatWalk analysis (dragging and nondragging), two parameters were additionally chosen for examination: the ratio of intensity of forepaw to hindpaw prints and speed of the animal when crossing. These parameters could be consistently measured in all animals. Post-SCI, there is increase in the use of forelimbs to move across the runway, which should be detected as an increase in the pawprint intensity of the forelimbs to the hindlimbs on the glass floor when transversing the runway. Additionally, for dragging animals, given that the force of the dragged hindlimbs is dissipated over a larger surface area, the intensity of the hindlimb prints should be less than those of rats able to take weight-supported steps.\nTable\n1.\nComparison of the Number of Male and Female Animals That Were Unable to Take Weight-Supported Plantar Steps Post-SCI\nTime point after SCI (weeks)\nFemales\nMales\n3\n4\n7\n5\n4\n6\n7\n3\n5\n9\n3\n5\n11\n4\n5\n13\n4\n6\nOpen in a separate window\nThere were 2 males and 1 female that were unable to bear their weight 3 weeks after injury (the first CatWalk time point after SCI), but regained that ability in later weeks. Additionally, 1 male and 1 female rat, who were taking weight-supported steps post-SCI, eventually lost this ability. At endpoint, 6 males and 4 females were unable to take consistent weight-supported plantar steps.\n\nHistology\nAt 13 weeks postinjury, all rats received i.p. injections of terminal anesthesia (100\u2009mg/kg of ketamine and 10\u2009mg/kg of xylazine) and transcardially perfused with cold phosphate-buffered saline, then 4% paraformaldehyde (0.1\u2009M, pH 7.4) as previously described.\n63\nThe T6\u2013T10 thoracic spinal cord segments (2\u2009cm), which contained the complete lesion, were dissected and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin-embedded cord segments were cut into 10-\u03bcm-thick sagittal sections and used to examine histological staining. These thinner sections allowed better study of damaged versus normal-appearing tissue after staining. Every 10th sagittal section of the paraffin-embedded T6\u2013T10 segment (i.e., every 100-\u03bcm interval spanning the width of the spinal cord) was mounted onto slides, stained with haematoxylin, eosin, and Luxol fast blue, dehydrated, and cover-slipped in Pro-Texx mounting medium (Baxter Diagnostics, Deerfield, IL) for histological analysis.\n\nEstimation of volumes\nStained sections were used to quantify volumes of normal-appearing GM and WM within the spinal cord piece using computer-assisted microscopy and MBF Biosciences Stereo Investigator software (version 10; MicroBrightField, Inc., Williston, VT). Contours were traced using the 4\u00d7 objective, and the 20\u00d7 objective was used to help determine borders between healthy and injured tissue. Algorithms for computations of Z-stack volumes of the spinal cord piece were performed according to Neuroleucida Explorer 5.64 (MicroBrightField) using the three-dimensional enclosed volume contour calculation. In each section, the perimeter (contour) of the total spinal cord section, the normal-appearing GM, and normal-appearing WM were separately traced on live images. Normal-appearing GM was distinguished from damaged tissue by the presence of healthy neurons and normal cellular density (without the presence of numerous nuclei, which is indicative of immune cell infiltration). Normal-appearing WM was defined as being nonfragmented, filamentous, darkly blue stained (not pale blue), and lacking immune cell infiltration.\n64\nEach traced section was logged into the software using serial section manager, which tracked the positions of each section within the 20-mm-long Z-stack to enable volume calculations using the NeuroExplorer algorithms. In addition to volume analysis, we estimated the lesion length as the distance between the most rostral and the most caudal extent of the lesion in the mid-section as well as the cross-sectional area of the ventral white matter (VWM) at the injury epicenter. The VWM contains important axonal tracts involved in the locomotion of the rat, as demonstrated in studies targeting specific transection of WM regions of the rat thoracic spinal cord.\n65\n\nStatistical analysis\nAn analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), excluding baseline data, analyzed using SAS software (Version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC), was applied to determine whether there was an overall gender effect in all outcome measures, with gender as the between-subjects factor, time point as the within-subjects factor, and age and weight at time of injury and baseline score as covariates. An ANCOVA should be used when a covariate, or \u201ca secondary variable that can affect the relationship between the dependent variable and other independent variables of primary interests,\u201d is present.\n66\nAdditionally, it is more appropriate to use an ANCOVA with the baseline score as an addtional covariate than performing an ANOVA on the percentage change from baseline.\n67\nIn this experiment, an ANCOVA was used to account for the covariates of age, weight, and baseline score when determining the effect of gender on recovery. Age and weight are considered covariates as well because they can change the relationship between the independent variable of gender and the behavioral measures (BBB, GridWalk, and CatWalk). For post-hoc analysis, Bonferroni's correction for multiple tests was applied. The results were then converted to a percentage change by using mean baseline scores. Linear correlations, using GraphPad Prism software (v. 6.05; GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA), were also performed on the stereological data obtained from the male and female rats with their respective BBB score at endpoint.\np\nvalues obtained were corrected to account for differing sample sizes. Results and figures are presented as means\u00b1standard error of the mean. Statistical significance was determined when the adjusted\np\n<0.05 was found and indicated by an asterisk,\np\n<0.01 is assigned two asterisks, and\np\n<0.001 is assigned thee asterisks."

    "Methods": "Patient demographics and management\nSFGH is the only Level 1 trauma center in San Francisco and the northern San Francisco peninsula. The hospital provides care for a high volume of patients with neurotrauma and polytrauma. Patients with SCIs were admitted to the neurosurgical ICU, and a MAP of at least 85\u2009mmHg was targeted for 5 days after the injury, similar to published guidelines\n12\nand the protocol of Wolf and colleagues.\n16\nPharmacological agents were administered if needed to achieve this goal.\n20\nIn 26.8% of patients, the first pressor started was phenylephrine. In 48.5%, the first pressor used was dopamine. In 3.1%, dopamine and phenylephrine were started concurrently. In 1.0%, levophed was the first used vasopressor. In 23% of patients, a second vasopressor was needed to meet the MAP targets. A detailed study of vasopressor use in an overlapping subset of SCI patients from San Francisco General Hospital has been published recently.\n20\nPatients were identified retrospectively for this analysis. Demographic data were collected from the patients' health records as shown in\nTable 1\n. American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grades were computed based on detailed neurological examinations performed on presentation but after resuscitation, and just before discharge.\n21\nThe AIS grade improvement was calculated.

The same system was used to collect physiological data in nonhuman experimentation as described previously by our group.\n22\nVariables displayed on the bedside monitor were collected at 1\u2009minute intervals, and for this work, MAP values as measured with an arterial line were analyzed. The duration of arterial line blood pressure monitoring was based solely on medical necessity as judged by the treating intensivist.\nData were recorded continuously and automatically from every bedside monitor in the neurosurgical ICU between 2005 and 2011 and stored on a server in a fashion adherent to patient privacy regulations. Data acquisition with this system initiates automatically as soon as patient data appear on the bedside monitor. The time of the first recorded observation in the collection system was denoted as time \u201c1\u201d. Note that this is distinct from the time of injury or the first arterial line MAP measurement.\n\nData analysis\nMAP values were analyzed with the assistance of Matlab. We designed a program to extract MAP values for each patient stored in individual Excel files. It calculated average MAP values between periods specified by the analyst. It was also programmed to count the number of epochs with MAP values below specified thresholds between specified periods. We selected to analyze blood pressures below 80 different thresholds from 120 to 40\u2009mm Hg (1\u2009mmHg increments). The Matlab program was checked for errors by comparing results with those generated using Microsoft Excel. The proportion of values below thresholds was analyzed to account for different numbers of observations between patients. Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint were used to graph the data and Photoshop CS2 was used to combine images for figures. Error bars represent standard error of the mean in all cases.\n\nStatistical analysis\nSPSS v21 software was used for statistical analyses. Analysis of variance was used as a first step in the analysis of average values from continuous data; if a difference between groups was demonstrated, the Tukey and Bonferroni\npost hoc\ntests were performed that adjust for multiple comparisons. Binomial logistic regression was used to analyze dichotomous categorical data. For average values of continuous data, the \u201cn\u201d was considered to be the total number of observations. Where proportions were analyzed, a single proportion was calculated for each patient, and the \u201cn\u201d was thus the number of patients in each group."

    "Methods": "This study was approved by the institutional review boards of the participating hospitals.\n\nStudy sample\nParticipants were adolescents with mTBI (\nn\n=50) and healthy adolescents (\nn\n=50). For the cohort of adolescents with mTBI, we identified eligible participants from a hospital trauma registry in the northwest United States. This registry is composed of patients who were admitted to the area's Level I trauma hospital after sustaining trauma to any anatomical region. The inclusion criteria for the cohort of adolescents with mTBI were: 1) ages 12 to 18 years old; 2) sustained mTBI in the preceding three to 12 months; 3) able to understand and speak English proficiently; 4) able to mobilize independently; and 5) no serious co-morbid health condition (e.g., cancer, diabetes) or documented developmental delay. Mild TBI was defined as any period of transient confusion, disorientation, impaired consciousness, or amnesia lasting less than 24\u2009h, or signs of other neurological or neuropsychological dysfunction, with the worse Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13\u201315 in the 24\u2009h post-injury or at hospital discharge if discharged prior to 24 hours from admission,\n19\nabstracted from the hospital trauma registry records. Adolescents with moderate and severe TBI were excluded from this study as the recovery course was more likely to be complicated by neurocognitive problems. The cohort of healthy adolescents was recruited from the community through flyers and word of mouth. Inclusion criteria were: 1) ages 12 to 18 years old; 2) able to understand and speak English proficiently; 3) able to mobilize independently; and 4) absence of a serious co-morbid health condition (e.g., cancer, diabetes) or documented developmental delay. Adolescents were excluded if there was a previous history of head injury.\nFor the cohort of adolescents with mTBI, letters of invitation with a brief study description were mailed to the potential participant's family residence. The adolescents and families were subsequently contacted via telephone by study staff for further study description and screened for eligibility. Adolescents were enrolled in the study after obtaining written consent from the parent/caregiver and written assent from the adolescent. Recruitment and enrollment occurred between September 2011 and December 2012. A total of 200 eligible participants were sent letters of invitation. Of the 200 eligible participants, 88 did not respond to the mailing or telephone contact for unknown reasons, 44 declined participation due to lack of interest or time constraints, and six were not eligible after initial screening due to decreased proficiency in English. Two were excluded as they were classified as moderate TBI. Participants and non-participants did not differ by sex or age. Post-enrollment, a total of 10 adolescents dropped out, of which five did not return study equipment, and five did not complete the study due to time constraints. The total analyzed cohort included 50 adolescents with complete study data. For the cohort of healthy adolescents, 32 adolescents were part of a larger study examining sleep\u2013wake disturbances.\n20\nAn additional 18 healthy adolescents were recruited between June 2012 and December 2012, for a total sample size of 50 in the healthy cohort. There were four adolescents who did not meet eligibility criteria due to a previous history of head injury and thus were not included in the study.\n\nProcedures\nFollowing enrollment, study materials (written instructions, questionnaire measures, Actiwatch, electronic sleep diary) were mailed to the participants' homes. Study staff then contacted families to instruct parents and adolescents to independently complete questionnaires, and for the adolescent to wear the Actiwatch and complete the electronic sleep diary twice daily for 10 days. This phone call provided an opportunity to answer any questions. Upon completion of the questionnaires and 10-day sleep assessment, families returned all study materials via mail. Families were reimbursed with gift cards to local stores.\n\nDemographics\nInformation regarding demographics (age, sex, race, ethnicity, and socio-economic status) was provided by the parents.\n\nDepressive symptoms\nThe Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) is a 20-item questionnaire that assesses symptoms of depression over the past week.\n21\nThe total score was used in analyses, with higher scores indicating greater depressive symptomatology. The CES-D is one of the most widely used screening tools for depression and has demonstrated adequate reliability and validity in adolescents.\n21\u201323\nConsistent with prior research, a CES-D score of 16 or higher was used to indicate the presence of depressive illness.\n24\nInternal reliability for the present study was good (Cronbach's \u03b1=0.81).\n\nPain\nAdolescents rated their usual pain intensity over the past three months using the 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), with anchors of 0 (\u201cno pain\u201d) to 10 (\u201cworst pain possible\u201d). The NRS is a widely accepted and well validated tool, and has demonstrated good reliability and validity in adolescent populations.\n25\nFrequency of pain was measured on a 6-point Likert scale from \u201cless than once a month\u201d to \u201cdaily.\u201d The location(s) of pain was assessed using a body outline. Adequate validity of these pain dimensions in clinical and community samples of adolescents has been demonstrated.\n26\n\nSleep quality\nAdolescents completed the Adolescent Sleep Wake Scale (ASWS), a 28-item measure that assesses the quality of sleep along five subscales over the past month: going to bed, falling asleep, maintaining sleep, reinitiating sleep, and return to wakefulness.\n27\nA total score is calculated from the mean of all items, with higher scores indicating better sleep quality. This scale has been shown to have adequate reliability and validity.\n27\nInternal reliability for the present study was excellent (Cronbachs \u03b1=0.90).\n\nPre-sleep arousal\nAdolescents completed the Pre-Sleep Arousal (PSA)\n28\nquestionnaire, which is a 16-item measure that assesses cognitive and somatic symptoms associated with sleep onset.\n28\nA slightly modified version for adolescent samples was used in the present study.\n20\n,\n29\nExamples of cognitive arousal symptoms include racing thoughts, worry and anxiety at bedtime; somatic arousal symptoms are tense muscles and racing heart prior to falling asleep. A total score is calculated, with subscales for cognitive PSA and somatic PSA. This scale has shown good reliability and validity in adolescents.\n30\nInternal consistency in the present study was good (Cronbach's \u03b1=0.88).\n\nActigraphy sleep assessment\nSleep patterns were assessed using the Actiwatch 64 (Phillips Respironics/MiniMitter Company Inc., Bend, OR), a watch-like device that estimates sleep\u2013wake patterns via activity monitoring. Participants were instructed to wear the Actiwatch on their non-dominant wrist for 10 d continuously. In addition, participants were instructed to maintain a corresponding 10 d electronic sleep diary, which was used to assist with actigraphy scoring. Following the 10 d assessment period, data were abstracted and scored by trained research staff using the Actiware Sleep version 5.5.\n31\nThe scoring algorithm is based on the amplitude and frequency of detected movements, using the one-minute epoch and medium sensitivity/wake threshold. The actigraphic variables used in analyses were sleep duration, wake time after sleep onset (WASO) and sleep efficiency. Sleep duration is the total number of minutes from sleep onset to sleep offset. WASO is the number of minutes that the adolescents were awake from sleep onset to offset. Sleep efficiency is the ratio of sleep duration and the total time spend in bed reported as a percentage. Actigraphy sleep variables were averaged over the participants' total assessment period. On average, adolescents with mTBI had 9.5 valid nights of actigraphy data and healthy adolescents had 9.3 valid nights of data available for analysis. Studies suggest that actigraphy provides a reasonably good estimate of sleep\u2013wake patterns, compared with polysomnography in healthy adolescents.\n32\n,\n33\n\nData analysis\nGroup differences between youth with mTBI and healthy youth were computed on demographic (age, sex, race, ethnicity, family income) and predictor variables (pain intensity, depressive symptoms) using chi-square tests for categorical variables and\nt\ntests for continuous variables. To address the first aim, independent samples\nt\ntests were used to examine between group differences on subjective sleep measures (sleep quality and PSA) and actigraphic sleep variables (sleep duration, WASO, and sleep efficiency). To evaluate our second aim, we constructed two separate multivariate regression models evaluating the contribution of demographic and clinical factors to subjective (sleep quality) and objective sleep disturbances (SE). Predictors that were included in all models were age, sex, pain intensity, depressive symptoms, and group (mTBI vs. healthy). All analyses were conducted using Statistical Package for Social Science version 19.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY)."

    "Methods": "Trial design and participants\nThe STITCH(Trauma) protocol has been published.\n15\nThis was an international, multicenter, prospective, patient-randomized, parallel-group pragmatic trial comparing early surgical evacuation of TICH with initial conservative treatment (ISRCTN 19321911, UK NIHR-HTA grant no.: 07/37/16). Ethical committee favorable opinion was obtained from the Southampton Multicenter Research Ethics Committee (REF: 09/H0502/68, June 15, 2009). Local ethical approval was obtained for each participating center. The trial was conducted according to Medical Research Council good clinical practice guidelines. Formal agreements were in place between the sponsor (Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Hospitals Foundation Trust), the holder of the study funding (Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK), and each participating hospital before commencing the study at each site.\nOnly TICH patients for whom the treating neurosurgeon was in equipoise about the benefits of early surgical evacuation, compared with initial conservative treatment, were eligible for the trial. Patients considered for the trial had had a computed tomography (CT) scan to confirm the diagnosis and size as well as location of the hematoma. Clotting or coagulation problems were corrected before randomization as per local standard clinical practice. Patients were included if they were adults within 48\u2009h of TBI and had evidence of a TICH on CT with a confluent volume of attenuation significantly raised above that of the background white and gray matter greater than 10\u2009mL calculated by: (length\u00d7width\u00d7height)/2 in cm.\n16\n(Initially, the time criterion was within 24\u2009h of TBI, but subsequent to an investigators' meeting this was increased to allow time for patients to reach neurosurgery and for the TICH to develop.)\nExclusion criteria were: a significant surface hematoma (EDH or SDH) requiring surgery; three or more separate hematomas fulfilling the inclusion criteria; a cerebellar hemorrhage/contusion; surgery could not be performed within 12\u2009h of randomization; severe pre-existing physical or mental disability or comorbidity that would lead to a poor outcome even if the patient made a full recovery from the TBI; permanent residence outside a study country preventing follow-up; and if the patient and/or relative expressed a strong preference for one treatment modality.\nWritten witnessed informed consent of the patients or their relatives was obtained by neurosurgical staff before randomization.\nIn total, 59 neurosurgical units in 20 countries completed all regulatory requirements and registered with the trial.\n\nInterventions\nThe two trial interventions were early surgery or initial conservative treatment. Early surgery was early evacuation of the hematoma by a method of the surgeon's choice (within 12\u2009h of randomization), combined with appropriate best medical treatment. Initial conservative treatment was best medical treatment combined with delayed (more than 12\u2009h after randomisation) evacuation if it became appropriate later. Both groups were monitored according to local standard neurosurgical practice.\nBest medical treatment could include (depending on the practices within the center) monitoring of ICP or other modalities and management of metabolism, sodium osmotic pressure, temperature, and blood gasses.\nAll patients had a CT scan at 5 days (\u00b12 days) after randomization to assess changes in hematoma size with and without surgery.\nInformation was collected about the status (Glasgow Coma Score [GCS] and focal signs) of patients through the first 5 days of their trial progress as well as ICP/CPP (cerebral perfusion pressure) measures (in invasively monitored patients), to describe any change in status that led to a change in equipoise for the treating neurosurgeon, and subsequent surgery in patients initially randomized to conservative treatment. At 2 weeks after randomization or at discharge or death (whichever occurred first), a discharge/2-week form was completed by the responsible neurosurgeon or research nurse. This form recorded the patient's status at that time, the mechanism of injury, whether and when they had surgery (including why, if randomized to initial conservative treatment, or why not, if randomized to early surgery), the GCS and localizing features for the 5 days after randomisation, the occurrence of any adverse events (AEs) after randomization (including death, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and surgical site infection), and past medical history.\nBefore assessing outcome each patient's GP (in the UK) or consultant (outside the UK) was contacted to check that the patient was alive, confirm the patient's place of residence, and complete a major AEs form.\n\nRandomization and masking\nTo minimise biases resulting from lack of concealment of allocation, randomization was undertaken centrally by an independent 24-h telephone and Web randomization service based in Aberdeen University (Aberdeen, UK). Allocation was stratified by geographical region, with a minimization algorithm based on age group, and severity (as measured by whether or not the pupils were equal and reacting), with a random component (i.e., with probability of 80%).\nThroughout the study, data broken down by treatment assignment were never provided to individual investigators or to the study team. Outcome was assessed by questionnaires to patients. If it was necessary to administer these questionnaires in person, then the interviewer was blind to treatment allocation. Outcome assignment, data cleaning, and CT assessment were all made before unblinding the treatment assignment.\n\nOutcomes\nOutcome was assessed at 6 months by a postal questionnaire translated into the appropriate languages and mailed to patients or their relatives/carers. In those centers where the postal systems were problematic, or there were literacy or language problems, questionnaires could be completed by a social worker or research nurse, who did not know the treatment allocation, in interview with the patient or relative.\nPrimary outcome was based on the 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) dichotomized into favorable and unfavorable outcome; dead, vegetative, and severe disability were coded as unfavorable and moderate disability and good recovery as favorable. Secondary outcomes were mortality, time to death, extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE), Rankin, and European Quality of Life Five Dimension Scale (EQ-5D) at 6 months. Crossover and major event rates (death, pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, infection, and rehemorrhage) in each treatment group were also reported.\n\nStatistical analysis\nPrevious observational studies have suggested a favorable outcome in the nonoperated group of approximately 40% and a favorable outcome in the surgical group of approximately 60\u201370%. Target sample size was 840 (420 in each arm). This was calculated assuming a more conservative favorable outcome (good recovery or moderate disability on the GOS) of 50% from conservative treatment, 10% benefit (i.e., 50% vs. 60%) from surgery, 5% significance with 80% power, and a safety margin built in to allow for loss to follow-up, making the total target sample size 840 patients (420 randomized to each treatment arm).\nThe independent data monitoring committee (DMC) reviewed data from the study after 50, 100, and 150 patients had been recruited. These interim reviews were confidential to only the data manager and the DMC. The trial was only to be stopped early by the DMC if one or other treatment policy showed an advantage at a very high significance level, or if recruitment rates were unexpectedly low. The DMC recommended, at each review, that the trial should continue. However, in February 2012, the funding agency decided to halt this international study with effect from the end of September 2012 for \u201cfailure to recruit in the UK.\u201d At this time, 6 patients had been recruited from the UK, despite our actively encouraging UK center participation throughout the trial. In total, 10 of the possible 36 UK centers expressed written interest in the study, but only seven completed all regulatory requirements to join the trial. Considerable effort was expended in trying continuously to recruit UK centers and raise the profile of the study\u2014the study team had a high profile at the national neurosurgical meetings and national neurosurgical research meetings giving presentations about progress on the study and manning a stand where investigators could discuss the study with the team. Monthly e-mail newsletters were sent to neurosurgical departments and paper copies were posted quarterly. Talks were given in individual centers to encourage recruitment. Help with all regulatory submissions was also provided. Despite these considerable efforts, only 6 patients could be recruited in the UK.\nAnalysis was on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. The analysis plan was adapted, following the decision from the funding agency to halt the trial early, agreed by the trial steering committee and published on the study website before unblinding the data. The primary analysis was a simple categorical frequency comparison using the uncorrected chi-squared test for favorable and unfavorable outcomes at 6 months.\n17\n,\n18\nA sensitivity analysis using logistic regression was undertaken to adjust for age, volume of hematoma, and GCS.\nSecondary outcome analyses included proportional odds model analysis of GOS, GOSE, and Rankin at 6 months, Kaplan-Meier's survival curve with log-rank test, and mortality. For dichotomized outcomes, absolute differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported.\nMinimal subgroup analysis was undertaken and regarded as exploratory. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were reported for the following subgroups: age (two bands using randomization strata: <50, 50, or more\u2014given that there were very few patients over 70 years of age, the two upper age bands were combined); volume of hematoma (using median split <=23 and >23\u2009mL); GCS (using standard classification of TBI severe, moderate, or minor: 3\u20138, 9\u201312, or 13\u201315); time from ictus to randomization (using median split <21 and >=21\u2009h); and geographical region (four bands: Europe, India, China, and other). Interaction tests (chi-squared test for heterogeneity) were undertaken and relevant\np\nvalues reported.\n\nCosting analysis\nThe costing analysis was undertaken on the ITT basis from an international health services perspective. Resource-use requirements to deliver the interventions (e.g., staff time and overheads) and time spent on hospital wards were collected using site-specific questionnaires and case report forms. Hospital readmissions were reported on participant outcome questionnaires. Costing followed recommended procedures for international studies,\n19\n,\n20\napplying country-specific unit costs (sourced from site-specific questionnaires) to resource-use data to generate total costs. Costs were transformed into 2013 international dollars\n21\nand reported as mean (standard deviation; SD) for each treatment group.\nA generalized linear regression model (GLM), specifying a gamma family and identity link, was used to estimate the impact of treatment allocation on costs accounting for skewed data and adjusting for patient characteristics (age and sex). Sensitivity analyses explored the use of alternative models for analyzing costs. Subgroup analysis presented raw mean costs according to World Bank classifications,\n22\nbased on gross national income (GNI) as follows: low income (GNI <=$1,005, e.g., Nepal); lower middle income (GNI $1,006\u2013$3,975, e.g., India); upper middle income (GNI $3,976\u2013$12,275, e.g., China); and high income (GNI >=f $12,276, e.g., western Europe and United States). Owing to small sample sizes, regression analyses were not undertaken.\n\nRole of the funding source\nNeither the sponsor nor the funder of the study had any role in study design, data gathering, analysis and interpretation, or writing the report. The corresponding author, E.N.R., and R.F. had full access to all the data in the study, and all members of the writing committee had responsibility for the decision to submit."

    "Methods": "Study population\nThis institutional review board\u2013approved, retrospective cohort study included adult TBI survivors. The eligible study population included those who experienced a TBI as evidenced by intracranial hemorrhage on head computed tomography (CT) and were admitted to a single Level I trauma center from July 2010 through May 2012. All patients who survived to discharge were offered a three-month, no-charge appointment at the multidisciplinary TBI clinic. Exclusion criteria were individuals younger than 18 years old at time of hospital admission, non\u2013English speaking individuals, vulnerable populations (such as prisoners or pregnant women), those not entered into the Trauma Registry of the American College of Surgeons (e.g., readmissions), and those who were unable to be contacted by telephone.\nWe defined non-contact by telephone as no working phone number or four failed attempts at contact across the following time frames: early morning (6\na.m.\nto 8\na.m.\n), morning (8\na.m.\nto noon), afternoon (1\np.m.\nto 5\np.m.\n), or evening (6\np.m.\nto 8\np.m.\n). Multiple time frames were used in order to obviate the conflict of work or personal responsibilities as the cause of non-contact.\n\nProcedures\nAll participants were administered a telephone survey incorporating a measure of orientation, the Extended-Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE), the Quality of Life after Brain Injury (QOLIBRI) scale, and a questionnaire covering demographic information and receipt of post-discharge rehabilitation. The telephone survey was completed either by the individual with TBI, a surrogate (relative, friend, or caregiver), or both.\nThe Extended-Glasgow Outcome Scale is a 19-item functional status questionnaire that yields a score ranging from 1 (deceased) to 8 (upper good recovery). The GOSE has been repeatedly validated as an informative and accurate assessment tool in TBI.\n3\n,\n4\nThe QOLIBRI scale is a 37-item questionnaire with six subscales that measure quality of life in the domains of cognition, self, daily life and autonomy, social relationships, emotions, and physical problems. This tool has been internationally validated in the TBI population.\n5\n,\n6\nFrom the trauma registry, we extracted patients' mechanism of injury (blunt, penetrating), admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, Injury Severity Score (ISS), and demographic data, including age, sex, race, and insurance status. Although GCS score can be treated as a continuous variable, in order to avoid model overfitting, to address non-normal distribution, and to use common clinical categorization, GCS score was categorized into mild (13\u201315), moderate (9\u201312), and severe (3\u20138) levels of injuries.\n4\n,\n7\nISS is defined as the additive square value of the three highest (i.e., most severe) Abbreviated Injury Scores; ISS reflects trauma severity and ranges from 1 to 75, with 75 indicating the most severe injury.\n8\nWe classified insurance status into the following four categories: private (PPO, HMO, and auto), public (Medicaid, Medicare, TennCare, and military), workers' compensation, and no insurance.\nTo identify factors that predicted clinic attendance, we created a multivariable logistic regression model employing covariates of age, sex, insurance status, and baseline injury characteristics (mechanism of injury, ISS, and admission GCS score). To determine risk factors for long-term functional and quality of life outcomes, as measured by GOSE and QOLIBRI at the time of phone follow-up, we developed multivariable regression models employing covariates of age, sex, insurance status, baseline injury characteristics (injury mechanism, GCS score, and ISS), clinic attendance, post-discharge rehabilitation, and time from injury to completion of telephone survey. All data was maintained using REDCap, a secure database hosted at Vanderbilt University.\n9"

    "Methods": "Institution research board approval\nApprovals for the study, including the consent form and patient information sheet, were obtained from the St. George's Joint Research Office and the National Research Ethics Service London\u2014Camberwell St Giles Committee (No. 10/H0807/23).\n\nPatient recruitment and follow-up\nWe recruited patients ages 18 to 70 years old with severe TSCI (American Spinal Injury Association [ASIA] A-C). Exclusion criteria were: 1) patients who could not consent or had other major injuries or co-morbidities; 2) time from injury to surgery more than 72 h; and 3) penetrating spinal cord injury. For the duration of the study (i.e., up to a week), patients were nursed in the NICU and were turned regularly to prevent pressure sores. Neurological examination was conducted by a neurosurgery resident in accordance with the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury\n13\npre-operatively, at the time of transfer to a rehabilitation facility (at about three to four weeks), and at six months in the outpatient clinic.\n\nSurgical technique\nAll patients had a posterior approach to realign and stabilize the spine. Spinal stabilization involved lateral mass screws for cervical injuries and pedicle screws for thoracic injuries. The first 11 patients had laminectomy without opening the dura (termed the laminectomy group). The extent of laminectomy was based on the extent of cord edema seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Four patients in the laminectomy group also had anterior cervical fixation and fusion. The last 10 patients (termed the laminectomy+duroplasty group) had laminectomy, followed by incising the posterior aspect of the dura longitudinally in the midline under a microscope. The length of the laminectomy and dural incision was estimated from the length of the swollen spinal cord edema on the pre-operative MRI. No patients in the laminectomy+duroplasty group had anterior cervical fixation and fusion. After opening the dura in the laminectomy+duroplasty group, we could see the ISP probe. In each of the 10 patients, the ISP probe was in the subdural space, thus confirming that our insertion technique was safe and did not result in intraparenchymal placement of the ISP probe. We then sutured an elliptical patch of artificial dura (Durepair\n\u00ae\n; Medtronic, Hertfordshire, UK) to the dural edges to expand the intradural space. The duroplasty was supplemented with fibrin glue (Tisseel\n\u00ae\n; Baxter, Newbury, Berkshire, UK). The surgical procedure is summarized in\nFigure 1A\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nDuroplasty technique and computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n(A)\nLeft: Exposed dura after laminectomy. Middle: Durotomy held open with forceps showing injured spinal cord and intraspinal pressure (ISP) probe.

Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\n\nMRI scan analysis\nMRI scans (1.5T; Philips Integra, Guildford, Surrey, UK) were obtained pre-operatively (\nFig. 1B\n), at two to three weeks post-operatively (\nFig. 1C\n), and at six to eight months post-operatively. The mid-sagittal anteroposterior (AP) diameter of the most compressed part of the dura was measured (D\ni\n) on the T2 images. The percent increase in D\ni\n(post-operative compared with pre-operative) was computed as [2\u00d7(D\ni(postop)\n\u2013D\ni(preop)\n)/(D\na\n+D\nb\n)]\u00d7100, where D\na\nand D\nb\nare the AP diameters of the mid-vertebral dura above and below the level of injury, respectively. In all patients, we examined the post-operative mid-sagittal T2-weighted MRI for the presence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) anterior and posterior to the injured spinal cord. In the laminectomy+duroplasty group, we examined the post-operative mid-sagittal T2-weighted MRIs for spinal cord expansion into the extra space created by the duroplasty. We also looked for the presence of pseudomeningocele in all post-operative scans.\n\nISP and arterial blood pressure (ABP) monitoring\nThe ISP probe was inserted in the operating theater. We first reduced and fixed the spinal fracture, inserted metalwork to stabilize the spine and performed laminectomies. At the end of this procedure, before closing the wound, a 14-gauge introducer was used to tunnel the ISP probe (Codman Microsensor Transducer, Depuy Synthes, UK and Ireland) through the skin into the wound. We used a 21-gauge needle bent at 90\u00b0 to perforate the posterior aspect of the dura and arachnoid one level below the injury. The 90\u00b0 bent prevents cord damage when perforating the dura. The dural perforation was widened with a blunt hook. Some CSF leaked through the dural hole, allowing the arachnoid to collapse onto the surface of the cord, thus enlarging the subdual space. To monitor ISP, the Codman probe was calibrated and advanced subdurally, under an operating microscope, through the dural hole until the probe tip was at the site of maximal spinal cord swelling according to the MRI scan. The ISP probe was secured to the skin with silk sutures and a tightening stitch around the exit site to prevent CSF leak. We monitored ABP from a radial artery with the catheter kept at the same level as the ISP probe. Videos showing the ISP probe insertion technique are shown in our earlier publication.\n8\nThe probe was connected to a Codman ICP Express monitor, in turn connected to a PowerLab data acquisition device via a ML 221 amplifier running LabChart v7.3.3 (ADInstruments, Oxford, UK). The arterial blood pressure output was taken from the bedside patient monitoring system (Philips Intellivue MX800; Philips, Guildford, Surrey, UK) and connected to the PowerLab. ISP and ABP were recorded at 100\u2009Hz using LabChart for up to a week. Satisfactory probe position was confirmed with a post-operative CT scan within 24\u2009h of insertion (\nFig. 1C\n).\n\nSCPP and sPRx\nWe calculated the SCPP signal, defined as MAP minus ISP. sPRx, a measure of spinal cord pressure reactivity, is the running correlation coefficient between ISP and MAP calculated over a 5-min period.\n8\nIf sPRx\u22640, spinal cord pressure reactivity is intact, but if sPRx>0, spinal cord pressure reactivity is impaired. The spinal cord indices ISP, SCPP and sPRx are analogous to the brain indices ICP, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and pressure reactivity index (PRx), respectively.\n14\n\nPatient position\nPatient position (supine or lateral) was recorded hourly on the nursing chart throughout the monitoring period and was analyzed retrospectively. In the supine position, the patient was lying directly on the wound with a pillow under the head and neck. In the lateral position, the patient was lying at about a 30\u00b0 to 45\u00b0 angle on the left or right, with two supporting pillows positioned away from the wound. For the laminectomy+duroplasty patients, we averaged the ISP for the lateral versus supine positions over each 24-h period.\n\nOutcome measures\nTo determine whether laminectomy+duroplasty produces long-term neurological deterioration, we compared the ASIA grade, the Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury (WISCI II),\n15\nand bladder and bowel Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM III)\n16\nof the laminectomy versus the laminectomy+duroplasty groups.\n\nStatistical analysis\nPrimary outcomes are MRI-based (increase in intradural space, CSF around the injured cord) and physiological (ISP, SCPP, sPRx). The study requires six patients in the laminectomy+duroplasty group and six in the laminectomy group to detect the following differences by two-tailed Student's\nt\ntest (\u03b1=0.05; power=0.9): increase in AP dural diameter of 50 versus 10 % with standard deviation (SD)=20; ISP of 20 versus 16\u2009mm Hg with SD=2; SCPP of 80 versus 64\u2009mm Hg with SD=8; and sPRx of 0.2 versus 0.0 with SD=0.1. The study requires seven patients per group to detect CSF around the injured cord in 80 versus 0 % MRI scans by \u03c7\n2\ntest (\u03b1=0.05; power=0.8). Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics (v. 20.0). For ISP, SCPP, increase in intradural space, and sPRx, we compared means of two groups using the two-tailed Student's\nt\ntest. CSF around the injured spinal cord and cumulative frequencies of ISP and SCPP were compared using the \u03c7\n2\ntest. One-sample\nt\ntest was used to test the effect of patient position on ISP."

    "Methods": "Study setting and population\nUsing data from the NTDB for admission years 2009\u20132012, we identified a cohort of pediatric patients hospitalized with severe TBI. The NTDB, maintained by the ACS, is the largest aggregation of US trauma data,\n13\ncontaining more than 5 million patient discharge records from more than 800 trauma centers across the United States.\n14\nPatients were included in the analysis if they were under 18 years of age at admission, were in the intensive care unit (ICU) for a minimum of 2 calendar days, and were treated for a severe TBI. In line with previous work,\n5\n,\n15\nsevere TBI was identified based on: (1) an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score of \u22653 and specific to head trauma (predot code beginning with 1), (2) a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score <9, and (3) a TBI-specific\nInternational Classification of Diseases\n(ICD-9 code on their discharge abstract (800.0\u2013801.9, 803.0\u2013804.9, 850.0\u2013854.1, 950.1\u2013950.3, 959.01, or 995.55). We restricted our cohort to patients treated in Level I and II hospitals to focus on facilities that provide the majority of care for severe TBI injuries as both direct admissions and transfers from lower level trauma centers. We excluded patients with missing inclusion criteria (\nn\n=3870), mechanism of injury (\nn\n=236), hospital discharge status (i.e., main outcome,\nn\n=38), those patients with penetrating injuries (\nn\n=301), nonsurvivable injuries (AIS=6,\nn\n=241). and those who arrived without vital signs (\nn\n=61).\n\nExposure, outcome and confounders\nWe developed a list of pre-specified facility-level characteristics as exposures of interest based on available data from the NTDB, including facility size (<200 beds, 201\u2013400, 401\u2013600, >600), trauma level (pediatric level I, pediatric level II, adult level I, adult level II), teaching status (university, community, nonteaching), nonprofit status (for profit, nonprofit), responsibility for pediatric trauma care (sole provider of care, shared responsibility/no pediatric services), and census region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West, shown in\nFig. 1\n16\n). The outcome of interest was 30-day inhospital mortality (yes/no) identified using hospital discharge status and length of stay.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nUnited States census regions.\n\nStatistical analysis\nTo control for confounding because of differences in patient populations between facilities, patient-level characteristics were included in a \u201cbaseline\u201d model of pediatric severe TBI mortality risk. This baseline model was constructed using a previously validated mortality risk-adjusted model for the adult NTDB population.\n17\nThis model, a parsimonious predictive set of variables among severely injured patients in the NTDB, was developed to identify and standardize the minimum set of covariates researchers should adjust for when performing a risk-adjustment analysis of mortality as an outcome in subsets of trauma populations. Variables not included in this minimum set may be associated with trauma mortality, but adding such variables to a model that includes the minimum set may not improve the model's ability to predict mortality. Because the validated model was developed for an adult population, we chose to expand the minimum set of variables and include other important predictors of mortality identified in the pediatric TBI literature. The definition of each covariate in our baseline model was modified for use in a pediatric population. As such, the baseline model included age, race, insurance source, transfer status, hypotension on arrival (based on American Heart Association guidelines for pediatric age groups\n18\n), heart rate on arrival, mechanism of injury, GCS score, injury severity score calculated from AIS (ISSAIS), head AIS score, and requirement for mechanical ventilation. Age and mechanism of injury were included as categorical variables. Transfer status, the presence of inhospital complications, the presence of comorbidities, requirement for mechanical ventilation, and hypotension were included as binary variables. Heart rate on arrival, GCS, head AIS, and ISSAIS were included as continuous variables. A full description of variable definitions for the baseline model can be found in\nSupplementary Table 1\n(see online supplementary material at\nftp.liebertpub.com\n).\nWe used Poisson regression with clustered sandwich estimators of variance to calculate risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for 30-day inhospital mortality. Clustering by facility was used to account for correlation between patients seen at the same hospital. To determine independent associations between our exposures of interest and inhospital mortality, we added the facility-level characteristics of interest to our baseline model individually and as a group. All analyses were conducted using Stata statistical software version 12 (Statacorp LP: College Station, TX).\n19\nThis study did not require Institutional Review Board approval by the University of Washington Human Subjects Division, because the previously collected de-identified data used for this investigation do not meet the federal regulatory definition of human subjects research."

Animals were placed on a heating pad to maintain normal body temperature throughout surgery. Animals were placed on a stereotaxic frame and the head was secured with ear bars. Burr hole and hub were prepared in the lateral skull at the junction of the sagittal, bregma, and lambda sutures. A 4.8\u2009mm craniectomy was performed with a trephine over the right parietal cortex, midway between bregma and lambda, tangential to the sagittal suture. A rigid plastic injury tube (modified female Luer-lock 20G needle hub) was attached to the skull with cyanoacrylate adhesive over the open craniectomy with the intact dura, and a stabilizing screw was placed in a burr hole drilled rostral to bregma on the ipsilateral side. The injury tube and stabilizing screw were secured with dental acrylic. Then the scalp was sutured, and the animal was returned to a warmed recovery cage. All surgical procedures were performed using an aseptic technique.\n27\n\nTBI induction\nThe TBI-inducing device consisted of a Plexiglas cylinder (60\u2009cm in length and 4.5\u2009cm in diameter) filled with sterile water. A piston was mounted on O-rings at one end and an extracranial pressure transducer, EPN-0300A (Entran Devices Inc., Fairfield, NJ) connected to a storage oscilloscope, TDS 310 (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR), was attached to the opposite end. A 5\u2009mm tube (internal diameter 2.6\u2009mm) ending in a male Luer-lock was fitted at the end. TBI was induced by rapidly injecting a small volume of sterile saline into the closed cranial cavity over the right ipsilateral hemisphere with the fluid percussion device. Immediately thereafter, the animal was removed from the device, monitored for duration of apnea and unconsciousness, and re-sutured while receiving supplemental oxygen ventilation. The magnitude of the pressure pulse was measured by a pressure transducer, stored on an oscilloscope, and later converted to atmospheres. The pressure pulse was monitored and controlled in order to deliver an equivalent impact to each animal. Carprofen (5\u2009mg/kg) and prophylactic antibiotic enrofloxacin (1\u2009mg/kg) were intraperitoneally injected in each animal twice per day.\n\nPhysiological parameter monitoring\nTwo femoral arteries were cannulated; the left artery to monitor mean arterial pressure (MAP) with a blood pressure analyzer (Digi-Med BPA blood pressure analyzer\n\u2122\n, MicroMed Inc., Louisville, KY), and the right artery to withdraw blood. The left femoral vein was also cannulated to infuse lactated Ringer's solution for fluid resuscitation. Animals were placed onto a stereotaxic frame including an incisor bar. The head was secured with ear bars, and body temperature was maintained via heat blanket (Animal Heating Pad, Davol Inc., Warwick, RI). After opening the scalp suture, ICP and pbtO\n2\nwere measured by a Camino ICP monitoring probe (Integra NeuroScience, Plainsboro, NJ) and Licox oxygen catheter microprobe (Integra Neuroscience, Plainsboro, NJ), respectively. CPP was calculated by subtracting ICP values from MAP (CPP=MAP-ICP). Physiological parameters were monitored for 2\u2009h, and animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (1\u223c2%) during the entire procedure.\n\nMRI\nMR images were acquired with a 9.4T MR imaging system (Bruker BioSpin Corp., Billerica, MA) with a surface coil as receiver. The rat was placed in an animal bed equipped with circulating warm water to regulate body temperature, and was anesthetized using isoflurane (2\u20132.5%) during imaging. Anatomic imaging was acquired with a T2-weighted turbo spin-echo sequence (rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement [RARE]). The detail parameters were as follows: repetition time (TR)=3000\u2009ms; echo time (TE)=34\u2009ms; RARE factor=4; field of view (FOV)=30\u00d730\u2009mm; matrix size=128\u00d7128; 30 slices with 1\u2009mm thickness. DTI was performed using a modified Stejskal and Tanner spin-echo diffusion-weighted sequence with the following parameters: TR=3001\u2009ms; TE=32\u2009ms; matrix size=128\u00d7128; FOV=30\u00d730\u2009mm; six slices with 1\u2009mm thickness. Image with b=0\u2009sec/mm\n2\nwas acquired first, and then diffusion sensitizing gradients were applied along six directions as follows: [G\nx\n, G\ny\n, G\nz\n]=[1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1], [-1, 1, 0], [0, \u22121, 1], and [1, 0, \u22121] with b=800\u2009sec/mm\n2\n. The diffusion tensor was represented by a 3\u00d73 matrix with three eigenvalues\n\u03bb\n1\n,\n\u03bb\n2\n, and\n\u03bb\n3\n. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was calculated by\nand FA was calculated by\nOn the ADC map, the edema region was determined as the area in the ipsilateral side having ADC values larger than the mean plus two standard deviations of ADC values on the contralateral side. The white matter was determined on FA maps as the region presenting higher FA values than the surrounding tissue. The relative FA value was calculated as the ratio of mean FA value in the region of white matter on the ipsilateral side to that on the contralateral side in each image slice, and the relative FA values of all six slices were averaged. ADC and FA values were calculated using computer software written with MATLAB (7.11.0, MathWorks, Inc.), and the region of interest (ROI) was segmented using conventional software, ImageJ, version 1.44p (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).\n\nPET/CT Imaging\nPET/CT imaging was conducted using Triumph, a PET/CT dual-modality imaging system (GE, Northridge, CA) right after completing MR imaging. Radiographic CT imaging was performed together with PET imaging to identify the injured area.\n18\nF-FDG (65\u00b11\u2009MBq) in 300\u2009\u03bcL phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was administered intravenously, and a 10\u2009min scan was performed at 43\u00b12\u2009min after injection. Animals were under isoflurane anesthesia (2\u223c2.5%) during dosing and imaging. The temperature of the animal bed in the Triumph scanner was maintained at 37\u00b0C during imaging. PET images were reconstructed with the maximum likelihood expectation maximization algorithm (10 iterations) in high-resolution mode. The axial FOV of PET images was set to 37.5\u2009mm, and the axial spatial resolution and sensitivity at the center of FOV were 2.2\u2009mm and 5.9%, respectively.\n28\nOn CT imaging, the X-ray tube voltage and anode current were set to 75\u2009kVp and 0.11\u2009mA, respectively, and the axial FOV was 78.9\u2009mm. A total of 256 projections were acquired in fly gantry motion mode for 1.07\u2009min. The co-registration of PET and CT images was performed using ImageJ version 1.44p (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). In PET images, the SUV was calculated by\nSUV=(C\u00d7W)/D\n, where\nC\nis tissue activity concentration (MBq/mL),\nW\nis animal BW (g), and\nD\nis the administered dose (MBq). The relative SUV was determined by the ratio of mean SUV in the upper half of the brain to that of central region (\u223c 10\u2009mm\n2\n) per each slice showing a skull opening, and the relative SUVs of four images (slice thickness: 1.175\u2009mm) were averaged. The upper half of the brain region was manually determined based on the rat brain anatomy in CT images, whereas the central region was determined using shell analysis technique introduced in our previous study.\n29\nThe segmentation of central brain region and SUV quantification were implemented using computer software written with Labview 2010 (National Instruments Co., Austin, TX). The upper half of the brain region was segmented using conventional software, ImageJ, version 1.44p (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).\n\nStatistical analysis\nOne-way ANOVA was implemented using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) to compare physiological parameters (ICP, CPP, and pbtO\n2\n) among sham, vehicle, and E\n2\n-SO\n4\ntreated groups at each time point.\n30\nOne way ANOVA was also used to compare edema size, relative FA value, and relative SUV among the groups.\nP\nvalues<0.05 were considered significant, while applying Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.\n30\nData are presented as means\u00b1standard error."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll experiments were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, approved all experimental procedures. C57BL6 male mice at postnatal day (PND) 21 and PND24, and weighing 7\u201310\u2009g and 10\u201313\u2009g, respectively, were used for these experiments. All mice were randomly assigned to an impact depth or sham group.\n\nModel of closed-head injury\nMice were anesthetized with 1% avertin (2, 2, 2 tribromethanol and tertiary amyl alcohol Sigma Aldrich,); intraperitoneally (IP), 20\u2009\u03bcL/g, then non-invasively mechanically ventilated (Hugo Sachs Electronik,) using an oral/nasal mask. Core temperature was monitored during surgery using a rectal probe (IT-4 Physitemp,) and maintained at 36.8\u201337.2\u00b0C by surface heating and cooling after impact using a heating pad under the home cage until mice were able to maintain their own body temperature. Mice were subjected to closed-skull traumatic brain injury using a stereotactically-guided electromagnetic compression device, as we described previously.\n9\nIn brief, a midline sagittal scalp incision was made and the periosteum reflected to reveal the appropriate landmarks. Immediately caudal to the bregma at 0\u2009mm, a right lateral closed-skull impact was delivered via an electromagnetic impactor (Leica Microsystems- My Neuro Lab,) using a 3.0-mm steel tip impounder with a controlled velocity (3.0\u00b10.2\u2009m/sec), impact depth (2.0 or 2.25\u2009mm) and dwell time (0.01\u2009sec). Sham mice received the same anesthesia, midline sagittal scalp incision, and steel tip impounder touching the skull, but with no impact.\n\nEvaluation of blood\u2013brain barrier integrity\nThe integrity of the BBB was investigated using Evans Blue (EB) extravasation, as we described previously.\n9\nEB dye (2%, 10\u2009\u03bcL/g, IP Alpha Aesar; Fisher Scientific,) was injected to PND21 and PND24 (impact depth 2.0 and 2.25\u2009mm) and sham mice (\nn\n=6 in each group) at 4\u2009h prior to sacrifice at 6\u2009h, 12\u2009h, 24\u2009h, 48\u2009h, 72\u2009h, and 7\u2009d following impact. Mice were then anesthetized and perfused with saline. Whole brains were placed in tubes and immediately submerged in liquid nitrogen, then stored in a \u221280\u00b0C freezer until processing. Brain samples taken from below the impact site of 0 to \u22123.46\u2009mm bregma (\nFig. 1\n) and just to the right lateral of the sagittal suture were excised, weighed, sonicated in formamide (Sigma Aldrich) and then incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. Samples were centrifuged and the supernatant aliquoted to a 96-well plate. Fluorescence was measured using an excitation of 600\u2009nm and emission 680\u2009nm with Spectramax M5 (Molecular Devices,). Fluorescence was analyzed by using Softmax Pro 5.4 (Analytical Technologies,).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nCoronal brain section of mouse brain illustrating area of the impact (black dot) and region for Western blot and Evans Blue analysis.\n\nMeasurement of water content\nPND21, PND24 (impact depths 2.0 and 2.25\u2009mm), and sham mice (\nn\n=6 in each group) were sacrificed at 24\u2009h, 48\u2009h, 72\u2009h, and 7\u2009d, and wet/dry weights were measured at each time-point.\n9\nMice were sacrificed with CO\n2\nand whole brains were removed, immediately weighed, and then placed at 60\no\nC for 3\u2009d. Dried whole brains were then re-weighed and the ratio of wet/dry was calculated, as we described previously.\n9\n\nWire Hang test\nPND21 and PND24 (impact depths 2.0 and 2.25\u2009mm) and sham mice (\nn\n=6 in each group) were tested for motor strength on Day 7, as we described previously.\n9\nHang times (latency to fall in seconds [s]) for each treatment group were averaged. In brief, mice were individually placed on a wire cage lid until footing was established. The cage lid was then inverted and the time to fall was recorded during a 2-min maximum testing time. Animals that were able to climb topside were awarded the maximum 2-min score. The test was terminated at two minutes for those mice that neither climbed topside nor fell.\n\n2-Object Novel Recognition test\nThis test is used to evaluate recognition memory on Day 7. PND21 and PND24 mice (impact depths 2.0 and 2.25\u2009mm) and sham mice (\nn\n=6 in each group) were habituated to the testing room in their home cage for 24\u2009h on Day 6 post-TBI. Mice were individually habituated to the testing black box for 10\u2009min each. On Day 7 post-TBI, mice were placed individually in the black box with two identical objects for 10\u2009min each. Four hours later, mice were placed individually in the black box with one familiar object and one new object. Each mouse was videotaped for 10\u2009min, and the number of touches per object was recorded. Scoring was as follows: nose touch=1 point; two paws on object=2 points; and all four paws on top of object=3 points, as we previously described.\n9\nPoints were tallied and touches to old versus new objects were compared. An observer blinded to the impact groups conducted video analysis.\n\nWestern blots\nBrain tissue samples (100\u2009mg) from under the impact site (\nFig. 1\n) or comparable location of sham from time-points 6\u2009h, 12\u2009h, 24\u2009h, 48\u2009h, 72\u2009h, and 7\u2009d, animals were homogenized in 1\u00d7 RIPA lysis buffer (Millipore,) with protease inhibitor (Sigma Aldrich). Protein concentrations were determined with Bicinchoninic Acid Protein Assay Kit (Pierce/Thermo Scientific,). ISG15 protein lysates (30\u2009\u03bcg) were fractioned by 4%-12% Bis-Tris gels (Novex/Life Technologies,) and MLCK protein lysates (90\u2009\u03bcg) were fractioned by 3\u20138% Tris-Acetate gels (Novex/Life Technologies), with both then transferred using the iBlot system, (Life Technologies,). ISG15 blots were probed with ISG15 rabbit serum (Washington University St. Louis, courtesy of Dr. D. Lenschow) and goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) secondary (Life Technologies). MLCK blots were probed with rabbit monoclonal primary antibody (Abcam,) and goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary (Life Technologies). Both were developed using Supersignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo Scientific) and imaged with GE ImageQuant LAS 4000 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences,).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nImmunohistochemistry was performed on PND21 mice at 24\u2009h, as we reported previously.\n9\nIn brief, the animals were sacrificed with 1% Avertin (100\u2009\u03bcL/g), perfused with normal saline by perfusion pump 10\u2009mL/min for 2\u2009min. Whole brains were removed, immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and then cryopreserved. Serial sections 20-micron thick extending from bregma 0\u2009mm to \u22123.46\u2009mm were prepared. The sequence for antibody processing was the same for each brain. All sections were rinsed, blocked with 10% normal swine serum, and incubated overnight at room temperature with primary antibodies: ISG15 rabbit serum (Lenschow Lab,) 1:400 and MLCK mouse monoclonal IgG (Sigma Aldrich) 1:150. Negative control sections were incubated in normal serum and phosphate-buffered saline in place of primary antibody. ISG15 was detected using Alexa flour 488 (Life Technologies) 1:200. MLCK was detected using Dylight 594 (Thermo Scientific) 1:200 and 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Life Technologies). Slides were photographed using a Deconvolution Axioplain Z imaging microscope with a Sensicam QE and Slidebook 5.0 at 20\u00d7.\n\nCo-immunoprecipitation\nCo-immunoprecipitation was performed to assess protein-protein interaction between ISG15 and MLCK. We incubated 500\u2009\u03bcg of PND24 TBI lysate from 6\u2009h, 24\u2009h, and 7\u2009d time-points for 1\u2009h at 4\u00b0C with either MLCK rabbit polyclonal (Abgent,) or ISG15 mouse monoclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,) primary antibody. A total of 20\u2009\u03bcL of Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose Immunoprecipitate Reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. ISG15 IP and MLCK IP were separated on a 3\u20138% Tris-Acetate mini-gel and transferred as described above. The ISG15 IP blot was probed with MLCK rabbit monoclonal primary antibody (Abcam) and anti- rabbit IgG (Life Technologies). The MLCK IP blot was probed with ISG15 mouse monoclonal primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and goat anti-mouse IgG (Millipore). Blots were developed as described above.\n\nStatistical analysis\nValues are expressed as mean\u00b1standard error of the mean for each group. Tests for normality were performed for each data set. Parametric tests were used when the data were normal, and nonparametric tests were used if the data were not normal. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or the Kruskal-Wallis test for nonparametric analysis was performed to compare three or more groups. Bonferroni's multiple comparison procedure (or Dunn's procedure for nonparametric analysis) was used for post hoc analysis. For the analysis of the 2-Object Novel Recognition we used specifically Kruskal Wallis with multiple comparisons analyzing all groups per age at one time comparing both old to new and new to old per impact depth. Significance was defined as\np\n<0.05 for all tests. Prism 5.0 Software (GraphPad Software, Inc.,) was used for statistical analyses."

    "Methods": "Patients\nThe study included 42 consecutive patients who were treated for CSDH by surgery at the First Hospital of Jilin University between March 2013 and April 2014. Five patients were excluded because of long-term use of thrombolytics or anticoagulant drugs (\nn\n=3), or hepatic and hematological disease (\nn\n=2). There were 25 males and 12 females ranging in age from 45 to 83 years (mean age 61.4\u00b19.7 years). All of the patients had a history of brain injury diagnosed >21 days after the initial injury. All patients required operation based on the appearance of CSDH proved by CT and MRI. All patients received single burr-hole irrigation under general anesthesia. Serum samples were drawn preoperatively into a serum separator tube (Vacutainer, Becton Dickinson, USA) and allowed to stand for 30\u2009min at room temperature to ensure full clotting. Hematoma fluid was collected into the vacuum tube after opening of the outer hematoma membrane. All samples were centrifuged at 3000\ng\nfor 10\u2009min and supernatant was collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until assayed. Written informed consent for participation in the study was obtained from all participants or their guardians. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of The First Hospital of Jilin University (IRB00008484).\n\nMeasurements of VEGF, MMP-2, and MMP-9 by ELISA\nWe measured the concentration of VEGF, MMP-2, and MMP-9 in hematoma fluid and serum using commercially available solid phase ELISA kits (R&D Systems Inc, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All measurements were performed in duplicates. The experimenter was blinded to the patients' clinical data.\n\nMeasurements of MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity by gelatin zymography\nA zymography technique with the use of NOVEX 10% zymogram (Gelatin) Protein Gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was employed.\n13\nFor each sample, 300\u2009\u03bcg of total protein was applied to the gel and submitted to electrophoresis in Tris/glycine/sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) running buffer at a constant current of 15\u2009mA. After electrophoresis, the gel was submitted to extraction of SDS with 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min. After extraction, the gel was transferred into 50\u2009mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.2\u2009M NaCl, 5\u2009mM CaCl\n2\n, 0.02% NaN\n3\n, and 1% Triton X-100, and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 72\u2009h. The protease bands appeared as clear bands on a blue background. MMP-2 and MMP-9 standards were run concurrently for determining the molecular weight of MMP bands. Samples all were analyzed in duplicate. Gels were scanned and quantification of the bands was determined using ImageJ software version 1.48 (National Institutes of Health [NIH], Bethesda, MD).\n\nStatistical analysis\nResults are expressed as mean\u00b1SD. The paired\nt\ntest was applied to assess possible differences in the levels of VEGF, MMP-2, and MMP-9 between hematoma fluid and serum. Nonparametric Mann\u2013Whitney\nU\ntest was assessed to examine the differences of VEGF mean concentrations among the MRI type groups. Correlations among the various measured parameters were calculated by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. For all statistical tests, the level of significance was set at 0.05.

    "Methods": "Calculation of contact exposure estimate\nAll participants provided informed consent prior to data collection. To calculate our estimate of contact exposure, we created a structured oral athlete interview that collected detailed information about their football career histories. In order to account for possible changes that occur during one's career, participants provided information for each year that they played, beginning with high school, and continuing through college and professional football. Additionally, in order to account for possible differences within a season, information was collected separately for the pre-season and for spring football for college.\nFirst, participants denoted their primary and secondary positions played (i.e., quarterback, offensive line, tight end, offensive back, running back, defensive line, defensive back, linebacker, wide receiver, special teams). Next, participants reported the average number and length of contact practices per week. We emphasized to participants to only consider those practices in which contact occurred (i.e., no strength and conditioning practices). At the high school and college levels, we assumed that the weekly practice schedules for the regular season and post-season were the same. For games, participants reported the number of games they played and the percentage of time that they played in those games (from possible choices including 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%). For professional football, data regarding number of games played for each recorded season are publicly available on\nNFL.com\n. In cases in which online records and players reports differed, follow-up with players was conducted to reconcile all differences. The majority of these differences were minimal, with athlete reports and online records differing by one game.\nFigure 1\nexplains the calculation of the contact exposure estimate for 1 year of participation. Because we were concerned with the differences in the frequency and the severity of impacts that occur in games compared to practice, we also calculated an adjusted contact exposure estimate that applied a weight, unique to each primary position played, to the number of game contact hours (\nTable 1\n). These weights were based on previous findings that compared the frequency and severity (i.e., linear acceleration) of impacts between games and practices in high school and college.\n17\n,\n20\nFor example, among college quarterbacks, the rate of game impact was 2.60 times that of practice impacts, and the mean severity of game impacts was 1.10 times that of practice impacts.\n17\nTherefore, if a college quarterback logged 100.00 game contact hours, his adjusted exposure would be 286.00 (calculated as 100.00\u00d72.60\u00d71.10). Adjusted exposures for special teams in high school football and for all positions in professional football utilized college level weights.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nCalculation of exposure contact per year in football.\nTable\n1.\nWeights for Total Game Contact Hours for Adjusted Contact Exposure Estimate, by Position\nWeight\nHigh school\nCollege and professional\na\nPosition\nFrequency\nSeverity\nFrequency\nSeverity\nQuarterback\n8.26\n1.07\n2.60\n1.10\nOffensive lineman\n2.68\n1.03\n2.19\n0.98\nTight end\n3.38\n1.06\n2.19\n1.04\nOffensive back\n3.38\n1.06\n2.06\n1.04\nRunning back\n3.38\n1.06\n2.06\n0.94\nDefensive line\n2.68\n1.03\n2.59\n0.94\nDefensive back\n3.49\n1.09\n2.67\n1.05\nLinebacker\n3.38\n1.06\n2.58\n0.98\nWide receiver\n3.49\n1.09\n2.09\n0.98\nSpecial teams\nb\n3.00\n0.78\n3.00\n0.78\nOpen in a separate window\nExample: Among college quarterbacks, the rate of game impact was 2.60 times that of practice impacts.\n17\nExample: Among high school quarterbacks, the mean severity of game impacts was 1.07 times that of practice impacts.\n20\na\nCollege data were utilized for weights for professional level football.\nb\nBecause of insufficient specials teams data at the high school level, weights from the college level were utilized.\nThe contact exposure estimate was first presented with an example scenario. Next we calculated contact exposure estimates within a cohort of 64 former football players, the majority of whom were non-Hispanic white (89.1%), had an average age of 58.4 years (SD=3.7), and had played the majority of their careers as offensive linemen (31.3%) or linebackers (29.7%). This cohort consisted of former players who had played in the NFL (\nn\n=32), and former players who had played up to the college football level only (\nn\n=32). NFL and college-only players were matched by age, primary playing position, and concussion history (categorized as low: i.e., zero to one concussions; and high: i.e., two or more concussions). Those who played in the NFL played college and professional football for an average of 13.8 years (SD=3.2). Those who played only at the college level played for an average 4.1 years (SD=0.6). Accordingly, it had been an average 27.4 years (SD=4.0) since former NFL players had retired, and an average of 37.6 years (SD=4.1) since former college players had retired. Research staff conducted structured oral interviews with these participants on their football career history in order to create the contact exposure estimates. ANOVAs compared unadjusted and adjusted contact exposure estimates by concussion history (low: zero to one concussions vs. high: two or more concussions); group (NFL vs. college-only); and their interaction."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Florida. A total of 60 adult female Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (200\u2013250\u2009g; \u223c16 weeks of age) were obtained from Harlan Laboratories Inc. (Indianapolis, IN). Animals were housed within the McKnight Brain Institute at the University of Florida and maintained on a 12/12\u2009h light\u2013dark cycle. In addition, they had free access to water and food pellets. Animals were assigned to one of two groups: spinally intact (\nn\n=22) or C2Hx groups (\nn\n=38). Animals within the spinally intact group were injected with a neuroanatomical tracer and assigned to either a 24\u2009h (\nn\n=2), a 48\u2009h (\nn\n=4), a 72\u2009h (\nn\n=6), a 96\u2009h (\nn\n=6), or a 120\u2009h (\nn\n=4) post-injection incubation period. Within the chronic hemisection group (\nn\n=38), all animals underwent behavioral assessments prior to and at biweekly intervals following C2Hx injury. A subset of 14 animals from the C2Hx group were allocated for neuroanatomical assessments at a post-PRV incubation interval of either 72 (\nn\n=6) or 96\u2009h (\nn\n=8). All animals assigned to the C2Hx group were assessed for lesion completeness prior to inclusion in the final analyses.\n\nGeneral surgical methods\nAnesthesia and injury methods have been previously described.\n22\u201324\nBriefly, rats were anesthetized by injection of xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg, s.q.) and ketamine (140\u2009mg/kg, i.p., Fort Dodge Animal Health, IA). Following completion of the surgical procedure, anesthesia was reversed via injection of yohimbine (1.2\u2009mg/kg s.q.). Upon recovery, animals were given injections of buprenorphine (0.03\u2009mg/kg s.q., Hospira, IL) for analgesia and sterile lactated Ringers solution (5\u2009mL s.q.) to prevent dehydration. Postsurgical care included administration of buprenorphine (0.03\u2009mg/kg, s.q.) for the initial 48\u2009h post-injury and delivery of lactate Ringers solution (5\u2009mL/day, s.q.) and oral Nutrical supplements (1\u20133\u2009mL, Webster Veterinary, MA) until adequate volitional drinking and eating resumed.\n\nSpinal cord hemisection injury\nAs previously described,\n1\n,\n23\n,\n25\na 3\u2009cm midline dorsal incision was made from the base of the skull extending caudally to approximately the fourth cervical segment (C4). A laminectomy was performed at the second cervical segment (C2) to expose the spinal cord. A small incision was then made in the dura and a lateral Hx performed on the left side of the spinal cord using a microscalpel, followed by gentle aspiration. Using this approach, the completeness of the lesion was readily visible and the extent of the lesion was reproducible. The dura was then closed with interrupted 9-0 sutures and durafilm was placed over the dura. The overlying muscle was then sutured in layers and the skin was closed with stainless steel surgical wound clips.\n\nAnatomical tracing protocols\nRecombinants of the Bartha strain of PRV (in minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum) were used as anatomical tracers to examine the neural circuitry associated with the ECRL muscle in cohorts of spinal intact and C2Hx rats. PRV is a trans-synaptically transported tracer that will label the entire motor circuitry over time. Propagation and culture methods for PRV have been extensively detailed.\n1\nTwo recombinants of PRV were used in the present study: either PRV152 or PRV614 (each \u223c2.0\u00d710\n8\nplaque-forming units [PFU]) were used to trace the circuitry associated with the ECRL muscle.\nApplication of PRV was made via a small incision in the skin of the distal forelimb above the ECRL muscle in spinal intact and C2Hx rats. The skin and fascia overlying the ECRL were dissected to expose the ECRL muscle belly. PRV (10\u2009\u03bcL) was injected into the ECRL via Hamilton syringe (Hamilton Company, Reno, NV). Animals were left to survive for 24\u2013120\u2009h following tracer injection. A careful time-course study was conducted in uninjured rats to determine the appropriate post-injection time point for first-order ECRL motoneuron labeling and subsequent, second-order transneuronal labeling of pre-motor ECRL spinal interneurons. Thus these data guided the selection of 72 and 96\u2009h PRV incubation times in the chronic C2Hx group, as there was evidence of both first- and second-order labeling at these time points.\nIn a subset of animals (\nn\n=2 from the 72\u2009h control group,\nn\n=2 from the 96\u2009h control group, and\nn\n=2 from the 96\u2009h C2Hx group), the left radial nerve was severed prior to injection of PRV, to dennervate the ECRL muscle. The muscle was then injected with PRV. These control experiments were used to determine whether any of the observed PRV labeled cells in the cervical spinal cord arose from labeling of pre-sympathetic neurons. Any neuronal PRV labeling in these rats would be the result of uptake and transport of PRV via sympathetic innervation of blood vessels, not via retrograde infection from the ECRL.\n\nBehavioral testing of forelimb function\nPrior to initiation of experimental testing, rats were handled for 3\u20135\u2009min daily for 7\u201310 days prior to testing by laboratory personnel to familiarize the animals with test administrators. All testing was conducted at the same time of day for each behavioral test. All procedures were videotaped and subsequently quantified by a blinded observer. Rats were tested prior to injury, at 1 and 2\u2009weeks post-injury, then at biweekly intervals thereafter, until termination of the study at 16 weeks post-injury.\nLimb-use Asymmetry (Cylinder) Test\nThe cylinder test was conducted on awake, unrestrained animals. Testing consisted of a single trial in which rats were placed in a clear Plexiglas cylinder (20\u2009cm in diameter, 20\u2009cm high) for 5\u2009min. Forelimb use was measured during vertical exploration as the number of individual and simultaneous forepaw contacts with the cylinder wall.\n26\u201328\nIpsilateral forelimb use was calculated as the proportion of ipsilateral forepaw contacts to the total number of forepaw contacts. Scores were calculated with and without dorsal paw contacts included in the quantification.\nForelimb Locomotor Scale (FLS)\nRats were placed in an open-field plastic enclosure measuring 0.85\u2009m\u00d71\u2009m. and were observed for a period lasting no longer than 5\u2009min. Trials were scored in real time by an examiner, and were also videotaped for later viewing and scoring. Scoring was conducted according to the FLS, a modified version of the Basso\u2013Beattie\u2013Bresnahan (BBB) Locomotor Rating Scale,\n29\n,\n30\nas previously described.\n19\n,\n31\n,\n32\nThe FLS is 17 point scale that defines deficits based on range of motion (\nTable 1\n), level of weight support, and whether the paw is parallel to the body.\nTable\n1.\nForelimb Locomotor Scale (FLS) Scoring Rubric\nFLS score\nBehavioral description\n0\nNo movements of the forelimb (shoulder, elbow, or wrist joints)\n1\nSlight movements of one or two joints of the forelimb\n2\nExtensive movement of one joint and slight movement of another joint of the forelimb\n3\nSlight movement of all three joints of the forelimb\n4\nExtensive movement of one joint and slight movement of two joints of the forelimb\n5\nExtensive movement of two joints and slight movement of one joint of the forelimb\n6\nExtensive movement of all three joints of the forelimb\n7\nPlantar placement of the forelimb with no weight support\n8\nDorsal stepping only\n9\nDorsal stepping and/or occasional plantar stepping\n10\nFrequent plantar stepping\n11\nContinuous plantar stepping\n12\nContinuous plantar stepping with paw position rotated (either at initial contact, lift-off, or both)\n13\nContinuous plantar stepping with paw position parallel (either at initial contact, lift-off, or both)\n14\nContinuous plantar stepping with paw position rotated (either at initial contact, lift-off, or both) and occasional toe clearance\n15\nContinuous plantar stepping with paw position parallel (either at initial contact, lift-off, or both) and occasional toe clearance\n16\nContinuous plantar stepping with paw position rotated (either at initial contact, lift-off, or both) and continuous toe clearance\n17\nContinuous plantar stepping with paw position parallel (either at initial contact, lift-off, or both) and continuous toe clearance\nOpen in a separate window\nNumerical score values are given based on defined behavioral criteria. (Adapted from Sandrow et al.\n31\n).\nVermicelli pasta handling test\nRats were given 7\u2009cm lengths of uncooked vermicelli pasta, marked at 1.75\u2009cm intervals to facilitate visualization of paw and pasta movement. For 10 days prior to initiation of behavioral testing, all rats were given the vermicelli pieces in their home cages to familiarize them with the pasta handling. Testing consisted of three to five trials in which the rats were given a single piece of pasta per trial while still in the clear Plexiglas cylinder. Test trials were videotaped with a Sony Digital Camcorder for frame-by-frame analysis. Quantification of this test involved counting the number of adjustments made by each forepaw, (left vs. right), the time to eat the entire length of the pasta, and documentation of any atypical behaviors (\nTable 2\n), including atypical paw positions, failure to contact the pasta, drops, abnormal pasta grasping, or compensatory head and neck positions.\n33\n,\n34\nAdjustments were defined as any visually confirmed release and re-grasp of the length of pasta. The time to eat was defined by when the pasta was first placed in the mouth, ending when the piece was released from both hands and completely consumed.\n19\n,\n33\n,\n34\nTrials were ignored if the rat did not consume the entire length of pasta or turned away from the camera in such a way that the pasta and the digits were obscured from view.\nTable\n2.\nVermicelli Pasta Handling Test: Atypical Behaviors\nAtypical behavior\nBehavioral description\na.\nPaws together when long\nb.\nGuide and grasp switch\nc.\nFailure to contact\nd.\nDrop\ne.\nPaws apart when short\nf.\nMouth pulling\ng.\nHunched/abnormal posture\nh.\nIron grip\ni.\nGuide around grasp\nj.\nAngling with head tilt\nOpen in a separate window\nDefinitions of atypical behaviors observed during the vermicelli pasta handling test (Adapted from Allred et al.\n33\nand Tennant et al.\n34\n).\n\nSpinal cord histology\nAt the predefined termination point, rats were euthanized by systemic perfusion with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). For lesion verification, the spinal cord was dissected and removed, embedded in paraffin, and 5\u2009\u03bcm transverse sections were prepared. Spinal cord sections were mounted on glass slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), stained with cresyl violet, and evaluated using light microscopy. C2Hx lesions were considered to be anatomically complete only if there was a complete absence of apparently healthy white or gray matter in the ipsilateral spinal cord at the lesion epicenter as previously described.\n22\u201325\n,\n35\n,\n36\nFor anatomical tracing studies, the cervical spinal cord was removed, and 40\u2009\u03bcm vibratome sections were made in the longitudinal plane. A subset of tissue was sectioned transversely (40\u2009\u03bcm vibratome sections) for assessing the cross-sectional distribution of labeled neurons. For immunocytochemical analyses of PRV labeling, longitudinal vibratome sections were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (0.1M, pH 7.4, 3\u00d75\u2009min), blocked against endogenous peroxidase activity (30% methanol, 0.6% hydrogen peroxide in 0.1\u2009M PBS, incubated for 1\u20132\u2009h), re-washed in PBS, and blocked against nonspecific protein labeling (10% normal goat serum in 0.1\u2009M PBS with 0.03% Triton-X). Sections were then incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with primary antibodies against PRV (rabbit anti-PRV; Rb133/134, raised against whole purified PRV particles that were acetone inactivated; 1:10,000; provided by Dr. Lynn Enquist). The following day, tissue was washed in PBS (0.1\u2009M, 3\u00d75 minutes), incubated for 2\u2009h at room temperature in a biotinylated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit; Jackson Immunocytochemicals, West Grove, PA; 1:200) and rewashed in PBS (3\u00d75\u2009min). Sections were further incubated for 2\u2009h in an avidin-biotin complex (ABC; Elite Vectastain Kit; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), given a third series of washes in PBS, and processed for antigen visualization with diaminobenzidine (DAB; Sigma, St. Louis, MO).\n1\nA subset of tissue sections were counterstained with cresyl violet for visualization of neuronal cell bodies.\n\nMicroscopy and quantitative analyses\nSpinal cord sections were examined using brightfield microscopy and photographs were taken using a Zeiss AxioPhot microscope with and AxioCam digital camera linked to a PC. PRV-positive cells (ECRL motoneurons and pre-motor interneurons) were quantified in serial longitudinal 40\u2009\u03bcm sections separated by 120\u2009\u03bcm (every fourth section) by a blind observer. Cell counts were made bilaterally in the dorsal horn, intermediate gray matter, and the ventral horn, and separated rostrocaudally into three cervical regions: C1-C3, C4-C6, and C7-T1. The average number of cells within each region (\u00b1 standard error of the mean) was sampled 72 and 96\u2009h following application of PRV. Motoneurons (primary PRV labeling) were distinguished from spinal interneurons (secondary labeling) based on their location and size. All other cells within the cervical spinal cord were considered spinal interneurons that innervate the ECRL motoneurons. In addition to reporting \u201craw\u201d cell numbers, the number of PRV-positive interneurons was then expressed as a function of the number of labeled ECRL motoneurons in order to control for variations in primary labeling among animals (secondary labeling was normalized against primary labeling).\n1\n,\n23\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were performed using SigmaPlot 12.5 statistical software (SigmaPlot, SPSS, Chicago, IL). Research hypotheses were tested at an \u03b1 level of 0.05 using repeated measures (RM), one, two, and three way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) to determine differences between groups. Post- hoc tests were performed using the Student\u2013Newman\u2013Keuls method to correct for multiple pairwise comparisons. One way RM ANOVAs were used to assess changes in body weight, cylinder test scores, time to eating, and atypical behavior scores on the vermicelli pasta handling test. Two way repeated measures ANOVA and the Student\u2013Newman\u2013Keuls post-hoc tests were conducted for FLS test scores and the number of adjustments in the vermicelli pasta test. For this ANOVA, factor 1 was \u201ctreatment\u201d (i.e., pre-injury or the various post-C2Hx time points) and factor 2 was \u201cside\u201d (i.e., relative to the side of injury: contralateral vs. ipsilateral). All data are presented as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean. A\np\nvalue of<0.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Human spinal cord samples\nHuman cervical spinal cords were obtained from 41 subjects (gestational age 18 weeks to 40 years of age), 25 from the Department of Forensic Medicine Sydney, NSW Health Pathology (DoFM) and 16 from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, University of Baltimore, Maryland (NICHD) (\nTable 1\n). \u201cTrauma\u201d cases were from subjects who had died as a result of a motor vehicle accidents (MVA), non-accidental death, or falls, and were divided into those who had reported survival times of >30\u2009min (\nn\n=14) and those whose survival time were either unknown or reported to be <30\u2009min (\nn\n=13). The remaining 14 cases were included as \u201ccontrol\u201d cases, and included spinal cords from two embryos and subjects who had died from a variety of causes including drowning, SIDS, asphyxiation, myocarditis, sudden collapse, and pulmonary fibrosis. Additional thoracic and lumbar spinal cord tissue was available for 12 cases. All cases were de-identified, and included information about age, gender, postmortem (PM) delay, and at least a brief summary of the circumstances surrounding the death.

Transverse sections were cut at 5\u03bcm with a Microm HM 325 rotary microtome (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., MA) for all but three samples, for which tissue was supplied as longitudinal cut unstained sections. Sections were then placed onto Flexi microscope slides (Dako, Denmark). One section from each case was stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E), and adjacent sections were immunoreacted with anti-nestin and anti-GFAP antibodies, or both.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nAll sections were de-paraffinized and taken to water. Sections undergoing immunohistochemistry for anti-nestin then underwent antigen retrieval in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) pH 8.0 solution. Slides were heated in EDTA solution in a microwave until boiling (1\u2009min) and then allowed to cool to room temperature before being rinsed in distilled water. All slides were then immersed in 0.1M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, with 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBS with Tween [PBST]) for 10\u2009min prior to 3% H\n2\nO\n2\nin PBST for 30\u2009min to block endogenous peroxidase. They were then washed in three changes of PBST before immersion in 5% normal goat or horse serum (NGS/NHS) in PBST for 30\u2009min to block nonspecific binding. Slides were incubated overnight in primary antibody at 4\u00b0C; rabbit anti-GFAP (1:1000, Dako, Denmark) or mouse anti-nestin antibody (1:500; Dako, Denmark). Sections were rinsed in three changes of PBST before incubation in biotinylated secondary antibody; Goat anti-Rabbit (1:200, Vector, USA) or Horse anti-Mouse (1:200, Vector, USA) for 1\u2009h at room temperature followed by three rinses in PBST and 1\u2009h incubation in peroxidase-ABC complex (Vector, USA). Finally, the reaction product was visualized using 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB) tetrahydrochloride, and the nuclei were lightly counterstained with Mayer's Hematoxylin before dehydration and cover-slipping with DPX.\nFor nestin-positive sections, double labeling with anti-GFAP and anti-nestin using fluorescent secondary antibodies was then preformed on adjacent sections. These sections underwent antigen retrieval, were incubated in normal serum in PBST for 30\u2009min, and were then incubated overnight in a cocktail of the two primary antibodies described. After rinsing in three changes of PBST, the sections were incubated in AF 488 goat anti-rabbit and AF 568 goat anti-mouse (1:200 Invitrogen, USA) for 1\u2009h at room temperature in the dark. Sections were washed with PBST and all sections were counterstained with Hoechst (33342, Invitrogen, CA) for 10\u2009min to visualize the cell nuclei before cover-slipping with Fluoromount (Dako, Denmark). The primary antibody was omitted from negative control slides.\n\nAnalysis of central canal morphology\nH&E-stained sections were observed using the Olympus BX51 Light Microscope (Olympus, Japan), and digital images were captured with an Olympus DP70 digital camera. All images were centered on the central canal, and have the dorsal aspect at the top of the image. The lumen area, perimeter, circularity, and epithelial height were measured for each section. The number of pendymal cells was counted, and a measure of ependymal cells/mm was calculated for comparison between the groups. Longitudinal sections were omitted from the lumen measurements, and sections with poor central canal morphology were omitted from all measurements.\n\nAnalysis of immunohistochemistry\nHigh power digital images of nestin/DAB-stained sections were captured as described. The total number of ependymal cells identified by their nuclei and the number of nestin-positive ependymal cells were counted in each spinal cord section. This measurement was expressed as the percentage of nestin positive cells (% nestin).\nDigital images of GFAP/DAB-stained sections were centered on the central canal such that both gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) were visible. An additional image was taken of the dorsal roots in each sample. The dorsal root does not contain astrocytes, and, therefore, is negative for GFAP. This image was used as an internal control for each section to control for any variation found in background staining intensity on different slides. The average gray scale value was calculated, from four regions of interest in the WM and the GM adjacent to the central canal and the dorsal root, using ImageJ software to give a measure of GFAP staining intensity. The percentage increase from background (dorsal root) was then calculated as a measure of GFAP-staining intensity (% GFAP) for the WM and GM in each section. Longitudinal sections were omitted from this analysis."

    "Methods": "TBI patients\nPatients were admitted to the study and medically treated as has been described previously.\n20\nBriefly, eligible patients included all mechanically ventilated moderately or severely brain-injured patients, \u226516 years of age, who were admitted to UCLA Medical Center within 24\u2009h of injury. Moderate or severe brain injury was defined as closed injury with a post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Score (GCS)\u226413 or deterioration to a GCS\u226413 within 24\u2009h of admission, and as an injury requiring mechanical ventilation and intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring. Exclusion criteria included the following: 1) terminal illness (e.g., advanced cancer, AIDS); 2) severe neurological illness (advanced Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's dementia, disabling cerebrovascular event, mental retardation); and 3) acute complete spinal cord injury. UCLA and UCB institutional review boards approved this protocol, and informed consent was obtained from patients' legal representatives.\n\nGeneral management protocol\nPatients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after initial stabilization or surgical evacuation of an intracranial hematoma, and were treated in accordance with the Brain Trauma Foundation and American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS)/Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) TBI Guidelines.\n21\nManagement goals included maintenance of ICP<20\u2009mm Hg and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP)>70\u2009mm Hg. All patients had arterial and JB catheters inserted as soon as possible following patient admission to allow determination of arteriovenous differences (AVD) for glucose, lactate, and oxygen.\nFor sampling of venous blood from the brain, the dominant jugular vein was selected based on the dominant jugular foramen visualized on admission CT scan. Using standard techniques, a 5 Fr Cordis and a 4 Fr Oxymetric catheter (Baxter Critical Care, Baxter Health Care) were inserted to a depth of \u223c15\u2009cm, or until resistance was encountered. Placement of the catheter was confirmed by lateral skull radiodgraphs. The catheter was calibrated\nin vivo\n, and repeat calibration was performed every 12\u2009h. Display of light intensity and oxygen saturation was continuously displayed on the monitor.\nAs a part of patient care, arterial and venous samples and\n133\nXenon-cerebral blood flow (CBF) studies were scheduled every 24\u2009h during post-injury days 0\u20135, 7, and 9. It was not possible for all scheduled studies to be completed on all patients because patients' clinical status and treatments took priority, including severely elevated ICP (ICP>30\u2009mm Hg), hemodynamic and/or respiratory instability, or removal of the jugular catheter or extubation following clinical improvement.\nFor isotope tracer studies, stable, nonradioactive D2-glucose and [3-\n13\nC]lactate isotope tracers were infused (discussed subsequently), typically 72\u201396\u2009h after admission to the ICU when informed consent had been obtained. Intravenous feeding was not used. All glucose-containing intravenous tube feeds were discontinued before isotope infusion. Enteral feeding (Osmolite 1.2 or 1.5; Abbott Laboratories, Abbot Park, IL) was continued during the isotope infusion. The rate of caloric delivery was at the discretion of the attending physician.\n\nHealthy controls\nSix healthy, nonsmoking, weight-stable volunteers (28.2\u00b18.2 years) were recruited from the UCLA campus and the surrounding community by posted notices and Internet advertisements. Subjects were admitted into the study if they met the following criteria: 1) had been diet and weight stable for >6 months; 2) were not taking medications; 3) had normal lung function, defined as forced expiratory volume in 1\u2009sec\u226570%; and 4) were disease and injury free as determined by a health history questionnaire and physical examination. Control subjects received local anesthetics for catheter placements and experimental procedures. Details for this technique have been previously described.\n20\nBriefly, through use of a femoral vein approach, a JB catheter was inserted under fluoroscopic guidance into proper position in the JB. A radial arterial line was also placed. Again, institutional ethical review boards approved the protocol and subjects provided written informed consent. Dietary records were not recorded for the control group.\n\nExperimental protocol\nControl subjects reported to the laboratory and were studied as described. Prior to tracer infusions, a blood sample was collected from the radial artery and JB catheter for baseline isotope enrichment measurements of glucose and lactate. Next, subjects received a primed continuous infusion of D2-glucose and [3-\n13\nC]lactate via an arm vein catheter while semisupine for 90\u2009min. The priming bolus for glucose was equal to 125 times the resting glucose infusion rate. Subsequently, D2-glucose was infused at 2\u2009mg/min. The priming bolus for lactate was equal to 23 times the resting lactate infusion rate of 2.5\u2009mg/min.\n22\nAs previously, different tracer cocktail infusion rates were managed by means of two separate pumps connected to a common venous infusion port.\n23\nIsotopes were obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Tewksbury, MA), diluted in 0.9% sterile saline, and tested for sterility and pyrogenicity prior to use (UCLA Pharmaceutical Services).\nArterial and JB blood samples (1\u20132\u2009mL) were collected simultaneously every 60\u2009min for a period of 3\u2009h following commencement of tracer infusion. Cannulas were flushed with an equivalent amount of 0.9% saline after each collection.\n\nProcessing and analysis of blood\nBlood samples were immediately transferred to ice-chilled tubes containing 0.6\u2009M of perchloric acid, shaken and stored on ice until the end of the experiment. Within 1\u2009h of collection, perchloric acid extracts were centrifuged (10\u2009min at 3000\u2009rpm, 2000\ng\n, 4\u00b0C) and the supernatants transferred to separate tubes for storage at \u221220\u00b0C until further analysis.\nBlood lactate was measured in neutralized perchloric extracts using an enzymatic method in addition to mass spectrometry as previously described.\n13\n,\n22\n,\n24\nBlood lactate isotopic enrichment (IE) was determined using gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of the\nN\n-propylamide heptafluorobutyrate derivative of lactate.\n25\nBriefly, neutralized perchloric extracts were lyophilized, re-suspended in 200\u2009\u03bcl of 2,2-dimethoxypropane and 20\u2009\u03bcl 10% w/w HCl in methanol, capped and incubated at room temperature for 60\u2009min. Next, 50\u2009\u03bcl of\nN\n-propylamine was added and the samples were heated at 100\u00b0C for 30\u2009min, dried under a stream of N\n2\n, re-suspended in ethyl acetate, and transferred to GC-MS vials. Thereafter, the samples were dried under N\n2\n, derivatized by adding 20\u2009\u03bcl of heptafluorobutyric anhydride (5\u2009min at room temperature), dried again under N\n2\n, and re-suspended in ethyl acetate for GC-MS analysis. Methane was used for chemical ionization with selected ion monitoring for mass to charge ratios 328 (unlabeled lactate) and 329 (\n13\nC-labeled lactate), respectively.\nBlood glucose concentration and IE were determined by GC-MS of the penta-acetate derivative using an Agilent DB-17 GC column and [U-\n13\nC]glucose as internal standard. Glucose sample preparation was performed as described previously. Methane was used for chemical ionization and selective ion monitoring was performed for mass-to-charge ratios (M/Z) of 331, 333, and 337 for endogenous glucose, D2-glucose tracer, and [U-\n13\nC6]glucose internal standard, respectively. Selected ion abundances were compared against external standard curves for calculation of both concentration and IE, with normalization to internal standard signal for determination of concentration.\nArterial and JB\n13\nCO\n2\ncontents were determined by isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) performed by Metabolic Solutions (Nashua, NH).\n\nCalculations\nThe arteriovenous differences (AVD) and cerebral metabolic rates (CMR) of glucose and lactate were calculated as follows:\nwhere [Metabolite\nart\n] and [Metabolite\nJB\n] are the concentrations of either glucose or lactate from arterial and JB venous sites, respectively, and CBF is the measured cerebral blood flow.\n20\nPositive AVD and CMR reflect net cerebral uptake, whereas negative AVD and CMR indicate net cerebral release.\nTracer-measured cerebral fractional extraction (FExTM) and tracer-measured uptake (TMU) (mg/min) were calculated as follows:\nwhere [Lac\nart\n] and [Lac\nJB\n] are arterial and JB lactate concentrations, respectively, and IELac\nart\nand IELac\nJB\nare the percent enrichment of lactate in arterial and JB blood, respectively.

    "Methods": "Animal model of TBI exposure\nEight adult male Long Evans hooded rats (250\u2013350\u2009g; Charles River Laboratories International, Inc., Wilmington, MA) were used as subjects. Rats (10 weeks of age) were exposed to overpressure injury using the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) shock tube, which simulates air blast exposure under experimental conditions. The shock tube has a 305\u2009mm circular diameter and is a 5.94\u2009m long steel tube divided into a 0.76\u2009m compression chamber that is separated from a 5.18\u2009m expansion chamber. The compression and expansion chambers are separated by polyethylene Mylar\u2122 sheets (Du Pont Co., Wilmington, DE) that control the peak pressure generated. The peak pressure at the end of the expansion chamber was determined by piezoresistive gauges specifically designed for pressure-time (impulse) measurements (Model 102M152, PCB, Piezotronics, Inc., Depew, NY). This apparatus has been used in multiple prior studies to deliver blast overpressure injury to rats.\n15\n,\n20\n,\n23\n,\n24\nIndividual rats were anesthetized using an isoflurane gas anesthesia system consisting of a vaporizer, gas lines and valves, and an activated charcoal scavenging system adapted for use with rodents. Rats were placed into a polycarbonate induction chamber, which was closed and immediately flushed with 5% isoflurane mixture in air for 2\u2009min. Rats were placed into a cone-shaped plastic restraint device and then placed in the shock tube. Movement was further restricted during the blast exposure using 1.5\u2009cm diameter flattened rubber tourniquet tubing. Three tourniquets were spaced evenly to secure the head region, the upper torso, and the lower torso, while the animal was in the plastic restraint cone. The end of each tube was threaded through a toggle and run outside of the exposure cage, where it was tied to firmly affix the animal and prevent movement during the blast overpressure exposure without restricting breathing.\nRats were randomly assigned to sham or blast conditions with the head facing the blast exposure without any body shielding, resulting in full body exposure to the blast wave. Further details of the physical characteristics of the blast wave are described elsewhere.\n3\nBlast-exposed animals received 74.5\u2009kPa exposures equivalent to 10.8\u2009psi. One exposure per day was administered for three consecutive days. Subjects received blast overpressure or sham exposure at the Naval Medical Research Center and were transferred to the James J. Peters VA Medical Center on the day following the last exposure. Following transfer, the animals were housed at a constant 21\u201322\u00b0C temperature with rooms on a 12:12\u2009h light cycle with lights on at 7\nam\n. All subjects were individually housed in standard clear plastic cages equipped with Bed-O'Cobs laboratory animal bedding (The Andersons, Maumee, OH) and EnviroDri nesting paper (Sheppard Specialty Papers, Milford, NJ). Access to food and water was ad libitum. The animals studied here represent a subset of those that were part of a previous behavioral study that has been reported elsewhere.\n25\nAnimals were euthanized by CO2 narcosis and the brains were quickly removed, using dissection procedures described previously.\n25\nTissue from frontal cortex from animals used in the present study was obtained at eight months following the last blast exposure.\n\nIsolation of neuronal and glial cell populations\nFrozen rat tissue from the frontal cortex was used for neuronal nuclei isolation as described by Matevossian and Akbarian\n35\nwith minor modifications. Briefly, approximately 100\u2009mg of postmortem brain tissue was homogenized in 3\u2009mL of Lysis Buffer containing 0.001% 1M Dithiothreitol (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) by volume.\n35\nA nuclear fraction was obtained by ultracentrifugation through a sucrose cushion in an SW40 rotor at 24,500 RPM for 1\u2009h at 4\u00b0C. The pellet was resuspended in 100\u2009\u03bcL of cold PBS, and immunostaining for FACS was done as described using 1.0\u2009\u03bcL of Alexa-Fluor 488 conjugated NeuN antibody (Millipore, Billerica, MA) in 200\u2009\u03bcL staining mix (containing 2.5% normal goat serum and 1.25% bovine serum albumin by volume), which was added to 410\u2009\u03bcL of 1XPBS. For the unstained control, 5\u2009\u03bcL of nuclei from each preparation was added to 300\u2009\u03bcL 1XPBS. For the negative control, 5\u2009\u03bcL from each preparation was added to 490\u2009\u03bcL of 1XPBS and 200\u2009\u03bcL of staining mix containing 1.0\u2009\u03bcL of Alexa Fluor\n\u00ae\n488 conjugated antibody was added. All samples were incubated in the dark for 60 minutes at 4\u00b0C with gentle mixing, followed by filtration through a 35\u2009\u03bcM cell strainer before FACS. Sorted nuclei were resuspended in 200\u2009\u03bcL Resuspension Buffer (100\u2009mM NaCl, 10mM Tris-HCl pH8, 25mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS) with freshly added Proteinase K (final concentration 100\u2009\u03bcg/mL) and incubated at 56\u00b0C for 30\u2009min. To extract DNA, the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) was used using the protocol supplied by the manufacturer.\n\nDNA methylation profiling via expanded reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (ERRBS)\nERRBS library preparation and sequencing was performed at the Epigenomics Core at Weill Cornell Medical College as described previously.\n36\n,\n37\nThis is a modification of the reduced representation bisulfite sequencing approach, which generates single-base resolution DNA methylation bisulfite sequencing libraries that enrich for CpG-dense regions by methylation-insensitive restriction digestion.\n38\nERRBS is similar to the RRBS method, except longer library fragment lengths of 150\u2013250\u2009bp and 250\u2013400\u2009bp were gel isolated. The libraries were then amplified and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 per the manufacturer's recommended protocol for 50\u2009bp single end read runs. Image capture, analysis, and base calling were performed using Illumina's CASAVA 1.7 software. For analysis of bisulfite treated sequence reads (with an average bisulfite conversion rate of >99.4% for all samples), reads were filtered from the adapter sequences using FLEXBAR software.\n39\nAdapter sequence contamination usually occurs towards the 3\u2032 ends of some reads. The adapter matching part of the read was removed if it aligned with the adapter sequence at least 6\u2009bps and had at most a 0.2 mismatch error rate. Reads were aligned to whole genome using the Bismark alignment software with a maximum of two mismatches in a directional manner and only uniquely aligning reads were retained.\n40\nIn order to call a methylation score for a base position, we required that read bases aligning to that position have at least a 20 phred quality score and that the base position should have at least 10\u00d7coverage. Only cytosines with these sequencing quality and coverage criteria were retained for subsequent analysis. The percentage of bisulfite converted cytosines (representing unmethylated cytosines) and non-converted cytosines (representing methylated cytosines) were recorded for each cytosine position in CpG, CHG, and CHH contexts (with H corresponding to A, C, or T nucleotides). The sequencing coverage of cytosines in these contexts were 9.1-14% of all 24.7 million CpG sites, 3.2-6.6% of all 113 million CHG sites, and 1.2-2.6% of all 800 million CHH sites in the rat genome. For cytosine residues for which we had at least 10\u00d7coverage, there were approximately 5.6-6.0% CpG, 1.5-1.6% CHG, and 0.50-0.55% CHH in the data used for subsequent analyses.\n\nGene expression analysis via NanoString\nWe used the NanoString nCounter Elements technology, which provides highly sensitive and reliable expression on a level of single transcript. With this method, it is possible to measure as little as 1.2-fold changes of a single transcript at 20 copies per cell (with\np\n\u22640.05). For this technology, digital detection is used on two levels. On the first level, each transcript is detected by a probe bound to a segment of DNA that is attached to a unique string of colored fluorophores (the molecular barcode). Identification of that transcript, therefore, depends only on the order of fluors on the string, rather than on intensities of the fluors. At the second level of digital detection, the number of total transcripts in a sample is quantified by counting the total number of times a particular string of fluors (or barcode) is detected. In contrast to microarrays or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based gene expression approaches, NanoString does not depend on synthesis of a complementary DNA strand or PCR amplification, eliminating enzymatic reactions and instead using barcode-labeled probes that anneal directly to mRNAs in solution wherein the hybrid molecule is then immobilized, detected, and counted (\nwww.nanostring.com/elements\n). For the present study, we ran some of the samples in duplicate and found the data to be highly correlated among all replicates (\nr\n2\n=0.99;\nsupplementary Fig. S1\n; see online supplementary material at\nwww.liebertpub.com\n).\n\nData and statistical analysis\nFor the global methylation analysis to compare the neuron (+) and glia (-) cells, a simple paired\nt\ntest was applied. For identification of differentially methylated cytosine residues in blast versus sham blast samples, we devised a moderated\nt\ntest weighted by sequence coverage. For a given cytosine, let\nbe the methylation levels (between zero and one) of the four samples that were given the blast treatment, and\nfor the sham treatment. Let\ndenote the coverages of the cytosine among the corresponding samples. We first computed the variance\n, where\nand\nare the sample mean of the methylation levels for the blast and sham groups, respectively. We also computed the variation just due to the coverage. First, we modified the methylation level\nby\n, which is a Bayesian estimate of the methylation level with a Jeffreys' prior distribution beta (1/2,1/2). From the modified methylation level, a simple estimate of the variance just due to the coverage can be obtained by using the binomial distribution\n, which is very close to the variance for the posterior Bayesian distribution if we had started with the prior Beta (1/2,1/2) distribution. The full Bayesian treatment is omitted here for the sake of simplicity. The t-test is computed by\n.\nDifferentially methylated sites using an a priori selected significance threshold (\np\n\u22640.005) were then mapped to annotated genes in the rat genome via the Homer software\n41\nto determine overlapping genes and associated regulatory regions. Genes thus identified were then used in gene ontology and pathway analysis.\n\nGene ontology and pathway analysis\nDifferentially methylated CpG sites among blast and sham blast controls were mapped to refSeq gene annotations, and these genes were then used for subsequent ontology analyses. The gene lists thus generated were examined to elucidate biological functions and pathways that may be involved in TBI-related neuropathology using QIAGEN's Ingenuity\n\u00ae\nPathways Analysis (IPA)\n\u00ae\n, (QIAGEN, Redwood City) software (\nwww.ingenuity.com\n), utilizing an unsupervised analysis. Functional analyses for the datasets were run to display the most significant biological functions across the dataset that meet a\np\nvalue cutoff of 0.05 (corrected for multiple testing via the Benjamini-Hochberg method).\n41\nFor ease of visualization, the top 20 functions are displayed. A second functional analysis on the data was performed that was restricted to CNS-related cell and tissue lines. From these analyses, also, the most significant canonical pathways and their interactions were identified. Data presented from the canonical pathways are representative of the canonical pathway at the cellular level, depicting our differentially methylated genes with other associated genes/proteins, their interactions, and the cellular and metabolic reactions in which the pathway is involved."

    "Methods": "Data source\nThe data used in this study were obtained from the complete National Health Insurance (NHI) claim database in Taiwan for the period 2000 to 2003. The NHI program has been implemented in Taiwan since 1995, and the coverage rate was 96% of the whole population in 2000 and 97% at the end of 2003 (i.e., more than 21.9 million persons). It should be noted that the rationale for using the NHI database after 2000 is that from January 1, 2000, according to the rules of the Bureau of NHI, NHI claim data have been encoded using the standardized\nInternational Classification of Disease, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification\n(ICD-9-CM). To keep individual information confidential so as to satisfy regulations on personal privacy in Taiwan, all personal identification numbers in the data were encrypted by converting them into scrambled numbers before data processing. This study was exempt from full review by the National Taiwan University Hospital Research Ethics Committee and the need for informed consent was waived because the data used consisted of de-identified secondary data released for research purposes and were analyzed anonymously, thus complying with the regulations of the Department of Health, Executive Yuan, Republic of China.\n\nStudy subjects and design\nWe used a cohort study design to investigate the effect of SCI on the risk of developing MS. The study population consisted of a SCI group and a non-SCI group, both selected from Taiwanese residents in the complete NHI claim database in 2001, in which more than 21.6 million persons were registered. To control for potential confounding effects of an imbalance in measured baseline characteristics, we used propensity score matching to create comparable cohorts of patients with and without SCI.\n10\n,\n11\nThe SCI group consisted of subjects ages 20 to 90 years who had received a diagnosis of SCI (ICD-9-CM codes 806, 952) in ambulatory medical care visits between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2001. To maximize case ascertainment, only patients who had at least two ambulatory visits with the diagnosis of SCI in this period were initially considered for inclusion in the SCI group (\nn\n=11,976). The index visit was defined as the first ambulatory visit in 2001 during which a diagnosis of SCI was recorded. Subjects with a previous diagnosis of MS (ICD-9-CM codes 340) before the index visit (\nn\n=13) were excluded. A total of 11,963 subjects was enrolled at this stage in the SCI group.\nInformation about the pre-existing comorbidities of diabetes (ICD-9-CM code 250), hypertension (ICD-9-CM codes 401-405), and dyslipidemia (ICD-9-CM code 272) was acquired by tracking all the ambulatory medical care and inpatient records in the NHI database in the year before the index visit. The case ascertainment for these medical comorbidities was defined on the basis of \u22651 hospital discharge or \u22652 ambulatory visits with a relevant diagnosis code.\nSince previous studies have suggested that the risk of MS may be affected by socioeconomic status, such as geographical region,\n12\n,\n13\nlevel of urbanization,\n14\nand income level,\n15\nthese factors also were included as variables in assessing the risk of MS. Information about the place of residence of each subject was obtained from the population household registry and the location was classified as Northern, Central, Eastern, or Southern Taiwan. As recommended by the Taiwan National Health Research Institute,\n16\nurbanization levels in Taiwan were initially classified into seven strata, with level 1 referring to \u201cmost urbanized\u201d and level 7 to \u201cleast urbanized\u201d communities; however, since the numbers of subjects in levels 5, 6, and 7 were relatively small, these three levels were merged into a single group labeled level 5.\nFor information on income level, we used the insured payroll-related amount as a proxy for income, with levels of New Taiwan dollar (NT$)0, NT$1-NT$15,840, NT$15,841-NT$25,000, and\u2265NT$25,001. We selected NT$15840 as the first cutoff point of income level because this is the government-stipulated minimum wage for full-time employees in Taiwan. Since household registry information was not available for 50 of the 11,963 subjects in the SCI group, these 50 subjects were excluded from the analysis, leaving 11,913 subjects in the final SCI group.\nThe non-SCI group was taken from the remaining subjects without a diagnosis of SCI in the same 2001 NHI claim database. The first ambulatory medical care visit during 2001 was assigned as the index visit. The exclusion criteria for recruiting subjects into the non-SCI group were: 1) a previous diagnosis of SCI (ICD-9-CM codes 806, 952) before the index visit; 2) a previous diagnosis of MS (ICD-9-CM codes 340) before the index visit; and 3) a previous diagnosis of stroke (ICD-9-CM codes 430-438), traumatic brain injury (ICD-9-CM codes 801-804 or 850-854), anterior horn cell disease (ICD-9-CM codes 335), or Alzheimer's disease (ICD-9-CM codes 331.0) before the index visit. Information about pre-existing co-morbidities and socioeconomic status was obtained as described above.\nBecause the number of subjects in the NHI database is very large, we used a two-stage method.\n17\nFor each subject in the SCI group, we first randomly sampled 40 age- and sex-matched non-SCI subjects who met the above criteria, giving a total of 476,520 non-SCI subjects. In the second stage, a logistic regression model including age, sex, pre-existing co-morbidities, and socioeconomic status as covariates was used to predict the probability (i.e., propensity score) of SCI. An 8-to-1 digit greedy matching algorithm\n10\nwas then used to identify five matched controls from the non-SCI subjects for each SCI patient according to the propensity score, resulting in a total of 59,565 subjects in the propensity score-matched non-SCI group.\n\nOutcome\nAll the ambulatory medical care records and inpatient records for each subject in the propensity score\u2013matched SCI and non-SCI groups from their index visit till the end of 2003 were retrieved and mortality data for the subjects who died during follow-up were obtained from the national mortality registry. The date of the first occurrence of a diagnosis of MS (ICD-9-CM codes 340) within the follow-up period was defined as the primary endpoint. The case ascertainment for MS required \u22651 hospital discharge or \u22652 ambulatory medical care visits with a diagnosis of MS made by a neurologist. All subjects were followed from the index visit to the first occurrence of MS, death, or end of follow-up (whichever occurred first).\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe chi-square test and Student's\nt\n-test were used to examine differences in demographic variables, comorbid medical disorders, and propensity score between the SCI and non-SCI groups. The standardized difference method was used to assess covariate balance after propensity score matching; this method is preferred to hypothesis testing methods, as it does not depend on sample size.\n18\nAn absolute standardized difference of 0 for a covariate indicates no between-group imbalance for that covariate and values<0.1 indicate an inconsequential imbalance.\n19\nIncidence rates of MS were calculated as the number of incident MS cases divided by the MS-free person-years. Stratified Cox proportional hazard regression with the patients matched by propensity score was used to estimate the effect of SCI on occurrence of MS. An alpha level of 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses. The analyses were performed using SAS 9.2 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC)."

    "Methods": "Study design\nThe study aims are pre-specified secondary analyses of a randomized clinical trial. Details of the design and the results of the primary analysis have been reported previously.\n10\nBriefly, participants were randomly assigned to administration of erythropoietin or placebo and to hemoglobin transfusion thresholds of 7 or 10\u2009g/dL in a 2\u00d72 factorial design. An interaction between erythropoietin and transfusion threshold on 6-month neurological outcome was not detected, allowing analysis of all patients in the trial regardless of randomization.\nParticipants with a closed head injury who were not able to follow commands after resuscitation and could be enrolled within 6\u2009h of injury were recruited from two level 1 trauma centers. Patients were excluded if their Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was three with fixed and dilated pupils, had penetrating trauma, pregnancy, life-threatening systemic injuries, or severe pre-existing disease. Transfusion of leukoreduced packed red blood cells was used to maintain the assigned hemoglobin threshold.\nA standard management protocol that included control of ICP to less than 20\u2009mm Hg, maintenance of MAP at least 80\u2009mm Hg, and CPP at least 60\u2009mm Hg was followed throughout the study (details in\nAppendix 1\n, Robertson and associates\n10\n). The PbtO\n2\nprobe was placed when possible in an area of injured brain, or in the right frontal white matter when the injury was diffuse. The goal for PbtO\n2\nwas at least 10\u2009mm Hg, and a standard algorithm was followed to treat episodes of brain tissue hypoxia.\n11\n\nData analysis\nStatistical analyses were conducted on an intent-to-treat basis (two patients who were assigned to the 7\u2009g/dL transfusion threshold were mistakenly treated as if they were in the 10\u2009g/dL group, and there were no crossovers between the randomized groups), and statistical significance was determined by a two-sided\np\nvalue of<0.05 for all analyses with the exception of interaction terms (<0.15). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare continuous measures that were not normally distributed among the transfusion threshold groups. Chi-square or Fisher exact test was used to compare categorical variables, when appropriate. The effect of the transfusion threshold group on dichotomous and continuous outcomes among subgroups was tested by including the subgroup\u00d7threshold group term in a logistic and linear regression model, respectively.\nThe generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach was used to compare continuous hemodynamic measures over time until 250\u2009h after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) among the transfusion threshold groups, adjusting for death. This method is an extension of generalized linear models for analyzing longitudinal data. The threshold group coefficient term can be interpreted as a measure of the difference in the hemodynamic measure between the threshold groups at ICU admission. The threshold-by-time (hour after ICU admission) coefficient can be interpreted as a measure of the difference in slope over time in the hemodynamic measure among the transfusion threshold groups.\nBecause of the nonlinearity of the data, we fit a restricted cubic spline function (\nSupplementary Appendix 1\n; see online supplementary material at http:/www.liebertpub.com) to the hour after ICU admission with 5 degrees of freedom: two boundary knots at 0 and 250\u2009h, and four internal knots at the 20th, 40th, 60th, and 80th quantiles of hour for ICP and CPP outcomes. The test for nonlinearity was conducted by comparing the Quasi-likelihood Information Criterion (QIC) for models with and without the spline parameters.\n12\nSimilarly, QIC was used to choose the working correlation structure.\nBecause monitoring was invasive, hemodynamic data were not usually collected if the patient went to the operating room or after the ICP had stabilized. Ignoring the missing values or assuming that they are missing at random can potentially bias the results. Therefore, we multiply imputed missing ICP and MAP values and used the Rubin formula\n13\nto combine the GEE coefficient estimates. CPP was calculated from the imputed ICP and MAP values. A single multivariate Wald\np\nvalue was calculated for the spline terms, and the confidence intervals (CIs) were omitted for the spline coefficients because of the uninterpretability of the individual spline components.\nWhen hourly monitoring was being conducted but a single hour had a missing value, the value was linearly interpolated using the adjacent hour's values. For patients who were removed from monitoring because of their values being stabilized, missing values were imputed from a normal distribution with the mean and standard deviation of the patients' nonmissing values in the last 12\u2009h of monitoring. If the patient had fewer than five nonmissing values in the preceding period, we took a random sample of patients who also had monitoring removed because of stabilized ICP, pooled their values 12\u2009h before their last observation, and computed the mean and standard deviation (SD) from this sample to impute values from a normal distribution with this mean and SD. Similarly, the mean and SD of values just before a patient went to the operating room for elevated ICP was used to sample missing values for similar patients.\nCox regression analyses were performed to determine whether or not transfusion threshold assignment increased the risk of death adjusted for enrollment motor Glasgow Coma Scale score. Censoring time was defined as date of withdrawal, death, or patient status at 6 months after injury, whichever occurred first. The proportional hazards assumption was examined using Schoenfeld residual plots, and we tested for a treatment by time (time-dependent) interaction. Because the proportional hazards assumption of the Cox model for mortality was violated, we fit a piecewise proportional hazards model in two separate time intervals, dichotomized at day 3, adjusting for enrollment motor GCS score. Day 3 was not a pre-specified hypothesis but was chosen as the time separating the two intervals based on maximizing the log partial likelihood. All analyses were conducted using R version 2.13.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)."

    "Methods": "Patient selection\nControl subjects were employees, volunteers, visitors, and patients at the Bellevue Hospital Center (New York, NY) recruited in accord with institutional review board policy. Inclusion criteria were age 7\u201376 years, vision correctable to within 20/50 bilaterally, intact ocular motility, and ability to provide a complete ophthalmologic, medical, and neurological history as well as medications/drugs/alcohol consumed within the 24\u2009h before tracking. Exclusion criteria were history of: strabismus, diplopia, palsy of cranial nerves III, IV, or VI, papilledema, optic neuropathy, macular edema, retinal degeneration, dementia or cognitive impairment, hydrocephalus, sarcoidosis, myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis, or other demyelinating disease. Pregnant individuals and prisoners were excluded from the study as were subjects who were missing eyes, not opening eyes, or wearing excessive mascara/false eyelashes. Subjects reporting any minor brain injury regardless of loss of consciousness (LOC) within the previous week were also excluded from participating as controls.\nAll trauma patients were recruited from the Bellevue Hospital emergency services (emergency room [ER] and trauma bay), trauma service, and neurosurgery service. They were between the ages of 18 and 60, subject to the same exclusion requirements as controls, consentable and able/willing to participate in the study. Some patients were observed in the ER for up to 3 days, whereas others were recruited from the inpatient services.\nBoth positive and negative head CT patients needed to have obtained a CT scan of the head before consideration for study enrollment. Trauma exclusion criteria included patients suffering burns, anoxic injury, or multiple/extensive injuries resulting in any medical, surgical, or hemodynamic instability. Positive head CT was defined as final CT scan reading (by an attending physician radiologist) demonstrating the presence of hemorrhage (subdural, epidural, subarachnoid, or intraparenchymal), brain contusion, or full-thickness skull fracture consistent with acute brain injury. Positive head CT patients were considered eligible for recruitment for up to 2 weeks after injury or surgery as long as they exhibited evidence of not yet being fully recovered from the brain injury (e.g., were still hospitalized). No positive head CT patients were recruited preoperatively; they either had nonsurgical injuries or were recruited postsurgically.\nCriteria for obtaining a head CT in the ER and trauma bay were based on an amalgamation of Canadian\n9\nand New Orleans Criteria,\n10\nin accord with the judgment of the individual examining physician responsible for the care of the patient. All aspects of patient care, including interpretation of radiology films, were rendered by personnel blinded to the results of eye-tracking research. Research subjects were not told about the findings of their eye-tracking studies. Research personnel conducting the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 3 (SCAT3) assessments were able to view eye-tracking trajectories to ensure that the study was done, but did not view individual metrics associated with the study.\nNegative head CT patients were defined as having no signs of structural injury on imaging; however, complaining of brain injury symptoms, such as headache, dizziness, cognitive impairment, and so on, as manifested by at least one of the following: LOC for any amount of time <30\u2009min; any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the accident; any alteration in mental state at the time of accident (i.e., feeling dazed, disoriented, or confused); and focal neurological deficit(s) that may or may not be transient.\nNon-head-injured was defined as patients who had sustained trauma, but did not meet ER/trauma bay criteria for obtaining a CT scan of the brain. Additional exclusion criteria for this group were: complaining of brain injury symptoms, such as headache, dizziness, cognitive impairment, and so on, as manifested by at least one of the following: any period of LOC; any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the accident; any alteration in mental state at the time of accident (i.e., feeling dazed, disoriented, or confused); and focal neurological deficit(s) that may or may not be transient.\n\nVisual stimulus\nWe recorded subjects' eye movements with an Eyelink 1000 eye tracker at a fixed distance of 55\u2009cm from a computer monitor over a time period of 220\u2009sec. Subjects were seated in either a height-adjustable or height-fixed chair or bed, with the monitor height adjusted to the subject. The tracker chinrest was attached to the monitor. The visual stimuli were the music videos Shakira Waka-Waka, K'naan Wavin\u2019 Flag, the Under the Sea song from the Little Mermaid, \u201cI Just Can't Wait to be King\u201d from the Lion King, Puss in Boots (soundtrack), Michael Jackson's \u201cMan in the Mirror,\u201d or Shankar Ehsan Loy \u201cBhumbroo.\u201d The video was played continuously in a square aperture with an area approximately one eighth the screen size while moving clockwise along the outer edges of the monitor for five complete cycles of 40\u2009sec each. The first and last 10\u2009sec of each data set were discarded to yield 200\u2009sec of data. The afferent stimulus was presented binocularly, and eye tracking was performed binocularly. Subjects were not spatially calibrated to the tracker to enable independent analysis of each pupil position over time.\n\nData analysis\nThe eye tracker sampled pupil position at 500\u2009Hz, yielding 100,000 samples over 200\u2009sec. We created scatter plots of the entire time series by plotting the 100,000 (x,y) pairs representing the two orthogonal components of the instantaneous angle of pupil reflection over time to create \u201cbox trajectories\u201d that reflected the temporal nature of the pupillary movement. Two hundred data points before and after each blink were removed before creating the measures of disconjugacy and aspect ratio to limit noise in the data from the blink event.\n\nAnalysis of gaze disconjugacy\nComparing the movement of one eye of a subject to the other eye of a subject was performed by comparing the x,y Cartesian coordinates at any time point t, for example, by subtracting the x coordinate of the left eye from the x coordinate of the right eye or vice versa; also, by subtracting the y coordinate of the left eye from the y coordinate of the right eye or vice versa. The sums of the differences between all of the x coordinates over the time tested informs regarding horizontal movement of the pupil. The sums of the differences in y coordinates over time informs regarding vertical movement of the pupil. The total sum of the differences between both x and y coordinates over the time tested can be summed to obtain a measure of total disconjugacy of gaze, or as an average of five eyebox trajectory cycles formulaically represented as follows:\nwhere X\nijk\nrefers to the x coordinate of the pupil, and k refers to the left or right eye of a subject. In cases where a subject's data were missing at any given time point in the five cycles (including blinks), the denominator of the equation was the number of cycles where the data were present. The difference in the x and y position, for the left and right eye, may then be computed. This vector of difference may then be plotted graphically for purposes of assessment and interpretation. To have a single metric expressing the level of pupil disconjugation, a variance of the data may be computed with respect to an expected mean of zero. This is significant because the code assumes that a healthy subject has zero vertical or horizontal pupil position difference between each eye. The variance for either horizontal (x) or vertical (substitute y for x) movement may be computed as follows:\nThe total variance in both the horizontal and vertical planes may be computed as follows:\nThe variance in x, y, and the total variance may be plotted in order to assess the amount of disconjugacy present in a subject.\n\nStatistical analyses\nData analysis was performed using R (version 3.0.3; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and SAS statistical software (version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). A\np\nvalue of<0.05 after being adjusted for multiple comparisons was deemed statistically significant.\nKruskal-Wallis' test was used to compare age, eye-tracking parameters, symptom severity score, and Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC) score across groups. A significant result indicated a difference between at least two of the groups.\np\nvalues adjusted for multiple comparisons were obtained using the bootstrap method,\n11\n,\n12\na resampling-based multiple testing method for correlated variables. Multiple pair-wise comparisons for eye-tracking parameters, symptom severity score, and SAC were made using Wilcoxon's two-sample tests.\np\nvalues were first adjusted by bootstrap method for correlated variables and then adjusted by Bonferroni's method for multiple testing within a single variable.\nLinear regression was performed to find the relationship between tracking metrics and SAC as well as the relationship between tracking metrics and the symptom checklist of SCAT3.\np\nvalues were adjusted using the bootstrap method."

    "Methods": "Injury\nAll procedures were approved by the Washington University Animal Studies Committee and are consistent with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines for the care and use of animals. Six-week-old C57BL/6J male mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) weighing 18\u201322\u2009g were used in these experiments. Mice were sacrificed at three different time points: 24\u2009h, 7 days, and 28 days (n=20 for each time point). For each time point, four mice underwent Sham injury and 16 mice underwent CCC.\n29\nThe mice were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane at induction, followed by maintenance at 2% isoflurane for the duration of the procedure. The head was shaved, and head holders were used to stabilize the head within the stereotaxic frame (MyNeurolab, St. Louis, MO). Then, a single 5-mm craniotomy was performed by an electric drill on the left lateral side of the skull centered 2.7\u2009mm lateral from the midline and 3\u2009mm anterior to lambda. The 3-mm electromagnetic impactor tip was then aligned with the craniotomy site at 1.2\u2009mm left of midline, 1.5\u2009mm anterior to the lambda suture. The impact was then delivered at 2-mm depth. The head holders were released immediately after the injury. At the time of injury, animals were randomized to either a loose fitting plastic cap (Open, n=8 for each time point) or replacement of the previously removed bone flap (Closed, n=8 for each time point) secured over the craniotomy with Vetbond (3M, St. Paul, MN) after injury. Animals randomized to the Sham group also received a bone flap to cover the craniotomy site similar to the Closed group. The skin was closed with interrupted sutures and treated with antibiotic ointment before removing the mouse from anesthesia and allowing it to recover on a warming pad.\n\nICP monitoring\nAll mice in the 24\u2009h and 7 day time points underwent parenchymal ICP monitoring. A single small (0.9\u2009mm) burr hole for ICP monitoring was made 2.5\u2009mm to the right of midline and 2.5\u2009mm anterior to lambda before the craniotomy for CCI. ICP measurements were performed with a 1.4F solid-state pressure transducer (Millar, Houston, TX) stereotaxically introduced through the previously described burr hole until an ICP waveform with cardiopulmonary variability was observed (approximate depth of 0.5\u2009mm). Measurements were performed after craniotomy, 15\u2009min after CCI, and either 24\u2009h or 7 days after injury. Mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and were secured in the stereotaxic frame for all measurements. Mice were continuously monitored for 5\u2009min at each time point. Using LabChart (AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO), a mean ICP for each 5\u2009min monitoring period was calculated. The burr hole for ICP monitoring was sealed with Vetbond before skin closure. For ICP measurements at 24\u2009h and 7 days after injury, the same burr hole was reaccessed using the same 0.9\u2009mm drill bit without removing the Vetbond.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nMice were sacrificed under isoflurane anesthesia by transcardial perfusion with 0.3% heparin in phosphate buffered saline. Whole brains were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48\u2009h, followed by equilibration in 30% sucrose for at least 48\u2009h before sectioning. Serial coronal slices 50-\u03bcm thick were cut on a freezing microtome starting with the appearance of a complete corpus callosum and caudally to bregma \u22123.08\u2009mm. Sets of 12 sections spaced every 300\u2009\u03bcm were mounted on glass slides and used for immunohistochemical studies. Staining was performed on free-floating sections washed in tris buffered saline (TBS) between applications of primary and secondary antibodies. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked by incubating the tissue in TBS+3% hydrogen peroxide for 10\u2009min. Normal goat serum (3%) in TBS with 0.25% Triton X (TBS-X) was used to block nonspecific staining for all antibodies. Slices were then further blocked with 1% goat serum in TBS and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with one of the following primary antibodies: polyclonal rabbit anti-\u03b2-APP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or polyclonal rabbit anti-neurofilament-200 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at concentrations of 1:1000 or polyclonal rabbit anti-NeuN (Millipore, Billerica, MA) at a concentration of 1:4000. Biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies in TBS-X were used at a 1:1000 concentration to detect bound primary antibodies. Colorization was achieved using the Vectastain ABC Elite Kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) followed by the application of 3-3\u2032 diaminobenzidine.\n\nStereology\nStereological analysis was performed on StereoInvestigator software version 8.2 (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT). Assessments were made by an investigator blinded to the injury group. The optical fractionator function was used to quantify target markers per cubic millimeter of tissue. A grid size of 250\u2009\u03bcm\u00d7250\u2009\u03bcm, a counting frame of 40\u2009\u03bcm\u00d740\u2009\u03bcm, and a dissector height of 15\u2009\u03bcm with a guard zone of 5\u2009\u03bcm were used for all quantifications, resulting in 3% of the region of interest (ROI) being randomly sampled. All ROI were traced at 4X magnification, and markers were counted at 60X magnification. The ipsilateral corpus callosum and external capsule spanning 12 sections were used as the ROI for the \u03b2-APP and neurofilament-200 (NF200) stains. This region was defined as the white matter area between midline and the lateral edge of the cingulum in rostral sections; in caudal sections, a horizontal line drawn laterally from the end of the fimbria served as the end boundary of the ROI. Injured axons were identified by \u03b2-APP-positive varicosities greater than 5\u2009\u03bcm. Similarly, NF200-positive axonal varicosities greater than 5\u2009\u03bcm in diameter were counted as injured axons during stereological assessment. Gunderson coefficients of error were <0.1 for both \u03b2-APP and NF200 quantifications. For quantification of NeuN positive cells, the CA3 region of the ipsilateral hippocampus was used as the ROI from the same 12 sections as described above. Intact neurons were identified as cell bodies with NeuN-positive nuclei. This ensured the Gunderson coefficient of error was <0.1.\n\nWhite matter volume quantification\nThe ipsilateral corpus callosum and external capsule spanning 12 sections were used as the ROI for white matter volume quantification at 1 month after injury. This region was defined as the white matter area between midline and the lateral edge of the cingulum in rostral sections, and in caudal sections, a horizontal line drawn laterally from the end of the fimbria served as the end boundary of the ROI. White matter volume estimation was performed using the Cavalieri method.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data were analyzed using Prism 6.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The results are presented as mean\u00b1standard deviation. For all data sets, there was no evidence for significant deviations from normal distribution (\np\n>0.05 by Shapiro-Wilk tests). ICP measurements were analyzed with a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Significant main effects on animal group were subjected to\npost hoc\nanalysis with Tukey tests with a significance level of\np\n<0.05. Quantitative histologic data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey tests for multiple comparisons with a significance level of\np\n<0.05. Spearman correlation was used to assess the correlation between peak ICP measurements (15\u2009min post-injury) and neuropathology at 1 day and 1 week post-injury time points."

    "Methods": "Study design\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of Medicare administrative claims data from 2006\u20132010 to describe depression treatment patterns and quantify differences in the prevalence of depression treatment between Medicare beneficiaries with a new diagnosis of depression after hospital discharge for TBI and a pre-TBI cohort of Medicare beneficiaries with a new diagnosis of depression. The pre-TBI cohort comprised Medicare beneficiaries in whom depression developed during the study period but before hospitalization for TBI. Medicare beneficiaries who experience TBI have a greater burden of comorbid illness compared with the average Medicare beneficiary.\n27\nThis unique study design allowed comparison of two cohorts with similar demographic and clinical characteristics.\n\nData source\nMedicare administrative data obtained from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Chronic Condition Data Warehouse (CCW) were the primary sources of data for this study. Medicare is a federal health insurance program in the United States that covers 93% of persons aged 65 and older. Part A covers hospitalizations, skilled nursing facility (SNF) stays under 101 days, home health, and hospice care. Part B covers most outpatient care. Part D covers prescription medications. Part C, also known as Medicare Advantage, allows private insurers to provide Medicare benefits, typically with Parts A, B, and D bundled together. The percentage of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan increased from 16% to 24% during the study period.\n28\n\nStudy sample\nWe used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) case definition for TBI, which previously has been reported to have a sensitivity of 89% to detect severe TBI and a positive predictive value of 93% to correctly identify TBI-related hospitalizations.\n29\n,\n30\nThe dataset comprised all Medicare beneficiaries with a hospital discharge diagnosis of TBI (\nInternational Classification of Disease, 9th Revision Clinical Modification\n[ICD-9CM] codes 800.xx, 801.xx, 803.xx, 804.xx, 850.xx- 854.1x, 950.1-950.3, 959.01) in any position on an inpatient claim between 1/1/2006 and 12/31/2010. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Maryland, Baltimore.\nInclusion criteria were: age \u226565 years at the time of TBI, 6 months of continuous Medicare Parts A and B with no Part C (Medicare Advantage) coverage before hospitalization for TBI, no depression diagnosis recorded in Medicare claims before the start of the study period (1/1/2006), 12 months of continuous Medicare Parts A and B with no Part C coverage before first depression diagnosis, and 6 months continuous Part D coverage with no antidepressant use before first depression diagnosis. The last two criteria were applied to isolate newly diagnosed depression so that we could compare antidepressant usage patterns during the year after first diagnosis of depression. Beneficiaries with a Medicare Advantage plan were excluded because these plans are not required to file claims for medical services.\nThe CCW contains information on 27 comorbid conditions including depression.\n31\nThe CCW contains an annual flag for each condition meeting CCW-defined criteria for that year as well as the date of first diagnosis. Only one date of first diagnosis is noted regardless of how many diagnoses have been made. Depression is defined in the CCW by the presence of any of the following ICD-9 codes: 296.20, 296.21, 296.22, 296.23, 296.24, 296.25, 296.26, 296.30, 296.31, 296.32, 296.33, 296.34, 296.35,296.36, 296.51, 296.52, 296.53, 296.54, 296.55, 296.56, 296.60, 296.61, 296.62, 296.63, 296.64, 296.65, 296.66, 296.89, 298.0, 300.4, 309.1, or 311 in any position on any inpatient, SNF, home health care, hospice, or Carrier (outpatient) claim.\nWe created two nonoverlapping cohorts of beneficiaries: those in whom depression developed during the study period but before experiencing a TBI and those in whom depression developed post-TBI. We defined incident depression pre-TBI as the date of first diagnosis of depression occurring after the start of the study period (1/1/2006) and before the hospital admission date for TBI. We defined incident depression post-TBI as the date of first diagnosis of depression occurring after the hospital discharge date for TBI but before the end of the study period (12/31/10).\n\nAntidepressant medications\nWe searched for antidepressant medications in the Medicare Part D prescription drug events file and defined antidepressant therapy as a medication prescription event involving at least one of the medications listed below. We initially created seven categories of antidepressant medications: (1) SSRI (citalopram, escitalopram, escitalopram oxalate, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline); (2) TCAs (amitriptyline, amoxapine, clomipramine, desipramine, doxepin, imipramine, nortriptyline, protriptyline, and trimipramine); (3) serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, and venlafaxine); (4) monoamine oxidase inhibitors (isocarboxazid, phenelzine, and tranylcypromine); (5) phenylpiperazine antidepressants (nefazodone and trazodone); (6) tetracyclic antidepressants (maprotiline and mirtazapine), and (7) buproprion.\nSSRIs accounted for more than 75% of the antidepressants in our sample; therefore, we created an \u201cother antidepressant\u201d (OAD) category composed of all antidepressants except SSRIs. We also created an \u201cany\u201d antidepressant variable. We divided beneficiary follow-up time into 30-day periods starting the date of depression diagnosis, and recorded filled prescriptions and proportion of days covered (number of daily doses in the prescription/number of days in the period) for all antidepressants in each 30-day period with Part D coverage. Because some prescriptions are written for 90 rather than 30 days, it is possible for a beneficiary to have no prescription fills during a period but still have a proportion of days covered by that prescription greater than zero.\nAntidepressant use during each 30-day period post-depression diagnosis was defined as either a filled prescription for an antidepressant or a proportion of days covered by an antidepressant greater than 0. Missing antidepressant information could result from a lapse in Medicare Part D coverage or SNF or hospital stays. We did not require Medicare Part D coverage in each period, but rather report prevalence of antidepressant use as a percentage of the number of depression cases in each 30-day period without missing data.\nWe were interested in comparing antidepressant management of depression between a cohort of beneficiaries with a diagnosis of depression post-TBI and a pre-TBI incident depression cohort with similar demographic and clinical characteristics. Beneficiaries with a diagnosis of depression during the study period but before the TBI hospitalization formed an excellent comparison group. To maintain independence of the cohorts, beneficiaries with a diagnosis of depression pre-TBI were no longer followed once they were hospitalized for TBI.\nDepression diagnoses occurred at different times during the study period. To accurately report antidepressant use among incident depression patients, we created a person-month file with an indicator variable for incident depression pre- or post-TBI and an indicator for diagnosis of depression in each 30-day period (1 month).\n\nNonpharmacological management of depression\nWe searched Medicare Parts A & B claims for events associated with non-pharmacologic management of depression and created two variables representing treatment: hospitalization and psychotherapy. We identified hospitalizations with a primary diagnosis of depression using ICD-9 codes 296.2x, 296.3x, or 311.xx. We identified admission to psychiatric hospitals using provider identification codes and admission to a psychiatric unit using revenue center codes (0114, 0124, 0134, 0144, 0154, 0204). For psychiatric hospital and psychiatric unit stays, we further required a primary or a secondary diagnosis of depression. We combined the three types of hospitalizations (inpatient admission with depression diagnosis, psychiatric hospital admission, and admission to the psychiatric unit) into a variable indicating any psychiatric hospitalization.\nWe used provider specialty (26,27,62,68,86) and current procedural terminology (CPT) codes (90804\u201390829, 90845,90847, 90849, 90853, 90857, 90865, 90870, G0409, G0410, G0411) to identify mental health services/psychotherapy in any location (inpatient, outpatient, SNF, hospice, or home health). We merged all treatment events into our person-month file. Finally, we created an indicator variable for \u201cany\u201d treatment of depression, which included antidepressants, psychotherapy, or psychiatric hospitalization.\n\nCovariates\nDemographic characteristics were obtained from the CCW enrollment file. Baseline comorbidities at TBI hospitalization were determined using CMS's CCW flagged comorbid conditions.\n31\nThese 27 chronic conditions are identified based on the presence of ICD-9 codes on inpatient, skilled nursing, home health, or outpatient claims using algorithms defined by CMS. If the date of first diagnosis of a particular chronic condition was before the date of depression diagnosis, the patient was considered to have that chronic condition at baseline. TBI hospitalization-associated variables included length of hospital stay and discharge to a SNF.\n\nData analysis\nFollow-up time post-depression diagnosis was divided into 30-day periods as previously explained. Beneficiaries were censored at the date of first TBI (for those diagnosed with depression pre-TBI), death, or the end of the study period.\nWe examined the frequency of baseline and TBI hospitalization-associated characteristics in the total sample and by incident depression status. For each category of antidepressants, we determined the prevalence of antidepressant medication use in each 30-day period over the year after first depression diagnosis among beneficiaries with a diagnosis of depression before and after TBI and report the average monthly prevalence of use. We also examined prevalence of use among individual antidepressant classes. We compared the prevalence of antidepressant use between beneficiaries with a diagnosis of depression pre- and post-TBI and generated\np\nvalues for comparisons using chi-square tests.\nSimilarly, we determined the average monthly prevalence of psychotherapy and any treatment for depression in each 30-day period over the year after first depression diagnosis among beneficiaries with a diagnosis of depression before and after TBI and report the prevalence of treatment. We compared the prevalence of depression treatment between beneficiaries with a diagnosis of depression pre- and post-TBI using chi-square tests.\nTo quantify the effect of TBI on receipt of antidepressant treatment over the year after diagnosis of depression, we used generalized estimating equations with a logistic model to accommodate the correlation between repeated measurements. We used bivariate analysis to identify potential confounders for inclusion in our models. Covariates associated with both the dependent (receipt of treatment for depression) and independent (timing of depression diagnosis) variables at the\np\n<0.001 level were considered for inclusion.\nWe ran separate models for any antidepressant, SSRIs, and OADs. We tested interactions of time since depression diagnosis, age, race, and sex with the independent variable. Similarly, we constructed regression models for psychotherapy and \u201cany\u201d treatment of depression. We conducted sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of our results to deviations from our assumptions. These analyses included limiting to beneficiaries with continuous Part D coverage during follow-up post-depression diagnosis, excluding beneficiaries with any antidepressant use 12 months before diagnosis of depression, and limiting follow-up time post-depression diagnosis to 6 months.\nBecause of large sample size, statistical significance was defined\na priori\nas\np\n<0.001. All analysis was performed with SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC)."

Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Harlan Laboratories (Dublin, VA).\n\nSurgery and behavioral assessment\nEight- to ten-week-old female mice were anesthetized (ketamine/xylazine, 100\u2009mg/15\u2009mg/kg intraperitoneally) before receiving mid-thoracic (T8) contusive spinal cord injuries. Mice received a laminectomy at T8, then the spinal column was stabilized using spinal clamps and positioned on an Infinite Horizon impactor device (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, Lexington, KY). The exposed spinal cord was visually aligned with the impactor tip and given a moderate (75 kDynes) contusion via computer-controlled delivery. All SCI mice received fluid supplements (Lactated Ringer's solution, 1\u2009mL; Hospira, Inc., Lake Forest, IL), antibiotics (Baytril, Norbrook Laboratories Limited, Newry, Northern Ireland; 10\u2009mg/kg), and analgesics (buprenorphine, 0.05\u2009mg/kg) subcutaneously for the first week (twice per day) following surgery. Twice daily bladder expressions continued for the duration of the study.

Lactated Ringer's solution (3\u2009mL), and the same doses of Baytril and buprenorphine as described above were administered subcutaneously immediately post-surgery and then twice a day for 7\u2009d. Twice-daily bladder expressions were performed until end of the study. All procedures were in accordance with University of Miami Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and National Institutes of Health guidelines.\n\nHistology\nMice or rats were perfused transcardially with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains and spinal cords were harvested, post-fixed for 2\u2009h and placed in 10%, 20%, 30% sucrose gradient overnight. An 8-mm mouse or 12-mm rat spinal segment centered at the injury site was embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature compound compound (Tissue-Tek, Sakura Finetek USA, Inc., Torrance, CA) and sectioned on a cryostat. Sagittal or horizontal sections were cut serially at 10\u2009\u03bcm and immunostained in PBS-0.3% TritonX-100 for mouse fibronectin (Millipore, Billerica, MA; AB2033, 1:500) or rat fibronectin (Millipore AB1954, 1:500), integrin \u03b15\u03b21 (Millipore MAB1984, 1:250), platelet-derived growth factor \u03b2 (PDGFR-\u03b2; Abcam, Cambridge, MA; AB32570, 1:200), CD11b (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY; RM2800, 1:500), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; Invitrogen 130300, 1:2000 or Abcam ab4674, 1:500), NeuN (Millipore MAB377, 1:300), Olig2 (Millipore AB9610, 1:250), RFP (red fluorescent protein; Rockland, Limerick, PA; 600-401-379S, 1:2000) and green fluorescent protein (GFP; Abcam, Cambridge, MA; ab13970, 1:1,000).

A 4-mm spinal segment centered at the injury site was dissected and meninges removed. Spinal cord tissues were then chopped into 100-\u03bcm slices using a McIlwain Tissue Chopper (Stoelting Co., Redding, CH) and lysed using a deoxycholate (DOC) extraction protocol as previously described.\n22\nChopped tissue in freshly prepared 2% DOC lysis buffer (2% DOC, 20mM Tris.Cl, 2mM EDTA, 2mM iodoacetic acid, 2mM N-ethylmaleimide, 2mM PMSF) was passed through a 25G needle and centrifuged (4\u00b0C, 15,000g) to obtain DOC-soluble (supernatant) and DOC-insoluble (pellet) components. The DOC-insoluble pellet was solubilized in freshly prepared 1% SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 20mM Tris.Cl, 2mM EDTA, 2mM iodoacetic acid, 2mM N-ethylmaleimide, 2mM PMSF) and centrifuged (room temperature, 15,000\u2009g) to obtain supernatant that contained DOC-insoluble ECM. Protein concentration was measured using bicinchoninic acid assay (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Protein sample from individual animals (mixed in \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) were separated on a 4\u201315% Criterion TGX precast gel (Bio-rad, Hercules, CA) and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane that was blocked in 5% milk (in Tris-Buffered Saline and Tween; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) TBS-T and incubated in rabbit anti-fibronectin antibody (Millipore AB2033, 1:2000) overnight at 4\u00b0C.\nThe next day, membranes were washed and incubated in appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA; 1:50,000) and detected using chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal West Pico Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and exposed to film. To control for loading variations, transferred PVDF membranes were incubated in 0.1% Coomassie blue R250 in 50% methanol/water for 30\u2009min and de-stained in acetic acid/ethanol/water (1:5:4) for 20\u2009min as previously described.\n23\nBand densities were quantified via ImageJ. Destained membrane was dried completely overnight and scanned. Each complete lane was then selected and band densities quantified using ImageJ 1.47v. Densities of fibronectin bands were normalized to densities of Coomassie blue (\nSupplementary Fig. 1\n; see online supplementary material at\nwww.liebertpub.com\n).\n\nqRT-PCR\nMice were anesthetized (see above) and perfused transcardially with cold diethylpyrocarbonate PBS. A 4-mm spinal segment centered at the injury site was dissected and homogenized and total ribonucleic acid (RNA) extracted using Qiagen RNeasy Plus Micro Kit. Total RNA was treated with DNAase (AMPD1; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) synthesized using the Advantage RT-PCR Kit (ClonTech, Mountain View, CA). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) and the Corbett Research RG 3000 thermal cycler (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). A standard curve was generated for each primer pair using serial dilutions of liver cDNA to optimize PCR conditions for each primer set. Expression level of each gene was calculated using the \u0394\u0394Ct method and normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Each sample was tested in triplicates. The primer sequences were: itga5 (forward: GGACCAAGACGGCTACAATGATGT, reverse: ACCTGGGAAGGTTTAGTGCTCAGT), itgb1 (forward: TTCAGACTTCCGCATTGGCTTTGG, reverse: TGGGCTGGTGCAGTTTTGTTCAC), itgav (forward: GGGCCTATTGTTCAGCACAT, reverse: GATTCCACAGCCCAAAGTGT). The primer set for itgb3 was purchased from Qiagen (QT00128849, QuantiTect Primer Assay).\n\nQuantification\nQuantifications of immunohistochemical images were performed by unbiased observers. To quantify the number of \u03b15\u03b21\n+\ncells that are also CD11b\n+\nor GFP\n+\n, co-localized cells were counted in three randomly selected 100\u2009\u03bcm\u00d7100\u2009\u03bcm squares in the GFAP\n-\nregion (fibrotic scar). Only DAPI\n+\ncells were counted. Co-localization was verified using Olympus FV10-ASW 3.0 viewer software to examine each of the ten one-micron Z-stack slices. For each animal, sections including the injury epicenter and two adjacent sagittal sections (spaced 100\u2009\u03bcm apart) were quantified, and the counts from each section were averaged. A total of 150\u2013300 cells per animal were counted.\nQuantification of the lysM\ntdTom\ncells in uninjured tissue were based on co-localization of the tdTomato reporter signal (enhanced using RFP antibody) with the following cell markers: CD11b, NeuN, GFAP and Olig2. Only DAPI\n+\ncells were counted. A total of 150\u2013300 cells per animal were counted across at least three adjacent coronal sections (spaced 100\u2009\u03bcm apart) of the thoracic spinal cord."

    "Methods": "Animal preparation\nAll animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio. Male Sprague Dawley rats (250\u2013350\u2009g) were anesthetized initially with 5% isoflurane mixed with room air, maintained with 2% isoflurane during surgery, and 1.5% during imaging procedures.\nThe experimental design is shown in\nFigure 1\n. Three groups were studied: (1) High-dose Mn\n2+\n(88\u2009mg MnCl\n2\n*4H\n2\nO per kg, n=4), in which a 120\u2009mM MnCl\n2\n*4H\n2\nO solution was administered at 1.8\u2009mL/h over 30\u2009min via tail vein starting 1\u2009h before TBI (day 0), and again on days 1, 6, and 13 after TBI. (2) Low-dose Mn\n2+\n(29\u2009mg MnCl\n2\n*4H\n2\nO per kg, n=6), in which a 40\u2009mM MnCl\n2\n*4H\n2\nO solution was administered at 1.8\u2009mL/h over 30\u2009min at the same time points described in group 1. (3) Vehicle (n=6), in which saline was infused over 30\u2009min and administered at the same time points as in group 1. During the high dose Mn\n2+\ninfusion, heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure were mildly and transiently reduced, whereas during low dose Mn\n2+\ninfusion, the values were within normal ranges. Body temperature (36.5\u201337.5\u00b0C), heart rate (350\u2013450\u2009bpm), and mean arterial blood pressure (120\u2013170\u2009mmHg) during MRI were all within normal ranges.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExperimental design shows behavioral, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and histological measurements as well as the time points of manganese chloride (MnCl\n2\n) or vehicle administration. TBI, traumatic brain injury. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nAfter Mn\n2+\nor vehicle infusion on the day of the TBI (day 0), the animal was secured in a stereotaxic frame and a \u00d85\u2009mm craniotomy was created over the left somatosensory cortex (S1: +0.25\u2009mm anterior and 3.5\u2009mm lateral to bregma), exposing the dura matter. The intact dura matter was impacted using a pneumatic controlled cortical impactor (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, LLC, Fairfax Station, VA) fitted with a \u00d83\u2009mm tip. The impact was induced using 5.0\u2009m/sec, 250\u2009\u03bcs dwell time, and a 1\u2009mm depth to mimic a moderate focal TBI.\n17\nAfter the impact, the cranial opening was sealed with bone wax, the scalp sutured closed, and antibiotic ointment applied along the suture line. The analgesic buprenorphine (0.05\u2009mg/kg) was given subcutaneously every 12\u2009h as needed for pain for 3 days.\nMRI was performed at 1\u20133\u2009h, and 1, 2, 7, and 14 days post-TBI for groups 2 and 2. MRI of group 3 (vehicle) was performed at 2\u2009h, 2, 7, and 14 days post-TBI with an additional MRI performed on day 15. Note that Mn\n2+\nor vehicle was injected via tail vein 30\u2009min before TBI (day 0), and 24\u2009h before MRI on days 1, 6, and 13 for groups 1 and 2 and on days 1, 6, 13, and 14 for group 3 (\nFig. 1\n).\n\nMRI\nMRI studies were performed on a 7 Tesla Pharmascan (Bruker, Billerica, MA). The anesthetized animals were secured in an MRI-compatible stereotaxic holder with ear and tooth bars. A transceiver surface coil of 2\u2009cm in diameter was placed over the intact skull.\n18\nRARE (rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement)\nT2-weighted images were acquired using a fast spin-echo sequence with repetition time (TR)=3\u2009sec (90-degree flip angle), effective echo time (TE)=18, 54, 90, and 126\u2009msec, 4 echo train length, seven 1.0-mm thick coronal images, field of view (FOV)=2.56\u00d72.56\u2009cm, matrix 96\u00d796 and reconstructed to 128\u00d7128, and eight transients for signal averaging. There were no gaps between slices. T2 maps were calculated.\nIR-RARE (Inversion Recovery RARE\nT1-weighted MEMRI images were acquired using an IR-RARE sequence with TR=3\u2009sec, inversion delay (TI)=1\u2009sec, seven 1.0-mm thick coronal images, field of view=2.56\u00d72.56\u2009cm, matrix 128\u00d7128, and four transients for signal averaging. There were no gaps between slices.\nImages were co-registered across time points using QuickVol and MRIAnalysisPak software.\n19\nThe lesion volumes were determined as pixels that had T2 values higher than the mean plus two standard deviations of the value in the homologous contralesional hemisphere.\n20\nT1-weighted signal intensities were analyzed for two (core and surround) regions of interest (ROIs) in the low-dose Mn\n2+\ngroup. The intensities were normalized with respect to the signal intensity of the homologous ROI in the contralateral hemisphere in the same animal. The T1-weighted signal intensity profiles were correlated with behavioral scores. Comparison was also made with the vehicle group.\n\nBehavioral assessment\nSensorimotor function was assessed using the asymmetry forelimb placement (cylinder) test and foot-fault test. Baseline behavioral assessments\n21\nwere made before the induction of TBI and Mn\n2+\ninfusion. Behavioral assessments were also performed before MRI acquisition on days 1, 2, 7, and 14 post-TBI. Behavioral tests were not performed after TBI induction on day 0 because of incomplete recovery from anesthesia.\nThe forelimb asymmetry placement test was performed by placing a rat into a transparent cylinder (20\u2009cm diameter, 30\u2009cm height) for 5\u2009min or until 30 placements were made.\n17\nA mirror positioned under the cylinder enabled a video recorder to see directly into the cylinder. The behavior was scored by counting the number of left or right individual forelimb placements and the number of simultaneous right and left (both) forelimb placements onto the cylinder wall during rearing. The forelimb asymmetry index was calculated as (the number of forelimb placements for each individual limb)+\u00bd (the number of both placements) divided by the total number of placements.\nThe foot fault test was performed\n17\nto assess limb misplacement during locomotion. The rat was placed on an elevated grid floor (e.g., size 18 in\u00d711 in with grid openings of \u223c1.56 in\n2\nand 1 in\n2\n) for 5\u2009min or until 50 steps were taken with one (right) forelimb. The rat was allowed to move freely on the grid, and the total number of steps and the number of foot faults through the grid openings were counted. The percentage of foot faults for each limb was calculated as the number of right or left forelimb foot faults divided by the total number of steps taken with the right forelimb.\n\nHistology\nFor histological correlation with MRI immunohistology for GFAP was assessed immediately after MRI experiments on day 14 post-TBI. The 14-day end-point was chosen based on a subset of studies in which no apparent differences in lesion volumes were observed between 14 and 28 days post-TBI.\nBriefly, selected rats were perfused 14 days post-TBI with ice-cold 5% sucrose in heparinized phosphate buffered saline (PBS), followed by ice-cold 4% buffered paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed and post-fixed for 2\u20135\u2009h at 4\u00b0C and subsequently cryopreserved in 30% sucrose for 2 days. 30-\u03bcm thick coronal sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. Sections were processed using standard immunofluorescent staining against GFAP.\nBriefly, sections were washed with PBS followed by permeabilization using 0.2% Triton X-100 (2\u2009\u03bcl Triton X-100:1\u2009mL PBS). The sections were blocked with 10% goat serum followed by incubation with a primary antibody directed against GFAP diluted in goat serum (1:1000 GenScript Rabbit Anti-GFAP pAb Cat# A01309) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The slides were then washed with PBS and incubated with secondary antibody (1:80 Sigma Aldrich Anti-Rabbit IgG-FITC Antibody Cat# MFCD00162786) for 1\u2009h at 37\u00b0C. Slides were washed and mounted with Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Images were acquired on a Nikon C1si microscope using 10X, 20X, and 60X objectives.\n\nStatistical analysis\nMann-Whitney\nU\ntests were used to compare differences in asymmetrical limb use and the percentage of foot faults between vehicle-and Mn\n2+\n-treated animals. Values are presented as mean\u00b1standard error of the mean. Statistical significance was set at\np\n<0.05."

    "Methods": "Stretchable microelectrode arrays\nDesign, fabrication, and packaging of SMEAs have been described previously in detail.\n37\u201339\nBriefly, thin-film conductors (3\u2009nm of chromium, followed by 75\u2009nm of gold, finished with 3\u2009nm of chromium) were sequentially deposited on a 280-\u03bcm-thick layer of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS; Sylgard 184; Dow Corning, Midland, MI) by electron beam evaporation.\n40\nThe gold thin-film was patterned into recording electrodes and encapsulated with a 15-\u03bcm-thick layer of either PDMS or photo-patternable silicone (WL5150; Dow Corning). Vias were opened in the encapsulation layer to expose the recording electrodes and peripheral contacts. Platinum black was electroplated on the surfaces of the recording electrodes. The SMEA was sandwiched between two printed circuit boards with circular openings for the culture well and to allow incorporation into our\nin vitro\nTBI model.\n41\nThe SMEA featured 28 recording electrodes (feature size, <100\u2009\u03bcm), two reference electrodes, and 30 peripheral contacts (\nFig. 1\n).\n38\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nImages of an SMEA.

Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\n\nOrganotypic slice cultures of the rat hippocampus\nAll animal procedures were approved by the Columbia University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (New York, NY). Before plating organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, SMEAs were made hydrophilic with air-gas plasma treatment (Harrick PDC-32G; Harrick Scientific, Pleasantville, NY) for 90\u2009sec.\n42\nSMEAs were precoated overnight with 80\u2009\u03bcg/mL of laminin (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and 320\u2009\u03bcg/mL of poly-\nl\n-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and then incubated overnight with Neurobasal medium (supplemented with 1\u2009mM of Glutamax, 50\u00d7B27, 4.5\u2009mg/mL of\nd\n-glucose, and 10\u2009mM of HEPES; Life Technologies) in a standard cell-culture incubator (37\u00b0C, 5% CO\n2\n). Brains of postnatal day 8\u201311 Sprague-Dawley rat pups were aseptically removed and the hippocampus cut into 375-\u03bcm-thick slices using a McIlwain tissue chopper (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA), according to published methods.\n41\nHippocampal slice cultures were then plated onto precoated SMEAs and fed every 2\u20133 days with conditioned full-serum medium (Sigma-Aldrich; 50% minimum essential media, 25% Hank's balanced salt solution, 25% heat inactivated horse serum, 1\u2009mM of Glutamax, 4.5\u2009mg/mL of\nd\n-glucose, and 10\u2009mM of HEPES) for 8\u201318 days total. To verify slice culture health before injury, the fluorescent dye, propidium iodide (Life Technologies), was used to stain for dead or injured cells. Unhealthy slice cultures were not included in the study, according to published methods.\n43\n\nMechanical stretch injury of hippocampal slice cultures\nThe\nin vitro\nmodel of mechanical stretch injury has been characterized previously in detail.\n41\n,\n44\nBriefly, after 8\u201318 days\nin vitro\n, media were removed from the SMEA well and the hippocampal slice cultures were mechanically stretched by pulling the SMEA over a rigid, tubular indenter. Slice culture electrophysiological function was then assessed as described below. Induced tissue strain and strain rate were verified with high-speed video analysis of the dynamic stretch injury event. Lagrangian strain was determined by calculating the deformation gradient tensor by locating fiducial markers on the tissue slice image before and at maximal stretch.\n44\n\nAssessment of electrophysiological function\nAt the indicated time point after stretch injury and while still adhered to the SMEA, slice cultures were perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; 125\u2009mM of NaCl, 3.5\u2009mM of KCl, 26\u2009mM of NaHCO\n3\n, 1.2\u2009mM of KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 1.3\u2009mM of MgCl\n2\n, 2.4\u2009mM of CaCl\n2\n, 10\u2009mM of\nd\n-glucose, pH=7.4; Sigma-Aldrich) at 37\u00b0C and aerated with 95% O\n2\n/5% CO\n2\n, as previously described.\n17\nFor experiments involving GABA inhibition, slice cultures were perfused for a minimum of 3\u2009min with bicuculline methiodide (50\u2009\u03bcM; Sigma-Aldrich) in aCSF before recording electrical activity, within 1\u2009h postinjury. Bicuculline was then washed from slice cultures for at least 20\u2009min before returning them to the incubator for follow-up recordings at the indicated time points.\nSpontaneous neural activity was measured by recording continuously for 3\u2009min at a sampling rate of 20\u2009kHz from all electrodes within the hippocampus before injury and at the indicated time point. Raw data were low-pass filtered with a 6-kHz analog, antialiasing filter and passed through a 60-Hz comb filter using a custom MATLAB script (version R2012a; MathWorks, Natick, MA). Consistent with other MEA studies with acute slices, electrodes of SMEAs recorded local field potentials produced by populations of neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, and axons within the local vicinity of individual electrodes.\n45\nNeural event activity was detected based on the multi-resolution Teager energy operator (m-TEO), which identifies epochs of data that contain high energy in specific frequency bands that are indicative of the feature being detected.\n46\nIn this case, the feature was the local field potential of neuronal ensembles recorded by the planar electrodes of the SMEA. The m-TEO was calculated for k=(600, 900, and 1200), and neural events were identified as the onset of those epochs with an m-TEO greater than 0.5 root mean square error (RMSE) above the baseline m-TEO and with a raw signal greater than 1.5 RMSE above the baseline of the raw signal.\n47\nUsing the results from the previous analysis above, which identified the onset time of each neural event on each electrode, the degree of correlation for event trains across electrode pairs was investigated. Spontaneous network synchronization was quantified using previously published methods based on correlation matrix analysis and surrogate resampling for significance testing.\n48\u201350\nCorrelation of neural events was computed to determine an event synchronization measure, the synchronization index, for each electrode pair.\n48\nCorrelated neural events across electrodes were defined as detected neural events that occurred within 1.5\u2009ms of one another.\n47\nFor two electrodes\nx\nand\ny\n, and neural event timing\nand\n(i=1,\u2026, m\nx\n; j=1,\u2026, m\ny\n), the event correlation matrix was calculated by\nEquation 1\n:\nwhere\n\u03c4\nwas the time interval in which two events were considered synchronous (1.5\u2009ms),\nm\nx\nand\nm\ny\nwere the total number of events to be compared, and\nwas a measure of correlation of two particular electrodes.\nThe event synchronization index for each electrode comparison, ranging in value from 0 (completely uncorrelated) to 1 (perfectly correlated), was calculated by\nEquation 2\n:\nTo identify clusters of synchronized electrodes, first, the participation index (PI) was calculated for each electrode\na\nthat contributed to a cluster\nb\n(\nEquation 3\n):\nwhere\n\u03bd\nab\nwas the\na\nth\nelement of eigenvector\n\u03bd\nb\nand\n\u03bb\nb\nwas the corresponding eigenvalue of the event correlation matrix [c\n\u03c4\n(x|y)].\nPI\nab\nindicated the contribution of electrode\na\nto the synchronized cluster\nb\n, with\ndefined as the weight with which electrode\na\ncontributed to cluster\nb\n. Clusters were defined as groups of electrodes with statistically similar patterns of activity, defined by PI\u22650.01.\n49\nNext, randomized surrogate time-series data without correlated electrode pairs were mathematically generated with an event rate equal to the instantaneous event rate of the experimental recordings by generating an inhomogeneous Poisson-distributed, \u201cevent train.\u201d These uncorrelated, synthetic event trains were analyzed identically to the experimental data to produce a correlation matrix, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and PI to bootstrap hypothesis testing of the experimental data.\n49\nEssentially, the uncorrelated Poisson-distributed event trains served as the null hypothesis against which to test experimental data. The surrogate randomization was repeated 50 times, and the mean (\n) and standard deviation (SD\nk\n) of surrogate eigenvalues were calculated (k=1,\u2026, M, where M was the number of electrodes). We identified the number of synchronized clusters that were significantly different from the randomized, asynchronous surrogates by\nEquation 4\n:\nwhere\nsgn\nwas a sign function,\n\u03bb\nk\nwas the eigenvalue of each electrode of the experimental data, and\nK\nwas a constant (\nK\n=3, for 99% confidence level, was used for this study). Detection of synchronized clusters represented the presence of neuronal assemblies functioning in an organized network. It is believed that neuron assemblies play a critical role in higher-order hippocampal function, including spatial navigation and memory processes,\n51\nwhich may be disrupted post-TBI and axonal injury.\n52\nThe degree of synchronization can be quantified and compared across slice cultures by calculating the global synchronization index (GSI), ranging from 0 (completely random, uncorrelated activity) to 1 (perfectly synchronous, correlated activity), for the cluster with the highest degree of synchronization within each slice culture (\nEquation 5\n):\nwhere\nwas the mean of the highest eigenvalues calculated across all surrogates,\nwas the maximal eigenvalue of the correlation matrix from the experimental data, and\nM\nwas the number of electrodes. Lower synchronization (i.e., lower GSI) has been associated with dysfunctional or damaged neural networks.\n53\nLast, the GSI was apportioned to each region (dentate gyrus [DG], cornu amonis [CA]3, and CA1) based on the fraction of regional electrodes participating in the cluster to obtain a normalized GSI for each region.\n\nStatistical analysis\nTo account for variability in the density and excitability of neuronal populations at each electrode, spontaneous activity data were normalized to preinjury levels for neural event rate on an electrode-by-electrode basis. Spontaneous activity and network synchronization data were analyzed by analysis of variance, followed by Bonferroni's post-hoc tests with statistical significance set as\np\n<0.05."

    "Methods": "Our data were derived from the 2011 cycle of the Center for Addiction and Mental Health's (CAMH; Toronto, Ontario, Canada)Monitor, a continuously-fielded cross-sectional telephone survey of Ontario adults age 18 or older, administered by the Institute for Social Research at York University (North York, Ontario, Canada). Excluded from selection were adults who were phoneless, institutionalized, and unable to speak English. The design employed a stratified, two-stage probability sample drawn quarterly through random digit dialing of listed and unlisted landline and mobile telephone numbers. Each calendar year, the four quarterly nonoverlapping samples are combined to provide a single annual data set. Although 3039 adults (response rate, 51%) completed the survey in 2011, our analysis is based on a random subsample of 1999 respondents who were asked the TBI question. A complete description of the survey and discussion of potential nonresponse bias is available on theMonitor'swebpage.21All procedures followed were in accord with institutional and national ethical standards on human experimentation as well as with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000. Informed consent was obtained from all patients included in the study. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committees of CAMH, St. Michael's Hospital (Toronto, Ontario, Canada), and York University.\n\nTraumatic brain injury\nHead injuries sustained in one's lifetime were assessed by a single question prefaced as follows: \u201cWe are interested in any head injuries that resulted in you being unconscious (knocked out) for at least 5 minutes, or you had to stay in the hospital for at least one night because of it.\u201d Respondents were then asked: \u201cHow many times, if ever in your life, have you had this type of head injury?\u201d Responses were recoded to create a binary lifetime TBI measure (yes=1; no=0). Similar questions assessing TBI have been previously validated.\n10\n,\n11\n,\n18\n,\n20\nWhereas respondents were normal adults, able to participate in regular adult activities, we cannot rule out the possibility of cognitive impairments affecting responses of TBI-injured adults. Of relevance here, we found that TBI adults were no more likely than non-TBI adults to assess questionnaire difficulty as \u201cdifficult\u201d (10.2% [95% confidence interval [CI], 6.8, 15.0] vs. 6.7% [95% CI, 5.4, 8.2]; second-order Rao-Scott adjusted chi-square [X\n2\n]\n(1, 1966)\n=5.04;\np\n>0.05).\n\nElevated psychological distress\nThe 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) was used to detect current psychological distress. The GHQ-12 assesses depressed mood, anxiety, insomnia, and social dysfunction and is extensively used as a screening instrument for common mental disorders or nonpsychotic psychiatric problems in epidemiological studies.\n22\nA cut score of 3 or more on the binary-scored GHQ-12 is considered the validated threshold identifying someone as experiencing elevated psychological distress during the past few weeks. Cronbach's reliability-coefficient (\u03b1) for these 12 items in this sample is 0.89.\n\nCigarette smoking\nSmoking (daily or occasionally) was derived from the following questions: (1) \u201cAt the present time do you smoke cigarettes daily, occasionally, or not at all?\u201d; (2) \u201cHave you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your life?\u201d; and (3) \u201cHow long ago was it that you last smoked?\u201d Cigarette smoking, binary-coded (yes=1), was defined if the participant reported smoking daily or occasionally, having smoked over 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, as well as having smoked at least one cigarette within the past 30 days.\n\nUse of substances\nAlso appraised was past-year use of cannabis and any past-year use of opioid pain relievers (e.g., Percocet, Percodan, Tylenol-3, Demerol, OxyContin, or codeine) without a prescription or without a doctor's consent. For both items, responses were binary-coded (yes=1).\n\nStatistical analysis\nTo accommodate the complex survey data, variances were estimated using Taylor Series Linearization available in the Complex Sample module in SPSS software (V20.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). The final analyses were based on a design with six strata (region) and 1988 adults. Logistic regression assessed the association between reported TBI status (reported history vs. not reported history of TBI during one's lifetime) and the four outcomes, while holding constant age, sex, family income, education, and marital status. To assess gender differences in TBI, a two-way TBI\u00d7sex interaction was added to each model separately and was assessed with the likelihood test. Mean age of participants was 46.6 years (range, 18\u201393; standard deviation=17.0) and 47.4% were men."

    "Methods": "Flow chamber and pressure servo pump\nThe microfluidic flow chamber is a parallel-plate flow system made of a 25-mm diameter cover-glass substrate and a 1-mm-thick glass slide separated by polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) walls (\nFig. 1A\n). The chamber dimensions were 1000\u2009\u03bcm wide, 15\u2009mm long, and 100\u2009\u03bcm high. The device was fabricated using soft lithography following the fabrication process described previously.\n27\nFor inlet and outlet, holes were punched through the PDMS at the ends of the chamber. The chip was mounted on a home-made assembly that allowed fluorescence imaging. The chamber substrate was coated with human fibronectin (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and rinsed 1\u2009h before seeding the cells.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nCalibration of shear stress in microfluidic chamber. (\nA\n) Schematic of experimental setup. High-speed pressure servo was connected to a microfluidic chamber to generate controlled fluid shear stimuli. (\nB\n) Comparison of triggering voltage pulse (red) and pressure rise (black) at inlet of the chamber, showing a rise time of 1\u2009ms can be achieved. (\nC\n) Trajectory of microbeads under a flow pulse of 6.5\u2009kPa for 10\u2009ms. The image was collected from the middle plane of the chamber, \u223c50\u2009\u03bcm from the bottom. Blue arrow indicates flow direction. (\nD\n) Dependence of average shear stress on inlet pressure. Maximum flow rate was estimated from the length of the streaks and shear stress calculated as described in Methods. Each data point was averaged from >8 streaks in each frame for a total of 10 frames of four experiments. Error bar indicates standard error of the mean. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nAn ultra-fast piezo-driven pressure servo (ALA Scientific Instruments, Farmingdale, NY) was used to generate pressure pulses of known waveform with a time resolution of \u223c1\u2009ms to drive the chamber.\n26\nThe stimuli included steps and ramps and the pressure was monitored at the chamber inlet to parameterize the shear stress. To mimic blast waves in the fluids, the waveform was chosen to closely resemble a classic Friedlander curve.\n28\nFlow velocity was obtained experimentally by tracking fluorescent microbeads. Mean flow rate was estimated from the measured data following established theory.\n29\nThe wall shear stress, \u03c4, was calculated using the empirical equation,\n, where \u03bc is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, Q is the volume flow rate, and\nw\nand\nh\nare the width and the height of the chamber, respectively.\n30\nViscosity was assumed to be 10\n\u20133\nPa s.\n\nCell culture\nPrimary adult astrocytes were isolated from gelatin-sponge implants from adult Sprague-Dawley rat brains provided by Dr. Thomas Langan (SUNY-Buffalo, Buffalo, NY). Astrocytes were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were transferred to the microfluidic chambers when the flasks reached 95% confluence and were cultured in the chamber for 3\u20135 days before the experiments. Media in the chamber were changed every 24\u2009h to sustain the cell growth. To permit phenotypic maturation of astrocytes, they were only used in experiments between passages 4 and 12.\n31\n\nCalcium dye loading and fluorescence imaging\nBefore the experiments, cells were gently washed with saline, followed by loading with the Ca\n2+\n-sensitive dye, Fluo-4 AM (5\u2009\u03bcM; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and kept in an incubator (37\u00b0C with 95% air and 5% CO\n2\n) for 30\u2009min. Chambers were then gently washed and returned to the incubator for \u223c8\u2009min to allow cleavage of the dye molecules. Normal saline was used as the shearing fluid. Fluorescence images were acquired using an inverted microscope (Axiovert 200M; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (AxioCam MRm; Carl Zeiss) and a 10\u00d7 objective lens. The filter set (excitation [Ex], 470/40\u2009nm; emission [Em], 525/50\u2009nm) was used for Ca\n2+\nimaging. Time-lapse images were obtained using software (AxioVision; Carl Ziess). To calibrate the shear stress in the microchannel produced by the pressure pulse, fluorescent microspheres (1\u2009\u03bcm, Sulfate Fluospheres; Invitrogen) were dissolved in the saline. The trajectories of the sphere under different pressure pulses were acquired using the filter set (Ex, 580/25; Em, 605/70).\n\nSolutions and reagents\nNormal saline containing 1\u2009mM of CaCl\n2\nwas used as control solution. In Ca\n2+\n-free solutions, CaCl\n2\nwas replaced by MgCl\n2\n. Gadolinium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was freshly prepared as 10-mM stock solution in control solution before each experiment. Nifedipine, cis-diltiazem hydrochloride, and verapamil hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) were each dissolved in ethanol and then diluted in saline to 10\u2009\u03bcM (ethanol in the final solution was less than 1:1000). The enantiomer forms of GsMTx4 were made and purified according to previously published protocols.\n32\n\nStatistical analysis\nRelative Ca\n2+\nintensity was calculated using\n, where\nF\nand\nF\n0\nare the mean fluorescence intensities of selected cells at time t and t=0, respectively. Background intensity was subtracted before the calculation. A new cell culture was used for each experiment. Mean calcium change was averaged over N selected cells from each image and over multiple experiments. The statistical analysis used the standard error of the mean. To summarize the multi-dimensional thresholds, the profile of peak Ca\n2+\nintensity was fit with a two-state Boltzmann equation (\nEquation 1\n):\nwhere\nx\nand\ny\nare, respectively, the amplitude and duration of the shear pulse;\na\n,\nm\n,\nn\n, and\nh\nare constants and were extracted from the fitting as\na=32.55\n,\nm=0.44\n,\nn=0.096\n, and\nh=\u20136.54\n. The fidelity of the fitting was measured by\nR\n2\n, coefficient of determination, and\nR\n2\n\u22650.95\nfor these fits."

    "Methods": "Animals\nThe described experiments were performed in accord with the Animal Welfare Act, Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and all other applicable regulations, policies, and procedures and were approved by the University of Maryland School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Baltimore, MD). Ten-week-old male C57BL/6NTac mice (20\u201325\u2009g) were obtained from Taconic Farms Inc. (Hudson, NY) and were handled as previously described.\n15\n\nVoluntary motor exercise\nAnimals were randomly assigned to exercise group (\nn\n=23) on running wheel (Nalgene, Bend, OR) or sedative control (\nn\n=28) in home cages for 4 weeks. Habituation was conducted for 3 days on running wheel before starting the exercise. Total revolutions during 4 weeks were recorded by the VitaView Data Acquisition System (Mini Mitter, Bend, OR) and converted to meters run based on the diameter of the running wheel. Mice were weighed before and after pre-exercise; mice without exercise were divided into Sham/No-Ex (\nn\n=11) and controlled cortical impact (CCI)/No-Ex (\nn\n=17) groups. Mice subjected to 4-week pre-exercise were randomly divided into Sham/Ex (\nn\n=8) or CCI/Ex (\nn\n=15) groups to ensure similar mean revolutions per day for each group. Animal weight was measured before exercise and weekly during the 4-week exercise period.\n\nControlled cortical impact injury\nTwenty-four hours after completion of 4-week exercise, CCI was performed as previously described.\n15\nSurgical anesthesia was induced and maintained with 3% and 2% isoflurane evaporated in a gas mixture containing 70% N\n2\nO and 30% O\n2\nand administered through a nose mask. The injury device consists of a microprocessor-controlled pneumatic impactor, driven by compressed air, with a 3.5-mm diameter tip. A 10-mm midline incision was made over the skull, the skin and fascia were reflected, and a 4-mm craniotomy was made on the central aspect of the left parietal bone between the bregma and lambda. Moderate-level brain injury was induced by an impact velocity of 6\u2009m/sec and a deformation depth of 2\u2009mm, as previously described.\n15\nMortality was under 10%; no other complications were noted. After injury, the incision was closed using surgical staples, anesthesia was terminated, and the animal was placed onto a heated pad to maintain normal core temperature for 30\u201360\u2009min postinjury. All animals were monitored carefully for at least 4\u2009h after surgery and then daily. Sham animals underwent the same procedure, including craniotomy, as injured mice except for the impact. Our previous studies in both traumatic spinal cord and brain injuries have shown that sham animals demonstrate molecular changes, compared to na\u00efve animals, but the magnitude and duration of these changes was smaller and shorter than in injured animals.\n16\u201318\nThus, sham injury represents an important control for anesthesia and surgical stress.\n\nMotor function evaluation\nChronic motor function was evaluated using a beam walking task, a method that is particularly good at discriminating fine motor coordination differences. The mouse was placed on the beam and the number of foot-faults for the right hindlimb recorded over 50 steps. A basal level of performance was achieved after 3 days training preceding surgery with an acceptance level of less than 10 foot-faults per 50 steps. The test was performed at 0 (immediately before CCI), 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days postinjury.\n\nMorris water maze and reversal Morris water maze tests\nSpatial learning and memory was assessed using the acquisition phase of the standard Morris water maze (MWM), as previously described.\n15\nA circular tank (100\u2009cm in diameter) was filled with water (23\u00b12\u00b0C) that was made opaque with white Crayola nontoxic paint. The maze was surrounded by various extramaze cues on the wall of the room. A transparent platform (10\u2009cm in diameter) was submerged 0.5\u2009cm below the surface of the opaque water. The MWM protocol included standard hidden platform training (acquisition; postinjury day [PID] 14 to PID 17) and standard probe test (PID 18). The swim path, latency to platform, time spent in each zone, and velocity were recorded by a computer-based Any-Maze automated video tracking system (Stoelting Co, Wood Dale, IL). Reference memory was assessed by a probe test on PID 18. The search strategies were analyzed on each of the four trials on day 4 of MWM.\n15\n\nTail-suspension test\nThe tail-suspension (TS) test assesses depression-like behavior in mice and is based on the observation that mice develop an immobile posture when placed in an inescapable hemodynamic stress of being hung by their tail.\n19\n,\n20\nThe TS was performed on PID 21, as described previously,\n21\nwith small modifications. Each mouse was suspended at a height of 50\u2009cm using adhesive tape placed approximately 1\u2009cm from the tip of its tail. Duration of immobility was recorded throughout the 5-min test period. The definition of immobility was passive hanging and complete motionlessness.\n\nOpen field test\nThe open field test was used to measure locomotor activity\n21\non PID 21. Mice were individually placed in a corner facing the wall of the open-field chamber (22.5\u00d722.5\u2009cm) and allowed to freely explore the chamber for 5\u2009min. Distance travelled was recorded by Any-Maze software.\n\nNovel object recognition test\nNovel object recognition (NOR), conducted as previously reported,\n22\n,\n23\nevaluated nonspatial hippocampal-mediated memory\n24\non PID 22 and 23. The apparatus consists of an open field (22.5\u00d722.5\u2009cm) with two adjacently located imaginary circular zones. Briefly, mice were habituated to the open field and were allowed to freely explore the area for 5\u2009min (no data were collected). After 24\u2009h, mice were placed into the chamber where two identical objects were placed near the left and right corners of the open field for training (sample phase) and allowed to freely explore until they spent a total of 20\u2009sec exploring the objects (exploration recorded when the front paws or nose contacted the object). Mice were then removed and returned to their home cage. After 24\u2009h, object recognition was tested by substituting a novel object for a familiar training object (novel object location counterbalanced across mice). Time spent with each object was recorded; because mice inherently prefer to explore novel objects, a preference for the novel object (more time than chance [10 sec] spent with the novel object) indicates intact memory for the familiar object.\nHistology\nA randomly selected set of animals from the groups that underwent behavior testing were euthanized and transcardially perfused with saline and 10% buffered formalin phosphate solution (containing 4% paraformaldehyde; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA) on PID 28 to be used for all histological analysis, including lesion volume and stereology. Frozen brain sections (60-um) were cut and mounted onto glass slides. Microglia were immunostatined with anti-Iba-1 (1:1000; Wako Chemicals, Dallas, TX) overnight and incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 2\u2009h at room temperature. Sections were placed in avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase solution for 1\u2009h (Vectastain Elite ABC kit; Vector Laboratories) and then reacted with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories) for color development.\n\nLesion volume assessment\nLesion volume was determined based on Cavalieri's method after staining with cresyl violet, as previously described.\n14\nThe lesion area was outlined using the Stereologer 2000 program (Systems Planning and Analysis, Alexandria, VA) to obtain the final volume measurements.\n\nAssessment of neuronal cell loss in the hippocampal subregions, cortex, and thalamus\nStereoinvestigator software (MBF Biosciences, Williston, VT) was used to count the total number of surviving neurons in the cortex, thalamus, as well as cornu ammonis (CA) 1, CA2/3, and dentate gyrus (DG) subregions of the hippocampus using the optical fractionator method of unbiased stereology, as previously described.\n25\n\nAssessment of microglial morphology in the cortex\nStereoinvestigator software (MBF Biosciences) was used to count the number of cortical microglia in each of the three microglial morphological phenotypes (namely, ramified, hypertrophic, and bushy) using the optical fractionator method of unbiased stereology, as previously described.\n26\n\nRNA isolation\nTwenty-four hours after injury, animals were euthanized and a 5-mm area surrounding the lesion epicenter on the ipsilateral cortex was rapidly dissected and immediately frozen on dry ice. This cohort of animals was separate from those used for behavior and histology euthanized at PID 28 and from those for Western blotting/subcellular fractionation also euthanized at 24\u2009h post-TBI. Total RNA was isolated using the miRNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). During the process of isolation, samples were treated with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen) to digest DNA contamination of samples, according to the manufacturer's protocol.\n\nReal-time polymerase chain reaction\nThe Verso\u2122 complementary DNA (cDNA) Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Peabody, MA) was used to synthesize cDNA from purified total RNA. RNA (1\u2009\u03bcg) was heated to 70\u00b0C for 5\u2009min and mixed with 5\u00d7cDNA-synthesis buffer, dNTP mix (0.5-nM final concentration), and Verso Enzyme Mix, and, finally, random hexamers (400\u2009ng/\u03bcL) were added. Tubes were incubated at 42\u00b0C for 30\u2009min, followed by 95\u00b0C for 2\u2009min. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was performed by using cDNA TaqMan\n\u00ae\nUniversal Master Mix II (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). In brief, reactions were performed in duplicate containing 2\u00d7TaqMan Universal Master Mix II, 1\u2009\u03bcL of cDNA (corresponding to 50-ng RNA/reaction), and TaqMan Gene Expression Assay (Applied Biosystems), 20\u00d7in a final volume of 20\u2009\u03bcL. TaqMan Gene Expression assays for the following mouse genes were performed: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Mm99999915_g1); PUMA (Mm00519268_m1); Bid (Mm00432073_m1); heat shock protein (HSP)a1a (Mm01159846_s1); HSPa1b (Mm03038954_s1); BDNF (Mm01334042_m1); and CREB (Mm00501607_m1; Applied Biosystems). Reactions were amplified and quantified using a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System and the corresponding software (Applied Biosystems). The PCR profile consisted of one cycle at 50\u00b0C for 2\u2009min and 95\u00b0C for 10\u2009min, followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15\u2009sec and 60\u00b0C for 1\u2009min. All reactions were performed twice. Efficiency of reactions for each set gene expression was close to 100%. Efficiency of reactions was measured using the threshold cycle (Ct) slope method. Briefly, serial dilutions of samples were generated and real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR reactions were performed on each dilution. Ct values were then plotted versus the log of the dilution and a linear regression was performed: Efficiency=(10\u22121/slope\u22121)\u00d7100%.\n27\nSamples were confirmed to be free of DNA contamination by performing reactions without reverse transcriptase. Gene expression was normalized to GAPDH, and the relative quantity of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) was calculated based on the comparative Ct method.\n28\n\nWestern blotting\nTwenty-four hours postinjury, a separate cohort of animals, including Sham/No-Ex (\nn\n=4), Sham/Ex (\nn\n=4), CCI/No-Ex (\nn\n=6), and CCI/Ex (\nn\n=6) mice, were euthanized and a 5-mm area surrounding the lesion epicenter on the ipsilateral cortex was rapidly dissected and immediately frozen on dry ice. The cortical tissue extracted 24\u2009h after TBI was divided for homogenization in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer or for subcellular fractionation. The RIPA lysate was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblots were probed with anti-\u03b1-Spectrin (1:3000; Enzo Life Science, Ann Arbor, MI), anti-Bid (1:1000; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), anti-PUMA (1:1000; ProSci Incorporated, Poway, CA), and anti-HSP70 (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF)-1 (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), cytochrome c (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), \u03b2-actin (1:20,000; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and Histone H2A.X (1:20,000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) were used as an endogenous control. Chemiluminescence was captured on a Kodak Image station 4000R station (Carestream Health, Rochester, NY), and protein bands were quantified by densitometric analysis using Carestream Molecular Imaging Software (Carestream Health). The data presented reflect the intensity of the target protein normalized to protein levels of the endogenous control in each sample (expressed in arbitrary units).\n\nSubcellular fractionation\nSubcellular fractionation was performed as previously described,\n29\nwith some modifications. 5-mm area surrounding the lesion epicenter on the ipsilateral cortex was rapidly dissected and homogenized in ice cold digitonin lysis buffer (20\u2009mM of HEPES [pH 7.4], 80\u2009mM of KCl, 1\u2009mM of ethylenedimainetetraacetic acid, 1\u2009mM of ethyleneglycol tetraacetic acid, 1\u2009mM of dithiothreitol, 250\u2009mM of sucrose, 200\u2009\u03bcg/mL of digitonin, and protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor [2, 3] cocktails [P8340; P5726; Sigma-Aldrich]) and incubated for 10\u2009min on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 1000\ng\nfor 5\u2009min at 4\u00b0C to pellet the nuclei. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged again at 12,000\ng\nfor 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C to pellet the mitochondria. The resulting supernatant, representing the cytosolic fraction, was recovered. Nuclear and mitochondrial lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer (Teknova, Hollister, CA) with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails.\n\nStatistical analysis\nFor the beam walk, acquisition trials of the MWM test repeated-measures one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) was conducted, followed by Student-Newman-Keuls' post-hoc test to compare the differences between each group. One-way ANOVA analysis, followed by Student-Newman-Keuls' post-hoc test, was performed for the other behavioral tests and neuronal cell counts, microglia activation, real-time PCR, and Western blot. A two-tailed paired Student's\nt\n-test was used for lesion volume. For the search strategy analysis, chi-square analysis was performed. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software (version 4.00 for Windows; GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) or the SigmaPlot Program (Version 12; Systat Software, San Jose, CA). Data are expressed as mean\u00b1standard error of the mean (SEM), and significance was determined at\np\n<0.05."

    "Methods": "Animals and housing conditions\nA total of 78 male Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic, Ry, Denmark), 10\u201312 weeks old and weighing 290\u2013320\u2009g at the beginning of the experiments, were used. They were housed in groups of four in Type IV MakrolonR plastic cages under standardized conditions (12\u2009h light/dark cycle, lights on at 07:00; temperature of 22\u00b10.5\u00b0C; and 40 \u2013 50% relative humidity). Food and water were provided ad libitum to the animals.\n\nExperimental groups and manipulations\nThis study is made up of three separate experiments, and for each experiment, different animals were used. All animals were handled and given a week to habituate to their environment prior to the experiments, then randomly assigned to one of three groups: control, sham, and exposed. Control rats were kept in the animal facility without any experimental manipulations for the duration of the study. Sham rats were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation, then injected intraperitoneally with 2.4\u2009mL/kg of a mixture of 1\u2009mL Dormicum\n\u00ae\n(5\u2009mg/mL midazolam; Roche, Stockholm, Sweden), 1\u2009mL Hypnorm\n\u00ae\n(Fentanyl/fluaniscane; Janssen, Stockholm, Sweden) and 2\u2009mL of distilled water. Exposed rats were treated identically to shams in addition to being exposed to a single blast wave.\nExperiment One was a behavior test\u2014the FST. Animals were divided into three groups: control (\nn\n=6), sham (\nn\n=7), and exposed (\nn\n=8). Experiment Two consisted of in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry analysis. A total of 33 animals were terminated at four post-exposure time-points: 2\u2009h (\nn\n=5), 1\u2009d (\nn\n=5), 3\u2009d (\nn\n=4) and 7\u2009d (\nn\n=8), and a total of 11 shams were used. Experiment Three consisted of HPLC analysis. Twenty-four animals were sacrificed at 1\u2009d=6, 6, and 7\u2009d=6, 6, exposed and sham, respectively.\n\nExposure conditions\nA validated blast tube\n46\n,\n51\u201353\ndesigned by Clemedson in 1955 was used for exposure.\n54\nSwedish army plastic explosive containing explosive m/46, 86% pentaerythritol tetranitrate and mineral oil was used with a Nonel ignition (Dyno Nobel Sweden, Nora, Sweden). Anesthetized animals were placed in a rigid metallic holder that protects all parts of the body except the head. This holder protects from lung injuries that otherwise would occur with the employed amount of explosive. The holder also prevents acceleration movements of the head relative to the rest of the body. The holder was subsequently mounted into the 1.5\u2009m metal shock tube, with the rat placed in a transverse prone position at a distance of 1\u2009m from the charge. Five grams of the explosive were then detonated, triggering a simple blast Friedlander-type wave at the surface of the animal with a peak pressure of 550\u2009kPa and a duration of 0.2\u2009msec.\n46\nThe rat's left side faced the charge. Post-exposure, animals were monitored for 1\u2009h, after which time they awoke, as did the shams.\n\nForced swim test\nAnxiety-/depression-like behavior was measured using the FST\n47\nat 1\u2009d pre-exposure (baseline) and 1\u2009d, 14\u2009d, and 35\u2009d post-exposure. Animals were individually placed in a vertical plastic cylinder (50\u2009cm height, 18\u2009cm diameter) containing water to a height of 30\u2009cm, at a temperature of 25\u00b10.5\u00b0C. Animals were exposed to two swimming sessions, 24\u2009h apart: a 10-min pre-test, and a 5-min test. The total duration of immobility and climbing behavior were recorded during the second, test day.\n49\nImmobility was defined as floating passively in an upright position in water, with only small movements necessary to keep the head above the water surface, typically only one paw movement at a time. Climbing was defined as vigorous forepaw movements directed toward the walls of the cylinder.\n\nIn situ hybridization (ISH)\nAnimals were anesthetized with isoflurane, injected with 1.5\u20132.0\u2009mL of pentobarbital, and then decapitated. The brains were rapidly removed and placed on dry ice and, once frozen, stored at \u221270\u00b0C until use. Serial coronal sections were cut at a thickness of 14\u2009\u03bcm at the level of the LC (bregma \u221210.52 \u2013 \u22129.16\u2009mm), and DRN (\u22128.30 \u2013 \u22127.30\u2009mm; coordinates according to Paxinos and Watson\n55\n) using Cryo-Star HM 560M (MICROM International GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany), and two sections were thaw-mounted per super frost slide (Thermo Scientific, Stockholm, Sweden). Three slides per animal were processed for ISH. Method of selection of slides was random.\nOligonucleotides complementary to rat TPH2 nucleotides\n43\n: TCC TCC GTC CAA ATG TTG TCA GGT GGA TTC AGC GTC ACA ATG GTG GTC [GENBANK ID NM_017139], and TH\n37\n: GCG CTG GAT ACG AGA GGC ATA GTT CCT GAG CTT GTC [GENBANK ID NM_012740] (CyberGene AB, Solna, Sweden), were labeled with deoxyadenosine 5\u2032triphosphate \u03b1\u2013P32 at the 3\u2032-end using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA).\nThe labeled oligoprobes were purified using ProbeQuant G-50 Micro Columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Sections were air-dried and incubated with the oligonucleotide probe for 18\u2009h at 42\u00b0C. Post-hybridization, sections were rinsed in 1\u00d7SSC, 4\u00d730\u2009min at 55\u00b0C followed by 1\u2009h at room temperature (RT), dehydrated with 70%, followed by 90% and finally 100% ethanol, air-dried and dipped in liquid photo emulsion NTB2 at RT (Kodak, Rochester, NY).\nThe optimal exposure time was determined by exposing the slides to imaging plates (BAS-SR Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) for 24\u2009h at RT, which were scanned using a phosphoimager (Fuji BAS 3000, Tokyo, Japan). Based on this data, TPH2 slides were developed after 72\u2009h and TH after a week using D19 developer (Kodak) and AL-4 fixative (Kodak) and mounted in glycerol-phosphate.\n56\nDark field photomicrographs were captured in a microscope (Nikon Eclipse E-600; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), connected to a digital camera (Digital Sight, U1; Nikon). The images were analyzed according to the mean gray density (MGD) of the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) signal in the regions of interest (ROIs), using ImageJ 1.48 (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).\n\nHisto- and immunohistochemistry (IHC)\nSections not used for ISH were used to evaluate nerve cell death (using Fluoro-Jade B [FJ] staining; Merck Millipore AG310, Darmstadt, Germany), \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein accumulation (APP; IHC) and leakages of blood vessels (using a secondary rat antibody, IHC). As positive control, sections from experiments with a focal penetrating injury model were used.\n57\nFor FJ staining, sections were air dried for 1\u2009h before being fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10\u2009min, and rinsed in 0.01\u2009M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 3\u00d73\u2009min. The sections were subsequently dipped in dH\n2\nO for 2\u2009min, followed by 10\u2009min in 0.06% potassium permanganate (KMnO\n4\n), then rinsed with dH\n2\nO for 2\u2009min. Slides were then soaked in FJ solution for 30\u2009min, washed in dH\n2\nO 3\u00d71\u2009min, and finally placed on a hot plate 50\u00b0C for 5\u2009min before a quick dip in xylene and thereafter mounted with Entellan (Merck).\nFor all other staining, slides were fixed in ice cold methanol for 5\u2009min, then shortly dipped in ice cold acetone, and rinsed in 0.01\u2009M PBS 2\u00d710\u2009min. One group was incubated in a humid chamber at 4\u00b0C for 18\u2009h with a solution of 0.3% Triton, 5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% sodium azide in 0.01M PBS and a rabbit poly-clonal antibody against APP (51-2700, dilution 1:400; Life Technologies, Stockholm, Sweden). The other group was not exposed to any primary antibody.\nThe following day, all sections were rinsed in 0.01M PBS 2\u00d710\u2009min and incubated for 1\u2009h at RT with 0.01\u2009M PBS, 0.1% sodium azide, 0.3% Triton. The first group then processed with an Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (dilution 1:400; Jackson ImmunoResearch, Suffolk, UK). The second group was incubated with CY2- conjugated donkey anti-rat antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 712-225-153, dilution 1:100) to visualize blood vessel leakage.\nSections were rinsed in 0.01M PBS 2\u00d710\u2009min, and mounted in a mixture of glycerol and PBS (1:3), then cover-slipped. Slides were viewed in a microscope equipped with epifluorescence (Eclipse E600; Nikon).\n\nHigh-performance liquid chromatography\nChemicals required for HPLC included: NA hydrochloride, DA hydrochloride, 5-HT hydrochloride, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), potassium chloride, phosphate monobasic monohydrate, sodium phosphate dibasic, sodium acetate, citric acid, octanesulfonic acid sodium salt and methanol, which were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). EDTA-2Na was purchased from Dojindo (Kumamoto, Japan).\nThe following regions were dissected using the appropriate landmarks as detailed by Paxinos and Watson\n55\n: PFC, hypothalamus, the dHiFo and vHiFo formation, occipital cortex (CX) and entorhinal cortex (ERC). Both ipsi-lateral (left)- and contra-lateral (right) regions were dissected, except the hypothalamus. The isolated brain regions were put into marked plastic vials and placed on dry ice. Dissected brain tissue samples (1\u201310\u2009mg) were mixed at a ratio of 1:10 (weight/volume) with 0.2\u2009M perchloric acid including 100\u2009\u03bcM EDTA-2Na, and homogenized at 0\u00b0C in a glass-pestle micro-homogenizer. Following standing for 3\u2009min on ice, the homogenates were centrifuged for 15\u2009min at 12,000\u2009g at 4\u00b0C. The supernatants were aspirated and mixed with 1\u2009M Na-acetate buffer, pH 3 at a ratio 5:1 (volume/volume) and filtered through a 0.22\u2009\u03bcm centrifugal filter for 4\u2009min at 12,000\u2009g at 4\u00b0C. The filtrates were stored at \u221280\u00b0C before HPLC analysis.\nConcentrations of NA, DA, and 5-HT in the brain tissue samples were determined by HPLC with electrochemical detection as described elsewhere.\n58\nBriefly, the HPLC system consisted of a HTEC500 unit (Eicom, Kyoto, Japan), and a CMA/200 Refrigerated Microsampler (CMA Microdialysis, Stockholm, Sweden) equipped with a 20\u2009\u03bcL loop and operating at 4\u00b0C. The potential of the glassy carbon working electrode was +450\u2009mV versus the Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The separation was achieved on a 200\u00d72.0\u2009mm Eicompak CAX column (Eicom). The mobile phase was a mixture of methanol and 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffer (pH 6.0; 30:70, volume/volume) containing 40\u2009mM potassium chloride and 0.13\u2009mM EDTA-2Na. The chromatograms were recorded and integrated by use of a computerized data acquisition system Clarity (DataApex, Prague, Czech Republic). The detection limit (signal-to-noise ratio=3) for NA, DA, and 5-HT was 0.05\u2009nM (i.e., 0.75\u2009fmoL in 15\u2009\u03bcL injected onto the column).\nConcentrations of DOPAC, HVA, and 5-HIAA were determined by a separate HPLC system with electrochemical detection (HTEC500). The potential of the glassy carbon working electrode was +750\u2009mV versus the Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The separation was achieved on a 150\u00d73.0\u2009mm Eicompak SC-5ODS column (Eicom). The mobile phase was a mixture of methanol and 0.1\u2009M citrate/0.1\u2009M sodium acetate buffer solution (pH 3.5; 16:84, volume/volume) and contained 210\u2009mg/L octanesulphonic acid sodium salt and 5\u2009mg/L EDTA-2Na. The detection limit (signal-to-noise ratio=3) for DOPAC, HVA, and 5-HIAA was 2\u2009nM (i.e., 10\u2009fmoL in 5\u2009\u03bcL injected onto the column). The chromatograms were recorded and integrated by use of the computerized data acquisition system Clarity (DataApex).\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 5 (GraphPad Software, CA).\nFor the FST differences in the total time spent climbing and immobile during each test session (baseline and 1\u2009d, 14\u2009d, and 35\u2009d post-exposure) were independently evaluated across all three groups (exposed,\nn\n=8; sham,\nn\n=7; control,\nn\n=6) using analysis of variance (ANOVA), repeated measures ANOVA, and Dunnett's\nt\n-test.\nFor ISH, the MGDs were determined for each of the ROIs (DRN, MRN, and LC) for each transcript (TH and TPH2). The MGDs of individual ROIs from each specific time-point (2\u2009h,\nn\n=5; 1\u2009d,\nn\n=5, 3\u2009d,\nn\n=4; and 7\u2009d,\nn\n=8; and a total of 11 shams) and transcript were separately compared with sham MGDs of corresponding ROIs and transcript, and analyzed using ANOVA and followed up by the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test, which enables comparisons across all five experimental groups. No difference between shams of the different time-points was found as evaluated by ANOVA, so the groups were collapsed. The MGD of each ROI was normalized to its corresponding sham level to clearly show increases and/or decreases in transcript level on sham levels.\nFor HPLC, each specific monoamine/ metabolite (NA, DA, 5-HT and DOPAC, HVA, 5-HIAA) was evaluated exclusively from one brain region against its corresponding sham region. The two terminal time-points post-exposure were evaluated separately, using an unpaired\nt\n-test, 1\u2009d=6, 6 and 7\u2009d=6, 6, exposed and sham, respectively. Since none of the brain regions showed a significant difference between the left and right, these groups were collapsed in the analysis.\nAll data are presented as the mean\u00b1standard error of the mean (SEM). The level of significance is as follows: *\np\n<0.05, **\np\n<0.01, and ***\np\n<0.001."

    "Methods": "Study population\nThe prospective study of concussion among professional ice hockey players from the Swedish Hockey League has been described before.\n22\nThe study was approved by the Ethics Committee for Medical Research at the University of Gothenburg (Molndal, Sweden) and by the Swedish Ice Hockey Association. Written informed consent was obtained from all 288 study participants comprised of 24 players from each of the 12 teams. The physicians for each team documented signs and symptoms of concussion and performed physical examinations in the event of concussion during the first half of the 2012\u20132013 season. The diagnosis of concussion (\nn\n=28) was made according to the latest guidelines on sports-related concussion.\n30\nBlood samples were obtained at 1 (\nn\n=25), 12 (\nn\n=22), 36 (\nn\n=20), and 144\u2009h (\nn\n=18) after concussion as well as on the day of return to play (\nn\n=10). Physicians recorded the date of concussion and the date at which players completely recovered from their injuries and returned to unrestricted competition. In addition, before the start of the season, players from two teams were sampled for baseline serum biomarker levels (\nn\n=45), and players from one of these teams provided blood samples 1 and 12\u2009h after a training game without concussion incident (\nn\n=17).\n\nSerum biomarkers\nBlood samples were collected and sera prepared by the methods described before.\n22\nSNTF was quantified in the deidentified sera using an electrochemiluminescence-based sandwich immunoassay\n27\nby an experimenter blinded to the data on PCS severity and serum levels of the other biomarkers. Briefly, standard 96-well plates with an underside electrode (Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD) were coated with purified and highly cross-species adsorbed goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG; Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL) at 50\u2009ng per well in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.03% Triton X-100, air dried, and stored overnight at 4\u00b0C. The next day, wells were blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TTBS (Tris-buffered saline [pH 7.4] containing 0.05% Tween-20), then washed with TTBS. The capture antibody (Ab), a mouse monoclonal to the SH3 domain in the\nN\n-terminal half of spectrin \u03b1II-subunit\n31\n(Covance, Kalamazoo, MI) was applied as ascites fluid at 25\u2009ng per well in 0.2% BSA/TTBS for 1\u2009h, then the wells were washed with TTBS. Next, human sera diluted to 40% or SNTF standards mixed in 0.2% BSA/TTBS were added in sextuplicate (25\u2009\u03bcL per well) for 2\u2009h, and then the wells were washed with TTBS. A standard curve was generated using a preparation of \u03b1II-spectrin isolated from mouse brain membranes by high salt extraction and ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by digestion with purified erythrocyte calpain I to generate SNTF, as described before.\n23\n,\n27\n,\n32\nThe detecting Ab was a cleavage site-specific purified rabbit IgG raised against the calpain-generated neoepitope in the C-terminus of SNTF ending at \u03b1II-spectrin residue 1176. This Ab was prepared in our laboratory and characterized extensively by Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, protease digest, and solid-phase immunoassay for specific reactivity with SNTF, but not the spectrin holoprotein or other spectrin proteolytic fragments.\n23\n,\n26\nNegative controls were evaluated in triplicate for every serum sample by replacing the SNTF-specific IgG with purified IgG prepared from preimmune rabbit serum and used at the same concentration (200\u2009ng/mL). The reporter Ab was goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to ruthenium (Sulfotag; Meso Scale Discovery) and diluted to 1:500 in BSA/TTBS. After three washes in TTBS, read buffer T containing tripropylamine (Meso Scale Discovery) was added to each well and, using a Sector 6000 system current, was applied to the plates and the electrochemiluminescent product generated in each well was quantified. Specific SNTF signal was calculated as the difference in signal between triplicate wells containing either the SNTF IgG or preimmune IgG and normalized to brain SNTF standards. One unit of SNTF is defined as the signal generated by 1\u2009nL of the protein standard per mL. The lower limit of detection (LLOD) was determined experimentally to be 14 units.\nTau and S100\u03b2 were quantified from the sera as published previously.\n22\nOne unit of tau and S100\u03b2 are defined as the signal generated by their respective protein standards at 1\u2009pg/mL.\n\nStatistical analyses\nFor comparison of biomarker levels after concussion or training versus their preseason or pretraining levels, the two-tailed\nt\n-test was used. Longitudinal biomarker levels were compared by Mann-Whitney's U test between participants with return to play within less than 6 days and 6 days or greater. Linear regression analyses compared longitudinal postconcussion serum levels of SNTF with tau and S100\u03b2. For serum SNTF levels below the LLOD of 14 units, a value of 13 units was assigned for all statistical analyses. The area under the receiver operator characteristics curve (AUC) for SNTF levels postconcussion versus preseason or as a function of the delay in return to play was calculated using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). Multi-variate analyses examined the combination of serum SNTF and tau after concussion in relation to preseason levels and with respect to the delay in return to play, using the statistical methods described above. Equal weighting was placed on SNTF and tau by representing each concentration as a fraction of the mean for that marker and summing the two fractional means for the combined measure."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats (approximately 3 months of age) were used in this study. Rats were housed individually in a room with a 12-h light/dark cycle. Food and water was available\nad libitum\n. All procedures were conducted in accord with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center (East Orange, NJ).\n\nSurgery\nRats were anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine mixture (60\u2009mg/7\u2009mg per kg, intraperitoneally) and placed in a stereotaxic instrument. A craniectomy (4\u2009mm diameter, centered at 3\u2009mm posterior to bregma and 3.5\u2009mm lateral to midline) was made unilaterally in either the left or right parietal bone plate; left and right locations were counterbalanced across animals. A Luer-Lok connector was glued to the skull surrounding the craniectomy. A plastic cylinder (cut from a 12-mL syringe) surrounded the craniectomy to protect the Luer-Lok connector. Dental cement fixed the plastic cylinder and Luer-Lok connector to stainless steel screws inserted in the skull. A small piece of Kimwipe was inserted into the connector to keep the dura clean of debris.\n\nFluid percussion\nTo control for individual differences in ASR reactivity, rats were matched for ASR amplitude at 102 decibels (dB), then randomly assigned to sham and mTBI groups. Fluid percussion injury was produced as described previously.\n20\n,\n21\nOne day after surgery, rats were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane. The Kimwipe was removed from the Luer-Lok connector, the connector was filled with saline, and the Luer-Lok was connected to the fluid percussion device. Rats in the sham group underwent all procedures experienced by rats in the injury group, except the fluid percussion impact. Rats in the mTBI group received a fluid percussion impact by a device that utilized a computer-controlled voice coil.\n22\n,\n23\nIn this device, a voice coil controlled the movement of a piston in a Plexiglas cylinder, analogous to a plunger in a syringe. At the opposite end of the cylinder was a Luer-Lok connector that could be mated to the Luer-Lok connector on the rat's skull. The cylinder was filled with water so that movement of the voice coil/piston transmitted pressure waves through the water-filled cylinder to the dura mater of the rat. A pressure sensor was located in the cylinder in contact with the water to measure pressure changes associated with piston movement. The pressure wave inducing mTBI was recorded. Presence of hyperextension of the limbs and tails as well as duration of apnea were recorded. In addition, recovery of the righting reflex was assessed. All rats were placed supine after injury, and the righting latency was defined as the time to right themselves on all four limbs spontaneously, not induced by tail or foot pinch. After recovery, rats were placed back in their home cage and moved to the housing room. Peak pressure, peak latency, apnea duration, and righting latency are shown for the three studies in\nTable 1\n.\nTable\n1.\nPeak Pressure and Acute Signs for Rats Receiving Lateral Fluid Percussion Injury\na\nPeak pressure (psi)\nPeak latency (ms)\nApnea (sec)\nRighting reflex (sec)\nExperiment 1\n18.9\u00b11.3\n19.9\u00b10.9\n12.9\u00b13.3\n519\u00b193\nExperiment 2\n23.2\u00b11.5\n19.5\u00b10.8\n11.0\u00b11.3\n510\u00b133\nExperiment 3\n19.5\u00b11.4\n19.7\u00b10.9\n13.0\u00b15.5\n554\u00b134\nOpen in a separate window\na\nMean\u00b1standard error of the mean.\n\nAcoustic startle response\nASR was assessed before injury and then 1, 7, and 21 days after injury using procedures previously described.\n24\nRats were placed in holders located on startle sensor platforms (Coulbourn Instruments, Langhorne, PA). A 15-min test session consisted of the presentation of 24 white noise bursts (100\u2009ms with a 5-ms rise/fall time). Acoustic stimuli with three different intensities (82-, 92- or 102-dB) were presented in pseudorandom order in which each intensity was presented in each block of three trials (eight repetitions of each intensity). The interstimulus interval varied between 15 and 25\u2009sec. Startle responses were analyzed offline. The test chamber was wiped with a soap solution between the testing of each rat.\nA startle response was scored if movement exceeded a response threshold during a 250-ms window starting at the onset of the stimulus. If movement did not exceed the threshold, no startle response was scored for that trial. A baseline period consisting of 250\u2009ms preceding stimulus onset was used to determine the response threshold. Response threshold was equal to the sum of the maximum amplitude during the baseline period and 4\u00d7 standard deviation of the baseline activity. Two measures of ASR were calculated at each stimulus intensity: sensitivity and amplitude. Sensitivity is the probability of a startle response. Amplitude is the magnitude of the startle response. Trials in which movement did not reach threshold (i.e., no startle response) are not included in the calculation of startle amplitude. However, for rats in which no response was evident for all eight trials of an intensity in a session, a true zero was recorded for that stimulus intensity.\n\nWorking memory\nWorking memory was assessed in a water maze before injury and then 1, 7, and 21 days after injury using a procedure similar to that described in Kobori and colleagues.\n19\nBriefly, rats were trained to find an escape platform (10\u00d710\u2009cm) located below the water surface in a pool (1.5\u2009m diameter). A session consisted of 12 trials (one session per day). Each trial had two phases (sample phase followed by choice phase). During the sample phase, the escape platform was placed randomly in the pool. Rats were started from a predetermined location, but never in the quadrant with the escape platform, and allowed 60\u2009sec to search for the platform. If the rat did not find the platform within 60\u2009sec, it was led to the platform. The choice phase commenced after a variable retention interval of 0, 15, or 60\u2009sec. The start location and the escape platform location were the same as in the sample phase. The rat was allowed 60\u2009sec to find the escape platform. The rat was put in a holding cage for 10\u2009min before the next trial commenced. For each session, the locations of the start and escape platform were distributed such that each quadrant was used on three trials as a start location and on three trials containing the escape platform. In addition, the three retention intervals were utilized four times in a session. Swim paths were recorded for offline analysis of path efficiency (straight-line distance between start and escape platform location/total distance traveled; a value of 1 indicates the most efficient path) and swim speed.\n\nPain sensitivity\nAt 24\u2009h postinjury, rats were tested for pain sensitivity on a hotplate. The surface of the plate was heated to 52\u00b0C and maintained at this temperature. After a rat was placed on the plate, latency to lick either of the front two paws was recorded and the rat was removed from the hotplate.\n\nHistology\nAfter behavioral testing, rats were perfused with formalin or 4% paraformaldehyde, and brains were removed and examined for gross brain damage (i.e., cavitation) at the site of the craniectomy. Rats with gross damage were excluded from further analysis. In some rats sacrificed 1 day after injury, brains were further processed for analysis using light microscopy. After postfixation overnight in formalin, brains were transferred to a 30% sucrose solution. Brains were sectioned at 50\u2009\u03bcm on a freezing sliding microtome and stained with cresyl violet or Fluoro-Jade C (Millipore, Billerica, MA).\n25\n,\n26\nFor the Fluoro-Jade stain, sections were incubated in 70% ethanol for 2\u2009min, washed in distilled water, and then followed by incubation in 0.06% potassium permanganate for 10\u2009min and a wash. Sections were incubated in 0.0001% Fluoro-Jade C with 0.001% acetic acid for 10\u2009min. After a final wash, sections were dried, rinsed in xylene, and cover slipped with DPX. Neurons labeled by Fluoro-Jade C were visualized using a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set on a Leica DM4000B-M microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Quantification of neurons stained with Fluoro-Jade C or cresyl violet was accomplished by unbiased stereology using the optical fractionator method (40\u00d7 objective, Stereo Investigator v.9.10.5; MicroBrightField, Colchester, VT). Areas examined were the cortex below the craniectomy and corresponding contralateral site, both hippocampi because of the importance of this brain region in spatial working memory, and the PnC and the cochlear nucleus because these nuclei are part of the essential neural circuit for ASR.\n5\nThe cortex was examined from midline to the rhinal fissure between the anterior and posterior extents of the craniectomy. A similar cortical region contralateral to the craniectomy was evaluated. Further, between the anterior and posterior extents of the craniectomy, dorsal hippocampus, including CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus, were investigated bilaterally. For the cortex, hippocampus, and PnC, four sections equally spaced throughout each brain region were counted.\n\nStatistical analysis\nValues are expressed as mean\u00b1standard error of the mean. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows (version 12.0.1; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) with \u03b1=0.05. Effects of mTBI on Fluoro-Jade C staining were assessed in a mixed-design analysis of variance (ANOVA) with injury as a between-subject factor and brain region and side as within-subject factors. Total numbers of giant PnC cells in sham and mTBI groups were compared with an independent-samples\nt\n-test. Effects of mTBI on ASR sensitivity and amplitude were determined by a mixed-design ANOVA with injury as a between-subjects factor and session (preinjury or various times postinjury) and intensity as within-subject factors. Effects of mTBI on working memory were assessed in a mixed-design ANOVA with injury as a between-subjects factor and time, retention interval, and phase (sample or choice phase) as within-subject factors. Follow-up post-hoc analysis was performed using the\nF\n-test. When repeated-measures factors failed sphericity tests, Greenhouse-Geisser's correction was performed. When uncorrected and corrected\np\nvalues were less than the level of significance (\u03b1=0.05), the uncorrected\np\nvalue was reported. When the corrected\np\nvalue was greater and the uncorrected\np\nvalue less than \u03b1=0.05, both uncorrected and corrected\np\nvalues were reported. Hotplate measures were evaluated using a Student's\nt\n-test. Comparisons of peak impact pressure and acute signs between experiments were performed using a one-way ANOVA with Tukey's honest significant difference test for post-hoc comparisons."

Female cPLA2\u2212/\u2212mice and wild-type (WT) littermates (12 weeks) generated from heterozygous breeding pairs at Indiana University School of Medicine Laboratory Animal Resource Center (Indianapolis, IN) were used in this study. Mice were maintained on a 12:12 light/dark cycle with food and water freely available. A total of 38 animals were used for the study and were divided into five groups: sham-operated (n=6); SCI (n=8); SCI+ATK (arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone;n=8); WT SCI (n=8); and cPLA2knockout (KO) SCI (n=8). All surgical interventions and postoperative animal care were performed in accord with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council) and were approved by the Indiana University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nSpinal cord contusion and treatment\nMice were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 2.5% Avertin (2,2,2-tribromo-ethanol, 0.15\u2009mL/10\u2009g body weight; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). A T10 laminectomy was performed to expose the underlying thoracic spinal cord segment(s), and animals received a (60-kDyne) contusion injury using an Infinity Horizon impactor. Spinal cord injury at the T10 vertebra (T12\u2013T13 spinal cord)\n18\nwas intended to preserve central pattern generators at L1\u2013L2 required for locomotor function, as well as the relevant motoneurons for our analysis. Sham control animals received laminectomy only. After injury, muscles and skin were closed in layers, and animals were placed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled chamber overnight. Manual bladder expression was carried out at least three times daily until reflex bladder emptying was established.\nAfter contusion injury, mice were treated with a potent, selective slow-binding inhibitor of cPLA\n2\n, ATK.\n19\nATK (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor MI) was injected intravenously (50\u2009\u03bcL of 4\u2009mM) at 30\u2009min after injury; mice received additional ATK injections administered i.p. (200\u2009\u03bcL of 4\u2009mM) on every other day up to 2 weeks postinjury; another group of SCI animals received vehicle injections. The dose and treatment regimens were selected based on our previous publication\n13\nand a previously published report.\n20\nAnimals were allowed to survive for 4 weeks after SCI, a length of time sufficient to observe induced effects on motoneuron morphology.\n6\n,\n21\u201323\nAn additional group of age-matched, sham-injured (laminectomy-only) females served as normal controls.\n\nInjection of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to cholera toxin B subunit\nFour weeks after injury, animals were reanesthetized, and the left vastus lateralis muscle of the quadriceps was exposed and injected with horseradish peroxidase conjugated to the cholera toxin B subunit (BHRP; 0.5\u2009\u03bcL, 0.2%; List Biological, Inc., Campbell, CA). BHRP labeling permits population-level quantitative analysis of motoneuron somal and dendritic morphologies.\n24\n,\n25\nForty-eight hours after BHRP injection, a period that ensures optimal labeling of motoneurons,\n24\n,\n25\nanimals were weighed and received a lethal dose of Nembutal (60\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) and were then perfused intracardially with saline, followed by cold fixative (1% paraformaldehyde/1.25% glutaraldehyde).\n\nTissue processing, histology, and lesion assessments\nA 12-mm thoracic spinal cord segment, including the lesion, was removed, postfixed overnight in the same fixative as used for perfusion, and transferred to sucrose phosphate buffer (30% w/v; pH 7.4). Thoracic segments were then embedded in gelatin, frozen, and sectioned transversely at 40\u2009\u03bcm; alternate sections were collected into two series and mounted on gelatin-coated slides. One series was stained with cresyl violet and eosin for assessing lesion and spared tissue volume. Cross-sectional areas of lesion or spared white (WM) and gray matter (GM) for each animal were measured in sections located 240\u2009\u03bcm apart and spanning the entire rostrocaudal extent of the lesion using a video-based morphometry system (Stereo Investigator; MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT) at a final magnification of 202\u00d7. An unbiased estimation of the percentage of spared tissue was calculated using Cavalieri's method.\n26\nTotal volume of spared WM and GM was calculated by summing their individual subvolumes.\n27\nIndividual subvolumes of spared tissue were calculated by multiplying the cross-sectional area\nA\n\u00d7\nd\n, where\nd\nrepresents the distance between sections (240\u2009\u03bcm). The percent total volume of spared WM and GM was calculated by dividing the total volume of spared WM and GM by the total tissue volume of the corresponding region (100\u00d7), respectively. Estimation of total and percent total lesion volume was determined using identical procedures. The remaining series of thoracic sections were stained for myelin using Luxol fast blue (LFB), as described previously.\n7\nThe lesion area and total spinal cord area were outlined from a section through the lesion epicenter and sections located either 240\u2009\u03bcm rostral or caudal to the epicenter using Stereo Investigator. The percent lesion area was determined by dividing the lesion area by the spinal cord area from the same section.\n\nMotoneuron morphology and quantification\nThe vastus lateralis muscle is innervated by motoneurons located in column 3 of the lateral motor column in the L2 spinal segment.\n28\u201330\nAfter perfusion, the lumbar portion of the spinal cord of each animal was removed, postfixed for 5\u2009h in the same fixative as used for perfusion, and then transferred to sucrose phosphate buffer (10% w/v; pH 7.4) overnight for cryoprotection. Spinal cords were then embedded in gelatin, frozen, and sectioned transversely at 40\u2009\u03bcm; all sections were collected into four alternate series. One series was stained with thionin for use in cell counts. For visualization of BHRP, the three remaining series were immediately reacted using a modified tetramethyl benzidine protocol,\n5\nmounted on gelatin-coated slides, and counterstained with thionin.\nMotoneurons innervating the quadriceps muscles do not form a discrete nucleus, but instead are contained within the large continuous populations of motoneurons located within the lateral motor column. Thus, to identify the appropriate area within the lateral motor column for motoneuron counts in the unreacted series, we used a method similar to that of Little and colleagues.\n6\nBriefly, for each animal, the range of sections in which motoneurons labeled with BHRP after injection into the vastus lateralis muscle were present in the reacted series was identified, and then motoneuron counts were performed in the appropriate matching sections in the unreacted series. For each animal, estimates of the total number of motoneurons in the left and right lateral motor columns were obtained using the optical disector method, as previously described.\n6\nCounts were made at 937.5\u00d7under brightfield illumination. Motoneurons are easily recognizable as large, darkly staining, multipolar cells. A counting frame (110\u00d780\u2009\u03bcm) was moved systematically throughout an area of each ventral horn (approximately 350\u00d7350\u2009\u03bcm, defined by the actual distribution of BHRP-labeled somata from all of the animals used in the study) in each section within the identified range. Only motoneurons in which there was a clear nucleus and nucleolus were counted, provided they did not contact the forbidden lines of the counting frame; motoneuron nucleoli were counted as they appeared while focusing through the z-axis, and nucleoli in the first focal plane (i.e., \u201ctops\u201d) were excluded to avoid double counting. Motoneuron counts were derived from a mean of 5.33 sections spaced 480\u2009\u03bcm apart and distributed uniformly through the entire rostrocaudal extent of the quadriceps motoneuron pool range. Cell counts for each animal were corrected for the proportion of sections sampled.\nUsing similar methods, the number of BHRP-labeled motoneurons was assessed in all sections of the reacted series through the entire rostrocaudal extent of their distribution for all animals. Counts of labeled quadriceps motoneurons were made under brightfield illumination, where somata could be visualized and cytoplasmic inclusion of BHRP reaction product confirmed.\n\nSoma volume\nThe volume of quadriceps motoneuron somata was assessed in at least one set of alternate sections (160\u2009\u03bcm apart) using the nucleator method.\n31\nA set of four rays emanating from a point randomly chosen within each BHRP-labeled motoneuron soma was drawn and oriented randomly. Soma volumes of an average of 28.1 motoneurons were measured for each animal using Stereo Investigator at a final magnification of 780\u00d7. Soma volumes within each animal were then averaged for statistical analysis.\n\nDendritic length\nFor each animal, dendritic lengths in a single representative set of alternate sections were measured under darkfield illumination. Beginning with the first section in which BHRP-labeled fibers were present, labeling through the entire rostrocaudal extent of the quadriceps motoneuron dendritic field was assessed in every third section (480\u2009\u03bcm apart) in three dimensions using a computer-based morphometry system (Neurolucida; MBF Bioscience) at a final magnification of 250\u00d7. Average dendritic length per labeled motoneuron was estimated by summing the measured dendritic lengths of the series of sections, multiplying by three to correct for sampling, then dividing by the total number of labeled motoneurons in that series. This method does not attempt to assess the actual total dendritic length of labeled motoneurons,\n32\nbut has been shown to be a sensitive, reliable indicator of changes in dendritic morphology in normal development,\n24\n,\n33\n,\n34\nafter changes in dendritic interactions\n33\nand afferent input,\n35\u201337\nas well as after injury.\n6\n,\n21\u201323\n,\n38\n\nDendritic distribution\nTo assess potential redistributions of dendrites across treatment groups, for each animal, the composite dendritic arbor created in the length analysis was divided using a set of axes oriented radially around the center of the collective labeled somata. These axes divided the spinal cord into 12 bins of 30 degrees each. The portion of each animal's dendritic arbor per labeled motoneuron contained within each location was then determined. This method provides a sensitive measure of dendritic redistribution in response to changes in dendritic interactions\n33\nand afferent input.\n35\n,\n36\n\nDendritic extent\nComparability of BHRP labeling across groups was assessed by quantifying both the rostrocaudal and the radial extent of quadriceps motoneuron dendritic arbors. The rostrocaudal extent of the dendritic arbor was determined by recording the rostrocaudal distance spanned by quadriceps motoneuron dendrites for each animal. The maximal radial extent of the arbor in the transverse plane was also measured for each animal, using a set of axes oriented radially around the center of the collective labeled somata. These axes divided the spinal cord into 12 bins of 30 degrees each. For each bin, the linear distance between the center of the quadriceps motor pool and the most distal BHRP-filled process was measured. Radial dendritic extent is independent of overall dendritic length and reflects the maximal linear distance (in the transverse plane) of BHRP transport to the most distal dendritic processes.\n\nMuscle fiber and motor endplate morphology\nThe right vastus lateralis muscles were removed immediately after perfusion and weighed. Muscles were then postfixed overnight in the same fixative as used for perfusion and then transferred to sucrose phosphate buffer (10% w/v; pH 7.4). Muscles were then rinsed in distilled water, blocked into proximal and distal segments, and flash-frozen in 2-methylbutane. Muscle segments were then sectioned (45\u2009\u03bcm) either transversely (for examination of muscle fiber cross-sectional area) or longitudinally (for examination of motor endplate area and density) on a cryostat at \u221220\u00b0C and thaw-mounted onto glass slides. Muscle fiber cross-sectional area was assessed after staining with Milligan's trichrome stain. Motor endplate size and density were assessed after staining for acetylcholinesterase using Roots-Karnovsky's method.\n39\nCross-sectional muscle fiber area and motor endplate size were measured under brightfield illumination using Stereo Investigator. To obtain accurate measures of motor endplate size, only\nen face\nprofiles were traced. An average of 32.5 muscle fibers and 30.0 endplates were measured for each animal at a final magnification of 510\u00d7. The number of motor endplates per muscle fiber was estimated by counting the number of muscle fibers and endplates in a grid (1\u00d71\u2009mm), randomly placed on the muscle section (one sample field per section, five muscle sections per animal). An average of 139.8 muscle fibers per animal was examined. Fiber and endplate areas within each animal were then averaged for statistical analysis.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data are presented as mean\u00b1standard error of the mean (SEM) and were analyzed by\nt\n-tests or analyses of variance (ANOVA; one way, two way, or repeated measures, as appropriate) followed by post-hoc analyses using Fisher's least significant difference (LSD). Digital light micrographs were obtained using an MDS 290 digital camera system (Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, NY). Brightness and contrast of these images were adjusted in Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA)."

    "Methods": "Spinal cord injury\nAdult male C57BL/6 (18\u201322\u2009g; Samtako, Osan, Korea) mice were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (500\u2009mg/kg), and a laminectomy was performed at the T9 level, exposing the cord beneath without disrupting the dura, as previously described.\n12\nThe spinous processes of T8 and T11 were then clamped to stabilize the spine, and the exposed dorsal surface of the cord was subjected to moderate contusion injury (50 kdyn force per 500- to 600-\u03bcm displacement) using an Infinite Horizons impactor (Infinite Horizons Inc., Lexington, KY). For sham-operated controls, animals underwent a T9 laminectomy without contusion injury. Surgical interventions and postoperative animal care were performed in accord with the Guidelines and Policies for Rodent Survival Surgery provided by the Animal Care Committee of Kyung Hee University (Seoul, Korea).\n\nDrug treatment\nFluoxetine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) dissolved in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was immediately administered into injured mice by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection (10\u2009mg/kg) after SCI and then further treated once a day for 14 days for analysis of loss of myelin and axons or for the indicated time points, as previously described.\n12\nTo determine the therapeutic time window, fluoxetine (10\u2009mg/kg) was also administered at 2, 6, and 12\u2009h after SCI and further treated with the same dose once a day for 14 days. PBS was administered for vehicle control. All data presented here are from experiments with fluoxetine administration starting immediately after injury, except in\nFigure 8\n. For sham-operated controls, animals underwent a T9 laminectomy without contusion injury and received no pharmacological treatment. Significant side effects, such as changes in body weight or an increase in mortality, resulting from fluoxetine treatment were not observed during our experiments.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 8.\nDelayed administration of fluoxetine improves functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI). After SCI, fluoxetine (10\u2009mg/kg) was administered at 2, 6, and 12\u2009h after injury and then treated with the same dose of fluoxetine once a day for 14 day, and functional recovery was assessed by BMS score and BMS subscore (\nn\n=10). Fluoxetine treatment (given at 2 and 6\u2009h after injury) significantly improved locomotor function, when compared to vehicle. Values are presented as means\u00b1standard deviation. *\np\n<0.05; **\np\n<0.01 versus vehicle control. BMS, Basso Mouse Scale; d, days.\n\nTissue preparation\nAt the indicated time points after SCI, animals were anesthetized with chloral hydrate and perfused by cardiac puncture initially with 0.1\u2009M of PBS and subsequently with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1\u2009M of PBS. A 20-mm section of spinal cord, centered at the lesion site, was dissected out, postfixed by immersion in the same fixative for 4\u2009h, and placed in 30% sucrose in 0.1\u2009M of PBS (pH 7.4). The segment was embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound for frozen sections, and transverse sections were then cut at 10 or 20\u2009\u03bcm on a cryostat (CM1850; Leica Microsystems Nussloch GmbH, Nussloch, Germany). For molecular work, animals were perfused with 0.1\u2009M of PBS and segments of spinal cord (8\u2009mm), including the lesion site, were isolated and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nAt 5 and 38 days after SCI, frozen sections were processed for immunofluorescence (IF) staining or double labeling (\nn\n=18) with antibodies (Abs) against phosphorylated (p)-p38MAPK (1:100; Cell signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), p-c-Jun (1:100; Cell Signaling Technology), cleaved caspase-3 (1:100; Millipore, Billerica, MA), CC1 (1:100; Millipore), CD11b (OX-42; 1:200; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), myelin basic protein (MBP; 1:500; Millipore), and 200-kDa neurofilament protein (NF200; Sigma-Aldrich). Fluorescein isothiocyanate\u2013 or cyanin 3\u2013conjugated secondary Abs were used (Jackson Laboratories, Danvers, MA). Also, nuclei were labeled with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), according to the protocol of the manufacturer's (Invitrogen). For NF200 staining, the ABC method was used to detect labeled cells using a Vectastain kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc,, Burlingame, CA). 3,3\u2032-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) served as the substrate for peroxidase. In all immunohistochemistry controls, reaction to the substrate was absent if the primary Ab was omitted or if the primary Ab was replaced with a nonimmune, control Ab. Some serial sections were also stained with Cresyl violet acetate for histological analysis. For quantification of p-c-Jun and cleaved caspase-3-positive oligodendrocytes, serial transverse sections (10-\u03bcm thickness) were collected every 100\u2009\u03bcm from 8\u2009mm rostral to 8\u2009mm caudal to the lesion epicenter (total, 160 sections), and p-c-Jun/CC1 or cleaved caspase-3/CC1 double-positive oligodendrocytes in the lateral and ventral funiculus of the WM were manually counted, as previously described.\n8\n\nQuantitation of the proportion of resting and activated microglia\nPercentage of field analysis was used to provide a quantitative estimate (proportional) of changes in the activation state of microglia, as previously described.\n3\n,\n14\nAfter IF staining with CD11b Ab (Millipore), images were taken with an Olympus BX-52 microscope connected by a CoolSNAP digital camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ). Quantitative analysis was performed by blinded observers (S.R.K. and T.Y.Y.) by using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). For cell-density determination, the number of positively labeled cells was counted for a predefined area of ventral horn. Resting and activated microglia were classified and counted based on a previous report.\n3\n,\n14\n,\n15\nResting microglia displayed small compact somata bearing long, thin, ramified processes. Activated microglia exhibited marked cellular hypertrophy and retraction of processes, such that the process length was less than the diameter of the soma compartment. Cells were sampled only if the nucleus was visible within the plane of section and if cell profiles exhibited distinctly delineated borders. Background levels of signal were subtracted, and control and experimental conditions were evaluated in identical manners.\n\nRNA isolation and real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction\nTotal RNA was isolated from spinal cords at 5 days (\nn\n=9) after injury using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Complementary DNA was synthesized from 5\u2009\u03bcg of the total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and real-time polymerase chain reation (PCR) was performed using SYBR Green PCR master mix (Invitrogen), as previous described.\n16\nPrimers used for NGF and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were synthesized by Genotech (Daejeon, Korea), and the sequences of the primers are as follows (5\u2032-3\u2032): NGF forward, 5\u2032-CAG GCA GAA CCG TAC ACA GA-3\u2032, reverse, 5\u2032-GTC CGA AGA CCT GGG TGG AG-3\u2032; GAPDH forward, 5\u2032- AAC TTT GGC ATT GTG GAA GG-3\u2032; reverse, 5\u2032- GGA GAC AAC CTG GTC CTC AG-3\u2032.\n\nWestern blot\nFor Western blot analysis, segments of spinal cord (8\u2009mm) containing the lesion site were isolated and the tissue homogenates were prepared (\nn\n=24), as previously described.\n12\nTotal protein was prepared with a lysis buffer containing 50\u2009mM of Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150\u2009mM of NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 10\u2009mM of Na\n2\nP\n2\nO\n7\n, 10\u2009mM of NaF, 10\u2009\u03bcg/mL of aprotinin, 10\u2009\u03bcg/mL of leupeptin, 1\u2009mM of sodium vanadate, and 1\u2009mM of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Tissue homogenates were incubated for 20\u2009min at 4\u00b0C and centrifuged at 25,000\ng\nfor 30\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. Protein sample (50\u2009\u03bcg) was separated on SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat skim milk or 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline solution with 0.1% Tween 20 for 1\u2009h at room temperature and then incubated with primary Abs against p-p38-MAPK (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), p38-MAPK (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), pro-NGF (1:1000; Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel), p-c-Jun (1:1000; Cell signaling Technology), c-Jun (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), cleaved caspase-3 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), MBP (1:500; Millipore), and RhoA (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Membranes were then processed with horseradish-peroxidase\u2013conjugated secondary Ab (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using Supersignal\n\u2122\n(Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Experiments were repeated three times to ensure reproducibility. Densitometric values of the bands on Western blots obtained by AlphaImager software (Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA) were subjected to statistical analysis. Background in films was subtracted from optical density measurements.\n\nPull-down assay for Ras homolog gene family member A activity\nPurification of glutathione\nS\n-transferase (GST)/Rho-binding protein domain (RBD) was performed as described previously.\n7\nAt 5 days after injury, frozen spinal cord tissue was homogenized in a modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing 50\u2009mM of Tris (pH 7.2), 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 500\u2009mM of NaCl, 10\u2009mM of MgCl\n2\n, 1\u2009\u03bcg/mL of aprotinin, 10\u2009\u03bcg/mL of leupeptin, and 1\u2009mM of PMSF (\nn\n=9). Homogenates were clarified by centrifugation twice for 10\u2009min at 13,000\ng\nat 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was incubated for 50\u2009min at 4\u00b0C with GST-RBD\u2013coupled beads (30\u2009\u03bcg/sample). Beads were washed four times with lysis buffer and eluted in sample buffer. Trimeric G-protein (GTP)-bound RhoA and total RhoA present in tissue homogenates were detected by Western blot.\n\nTerminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling staining\nFive days after injury, serial spinal cord sections (20-\u03bcm thickness) were collected every 200\u2009\u03bcm and processed for terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining by using the Apoptag\nin situ\nkit (Millipore), according to the manufacturer's instructions (\nn\n=10). A DAB substrate kit (Vector Laboratories) was used for peroxidase staining, and sections were then counterstained with methyl green. Negative control sections were treated similarly, but incubated in the absence of TdT enzyme, dUTP-digoxigenin, or antidigoxigenin Ab, and positive control sections were incubated in DNase1. Only those cells showing morphological features of nuclear condensation and/or compartmentalization in the WM were counted as TUNEL positive. The investigators who were blind as to the experimental conditions carried out TUNEL analysis. Quantification was assessed by blinded observers (T.Y.Y. and T.H.O.). TUNEL-positive cells in both lateral and ventral funiculus of the WM from 8\u2009mm rostral to 8\u2009mm caudal to the lesion epicenter (total, 80 sections) were manually counted.\n\nMyelin staining\nMyelin staining was performed as described previously.\n7\nMice treated with vehicle or fluoxetine were anesthetized at 38 days after injury, and frozen sections were prepared as described above. For Luxol fast blue (LFB) staining for myelin, serial transverse cryosections (16-\u03bcm thickness) were incubated in 0.1% LFB (Solvent Blue 38; Sigma-Aldrich) in acidified 95% ethanol overnight at 60\u00b0C. Differentiation was performed with 0.05% lithium carbonate and 70% ethyl alcohol.\n\nQuantitation of the spared axons\nAt 38 days after injury, spinal sections were prepared as described above. Axons were stained using an Ab specific for NF200. For quantitative analysis of axonal densities, serial transverse cryosections (10-\u03bcm thickness) were collected every millimeter section rostral and caudal 3\u2009mm to the lesion site. Axonal densities were determined within preselected fields (40\u00d740\u2009\u03bcm, 1600\u2009\u03bcm\n2\n) in the ventral funiculus, as previously described.\n7\nThe location of these sites was carefully conserved from group to group using anatomical landmarks, and neurofilament-stained axons were manually counted from each field. The number of axons in vehicle- or fluoxetine-treated spinal cord is expressed as a percentage relative to that in sham control (100%). Quantification was assessed by blinded observers (T.Y.Y. and T.H.O.).\n\nBehavioral tests\nLocomotor outcome after spinal cord contusion injury was assessed using the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS;\nn\n=50).\n17\nMice were scored in an open-field environment by blinded observers (S.R.K. and T.Y.Y.). Consensus scores for each animal were averaged at each time point for a maximum of 9 points for the BMS score and 11 points for the subscore, which assess finer aspects of locomotion.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented as the mean\u00b1standard deviation values. Comparison in between vehicle- and fluoxetine-treated groups were made by an unpaired Student's\nt\n-test. Multiple comparisons between groups were performed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Quantitative analysis of axonal densities was analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA (distance vs. treatment). Behavioral scores from BMS score and BMS subscore were analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA (time vs. treatment). Tukey's multiple comparison was used as post-hoc analysis. Statistical significance was accepted with\np\n<0.05. All statistical analyses were performed by SPSS software (15.0; SPSS Science, Chicago, IL)."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nThis study was approved by the research ethics board governing the institution. Participants were recruited from the Calgary Complex Concussion and Traumatic Brain Injury Program at the Alberta Children's Hospital (Calgary, Alberta, Canada). mTBI was defined as any direct or indirect biomechanical force resulting in a change in neurological state\nwithout\nthe following: loss of consciousness for more than 20\u2009min, focal neurological deficits, and/or post-traumatic amnesia for more than 24\u2009h.\n39\nThe terms mTBI and concussion are often used interchangeably, with the term concussion used more often in sports medicine or as a subset of mTBI.\n40\n,\n41\nAs a result, for this article, mTBI and concussion were not differentiated. PCSs were recorded using the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire.\n42\nControls were healthy children with with no previous history of TBI. Exclusion criteria included use of neuroactive medication, regular use of alcohol or recreational drugs, and presence of skull fractures. All participants were right handed. Informed consent was obtained from all participants and legal guardians before participation.\n\nFunctional near-infrared spectroscopy system\nA continuous-wave, diffuse optical system was used for data collection (CW5; TechEn, Inc., Milford, MA).\n43\nNear-infrared light for source optodes was supplied by diode lasers, and detector optodes were avalanche photodiodes. A head pad consisting of four source and eight detector optodes, 2.0\u2009cm apart, was placed over the location of the motor cortex of each hemisphere (\nFig. 1\n). Positioning was based on the standard 10\u201320 electroencephalogram (EEG) protocol at 40% of the measured distance from nasion to inion.\n24\n,\n44\n,\n45\nEach pad was held in place by a velcro strap placed in the coronal orientation and tightened for comfort. Pads were then connected to one another, and hair was moved out of the way for optimal contact of the optodes with the scalp.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\n(\nA\n) Participant setup, showing the position of the head cap. (\nB\n) Diagram of the source and detector fiber pattern.\n\nStudy paradigm\nTo minimize background noise, room lights were dimmed and the room was kept quiet. The participant was positioned comfortably in a chair and was asked to limit movement. Data were then collected for 300\u2009sec while the subject rested. The subject was then asked to perform a motor task, which consisted of tapping the index and middle finger of the right hand to the thumb at a rate of 1\u2009Hz, as paced by an audio metronome. Task periods lasted 15\u2009sec and alternated with 30\u2009sec of rest. Total task time was 300\u2009sec.\n\nCalculation of hemoglobin concentration change during the motor task\nAll measurements were based on changes in chromophore concentrations corresponding to optimal absorbance for deoxy-Hb and oxy-Hb at wavelengths of 690 and 830\u2009nm, respectively. Preprocessing of raw optical density (OD) by a CW Filter (TechEn designed program; TechEn, Inc., Milford, MA) down-sampled data from 200 to 100\u2009Hz. These were down-sampled to 10\u2009Hz using MATLAB (The MathWorks, Natick, MA). Identification of each source-detector pair was accomplished by Fourier transform of the received signal.\n46\nNext, a graphical user interface software package was used to process the filtered OD data (HoMER; TechEn, Inc.). A low-pass filter of 0.8\u2009Hz was applied to the data, which were then converted to change in OD as a function of time for each source-detector pair. Changes in total Hb, deoxy-Hb, and oxy-Hb were calculated using a modified Beer-Lambert law.\n43\nIn order to calculate concentration changes in each of the total Hb, deoxy-Hb, and oxy-Hb during the motor task, for each source-detector pair, data during the rest periods 5\u2009sec preceding task commencement were averaged and subtracted from averaged data during the last 10\u2009sec of the motor task periods. Using MATLAB (The Mathworks), a tomographical map of the average change in chromophore concentration (in micromolar units) during the motor task was generated. For each participant, the changes in concentration of total-Hb (\u0394-total-Hb), deoxy-Hb (\u0394-deoxy-Hb), and oxy-Hb (\u0394-oxy-Hb) were averaged over the source-detector pair exhibiting the maximum change during finger tapping and the three nearest source-detector pairs.\n\nCoherence analysis\nIn this study, we used coherence as the measure of connectivity. Coherence is an estimate of a linear-time variant relationship of two time-varying signals, at a particular frequency, on a scale of 0\u20131. A value of 1 indicates a complete linear relationship and 0 indicates no relationship. That is, coherence determines connectivity in terms of the common temporal frequencies between two signals. The calculation of coherence for fNIRS data has been described previously by our group.\n24\nThe source-detector pair exhibiting the greatest change in total Hb and oxy-Hb during the tapping task was chosen as the reference, whose signal during the 300-sec rest period was compared with all other source-detector pairs by coherence analysis. Tomographical maps of coherence within the frequency range of 0.04\u20130.10\u2009Hz were then computed using software written in MATLAB (The MathWorks). For each participant, coherence was averaged over the three source-detector pairs surrounding the reference region in the ipsilateral hemisphere (i.e., the reference source-detector pair was excluded, given that the coherence is equal to 1 at that location), as well as over the four anatomically homologous source-detector pairs in the contralateral hemisphere.\nCoherence analysis was repeated for data collected during the finger-tapping task, to see whether coherence at resting-state frequencies (0.04\u20130.10\u2009Hz) was modulated differentially between participant groups during the performance of the motor task.\n\nStatistical analysis\nMeans, standard deviations, and ranges were used to describe the samples. Kolmogorov-Smirnov's test was used to test for normal distribution of the data. Between-group chromophore magnitude of change (\u0394-total-Hb and \u0394-oxy-Hb) during motor task performance was compared using the Student's\nt\n-test. Differences in mean coherence between hemispheres and participant groups were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA). In order to allow for multiple comparisons, Tukey's post-hoc analysis was used to compare means through pair-wise comparisons. We examined the direction of change in coherence within each hemisphere with task activation using paired\nt\n-tests."

    "Methods": "Participants\nThe present study was funded by the Health Services Research and Development (HSR&D) service of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The main study's purpose was to examine the sensitivity and specificity of screening measures and comprehensive evaluations for persisting symptoms following mTBI sustained during OIF/OEF deployments. As part of that study, extensive neuropsychological and psychological evaluations were conducted on 438 OIF/OEF veterans identified at Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) in Lexington, KY, Tucson, AZ, and Hines, IL. Participants were recruited through three strategies: 1) Veterans were referred to research staff by polytrauma clinic staff; 2) A random sampling of veterans was mailed an introductory letter along with an opt-out postcard. If a veteran did not return the postcard then they were contacted by phone; and 3) Study flyers were disseminated at large events frequented by OIF/OEF veterans. It should be noted that the present sample potentially included all veteran participants from the three centers involved, whereas the previous report by Shandera-Ocshner and colleagues was based on a subset of participants from the Lexington VAMC alone (\nn\n=81).\n33\nApproval for the study was obtained from the VA Centralized Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the Lexington, Tucson, and Hines VA Medical Center Research and Development Committees. Informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act authorization were obtained from all study participants. Veterans were required to complete full-day clinical or research test batteries and were paid $160 for their participation.\n\nMeasures\nAll tests were administered on a single day with a minimum of two breaks. The order of tests was fixed for all participants and the evaluation took approximately 4\u20136\u2009h. Since projections indicate that approximately 40% of mTBI claims and 20\u201330% of PTSD claims contain probable invalid symptom reporting,\n34\n,\n35\nseveral tests of psychiatric symptom validity or inadequate effort were incorporated in the test battery. As noted earlier, much of the current research has not studied the issue of effort in this particular context. All participants were administered the Letter Memory Test (LMT), which is a 45-item, forced-choice recognition task that uses letters as stimuli and manipulates apparent difficulty level through variation of the number of letters to be remembered and the number of choices from which the target stimulus must be selected.\n36\nInman and colleagues found that the LMT discriminated poorly motivated from well-motivated groups at a moderately high level of accuracy and had high internal consistency reliability.\n36\nA recent meta-analysis showed LMT efficacy in differentiating feigned and honest responders to be comparable to the Word Memory Test (WMT), the Digit Memory Test (DMT), and the Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM).\n37\nUsing the optimal cut-rate of 93%, the LMT has moderate sensitivity (70.2%) and high specificity (93%) to detect feigning.\n37\nThe participants also were administered the Miller Forensic Assessment of Symptoms Test (M-FAST), a 25-item structured interview designed to screen for invalid psychiatric symptoms.\n38\nAll participants also completed the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF).\n39\nThe MMPI-2-RF is a 338-item self-report measure of personality and psychopathology, a revised version of the MMPI-2. The MMPI-2-RF contains embedded validity scales designed to detect random responding, faking-bad, defensiveness, and other problematic response sets. Mason and colleagues examined the sensitivity of the MMPI-2-RF validity scales at detecting feigned PTSD symptoms.\n40\nThe authors found that using a cut-off of 100T on the revised F scale provided optimal sensitivity and specificity for detecting feigned PTSD.\nTo assess for PTSD, participants were administered the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). Regarded as the gold standard diagnostic assessment tool for PTSD, the CAPS is a structured interview used clinically to determine whether a person meets DSM-IV criteria for PTSD.\n41\nThe measure has 30 items and takes approximately 45\u2009min to 1\u2009h to administer. Determination of mTBI was made utilizing a Structured Interview for TBI Diagnosis in OEF/OIF Veterans, based on an interview validated by Donnelly and colleagues at the BuffaloVA.\n42\nA veteran was considered to have sustained a deployment mTBI if the criteria provided by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine were met by his or her responses to the TBI interview questions regarding loss of consciousness and alteration of consciousness with likelihood of mTBI rated as \u201calmost certainly\u201d or \u201cvery likely.\u201d\n43\nThe form was modified by researchers at the Lexington, Tucson, and Hines VAs for use in the multi-site study.\nAll participants also were administered the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The BDI-II is a 21-item self-report measure that assesses the presence and severity of symptoms of depression.\n44\nThe BDI-II has excellent reliability, an internal consistency alpha of 0.92, and one week test\u2013retest correlation of 0.93. The BAI is a 21-item self-report measure that assesses the presence and severity of anxiety symptoms.\n45\nThe BAI has high internal consistency (alpha=0.92) in outpatients and good test-retest reliability after one week (\nr\n=0.75).\nAll participants were administered the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR),\n46\nwhich uses irregular word reading ability and demographic information to estimate pre-morbid Full Scale IQ (FSIQ). The California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II) was administered to measure verbal memory ability. The CVLT-II involves oral presentation of a 16-item word list over five learning trials, an interference trial, short-delay recall (free and cued portions), 20-min \u201clong-delay\u201d recall, and recognition trials.\n47\nThe Conners' Continuous Performance Task (CPT-II) was administered as a measure of attention, response speed, variability, errors in failing to inhibit a response, and errors in failing to respond. The CPT-II is a computerized test that requires the participant to make a response to all stimuli (letters) that appear on the screen except for the letter \u201cx.\u201d\n48\nThe rate at which the stimuli appear varies throughout the test.\nParticipants also were administered the \u201cclassic\u201d neuropsychological tests of executive functioning (Trail-Making Test, Verbal Fluency, Figural Fluency, Stroop) subtests of the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS). The D-KEFS provides a standardized method of examination of executive function sub-systems and a consistent normative group on which to base interpretations.\n49\nReliability and validity data for the D-KEFS subtests used in the current study indicate good psychometric properties overall. Test\u2013retest reliability (average interval length of 25\u2009d) correlations fall in the moderate to high range for the Trail Making Tests, Verbal Fluency, and Color-Word with some evidence of practice effects.\nThe Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) is known as the \u201cgold standard\u201d intelligence test in the assessment of adults.\n50\nAll participants were administered two of the 10 core subtests\u2014Coding and Symbol Search\u2014allowing for the calculation of the Processing Speed Index (PSI).\n\nSelection of study sample\nSubjects from the primary study database were potentially included in the present study sample if they met the recommended cutting scores for the aforementioned effort tests. Of the 438 veterans seen for clinical and/or research purposes at the Lexington, Tucson, and Hines VAMCs during the 15-month duration of the study, 75 were excluded from data analyses because they violated the recommended cutoff scores on one or more of the effort tests or validity scales: 33 scored less than 93% on LMT, 40 scored above 6 on M-FAST, four scored above 80T on Variable Response Inconsistency, six scored above 80T on True Response Inconsistency, 10 scored above 80T on L Scale, and 48 scored above 100T on F Scale (the recommended cut-off score suggested for invalid PTSD responding).\n39\nOut of the 75 veterans excluded, 43 failed one effort measure, 21 failed two effort measures, and 11 failed three effort measures. Additionally, 34 were excluded due to post-deployment mTBI and 26 were excluded due to history of childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder/attention deficit disorder.\nOther psychiatric and substance abuse diagnoses were not excluded in the present study due to the high prevalence of these diagnoses in OIF/OEF veterans (over 85% of veterans with mTBI and over 40% of those without mTBI) described by Carlson and colleagues.\n51\nAlso, estimates from the literature suggest more than two-thirds of individuals with PTSD have at least one other comorbid Axis I diagnosis.\n52\n,\n53\n\nDiagnostic assignment\nFor veterans remaining after the above noted exclusionary criteria, diagnostic assignment was based on the veteran's responses to a Structured TBI Diagnostic Interview and the CAPS.\n42\n,\n41\nFor purposes of this study, a veteran was considered to have a deployment-related mTBI (mTBI-o) if the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine criteria for mTBI were met as determined by his or her responses to the TBI interview questions.\n51\nA veteran was considered to have PTSD based on the lenient scoring rule (F1/I2) provided in the CAPS manual (PTSD-o). Veterans who met both criteria were assigned to the mTBI+PTSD group and veterans who did not meet criteria for either mTBI or PTSD were assigned to the veteran control group (VC).\n\nProcedures to create comparable groups\nAs previously noted, an important goal of the present study was to compare veteran groups, which were comparable on potentially confounding variables. Therefore, the first author carried out procedures to create such groups, blind to the neuropsychological test performance.\nThe following process was employed in order to make the groups more similar: First, group descriptives were compared to identify significant differences on demographic variables (age, estimated IQ, and education). Initially, the most consistent difference between groups involved the VC group having significantly higher age, education levels, and predicted FSIQ than the mTBI+PTSD group. Therefore, we eliminated outliers on age, education, and higher predicted FSIQ from the VC for whom there were no comparable veterans with either mTBI or PTSD. To do this, seven VC individuals age 51 or older were excluded from data analyses.\nNext, 19 individuals with higher levels of education and higher predicted FSIQ were removed from VC. Because the mTBI+PTSD group had many veterans with lower education achievement and low estimated pre-deployment IQs, 10 veterans were eliminated from the low end of this distribution in this group. Only one veteran was excluded from the PTSD-o group due to an outlying low estimated IQ score. No veterans were excluded from the mTBI-o group. Therefore, of the 288 veterans remaining after the validity screens mentioned above, 37 subjects were excluded in order to make the four groups comparable on age, estimated IQ, and education level."

    "Methods": "Animals, care, and euthanasia\nThree green fluorescent protein (GFP)\u2013expressing Sprague-Dawley female rats (10 weeks) were obtained from the W. M. Keck Center for Collaborative Neuroscience for preliminary studies of the anatomy of the lumbosacral cord and distribution of tibial and peroneal motoneurons. A total of 26 wild-type adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (10 weeks old, 210\u2013230\u2009g) were purchased from Charles River Laboratory for the lumbosacral SCI experiments. The rats were randomized to three injury groups: Sham (laminectomy only,\nn\n=9); 25\u2009mm spinal cord contusion (\nn\n=8); and 50\u2009mm spinal cord contusion (\nn\n=9).\nThe rats were housed in a controlled environment room, and provided with standard rodent chow and water for a week before the study. The rats were maintained in individual rat boxes for six weeks, received bladder expression one to two times daily, and assessed before and weekly after surgery for standing and walking footprints. The rats were euthanized and fixed by perfusion at six to seven weeks. The experimental protocol complies with Rutgers and National Institutes of Health regulations regarding protection of animals used for experimental purposes. The Rutgers Animal Care and Facilities Committee (the equivalent of the institutional animal care and use committee) approved the protocol.\nFor surgical procedures, the rats were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane (5% induction and 1\u20132% maintenance). For euthanasia and fixation, the rats were deeply anesthetized with intraperitoneal injections of ketamine (80\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg). To fix the rats for histology, we opened the chest cavity, inserted a blunt needle through the left ventricle into the aorta, clamped the needle in place, and cut open the right atrium. After injecting one mL of 1% lidocaine to dilate blood vessels, we perfused 200\u2009mL of saline at 35\u2009mL/min to wash out blood, and then 300\u2009mL of 4% paraformaldehyde at 25\u2009mL/min.\n\nRetrograde motoneuronal labeling\nThree transgenic GFP (green-fluorescent-protein) expressing Sprague-Dawley rats and twelve wild-type Sprague-Dawley rats were euthanized seven weeks after SCI. At six weeks after injury, we applied Fluoro-Ruby (FR, Invitrogen, NY) and Fluoro-Gold (FG, Fluorochrome, CO) dyes to the common peroneal and tibial nerves to label motoneurons innervating the nerves. We anesthetized the rats with isoflurane, incised the back of the thigh and knee, blunt-dissected muscles to expose the tibial nerve and common peroneal nerves, cut the nerves with sharp scissors, placed the proximal stumps into small polyethylene tubes containing 2% dye (FR or FG) in saline, sealed the tubes with silicone grease and Vaseline to prevent leakage, and left the tracer in contact with the nerve for at least 1\u2009h. The tube was then removed, the nerve was rinsed in saline, and the skin was sutured.\nOne week later, the rats were anesthetized, perfused, and fixed as described above. The spinal cord were removed, placed in the 30% sucrose/0.1\u2009M phosphate buffer at 4\u00b0C for 24\u2009h, and embedded in OCT compound (Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA). Serial sagittal sections were cut at a thickness of 50\u2009\u03bcm using a cryostat microtome (OTF5000, Bright instrument Co Ltd., Cambridgeshire, UK), washed three times with 0.1\u2009M PBS and cover-slipped with fluorescence-compatible anti-fade mount (Mo1, Biomedia, CA). We imaged sections with an epifluorescent microscope (Axiovert 200M, Zeiss, Germany) and counted FR- and FG-positive motor neurons in all sections using ImageJ software.\nThe L5 to S1 spinal cord segments are located just above and below the junction of T13 and L1 vertebrae. The dorsal root entry zones for L4 and L5 roots were on either side of the junction. The tibial nerve (L4-5, S1-S3) gives off branches to the gastrocnemius, popliteus, soleus, and plantaris muscles, as well as the sensory sural nerve that innervate the lateral foot. The common peroneal nerve (L4-5, S1-2) form the superficial and deep peroneal nerves, innervating the peroneus longus, peroneus brevis, and short head of the biceps femoris muscles.\n\nLumbosacral spinal cord contusion\nWe anesthetized rats with isoflurane (5% induction and 1\u20132% maintenance) using a facemask, shaved the rats, washed the skin with betadine solution, and surgically exposed the L1 dorsal process. After removing the dorsal lamina of L1, we placed a suture to mark the lower margin of T13, and then removed the T13 dorsal lamina. The Sham group received only laminectomy.\nThe MASCIS Impactor (Multicenter Animal SCI Impactor, W.M. Keck Center for Collaborative Neuroscience, Piscataway, NJ) was used to drop a 10\u2009g rod (impactor head diameter, 2.5\u2009mm) from a height of either 25\u2009mm or 50\u2009mm onto the spinal cord at the junction of T13 and L1 vertebral bodies. The dura was not opened. After contusion, we placed a piece of subcutaneous fat on the dural surface to prevent adhesions between the dura and surrounding tissues.\nAfter injury, we manually expressed the bladders of the rats twice daily for a week and once daily as necessary after the first week, injected 6\u2009mL saline subcutaneously daily for 3\u2009d, and gave antibiotics (Cefazolin 50\u2009mg/kg) subcutaneously daily for one week. After the first week, if the rats showed evidence of urinary tract infection ( i.e., hemorrhagic and cloudy urine), they were housed separately from the other rats and given subcutaneous enrofloxacin (Baytril 2.5\u2009mg/kg per day) daily for 10\u2009d. If the urinary tract infection had not resolved within that period, the rats would have been euthanized. None were.\nIf the rats had shown signs of post-operative pain during the first week after surgery, we would have been treated with buprenorphine (0.05\u2009mg/kg) subcutaneously daily. None did. Animals that showed early signs of autophagia or autotomy, they would receive oral acetaminophen (64\u2009mg/kg, Infant TYLENOL\n\u00ae\nOral Suspension Liquid; Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ) daily for the remainder of the experiment. The rats readily drank the medicine from a dropper. Two rats did not respond and were euthanized, one from the 25\u2009mm and the other from 50\u2009mm injury group.\n\nFootprint analyses\nThe rats were assessed before injury (Day 0) and tested weekly for changes in their walking and standing footprints. To obtain walking footprints, the rats were placed in a confined walkway that has a dark shelter at the end of the corridor (10\u00d7100\u2009cm). White paper was placed on the walkway. The hind paws of the rats were inked with a paint-soaked sponge. As they walked down the corridor, they left their footprints on the paper. The rats were trained to walk in the corridor and baseline-walking tracks were recorded before surgery.\nThree measurements were made from the walking footprints: Footprint Length (FL) distance is the change in footprint length from the heel to the third toe before injury (NFL) to after injury (EFL) divided by NFL; therefore, (EFL-NFL)/NFL. Toe Spread (TS) is the change in distance from the first to the fifth toe before (NTS) and after injury (ETS), divided by NTS; therefore, (ETS-NTS)/NTS. Intermediate Toe Spread (ITS) is the change in distance from the second to the fourth toe before (NITS) and after (EITS), divided by NITS.\nThese measurements were used to calculate the sciatic function index (SFI) proposed by Bain and colleagues\n38\nand described in\nTable 2\n. An SFI index is set at \u2212100 if no footprint were measurable (i.e. the rats could not walk).\n39\n,\n40\nIn cases where the rat could not walk, we assumed 45\u2009mm for FL (39.1\u2009mm is the longest observed), 10\u2009mm for TS (10.1\u2009mm was the shortest observed), and 5.0\u2009mm for ITS (5.3\u2009mm was the shortest observed).\nTable\n2.\nFootprint Factors\nFactors\nCalculation\nFootprint length factor (FLF)\nFLF=(EFL - NFL) / NFL\nToe spread factor (TSF)\nTSF=(ETS - NTS) / NTS\nIntermediate toe spread factor (ITSF)\nITSF=(EITS - NITS) / NITS\nSciatic Function Index (SFI)\nSFI=\u221238.3\u00d7FLF+109.5\u00d7TSF+13.3\u00d7ITSF\u22128.8\nStatic Sciatic Index (SSI)\nSSI=108.44\u00d7TSF+31.85\u00d7ITSF\u22125.49\nOpen in a separate window\nEFL, footprint length after injury; NFL, footprint length before injury; ETS, toe spread after injury; NTS, toe spread before injury; EITS, intermediary toe spread after injury; NITS, intermediary toe spread before injury.\nFor standing or static footprints, the rats were placed into acrylic glass containers (25\u2009cm\u00d715\u2009cm\u00d710\u2009cm) on a transparent base plate and photographed from below. We analyzed five photographs of each rat by ImageJ. Toe spread factor (TSF) is the distance between the first and fifth toes on standing footprints. Intermediate toe spread factor (ITSF) is the distance from the second to the fourth toe. The SSI\n41\nwas calculated from TSF and ITSF, as described in\nTable 2\n.\n\nFixation, sectioning, and staining\nAt six weeks after injury, animals were anesthetized and perfused transcardially with 0.9% saline and then 4% paraformaldehyde. The spinal cords, tibial nerve, common peroneal nerve, tibialis anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius (GA) were collected and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24\u2009h. For spinal cord sections, we cut 1-cm lengths of spinal cord centered on the injury area, serially sectioned the cord horizontally, and stained two sections from every 20 sections, one for Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) and the other for NeuN staining.\nFixed tissues were dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol solutions, cleared in xylene, and embedded in paraffin blocks for sectioning. Spinal cord sections were cut with a rotary microtome (Model 820, American Optical, NY) at 5\u2009\u03bcm thickness and mounted on slides. The sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in 100% and then 95% ethanol. The sections were then stained with LFB for myelin or NeuN antibody for neurons.\nTo stain white matter, we incubated sections in 0.1% Luxol Fast Blue (LFB, Acros, NJ) diluted in 95% ethanol with 10% acetic acid at 56\u00b0C for 24\u2009h, rinsed in 95% ethanol and then distilled water, differentiated in 0.05% lithium carbonate, rinsed in 70% ethanol, dehydrated in 99% ethanol, cleared with xylene, and cover-slipped with mounting media. LFB-stained sections were photographed with a microscope (Axiophot, Zeiss, Germany). Areas of spared white matter were outlined and quantified (ImageJ) every 20th section. Sections with the least spared white matter were designated the injury epicenter.\nFor NeuN staining, we first did antigen retrieval by immersing sections in fresh citrate buffer (1\u2009g NaOH, 2.1\u2009g citric acid, and 1 L H\n2\nO), heating for 15\u2009min at 100\u00b0C, and cooling at room temperature for 20\u2009min. The sections were incubated in primary antibody for NeuN (1:1000 dilution; Millipore, MA) overnight at 4\u00b0C, washed with PBS, incubated in biotinylated secondary antibody (1:500 dilution; Millipore) for 1\u2009h at room temperature, followed by ABC (avidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase; Vector, CA) and DAB (3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine), washed and then cover-slipped with mounting medium.\nThe tibial nerves and common peroneal nerves were mounted in paraffin, cut into 5-\u03bcm cross-sections, and stained with Holmes Silver Nitrate and LFB. Briefly, sections were deparaffinized and hydrated to distilled water, placed in 20% silver nitrate in dark at room temperature for 1h, washed in water, placed in impregnating solution at 37\u00b0C overnight, placed in reducing solution for 5\u2009min, washed in distilled water, toned in 0.2% aqueous gold chloride for 3\u2009min, placed in 2% aqueous oxalic acid for 5\u2009min, placed in 5% aqueous sodium thiosulfate, and washed in tap water for 10\u2009min, followed by LFB staining.\n\nImage analyses\nSpinal cord sections were photographed with an epifluorescent microscope (Axiophot). Motor neuronal cell bodies in ventral horn were outlined using ImageJ software. Ventral horn was defined as gray matter ventral to the central canal. Only motor neurons with a clearly identifiable nucleus and a cell soma larger than 100\u2009\u03bcm\n2\nwere counted. Motor neurons were counted every 20th section. (Please note that these counts do not represent total motoneuron count and is a sampling approach.)\nSections of the peripheral nerves were digitally photographed with a microscope (Axiophot). Total numbers of myelinated axon were counted manually from representative images while axon diameter and thickness of myelin sheath were determined with ImageJ software. We calculated mean axon numbers, axon diameters, and thickness of myelinated sheaths, with standard error of means for the three groups.\nTo quantify muscle atrophy, we cut thin (5\u2009\u03bcm) cross-sections of TA and GA muscles, stained the sections with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and digitally photographed the sections with a microscope (Axiophot). On each image, two vertical and five horizontal lines were drawn. One muscle fiber close to the intersection of a vertical and horizontal line was selected for analysis. A total of 10 muscle fiber cross-sectional areas (CSA, expressed in square micrometers) were determined with the ImageJ program from representative sections from each animal. We calculated mean fiber CSA and standard errors of means for each injury group (Sham, 25\u2009mm, and 50\u2009mm).\n\nStatistics and number of animals studied\nResults are expressed as means\u00b1standard deviation. We used a commercial statistics program (Statview ) to do analysis of variance (ANOVA) to estimate overall statistical significance and a post hoc test (Scheffe's test) to estimate statistical significance of differences between pairs of groups. To assess change of footprint parameters over time, we used repeated ANOVA (over time) and a post hoc test (Scheffe's test) to determine the effects of time on each variable. Some data were expressed as a percentage of controls. For example, white matter areas are expressed as a percentage of mean value of the Sham group. A\np\nvalue of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nSome preliminary experiments were excluded from this report. In preliminary studies (unpublished) using several male Sprague-Dawley rats, we found that male rats developed flaccid bladders and had bladder blood clots after a 50\u2009mm L4-L5 spinal cord contusion. We limited further experiments to female rats and excluded the male results.\nA total of 29 female rats were studied. Three rats were not injured and studied for distribution of back-labeled peroneal and tibial motoneurons. The remaining 26 rats were randomized to three injury groups (i.e., Sham,\nn\n=9; 25\u2009mm,\nn\n=8; and 50\u2009mm,\nn\n=9). One rat in the 25\u2009mm group and one rat in the 50\u2009mm group had to be euthanized and perfused two weeks after surgery due to autotomy (self-amputation of digits or foot). One rat in the 50\u2009mm group showed a mild heel ulcer in the sixth week after surgery but the condition was well controlled with acetaminophen. One rat in the Sham group died during the procedure to label motoneurons. The footprint and spinal cord histological data came from 23 rats (i.e., eight rats in the Sham group, seven rats in the 25\u2009mm group, and eight rats in the 50\u2009mm group). Twelve of the 23 rats were studied with retrograde labeling of the peroneal and tibial nerves in horizontally sectioned spinal cords (four Sham, four 25\u2009mm, and four 50\u2009mm). The 11 remaining rats were studied with coronal sections of the spinal cord, peripheral nerve, and muscle histology (four Sham, three 25\u2009mm, and four 50\u2009mm)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nThe generation of the transgenic CD-1 mice expressing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) gene under control of the\nnestin\n-delta (d) promoter,\nnestin\n\u03b4\n-TK\n-\nand\nnestin\n\u03b4\n-TK\n+\nmice, has been described previously.\n27\nThe\nnestin\n\u03b4\npromoter has been shown to be absent from neuronal or glial populations,\n27\nwhere green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression was not observed in na\u00efve cortical tissues but was observed in perilesional regions 2 days post-controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury (DPI). Administration of ganciclovir sodium (Cytovene-IV, Roche Pharmaceuticals) to\nnestin\n\u03b4\n-TK\n+\nmice leads to phosphorylation of ganciclovir in TK expressing cells, causing cell death from inhibition of DNA synthesis. Animals were housed in a 12-h light/dark cycle with food and water\nad libitum.\nProcedures related to animal use and care were approved by the University of Miami Animal Use and Care Committee.\n\nGanciclovir sodium treatment\nTo determine the optimal concentration of ganciclovir sodium treatment, we first performed a dosing study using 0 (vehicle,\nn\n=4), 10 (\nn\n=5), 50 (\nn\n=4), and 100 (\nn\n=4) mg/kg/d administered subcutaneously via a 2-week miniosmotic pump (Alzet model #1002; rate of 0.25\u2009\u03bcL/h) in na\u00efve and CCI injured mice (\nSupplementary Fig. 1\n; see online supplementary material at\nftp.liebertpub.com\n). An optimal dose of 50\u2009mg/kg/d ganciclovir sodium was used for the remainder of the study. To analyze the effect of ganciclovir sodium on NSPC ablation in the SVZ, mice were treated with 50\u2009mg/kg/d ganciclovir sodium or vehicle for 2 weeks before sham surgery or CCI injury. At the time of surgery, the pump was replaced with a second pump containing 50\u2009mg/kg/d ganciclovir sodium or vehicle, and the mice were allowed to survive for an additional 14 DPI (i.e., 4 weeks of continuous treatment;\nFig. 1\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSchematic of protocol timeline used for 4 weeks of ganciclovir (Cytovene-IV) treatment, controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury, and rotarod assessment. DPI=days post-injury.\nFor initial pump insertion, mice were anesthetized with ketamine (75\u2009mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (14\u2009mg/kg body weight) by intraperitoneal injection. A small incision was made in the skin between the scapulae, and a small pocket was formed using a hemostat to separate the subcutaneous connective tissue. The pumps were inserted into the pocket with the opening of pumps pointing away from the incision. The skin incision was closed using 5-0 silk suture. Replacement pumps were inserted at the time of the sham or CCI surgery.\n\nCCI injury\nMice were anaesthetized with ketamine (75\u2009mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (14\u2009mg/kg body weight) by intraperitoneal injection and positioned in a stereotaxic frame. Body temperature was monitored with a rectal probe and maintained at 37\u00b0C with a controlled heating pad set. A 5-mm craniotomy was made using a portable drill over the right parietotemporal cortex (\u22122.5\u2009mm caudal and 2.0\u2009mm lateral from bregma). The injury was generated using a 3-mm beveled stainless steel tip attached to an\ne\nCCI-6.3 device (Custom Design & Fabrication) at a velocity of 6.0\u2009m/sec, depth of 0.5\u2009mm, and 150\u2009msec impact duration. Sham mice received craniotomy only. After CCI injury, the skin was sutured using 5-0 silk sutures.\n\nBehavior\nThe activities of mice were observed in a standard cage containing five mice over a period of 5\u2009min and were graded as either active or less active and their fur was identified as being groomed or not groomed. Motor function was tested on the Rotamex 4/8 accelerating rotarod before injury and at 3, 7, and 14 DPI. Groups included: (1)\nnestin\n\u03b4\n-TK\n+\nwith vehicle (sham\nn\n=5, CCI injury\nn\n=5); (2)\nnestin\n\u03b4\n-TK\n+\nwith ganciclovir sodium (sham\nn\n=5, CCI injury\nn\n=6); (3)\nnestin\n\u03b4\n-TK\n-\nwith vehicle (sham\nn\n=5, CCI injury\nn\n=7); and (4)\nnestin\n\u03b4\n-TK\n-\nwith ganciclovir sodium (sham\nn\n=5, CCI injury\nn\n=18). The rotating cylindrical rod was 50-mm wide and had a linear acceleration from 10\u2009rpm to 60\u2009rpm over a period of 10\u2009min (i.e., rate of acceleration was 5\u2009rpm). Mice were given four trials on each day, and the time to fall off the rotarod was averaged over the four trials. For each mouse, the post-injury motor performance was expressed as a percentage of pre-injury performance and then averaged across the mice in each group.\n\nHistological preparation and immunohistochemistry\nBromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) (Sigma) was injected intraperitoneally (50\u2009mg/kg of body weight) 1\u2009h before sacrificing the mice, as described previously.\n28\nTo analyze the SVZ of mice that were sacrificed at the 2 week time point, mice were deeply anesthetized using ketamine (75\u2009mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (14\u2009mg/kg body weight) by intraperitoneal injection, the brains were removed, quickly frozen in OCT over isopentane on dry ice, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. To analyze the injury microenvironment of mice that underwent CCI injury, 14 days later these mice were deeply anesthetized using ketamine and xylazine by intraperitoneal injection and transcardially perfused with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4). The brains were stored in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, 30% sucrose for 48\u2009h and then frozen in OCT over isopentane on dry ice and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. For both fresh (2 week) and fixed (4 week) tissue, 30\u2009\u03bcm serial frozen coronal sections were cut and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\nTo analyze the cellular composition of the SVZ and perilesional region of the cortex, other sections were permeabilized and immunohistochemically stained with the primary antibodies anti-GFP (1:500; Molecular Probes), anti-nestin (1:500; Neuromics), anti-Ki67 (1:25; Dako), anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (1:1000; Dako), anti-Iba1 (1;1000; Wako), anti-NeuN (1:500; Millipore), anti-doublecortin (anti-DCX) (1:200; Santa-Cruz) and anti-polysialylated-neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) (1;1000; Millipore) overnight at 4\u00b0C.\nFor Ki67 staining on fixed tissue, sections underwent antigen retrieval with 10\u2009mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0, where slides were placed in 200\u2009mL buffer and heated twice for 4\u2009min in a 1500\u2009W microwave oven. For BrdU staining, sections were first incubated in 2\u2009N HCl for 1\u2009h at 37\u00b0C, then washed with 0.1\u2009M borate buffer, pH 8.5. All sections were washed three times in PBS, incubated in fluorescent secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) for 30\u2009min at room temperature, washed an additional three times in PBS, and cover-slipped in mounting medium containing DAPI (Invitrogen).\n\nCollection of conditioned NSPC tissue culture medium\nNSPCs were isolated from the SVZ of adult wild type CD-1 mice (2 to 4 months old) and grown as described previously.\n29\nOnce NSPC cultures were confluent, the conditioned NSPC media (NSCM) was collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. On the day of use, this media was defrosted and used as 1:1 or diluted 1/2, 1/20, or 1/200 in NSPC media not incubated with cells. To remove NSPC debris, some undiluted NSCM media was centrifuged at 1500\u2009rpm for 5\u2009min at 4\u00b0C.\n\nAstrocyte culture, scratch wound assay, cell death assay and immunocytochemistry\nFor the astrocyte scratch wound assay, brains from newborn wildtype (P1-P3) CD-1 mice were simultaneously dissected under sterile conditions using Hanks' balanced salt solution media containing 10\u2009mM HEPES. The cortices were isolated and combined, tissue samples were dissociated mechanically and triturated in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), before being filtered through a 40-\u03bcm cell strainer and then a 10-\u03bcm cell strainer. The freshly dissected mouse astrocytes were plated onto uncoated 10-cm plates at 100,000 cells/mL and grown to confluence for 14 days at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO\n2\n. To reduce microglial growth, the culture medium was changed every other day.\nOn confluency, cells were directly transferred into uncoated 24-well plates for scratch wound assays at a density of 1\u00d710\n5\ncells per well. After 4 to 6 days in 24-well plates, astrocyte monolayers were scratched with a sterile 200\u2009\u03bcL pipette tip. Wells were washed twice with sterile PBS, then either DMEM containing 10% FCS, unconditioned NSCM, or conditioned NSCM (1:1 or diluted 1:2, 1:20, or 1:200 with unconditioned NSCM) with or without centrifugation (1500\u2009rpm, 5\u2009min, 4\u00b0C) were added to the plates and incubated for an additional 48\u2009h, after which the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10\u2009min. The cells were then permeabilized and incubated in the primary antibodies anti-GFAP (1;1000; Dako), anti-Ki-67 (1:200; Dako), anti-nestin (1:500; Neuromics), anti-vimentin (1:100; Santa-Cruz), anti-O1 and anti-O4 (1:2; kind gifts from Dr. Pat Wood), anti-NG2 (1:500; Millipore), anti-Iba-1 (1:1000; Wako) for 30\u2009min at room temperature on an orbital shaker.\nThe cells were subsequently washed three times in PBS, incubated with appropriate secondary fluorescent antibodies (Molecular Probes) and DAPI (Santa-Cruz) for 30\u2009min at room temperature on an orbital shaker, and washed a final three times with PBS before imaging. The scratch wound assay consisted of at least three independent experiments in triplicate per treatment group.\nFor cell death assays, astrocytes were cultured from\nnestin\n\u03b4\n-TK\n-\nand\nnestin\n\u03b4\n-TK\n+\nmice as indicated above. On confluency, cells were directly transferred onto uncoated 96-well plates at a density of 5\u00d710\n4\ncells per well. After 2 days in culture, ganciclovir sodium (0\u2013720\u2009\u03bcM) or staurosporine (100 nM or 10\u2009\u03bcM; Biolmol) was added and incubated an additional 48\u2009h. This concentration and time were chosen because 2\u201310\u2009\u03bcM ganciclovir reduces 30\u201370% cell viability\nin vitro.\n30\n,\n31\nCells were further treated with 0.05\u2009\u03bcM Sytox Red (Life Technologies) and 10\u2009\u03bcg/mL Hoechst 33258. Ten minutes later, the live/dead cells were automatically counted using Cellomics ArrayScan VTI Live HCS reader (Thermo Scientific) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO\n2\n. For the cell death assay, the experiment consisted of a minimum of six wells for each treatment group.\n\nHistological analysis\nFor\nin vivo\nanalysis, photomicrographs of sections containing the entire rostrocaudal extent of the injury site using cresyl violet sections were taken on an Olympus Bx50 microscope using an Olympus SC30 camera with Olympus \u201cAnalySIS getIT!\u201d software. The distance between the most caudal and rostral sections was calculated to determine the rostral-caudal injury length. Cortical tissue sparing was assessed by contouring the volume of remaining ipsilateral and contralateral cortical tissue using MicroBrightField StereoInvestigator 10.30.1 software package and using MicroBrightField NeuroLucida Explorer 11.03 calculating the volume of remaining ipsilateral cortex as a percentage of the contralateral cortical area.\n\nStereology\nFor\nin vivo\nanalysis, sections at the rostral extent of the SVZ were collected from\nnestin\n\u03b4\n-TK\n+\n(\nn\n=5) and\nnestin\n\u03b4\n-TK\n-\n(\nn\n=4) treated with 50\u2009mg/kg/d ganciclovir sodium for 2 weeks before injury, and in\nnestin\n\u03b4\n-TK\n+\n(\nn\n=6) and\nnestin\n\u03b4\n-TK\n-\n(\nn\n=6) mice at 14 DPI. SVZ proliferation and NPSC ablation was assessed by stereological assessment of the total number of BrdU-, nestin-, and PSA-NCAM-positive cells, respectively, using a motorized Zeiss Axio-phot microscope, Optronix Microfire camera, and MicroBrightField StereoInvestigator 10.30.1 software package.\nTo assess neuroblast, neuronal, astrocyte, and microgial/macrophage cell numbers in the perilesional region and corpus callosum (CC), nonbiased cell number estimations were performed on the five most central rostrocaudal sections around the injury epicenter (as determined using cresyl violet stained sections), which were 30\u2009\u03bcm thick and 180\u2009\u03bcm apart. For NeuN, DCX and PSA-NCAM cortical counts, a contour of approximately 250\u2009\u03bcm deep was placed over the cortex on either side of the injury site at 5X magnification, and a grid of 125\u00d7125\u2009\u03bcm was placed over this area, with a counting frame of 50\u00d750\u2009\u03bcm. For DCX and PSA-NCAM counts in the CC, the area of the CC was outlined (approximately 150\u2013200\u2009\u03bcm wide) at 5X magnification, and a grid of 125\u00d7125\u2009\u03bcm was placed over this area, with a counting frame of 50\u00d750\u2009\u03bcm.\nFor astrocytes and microglia/macrophage counts, contours of approximately 700\u2009\u03bcm or 250\u2009\u03bcm deep, respectively, were made around the entire injury site, and a grid of 400\u00d7400\u2009\u03bcm or 200\u00d7200\u2009\u03bcm, respectively, was placed over this area, each with a counting frame of 50\u00d750\u2009\u03bcm. To assess proliferation, the SVZ was outlined to create a contour and a grid of 40\u00d740\u2009\u03bcm was placed over this area, with a counting frame of 20\u00d720\u2009\u03bcm. The number of NeuN, DCX, PSA-NCAM, GFAP, Iba-1, BrdU, and nestin-positive cells with an identifiable nucleus were randomly counted using the optical fractionator at 63X magnification.\nFor\nin vitro\nanalysis, photomicrographs of the scratch wound (1\u2009mm\n2\narea centered on the scratch midline) were taken at 10X (which captured both sides of the scratch area) on a Zeiss Axiovert200 microscope with an Axiocam MRm camera using Axiovision 4.8 software and converted to 8 bit grayscale images. For counting the number of DAPI- and Ki-67-positive nuclei, the images were inverted in ImageJ software and the ITCN automated counter plug-in was used to count cells. The ITCN plug-in was first optimized to ensure every nucleus was counted once, which was validated approximately every 20\u201330 photomicrographs. For each photograph, the number of Ki67-positive nuclei was calculated as a percentage of the number of DAPI-positive nuclei.\nAstrocyte reactivity at the scratch-wound edge was determined by GFAP density, whereby images were thresholded and the area fraction of pixels positive for GFAP-labeling was measured in ImageJ. For each photograph, GFAP expression levels (arb. units) where measured in fractional areas to give an average GFAP intensity. DAPI-positive cells were also counted for each photograph to provide GFAP intensity/DAPI cell value. Values for each photograph were then averaged per well to provide an average GFAP intensity/DAPI cell value.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data were assessed for homogeneity of variance, after which statistical analysis was performed. Histological differences were assessed using the Student\nt\ntest, and behavioral differences (intra- and intergroup analysis) were assessed using two-way Repeated measures analysis of variance with Student-Newman-Keuls method\npost hoc\ntest in SigmaPlot 13.0 where significance was <0.05. Data in figures are expressed as mean\u00b1standard error of the mean."

    "Methods": "Patients with TBI\nMethodological details have been reported previously,\n49\nbut are abbreviated here for the convenience of readers. Patients with moderate or severe head injuries, aged 16 and older, were admitted to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Medical Center within 24\u2009h of injury. Moderate or severe head injury was defined as closed injury with a post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score less than or equal to 13, or deterioration to a GCS less than or equal to 13 within 24\u2009h of admission, and necessitating mechanical ventilation and intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring.\n44\nExclusion criteria included the following: (1) terminal illness, (2) severe neurologic illness, and/or (3) acute complete spinal cord injury. UCLA and the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) Institutional Review Boards approved this protocol, and informed consent was obtained from patients' legal representatives.\nPatients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after initial stabilization or surgical evacuation of an intracranial hematoma and treated in accordance with the 2007 Brain Trauma Foundation and American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons TBI Guidelines.\n53\nManagement goals included maintenance of ICP less than 20\u2009mm Hg and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) above 70\u2009mm Hg, in accordance with the guidelines for the management of severe head injury. All patients had arterial and jugular bulb (JB) catheters inserted as soon as possible after admission to allow determination of arteriovenous differences (a-v) for glucose (AVDglu), lactate (AVDlac), and oxygen (AVDO\n2\n).\nFor sampling of venous blood from the brain, the dominant jugular vein was visualized on admission by means of CT scanning. Using standard techniques, a 5F Cordis and a 4F Oxymetric catheter (Baxter Critical Care, Baxter Health Care, Deerfield, IL) were inserted to approximately 15\u2009cm until resistance was encountered. Placement of the catheter was confirmed by lateral skull radiology. The catheter was calibrated\nin vivo,\nand repeated calibration was performed every 12\u2009h. Light intensity and oxygen saturation were continuously displayed on the monitor.\nFor patient care, arterial and venous samples were scheduled every 24\u2009h during post-injury days 0 to 5, 7, and 9;\n133\nxenon-measured cerebral blood flow (CBF) was scheduled for every 12\u2009h for the first 48\u2009h after injury (post-injury days 0 and 1), then daily on post-injury days 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9. In this study, to assess the relationship of early brain metabolism to long-term outcome, only metabolic data obtained from post-injury days 0 to 5 were used, given that many patients did not have complete data on post-injury days 7 and 9. Because of the patients' clinical status, such as severely elevated ICP (ICP>30\u2009mm Hg), hemodynamic or respiratory instability, or removal of the jugular catheter or extubation after clinical improvement, it was not possible for all scheduled studies to be completed on all patients.\nFor the conduct of isotope tracer studies, stable, nonradioactive D2-glucose and [3-\n13\nC]lactate isotope tracers were infused (vide infra), 6\u00b12 days (range of days 2\u201310) after admission to the ICU when informed consent had been obtained. All glucose-containing intravenous tube feeds were discontinued before isotope infusion. All enteral feeding was either Osmolite 1.2 or 1.5 (Abbott, Columbus, OH) and was continued during the isotope infusion. Determination of the rate of caloric delivery was at the discretion of the attending physician.\n\nHealthy control subjects\nSix healthy, nonsmoking, weight-stable volunteers (28.25\u00b18.22 years) were recruited from the UCLA campus and the surrounding community by posted notices and Internet advertisements. Subjects were admitted into the study if they met the following criteria: (1) were diet and weight stable for >6 months; (2) were not taking medications; (3) had normal lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1\u2009sec of 70% or more); and (4) were disease and injury free as determined by a health history questionnaire and physical examination. Control subjects received local anesthetics for catheter placements and experimental procedures. Details for this technique were described previously.\n44\nBriefly, through use of a femoral vein approach, a JB catheter was inserted under fluoroscopic guidance into proper position in the JB. A radial arterial line was also placed. Again, Institutional Ethical Review Boards approved the protocol, and subjects provided written informed consent. Diet records were not recorded in the control group.\nExperimental protocol control subjects reported to the laboratory, and patients were studied as described above. Before tracer infusions, a blood sample was collected from the radial artery and JB catheter for measurement of background isotope enrichments of glucose and lactate. Next, subjects received a primed continuous infusion of D2-glucose and [3-\n13\nC]lactate while resting semi-supine for 90\u2009min. The priming bolus for glucose was equal to 125 times the resting glucose infusion rate. Subsequently, D2-glucose was infused at 2\u2009mg/min. The priming bolus for lactate was equal to 23 times the resting lactate infusion rate that was at 2.5\u2009mg/min.\n4\n,\n54\nIsotopes were obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Woburn, MA), diluted in 0.9% sterile saline, and tested for sterility and pyrogenicity before use (UCLA Pharmaceutical Services). Tracers were administered via an indwelling intravenous catheter placed in the arm.\nArterial and JB blood samples (1\u20132\u2009mL) were collected simultaneously every 60\u2009min for 3\u2009h after commencement of tracer infusion. Cannulas were flushed with an equivalent amount of 0.9% saline after each collection.\n\nProcessing and analysis of blood\nBlood samples were immediately transferred to ice-chilled tubes containing 0.6\u2009M of perchloric acid, shaken, and stored on ice until the end of the experiment. Within 1\u2009h of collection, perchloric acid extracts were centrifuged (10\u2009min at 3000\u2009rpm,=2000 G), 4\u00b0C), and the supernatants were transferred to separate tubes for storage at \u221220\u00b0C until further analysis. In this investigation, glucose and lactate flux rates are presented in units of mg/kg/min instead of mMol/kg/min to facilitate comparisons between metabolite flux rates.\nBlood (lactate) was measured in neutralized perchloric extracts using an enzymatic method in addition to mass spectrometry as described previously\n4\n,\n36\nwith (U-\n13\nC\n3\n)lactate as an internal standard. Blood lactate isotopic enrichment (IE) was determined using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GCMS: GC, model 6890 series; MS, model 5973N, Agilent Technologies, Danbury, CT) of the N-propylamide heptafluorobutyrate derivative.\n55\nBriefly, neutralized perchloric extracts were lyophilized, resuspended in 200\u2009\u03bcL of 2,2-dimethoxypropane and 20\u2009\u03bcL 10% HCl in methanol, capped, and incubated at room temperature for 60\u2009min. After the addition of 50\u2009\u03bcL of N-propylamine, the samples were heated at 100\u00b0C for 30\u2009min, dried under a stream of N\n2\n, and transferred to GCMS vials using ethyl acetate. Thereafter, the samples were dried under N\n2\n, derivatized by adding 20\u2009\u03bcL of heptafluorobutyric anhydride (5\u2009min at room temperature), dried again under N\n2\n, and resuspended in ethyl acetate for GCMS analysis. Methane was used for chemical ionization with selected ion monitoring for mass to charge ratios (M/Z) of 328 (unlabeled lactate), 329 (tracer labeled lactate), and 331 ([U-\n13\nC\n3\n]lactate internal standard), respectively.\nBlood glucose concentrations and IEs were determined by GCMS of the pentaacetate derivative and (U-\n13\nC6)glucose as internal standard. Glucose sample preparation was performed as described previously.\n4\n,\n56\nMethane was used for chemical ionization, and selective ion monitoring was performed for M/Z of 331 (unlabeled glucose), 332 (M+1 glucose), 333 (D2-glucose), and 337 ([U-\n13\nC\n6\n]glucose internal standard). Selected ion abundances were compared against external standard curves for calculation of both concentration and IE, with normalization to internal standard signal for determination of concentration.\n\nCalculations of whole body metabolism\nWhole body substrate (glucose and lactate) rates of appearance (Ra, mg/kg/min) and disappearance (Rd, mg/kg/min) were calculated using the equations of Steele\n57\nas modified for use with stable isotopes\n58\n:\nwhere: F is the tracer infusion rate, C\ni\nis the metabolite concentration at time t\ni\n, IE is the isotopic enrichment of either D2-glucose or (3-\n13\nC)lactate, and V is the volume of distribution for glucose\n59\nand lactate.\n7\nThe percentage of glucose from GNG was calculated as described previously by Bergman and associates,\n4\nderived from that of Zilversmit and colleagues\n60\nas follows:\nwhere: glucose M+1 IE is the isotopic enrichment of\n13\nC-glucose derived from lactate tracer and H is the factor to correct for loss of label in the tricarboxylic acid cycle during GNG and was assumed to be 1.45.\n9\n,\n10\n,\n59\n,\n61\u201364\n\nStatistical analysis\nData descriptions and testing were conducted in R version 2.15.1.\n65\nGroups were compared both with the conventional\nt\ntest and its robust analogue, the Yuen test,\n66\nbecause of the presence of nonnormality in the data distributions.\n67"

    "Methods": "Subject selection\nForty six subjects were consecutively recruited from the trauma center following a closed-head TBI. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board and informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Entry criteria included a loss of consciousness and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score on admission between 6 and 15. Additional requirements included the absence of a prior TBI event, psychiatric illness, or neurological disease, and the ability to take part in a MRI study and neuropsychological evaluation. Of these subjects, two withdrew and four were removed for reasons that included motion artifacts or missing data, leaving 40 subjects for analysis. Of this group, 23 had experienced a motor vehicle accident, six experienced an assault, four had been hit by a car, one experienced a fall, and six were struck by an object. In addition, 29 age-matched healthy control subjects were recruited.\n\nData acquisition methods\nAll subjects underwent a MRI study and completed a neuropsychological evaluation, which each took approximately 1\u2009h. MRI data were acquired at 3 Tesla (Tim-Trio, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using eight-channel phased-array detection. The protocol included a T1-weighted MRI with 1-mm isotropic resolution (magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo sequence, echo time (TE)/ repetition time (TR)=4.43/2150\u2009msec; 160 slices). Volumetric MRSI data were obtained using a spin-echo acquisition with selection of a 135\u2009mm slab covering the cerebrum, Echo-Planar readout with 1000 spectral sample points and a spectral bandwidth of 1250\u2009Hz, TR/TE=1710/70\u2009msec, spatial sampling of 50\u00d750\u00d718 points over 280\u00d7280\u00d7180\u2009mm\n3\n, and an acquisition time of 26\u2009min.\n5\nData were processed in a fully-automated manner using the MIDAS package\n19\nto provide metabolite images for NAA, Cre, Cho, and their ratios, with a 1\u2009mL resultant voxel volume. Processing included signal normalization of individual metabolite images to institutional units using tissue water as a reference, and formation of tissue distribution maps at the SI resolution following segmentation of the T1-weighted MRI using FSL/FAST,\n20\nwhich were used for correction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) partial volume in the analysis. All images were then spatially-registered and interpolated to 2\u2009mm isotropic voxels. Additional details of the processing have been previously reported.\n21\nDTI data were acquired using a diffusion weighted spin-echo echo-planar imaging sequence with field of view=220\u00d7220\u00d7132\u2009mm, TR=11,800\u2009msec, TE=80\u2009msec, parallel imaging factor 2, four averages, and 60 contiguous axial slices of thickness 2.2\u2009mm, with an acquisition time of 10.8\u2009min. Diffusion encoding used 12 directions with b=1000\u2009sec/mm\n2\n, in addition to one set of images with no diffusion weighting. Maps of FA and MD were obtained using DTIStudio (\nwww.mristudio.org\n) and spatially normalized using a large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping transformation\n22\nto a template in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space with 1-mm isotropic voxels.\nA battery of neuropsychological tests was administered to all subjects. Z-scores were calculated for each measure and composite scores were then derived for four cognitive domains important in TBI research. An overall composite score was then calculated for each subject based on the four domains. The cognitive domains and their associated subtests were: 1) attention (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale [WAIS] Digit Span [Forward] and Trail Making Test A, and Wechsler Memory Scale [WMS] Faces I); 2) working memory (WAIS Digit Span [Backward]); 3) memory (WMS Faces II); and 4) executive function (WAIS Matrix Reasoning, Controlled Oral Word Association [either FAS or PTM for Spanish speakers], Animal Fluency, and Stroop Color Word Interference Test).\n\nData analysis\nTo examine differences in imaging measures as a function of the degree of injury the 40 TBI subjects were divided into two groups of 20 using the composite neuropsychological test score, based on the underlying assumption that a lower neuropsychological test score was related to a greater degree of overall injury.\n23\nThe group termed Group 1 contained subjects with the worse test scores and Group 2 contained subjects with the better test scores.\nThree voxel-based analyses were performed using the MIDAS software package in order to determine the distributions of altered imaging measures with TBI, and the results displayed using MRICro (\nwww.mricro.com\n). The following analyses were performed:\nGroup analysis\nA voxel-based analysis of all maps was carried out to examine differences of group mean values for each TBI group and the control group using a Student's unpaired\nt\n-test. Following spatial normalization, the MRSI parameter maps were smoothed using a 10-mm full-width at half maximum Gaussian filter and the DTI maps were smoothed with a 6-mm Gaussian filter to minimize the influence of any errors in the registrations. Differences were considered significant for\np\n<0.05, with correction for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate.\n24\nFor the MRSI analysis, voxels were excluded based on the following criteria: 1) line width >12\u2009Hz; 2) having an outlying value greater than three times the standard deviation of all valid voxels over the image; 3) more than 30% CSF contribution to the voxel volume; and 4) fewer than 10 subjects that passed the previous exclusions. The individual metabolite maps were corrected for CSF partial-volume contribution. Maps of the percent difference relative to control values were generated showing only those voxels that reached significance and were contained within a cluster of greater than 100 voxels (0.8\u2009mL).\nFor the DTI data, a brain mask that was comprised of white matter and deep gray matter regions was applied to exclude voxels outside of the brain or close to any CSF-containing regions, and voxels were retained only if they were part of a cluster of greater than 300 voxels (0.3\u2009mL). This mask was created by segmentation of white matter in the standard space reference image followed by manual editing to include the additional gray matter structures while excluding a 2\u2009mm region adjacent to the ventricles.\nIndividual subject Z-score analysis\nFor each subject a Z-score map was generated for each DTI and MRSI measure, using methods similar to previous implementations.\n11\n,\n13\u201316\n,\n21\n,\n25\nThis procedure maps at each voxel the difference of the individual subject maps from the control mean value, divided by the standard deviation from the control group. Differences were considered significant for\np\n<0.05 with false discovery rate correction, and a thresholded Z-score map generated that showed only voxels that passed significance and cluster size requirements. For the MRSI analyses, the same voxel selection criteria as previously described were used and the analysis specifically accounted for the relative content of gray and white matter.\n21\n,\n26\nFor the MRSI analysis the control subject data were combined with an existing database\n21\nto enable selection of age-matched control groups, for which age groups of 18\u201325, 26\u201335, 36\u201345, and 46\u201355 years old were used, with the number of subjects in each control group being 55, 52, 39, and 52 respectively.\nSummed individual Z-score analysis\nA map was generated for each DTI parameter from the sum of all voxels with significantly altered values, as indicated in the individual Z-score maps, across all subjects. These maps displayed a count of the number of subjects with significantly altered parameter values at each voxel, representing the frequency of DTI-detected tissue injury across each study group. This was done separately for positive and negative changes of the image parameter."
