    "Methods": "Patients and data\nThe study population consisted of 259 patients with severe TBI aged 16 years and older:\n\u2022\u2002There were 164 patients included from the Brain-IT database,\n19\na multicenter data collection between March 2003 and July 2005 (Newcastle, Uppsala, Monza, Leuven, Heidelberg, Iasi, Barcelona, Leipzig, Kaunas, Turin, Novara, Vilnius, Milan, Glasgow, Mannheim, Edinburgh, Southampton, Cambridge, Zurich, London, G\u00f6teborg). The Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee for Scotland MREC/02/0/9 granted the use of these data for scientific purposes on February 14, 2002.\n\u2022\u2002The data of the remaining 95 adult patients were collected from four centers: 38 from the San Gerardo Hospital in Monza, Italy, between March 2010 and April 2013; 25 from the University Hospitals, Leuven, Belgium, between September 2010 and September 2013; 20 from the University Hospital, Antwerp, Belgium, between May 2010 and June 2013; and 12 from the University Hospital, T\u00fcbingen, Germany, between February and December 2009. Local Ethical Committee approval to use the anonymized data for this analysis was obtained in all centers.\nData collection included baseline risk factors (age, sex, admission Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), admission pupil reactivity), and minute-by-minute ICP and MAP monitoring data. Monitoring data were recorded in minute-by-minute resolution through specifically designed \u201cBrainIT data collection software\u201d for the BrainIT study.\n19\nFor the later cohort, data were recorded through the centers' Patient Data Management System, in minute-by-minute resolution in Leuven, T\u00fcbingen, and Monza, and in second-by-second resolution in Antwerp. For the Antwerp patients, the median value per minute was used in this analysis. Minute-by-minute signals from all data sets were reviewed independently by two senior clinicians in Leuven (GM, BD), and obvious artifacts at visual inspection of data traces were removed.\nFinally, a correction of the CPP values for arterial blood pressure transducer height was made based on the information that was obtained on the height of the arterial blood pressure transducer and of the head of the bed. For patients in whom the transducer was at cardiac atrium level and who received nursing care with the head of the bed elevated at 30 degrees, 10\u2009mm Hg was subtracted from the registered CPP. This was the case in 101/259 patients (39.0%).\nTo investigate the effect of DC and old age on the capacity to tolerate CPP insults, the analyses were performed separately for three groups: patients \u226465 years who did not undergo DC (\nn\n=\u2009179), patients >65 years who did not undergo DC (\nn\n=\u200935), and patients \u226465 years who underwent DC (\nn\n=\u200937). The details of the three groups are presented in\nTable 1\n. The group of patients \u226465 years who did not undergo DC was considered the standard group on which the analyses assessing the effect of AR and ICP were performed (see below).\nTable\n1.\nPatient Demographic, Injury, and Outcome Data\nCohort \u226465 years of age without DC\nCohort >65 years of age without DC\nCohort \u226465 years of age with DC\nNumber of patients (\nn\n)\n179\n35\n37\nLOS days, median (IQR)\n14 (7\u201323)\n14 (6.5\u201324.5)\n24.5 (14\u201331)\nAge, median (IQR)\n36 (24\u201350.1)\n72 (69\u201375.5)\n36.9 (23\u201352.3)\nSex (% male)\n82.1\n71.4\n83.8\nPupil reactivity\nNone (%)\n9.5\n20.0\n18.9\nOne (%)\n12.3\n5.7\n10.8\nTwo (%)\n72.1\n68.6\n67.6\nUnknown, untestable or missing (%)\n6.1\n5.7\n2.7\nGCS total, median (IQR)\n7 (4\u201310)\n7.5 (4.5\u201311)\n7 (3\u201311)\nUnknown, untestable or missing (%)\n5.6\n8.6\n10.8\nGCS motor, median (IQR)\n4 (1\u20135)\n5 (2\u20135)\n4 (1\u20135)\nUnknown, untestable or missing (%)\n2.8\n2.7\n10.8\nCPP monitored time (days)\n5.8 (2.9\u201310.7)\n5.1 (2.7\u20139)\n10.7 (5.4\u201312.2)\nPercent valid CPP monitored time\n*\n94.9 (89.6\u201397.6)\n95.0 (83.1\u201397.6)\n93.0 (81.1\u201396.7)\nGOS at six months, median (IQR)\n4 (3\u20135)\n3 (1\u20134.8)\n4 (3\u20135)\nGOS 1\u2009=\u2009death (\nn\n; %)\n23; 12.9\n13; 37.1\n5; 13.5\nGOS 2\u2009=\u2009vegetative (\nn\n; %)\n4; 2.2\n3; 8.6\n2; 5.4\nGOS 3\u2009=\u2009severe disability (\nn\n; %)\n49; 27.4\n9; 25.7\n11; 29.7\nGOS 4\u2009=\u2009moderate disability (\nn\n; %)\n43; 24.0\n1; 2.9\n4; 10.8\nGOS 5\u2009=\u2009low disability (\nn\n; %)\n60; 33.5\n9; 25.7\n15; 40.5\nOpen in a separate window\n*\nNon-valid data were because of monitor disconnections, data loss during patient transport. or artefacts removed manually.\nDC, decompressive craniectomy; LOS, length of stay; IQR, interquartile range; GCS, Glasgow Coma Scale; CPP, cerebral perfusion pressure; GOS, Glasgow Outcome Scale.\n\nOutcome\nFunctional outcome was assessed at 6 months in all centers using the Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS).\n20\n\nVisualization method\nThe method developed in our group for visualizing the univariate association between insult and outcome and that was used for assessing the pressure and time burden of intracranial hypertension in G\u00fciza and colleagues\n7\nwas applied in the current analysis investigating the relationship between CPP and outcome. For CPP, two types of insults are defined: insults characterized by CPP dropping below a certain pressure value for a certain duration of time as well as insults characterized by CPP exceeding a certain pressure value for a certain duration of time. Hence, the visualization was performed separately for insults of low CPP and insults of high CPP. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the number of insults of a certain intensity and duration and GOS was expressed by a graded color code: negative correlations in red (\u22121 in dark red) and positive correlations in blue (+1 in dark blue). The contour for zero correlation was highlighted in black and defined as the \u201ctransition curve.\u201d For more details about the visualization method, we refer to G\u00fciza and coworkers.\n7\nAnalytic routines were programmed in Matlab\n\u00ae\n(MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA).\n\nRole of cerebrovascular pressure reactivity expressed by LAx\nThe LAx, expressing cerebrovascular pressure reactivity as an indicator of pressure AR, is calculated as the moving median of the correlation coefficients between ICP and MAP for the past time intervals of 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, and 90\u2009min, using minute-by-minute resolution data.\n15\nThe LAx was calculated at every minute during the monitoring period and average LAx for every CPP insult period, which allowed for discriminating CPP insults associated with \u201cactive\u201d AR (if average LAx <0) or \u201cpassive\u201d AR (if average LAx \u22650). Hence, the relationship between CPP insults and outcome was visualized separately considering active or passive episodes exclusively.\n\nRole of ICP\nThe relationship between CPP insults and outcome was visualized separately for CPP insults associated with average ICP \u226425\u2009mm Hg and for CPP insults associated with average ICP >25\u2009mm Hg to examine the relative effect of ICP and CPP insults on outcome. The value of 25\u2009mm Hg was chosen as the discriminator because ICP above 25\u2009mm Hg was associated with poor outcome independent of the insult duration in our ICP article.\n7\n\nMultivariate analysis\nMultivariate logistic regression models for death were calculated to investigate the independent association of the cumulative dose of CPP insult burden with outcome. Therefore, the percentage of total monitoring time each patient had CPP insults associated with worse GOS (i.e., time spent in the red zone) was used as an independent variable, together with the IMPACT model core variables age, pupils, and admission Glasgow motor score.\n21\nThe percentage of monitoring time spent in the red zone was based on a new calculation, in which for each patient, for every minute of monitoring it was checked whether this minute fulfilled criteria of belonging to one or more of the several episodes negatively associated with outcome (i.e., red zone). The time in the red zone was then divided by the total monitoring time of that patient.\n\nImpact of CPP policy\nThe database contains patients treated before and after the publication of the third revision of the Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines in 2007, in which the recommendation to aim at CPP higher than 70\u2009mm Hg was abandoned.\n22\nTo assess whether CPP policy confounded the current analysis, the median of the patients' median CPP was calculated per center. For the two centers that contributed data to the cohort before and after 2007, the median was calculated separately for the patients of both periods. Next, the visualization method was applied separately for centers with a median CPP below and above 70\u2009mm Hg to assess its validity independent of CPP policy."

    "Methods": "In vivo\nexperiments on human subjects\nExperiments to obtain brain motion were conducted with the help of healthy human subjects recruited by the Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine (CNRM). This study was approved by the CNRM Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the National Institutes of Health. All subjects provided written informed consent prior to participation in the study. The experimental setup consisted of a head rotation device equipped to deliver a controlled angular acceleration onto a subject's head in an axial plane (i.e., rotation about an inferior-superior axis, see\nvideo S1\n) (see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). Dynamic motions of subject-specific brains, under mild angular accelerations, were captured using an established quantitative imaging technique called tagged MRI.\n16\n,\n17\nDeformation measures, specifically, components of displacement vector and strain tensor, were computed from tagged MRI images using the harmonic phase (HARP) method.\n17\nAs such, experimental data were obtained in 3D. However, the calculation of strain was restricted to two-dimensional (2D) (i.e., in-plane) strain components because of technical challenges associated with accurately calculating out-of-plane motion from the tagged images. Further, experiments were designed such that the head was subjected to pure rotational acceleration about a single axis. This simplified loading in the experiments has the advantage of primarily inducing 2D kinematics (i.e., significant in-plane motion and minimal out-of-plane motion) within the 3D head. Hence, in this article, we have focused on motions in a 2D plane only. Details on the experimental method have been provided elsewhere.\n18\n\nSubject-specific digital head model\nThe subject-specific head model was built for total six human subjects (volunteers) (age range: 18\u201330 years). The head model considers the subject-specific anatomy of the brain. MRI (T1-weighted) images are segmented into different substructures using a topology-preserving, atlas-based technique.\n22\nThe segmented structures are identified in\nFigure 1\n, and include white matter, gray matter, caudate, putamen, thalamus, ventricles, CSF, and SAS. Image processing (dilation of a brain mask) is used to generate an approximate, artificial \u201cskull.\u201d The segmented stack of images are exported in the form of voxelated data with a uniform spatial resolution of 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009mm\n3\n. These data, which carry with them subject-specific anatomy of the brain, are imported to the subject-specific head model with each voxel now representing a physical material volume. Contiguous material volumes are used to represent the structure of the brain (assumed as a continuum solid). The deformation response of the brain is computed with the help of a numerical method, called the material point method, to solve governing equations of motion, supplemented with initial conditions, boundary conditions, and material constitutive response. We used the UINTAH material point method package\n(uintah.utah.edu\n) to perform high-performance simulations on a computing cluster.\n\nConstitutive models\nThe white matter of the brain consists of an organized morphology of fibers (bundle of axons) and the gray matter contains the cell bodies of neurons. The white matter tissue is generally considered anisotropic and the gray matter tissue is considered isotropic. A constitutive model, as applicable to an individual material volume, is an analytic model that relates a stress measure to a deformation measure, with the fidelity to consider the underlying fibrous morphology of the tissue. A number of previous studies\n7\n,\n9\n,\n10\nhave found that the anisotropy of white matter (because of preferential fiber orientations) is critical for prediction of axonal strain and subsequent locations of injury. We modeled the white matter using the Holzapfel\u2013Gasser\u2013Ogden (HGO) strain energy function.\n7\n,\n23\nAll other substructures were modeled using an isotropic limit of the HGO model. The constitutive model even incorporates the time-dependent response using a quasilinear viscoelastic function.\n24\nIn this work, because viscous time constants are much larger than the simulation time, the contribution of viscous terms was minimal (if any). Details on the implementation of the constitutive model are available in Wright and coworkers.\n7\nThe CSF was modeled as a fluid using the Tait equation of state,\n25\ngiven as\nwhere\nP\nis the pressure,\nK\nis the bulk modulus, and\nis the density. The subscript \u20180\u2019 indicates values at zero pressure. For fluids similar in composition and viscosity to that of water, the value of constant\nn\n=\u20097.15.\n25\nIn addition, Newtonian behavior is assumed for shear.\nValue for bulk modulus of the brain tissue used in computational head models varies significantly (by three orders of magnitude [for details and relevant references see Ganpule and coworkers\n6\n]) and remains uncertain because of lack of measurements in the literature. The dynamic bulk moduli of cerebrum (\nK\n=\u20091.46\u2009GPa) and cerebellum (\nK\n=\u20091.19\u2009GPa), were measured by one of the co-authors (K.T.R.) at high strain rates (550\u2009s\n\u22121\nto 2700\u2009s\n\u22121\n) using the compression Kolsky bar testing\n26\non tissue samples from a postmortem human subject. The dynamic bulk modulus value is close to some other values (e.g., 2.1\u2009GPa\n27\n,\n28\n) that are widely used in the literature.\n8\n,\n29\u201332\nSeveral material constants in the constitutive model are adopted from nanoindentation measurements available in the literature.\n33\nThe anisotropic properties of the white matter tissue are calibrated\n7\nfrom data on tensile tests.\n34\nA comprehensive list of material properties and values are listed in\nTable 1\n.\n25\n,\n33\u201336\nTable\n1.\nMaterial Properties of Head Constituents\nSubstructure\nProperties\nReference\nWhite matter\nG\n0\n=\u20091520\u2009Pa;\n=\u2009286\u2009Pa;\ng\n1\n=\u20090.81;\n=\u20092\u2009sec\nk\n1\n=\u2009121\u2009Pa;\nk\n2\n=\u20090.0001; fractional anisotropy (\n) and fiber direction (\n, unit vector) for each material point from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)\n33\n,\n34\nGray matter\nG\n0\n=\u20092750\u2009Pa;\n=\u2009385\u2009Pa;\ng\n1\n=\u20090.625;\ng\n2\n=\u20090.055;\ng\n3\n=\u20090.182;\n=\u20092\u2009sec;\n=\u200911\u2009sec;\n=\u200947.5\u2009sec\n33\nCaudate, putamen\nG\n0\n=\u2009700\u2009Pa;\n=\u2009110\u2009Pa;\ng\n1\n=\u20090.61;\ng\n2\n=\u20090.135;\ng\n3\n=\u20090.103;\n=\u20091.45\u2009sec;\n=\u200910\u2009sec;\n=\u2009110\u2009sec\n33\nThalamus\nG\n0\n=\u20096700\u2009Pa;\n=\u2009943\u2009Pa;\ng\n1\n=\u20090.81;\n=\u20092\u2009sec\n33\nCommon properties for brain substructures\n=\u20091040\u2009kg/m\n3\n;\n=\u20091.46\u2009GPa;\n=\u20091.19\u2009GPa\nSubarachnoid space (SAS)\n=\u20091133\u2009kg/m\n3\n;\nE\n=\u20099.85\u2009MPa;\n=\u20090.45\n36\nSkull\n=\u20092070\u2009kg/m\n3\n;\nE\n=\u20098\u2009GPa;\n=\u20090.22\n35\nVentricles, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)\n=\u20091004\u2009kg/m\n3\n;\nK\n=\u20091.46\u2009GPa;\nn\n=\u20097.15;\n=\u20091.002e-3\u2009Pa-sec\n25\nOpen in a separate window\n\nIncorporation of white matter anisotropy through DTI\nIn this work, axonal tracts were deformed based on the anisotropic constitutive response and they were not merely mapped against the deformation field. The fiber alignment vector\na,\nand the degree of fiber dispersion,\n, are required inputs to the constitutive model. These parameters vary spatially within the white matter of the brain and can be estimated from the DTI.\n37\nDTI is an MRI technique that provides an\nin vivo\nmethod for determining the orientation and anisotropy of white matter. The subject-specific DTI data were co-registered with subject-specific MRI images. The fiber alignment vector and the degree of fiber dispersion were estimated for individual voxels of the white matter.\n37\nDetails of incorporation of white matter anisotropy through constitutive model and DTI are available elsewhere.\n7\nIn brief, constitutive model used in this work (i.e., HGO strain energy function) took the following form:\nwith\nwhere,\nis the shear modulus of the isotropic matrix,\nk\n1\nis the stiffness of the fibers,\nk\n2\nis the dimensionless material parameter that controls the nonlinearity of the anisotropic response,\nN\nis the total number of fiber families (in the current work it was assumed that only a single family of fibers existed in the material; therefore,\nN\nwas set equal to 1),\nK\nis the effective bulk modulus of the material,\nJ\nis the volume change ratio, and\nis the structural parameter that defines the degree of fiber dispersion. The modified invariant,\nand\n, are defined as\nwhere,\nis the deviatoric component of the right Cauchy\u2013Green deformation tensor and\nis a unit vector representing the fiber direction in the reference configuration. Fiber direction can be obtained from DTI. When the material undergoes deformation, the vector\nwill deform with the body. After deformation, the fiber direction may be described by a unit vector\n. In general, the fibers will also undergo length change. The fiber stretch,\n, can be determined in terms of the deformation gradient and the fiber direction in the undeformed configuration:\nbecause\nis a unit vector:\nThe fiber orientation map and fractional anisotropy (FA) map from DTI provides the primary direction of fiber alignment and the degree of fiber dispersion respectively, for each voxel. Although the local fiber orientations can be directly obtained from the fiber orientation map, the fiber dispersion values determined from the FA map are not equal to the fiber dispersion parameter (\n) used in the HGO model. Fiber dispersion parameter\ncan be related to FA from DTI using a relation (derived in Wright and coworkers\n7\n):\nthe lower limit of\nbecomes 0, which represents regions with perfectly aligned fibers (i.e., transverse isotropy), and the upper limit becomes 1/3, which describes regions with randomly oriented fibers (i.e., isotropy).\n\nLoading and boundary conditions\nIn the experiments,\n18\na mild angular head deceleration in a human subject is generated after being initiated by voluntarily releasing a latch and coming to a rigid stop within a head support device. During the experiment, angular position histories are measured on the head rotation device in real-time using an MRI-compatible angular position sensor. Angular velocity and deceleration histories are computed from the recorded angular positions. The experimentally measured initial angular velocity and angular deceleration of the head act as initial conditions and boundary conditions to the head model, respectively. The head has an initial angular velocity of\n=\u2009\u223c3.5\u2009rad/sec at\nt\n=\u20090\u2009ms, after which it decelerates according to the angular deceleration history shown in\nFigure 2\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nThe head models use a particle-based numerical method, the material point method (MPM), for dynamic analysis of a subject-specific human brain undergoing rotational acceleration.\n(a)\nshows a mid-axial section of the head model. Digitized image data from MRI images and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) images were imported to the head model. A constant angular velocity,\n, acts as an initial condition for the head, as shown in\n(a)\n. Subsequently, the skull decelerates according to deceleration history shown in\n(b)\n. Both\nand angular deceleration are based on the experimental measurements. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\n\nMethod of solution\nThe material point method\n19\u201321\nis used to obtain dynamic analysis of the head model subjected to aforementioned loading conditions. In this numerical technique, the material volumes (also referred to as the material points) are used to represent a discretized material continuum. A background grid is used for solving governing equations (balance of linear momentum and balance of mass) and to determine spatial gradients using interpolation shape functions. The background grid does not deform. The material points are convected under the action of boundary conditions and are consistent with the materials constitutive response. The material point method has been applied to analyze a wide range of dynamic problems in solid mechanics and biomechanics, including dynamic material failure,\n20\n,\n38\ncellular mechanics,\n39\nand analysis of the ballistic impact on soft tissues and subsequent soft tissue failure.\n40\nIn finite element modeling, element geometry typically corresponds to either hexahedral or tetrahedral elements. In the MPM, becauses explicit meshing is not required, elements are only used for the background grid. The background grid is made up of hexahedral elements.\nThe MPM has several limitations. MPM is more computationally expensive than the FEM, as the field variables have to be interpolated from the particles to the grid and vice versa, and as the grid has to be reinitialized at the beginning of the new step. Energy dissipation error can occur in the MPM. Advanced techniques such as a time-stepping algorithm for stress calculation\n41\n,\n42\nand convected particle domain interpolation technique are required for alleviating the error.\n21\nSimulations in our article utilized the aforementioned techniques\n21\n,\n41\n,\n42\nto alleviate the energy dissipation.\n\nComparison of simulation predicted full-field data with tagged MRI measurements\nOver the past few decades, the (bio) mechanics community has seen a tremendous rise in the use of computational models. The practice of using numerical models to design, build, and evaluate the performance of systems at the intersection of engineering and biology is gaining traction. Often, such models are validated at discrete spatial points because of the limitation in experimental measurements. One important aspect of the model development process\u2014full spatial field model validation\u2014has, however, received little attention. The evaluation of model validity becomes extremely critical when predictive capability is desired, especially to predict injuries, under dynamic loading conditions that typically result in spatially heterogeneous deformations. We propose a few statistical measures\n43\u201346\nto evaluate model validity. These measures are summarized in\nTable 2\n. Variables\nP\nand\nO\nrepresent a spatially varying simulated (predicted) data set and an experimentally measured (observed) data set, respectively. An overbar (\n) denotes the mean of the data set. Although there are uncertainties in the measured data, we assume that the measured data (\nO\n) is the ground truth for comparison of simulated results. A higher value of one of these statistical measures indicates a better agreement between simulated and measured data sets, except for the root mean square error (RMSE) observations standard deviation ratio (RSR) measure, for which a lower value indicates a better agreement. For some of the statistical measures described here (e.g. RSR, correlation score [CS]), the validity rating (or performance of a predictive model) in terms of a qualitative index (such as excellent, unacceptable) are adopted from the literature.\n44\n,\n45\nWe use these ratings to indicate the agreement of simulated results with the measurements (\nTable 3\n).\nTable\n2.\nStatistical Measures for Evaluation of Full Field Data Between the Model and the Experiment\nStatistical measure\nEquation\nRange\nReference\nIndex of agreement (\n)\n(\u22121) to 1\n46\nCoefficient of efficiency (\n)\nto 1\n43\nRoot mean square error (RMSE)-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR)\n0 to\n45\nCorrelation scores (CS)\n0 to 100\n44\nOpen in a separate window\nNISE, normalized integral square error.\nTable\n3.\nModel Performance Evaluation Statistics\nAxial slice location\nd\nr\nE\n2\nRSR\nCS\nRadial-circumferential shear strain (\nZ\u2009=\u200940\n0.48\n\u22120.08\n1.06 (unsatisfactory\na\n)\n84.70 (good\na\n)\nZ\u2009=\u200920\n0.55\n0.02\n0.99 (unsatisfactory\na\n)\n91.20 (excellent\na\n)\nZ\u2009=\u20090\n0.49\n\u22120.07\n1.04 (unsatisfactory\na\n)\n86.19 (excellent\na\n)\nZ\u2009=\u2009\u221220\n0.43\n\u22120.12\n1.09 (unsatisfactory\na\n)\n78.90 (good\na\n)\nOpen in a separate window\na\nValidity rating (or performance of a predictive model).\nRSR, Root mean square error (RMSE) observations standard deviation ratio; CS, correlation score.\n\nSimulations of injurious loading\nRowson and coworkers\n47\nstudied the rotational kinematics of the head associated with concussive impacts, using a head acceleration data set collected in 335 collegiate football players. They report injury thresholds for various impact scenarios that resulted in definitive concussive injury. The impact scenarios are classified into three broad categories based on the direction of rotation as: impacts that result primarily in rotations in the sagittal plane, impacts that result primarily in rotations in the coronal plane, and the impacts that result primarily in rotations in the axial plane. We simulated the scenario that resulted primarily in rotation about the axial plane, as this closely resembles the loading simulated in the noninjurious case. This mode is dominated by significant rotational accelerations about the inferior-superior axis; that is\n; with sagittal (\n) and coronal (\n) being negligible components (as recorded by the helmet sensors). Rowson and coworkers\n47\nreport peak angular acceleration of 2192\u2009rad/sec\n2\nas an injury threshold for the impacts that result in preliminary rotation about the axial plane. This peak acceleration value is used together with a representative acceleration pulse from Rowson and coworkers\n12\nas the loading input to the simulations (\nFig. 6\n). This peak acceleration value is an order of magnitude higher than the peak value used in the noninjurious loading case (\u223c200\u2009rad/sec\n2\n) associated with the live human experiments. Also, the duration of the acceleration pulse is 18\u2009ms for the injurious loading scenario as opposed to 40\u2009ms for the noninjurious loading scenario.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 6.\n(a)\nInput acceleration for injurious loading.\n(b)\nRadial-circumferential shear strain (\nE\nrt\n) pattern in the brain for injurious loading.\n(c)\nRegions of white matter fiber tracts exceeding axonal strain injury (ASI) criterion. Injured (damaged) regions are marked in red. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\n\nInjury criterion\nOur current understanding of the best injury criterion for DAI under rotational accelerations is that injury occurs\n7\nwhen the axonal tensile strains (rather than shear strains) reach a critical value.\n48\n,\n49\nThe closest approximation to the axonal strains is provided by the axial strains along the fiber directions in the white matter fiber tracts. Because our head model includes the fiber orientations and our constitutive model\n7\nincludes the anisotropic response because of underlying fiber tracts, we can compute the axial strains along the white matter fiber tracts. We use an axonal strain injury (ASI) criterion\n7\n,\n10\nto identify regions of the brain that exceed the ASI during the injurious loading scenario. We use two injury threshold values, a value of 18% defined by Wright and coworkers,\n7\nbased on work of Bain and Meaney,\n49\nand a value of 13% defined by Giordano and Kleiven,\n10\nbased on the work of Newman and coworkers.\n50\nBain and Meaney\n49\ndefined an optimal axonal strain threshold of 18% for the onset of electrophysiological impairment (a functional injury). Giordano and Kleiven\n10\ndefined a white matter axonal threshold of 13% based on finite element calculations of accidental reconstructions\n50\nfrom the American National Football League (NFL). Strain rates for injurious loading simulated here and used while deriving ASI criteria are comparable. Strain rate for simulated injurious loading is \u223c50\u2009s\n\u22121\n. Strain rate for ASI criteria of Wright and coworkers is \u223c30\u201360\u2009s\n\u22121\n, whereas strain rate for ASI criteria of Giordano and Kleiven is \u223c100\u2013400\u2009s\n\u22121\n.\n\nQuantification of injury\nTo quantify overall injury (damage) in white matter substructures, white matter tracts are further classified into three broad functional categories.\n51\nThese categories are: 1) projection fibers (cortex\u2013spinal cord, cortex-brainstem, and cortex\u2013thalamus connections), 2) association fibers (cortex\u2013cortex connections, limbic system tracts), and 3) callosal fibers (right\u2013left hemispheric connections). We kept white matter tract segmentation to three broad categories for ease of interpretation of overall damage."

    "Methods": "Animals and fp brain injury\nAll procedures involving animals were conducted using the guidelines and approval of the University of Miami Animal Care and Use Committee.\nThe experimental animal groups for this study consisted of Sprague-Dawley rats that had undergone mild, moderate, or severe fpTBI, or sham injury, at three months of age. At the time of injury, animals were assigned to one of these experimental groups, and surgical procedures were conducted randomly. Animals were given a code number based on the day of TBI operation. Age and strain-matched injury-na\u00efve rats were also used, but these animals were acquired two weeks before any procedure for electrophysiology.\nDetails of fp injury, as conducted in our laboratory, have been published previously.\n17\nBriefly, injury consisted of a two-stage procedure under isoflurane anesthesia. During the first stage, a 4.8\u2009mm craniotomy was performed over the parietal cortex for attachment of a plastic injury tube. Twenty-four hours later, the animals were re-anesthetized, and the injury tube was attached to the fp injury device. The animals were intubated and mechanically ventilated while monitoring of arterial blood pressure and periodical sampling of blood for blood gas measurements was conducted. Animals were grouped as mild, moderate, or severe fpTBI based on the characteristics of the fp wave: mild 1.2\u20131.5 ATM, moderate 1.8\u20132.2 ATM, severe 2.4\u20133.0 ATM. Sham animals received all procedures without delivery of the fp pulse. Age-matched na\u00efve animals did not undergo any injury-related procedure. After the procedure, animals were returned to the vivarium and housed there under controlled light/dark and temperature/humidity conditions for one year. One-year-old surgical procedure-na\u00efve rats were acquired and housed for two weeks before electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings.\n\nElectrophysiology\nOne year after fpTBI or sham operation, animals were prepared for monitoring of awake ECoG activity. The ECoG recordings were conducted in injured and sham animals within three days of the anniversary of their injury and thus remained randomized for ECoG recordings. Age-matched na\u00efve animals were treated similarly except that the animals were implanted for recordings at random intervals with the other groups of animals. Laboratory personnel conducting the recordings were only given animal code numbers and thus were blinded to the animal group assignment.\nAnimals were anesthetized with isofluorane (4% induction, 2% maintenance) and placed in a stereotaxic head holder (Kopf). A 2-cm midline incision was made and blunt dissection was used to carefully expose the cranial surface. Two small (2-mm) burr holes were drilled to expose the dura anterior (bregma - 1.0\u2009mm, 2\u2009mm lateral to midline) and posterior (lambda +2.0\u2009mm, 2.0\u2009mm lateral to midline) to the previous TBI craniotomy site. Two silver-silver chloride coiled wire electrodes (2-mm coil diameter) were gently place in the two burr holes and attached to the base of a custom-made magnetic head stage containing gold pin connectors (Apple MagSafe laptop connector). A third indifferent electrode, which served as ground, was implanted into muscle lateral to the contralateral hemisphere. The head stage and implanted electrodes were attached permanently to the skull with dental acrylic, and the opening through the skin was closed around the head stage with surgical staples. Animals were allowed to recover from surgery for 24\u2009h before recordings.\nRecordings of ECoG activity were made in awake animals using a homemade head stage that provided 10X amplification of the differential signal between the two implanted electrodes. The head stage amplifier provided high pass filtering above 0.1\u2009Hz. The head stage contained the mating magnetic connector (Apple MagSafe laptop connector) that allowed rapid and stable connection of the amplifier head stage to the electrode head stage implanted in the animals. The amplifier head stage received power from, and transmitted ECoG signals to, a CWE Model 820 second stage conditioning amplifier. This amplifier provided additional 100X amplification and high frequency cutoff filtering at 500\u2009Hz. The amplified and conditioned signals were digitized and recorded with AD Instruments Powerlab and Labchart software, respectively. Simultaneous video recordings were made to correlate ECoG signals with animal behavior. In some animals, behavior was quantified using Ethovision software to monitor animal movement. Recordings were made from each animal for 1\u2009h.\nECoG seizure detection was performed with customized software\n18\ndeveloped to modify the EEGLab module using the MatLab platform. In brief, the goal was to quantify ECoG events for each 1\u2009h recording period using short time period Fourier transformation (STFT). The procedure is summarized as follows: average spectral power was measured from a 4\u2009min segment of ECoG obtained from aged-matched na\u00efve animals during awake exploratory behavior (typified by high frequency, low amplitude ECoG activity).\nPower in the major frequency bands (delta 0.5\u20133.5\u2009Hz, theta 3.5\u20137.5\u2009Hz, alpha 7.5\u201312.5\u2009Hz, beta 12.5\u201330\u2009Hz, and gamma rhythms 30\u201360\u2009Hz) was calculated using STFT for each 4\u2009sec period of ECoG activity for the entire 1\u2009h recording period. All power measurements were normalized using a median decaying memory algorithm\n19\nto control for possible differences in absolute ECoG amplitudes because of differences in signal strength.\nECoG epochs containing spike/wave discharges (SWDs) were detected by first comparing power in each frequency band with the power observed in controls as described above. A significant change in power was detected when power in any frequency band exceeded that of the control ECoG power by three standard deviations. Then, each ECoG epoch was examined for a particular pattern of significant frequency changes that were unique to SWDs. Preliminary comparisons of power changes in each frequency band with known SWD containing ECoG records indicated that SWDs would be reliably detected when power significantly increased in a combination of the theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands. Any ECoG epoch having increased power in this frequency band combination was scored as an epoch containing the SWD pattern.\nOnce the pattern was determined, all ECoG records for all animals were processed, without experimenter intervention, to detect the total number of SWD-containing epochs in a 1\u2009h period. This analysis did not attempt to score the number of SWDs or their duration, and by not doing so, did not place any particular weight on short or long duration SWDs. To examine possible differences in durations of SWDs, the number of consecutive ECoG epochs that contained SWDs was determined. Thus, a single SWD containing epoch not followed by another epoch was considered to have a duration of 2\u2009sec or less. Two consecutive SWD containing epochs was considered to have a duration of 2\u20134\u2009sec and so on.\nRecording sessions consisted of placing each animal in a novel environmental chamber for 1\u2009h. We thought this was preferable to a longer recording, because each animal was subjected to the identical start and end point of the session as defined by the experimenter rather than allowing the animals to undergo various changes in behavioral state without experimental control. All recordings were conducted during the dark cycle of the animal's light/dark circadian rhythm in a dimly lit room.\n\nHistology\nEstimates of TBI induced damage to selected brain structures was conducted by volumetric analysis as described previously.\n20\nCoronal sections at multiple levels (0.8, 1.8, 3.3, 4.3, 5.8, 6.8, and 7.3\u2009mm posterior to bregma) were used for volumetrical measurement. Volume measurements for each structure were computed using area components from multiple semiserial sections using numerical integration of successive areas. Areas were determined by tracing the boundaries of each structure at a power of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009from a minimum of three coronal sections at different bregma levels depending on the size of the structure. Volumes were expressed as the ratio of structure volumes from right and left hemisphere\n\nStatistics\nStatistical comparisons among groups were made using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student\nt\nstatistic. Three animals (one na\u00efve and two shams) were removed from analysis because of acute cortical injury resulting from ECoG electrodes or skullcap mounting screws. Distributions of SWD durations were compared using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov nonparametric test."

    "Methods": "Survey\nA survey was developed as part of the Access to Care and Timing (ACT) project sponsored by the Rick Hansen Institute (RHI) to examine current models of care delivery for tSCI in Canada and how the provision of care impacts outcomes along the continuum of care.\n31\nSurvey questions were related to: 1) care within the province and within each facility (e.g., regions served, number of beds); 2) structural attributes (e.g., number of wards available for admissions); and 3) service availability (e.g., admission criteria). Facilities were instructed to answer the questions based on care delivery from 2009 to 2011. A copy of the survey is included in the\nSupplementary Material\n(see online supplementary material at\nwww.liebertpub.com\n).\nThe survey was administered to a purposive sample of 26\u2009tSCI care facilities located in 13 cities within eight Canadian provinces: 12 acute, 11 rehabilitation, and three integrated acute and rehabilitation facilities (herein referred to as integrated facilities). Each participating facility is also part of the Rick Hansen Spinal Cord Injury Registry (RHSCIR), which is a national longitudinal registry documenting the continuum of care in Canada for tSCI.\n32\nThe RHSCIR has expanded since it was established in 2004 and this study included all facilities enrolled as of January 2011. Facilities were excluded if: a) they were not enrolled in the RHSCIR, and b) they were located in provinces or territories where patients with tSCI are triaged and treated in neighboring provinces. Despite these sampling exclusions, it was assumed that the majority of individuals with an acute tSCI in Canada would be treated at one of the participating facilities. These facilities are situated in metropolitan areas in the southernmost portion of Canada where 69% of the Canadian population resides.\n33\nAll facilities obtained research ethics board approval, if required, and institutional approval to disclose the survey results to the RHI. Permission was also given by all participating facilities to disclose their identity.\n\nData sources\nCompletion of the survey by the participating facilities required data from several sources. Administrative and clinical personnel were contacted to assist with responses regarding the structure and availability of services at each facility. Where possible, data were obtained from the RHSCIR at each facility to determine quantifiable estimates of the number of admissions. If RHSCIR data were not available, the facilities were advised to use other hospital databases. Due to variation in data sources, admission data was reported over any complete 12-month period (calendar or fiscal year) from 2009 to 2011. Subject matter experts assisted in the data cleaning.\n\nAnalyses\nThe survey results (categorical and continuous data) were analyzed using descriptive statistics. For both the acute and rehabilitation facilities, data were analyzed to describe care within both the province and the facility, the structure of the facility, and the services provided. In addition, experts at each facility were asked a number of open-ended questions to examine potential challenges to providing care for patients with tSCI. Such questions included: \u201cWhat are the greatest challenges with regards to SCI patient care encountered by your center?\u201d Barriers to the provision of care were identified inductively through thematic analysis of responses."

    "Methods": "Experimental design\nMouse spinal cord injuries were produced by delivering 50 kdyn or 75 kdyn force contusions to the T9 thoracic spinal cord with or without 20\u2009sec of sustained compression. Four different injury groups were generated: (1) 75\u2009dyn (contusion), (2) 75 kdyn +20\u2009sec (of spinal cord compression), (3) 50 kdyn, and (4) 50 kdyn +20\u2009sec. At 3, 7, and 14 days post-injury (dpi),\nn\n=\u20094\u20136 animals/group were sacrificed, and tissue was harvested for histological evaluation. Locomotor analysis using the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) was conducted on a separate set of animals (n\u2009=\u200910/group) over the course of four weeks. At 28\u2009dpi, these animals were sacrificed and spinal cord sections generated for histological analyses. Staining and analyses were performed to track inflammatory response at 7 and 14\u2009dpi and anatomical recovery at 3, 7, 14, and 28\u2009dpi.\n\nAnimals\nExperiments were performed using 90 3\u20134 month old female C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine). Animals were housed in individually ventilated cages with\nad libitum\naccess to food and water. All procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Office of Responsible Research Practices and with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Kentucky.\n\nSCI\nMice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal (ip) injections of ketamine (100\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg). After a T9 laminectomy, a mid-thoracic SCI was produced using the IH injury device (Precision Systems and Instrumentation).\n2\nA previous study suggests that the duration of compression has negligible effects on outcomes.\n11\nBased on these findings, we performed pilot studies examining different compression times and found no obvious differences in injury severity between groups. This finding is consistent with a previous study reporting an injury threshold at 15\u2009sec of sustained compression after IH contusion SCI.\n9\nThus, we determined a 20\u2009sec sustained compression was sufficient and reproducible within our stereotaxic mode of injury application.\nMice were divided randomly to receive SCI with varying impact force (50 or 75 kdyn) and duration of maintained compression (i.e., dwell time: 0 or 20\u2009sec), yielding four groups: 50 kdyn, 50 kdyn 20\u2009sec, 75 kdyn, and 75 kdyn 20\u2009sec. After injury, muscle and skin incisions were closed using monofilament suture. Post-surgically, animals received one subcutaneous injection of buprenorphine-SR (1\u2009mg/kg) for pain and 2\u2009mL of saline + antibiotic (5\u2009mg/kg, enroloxacin 2.27%: Norbook Inc, Lenexa, KS); buprenorphine has been shown to produce analgesic effects without affecting molecular, anatomical, behavior, or physiological parameters after SCI.\n17\nAnimals were housed in warming cages overnight. Animals continued to received 1\u2009mL saline + prophylactic antibiotics subcutaneously for five days. Food and water intake and the incision site were monitored throughout the course of the study. Bladder expression was performed on injured mice twice daily until mice reached voluntary evacuation. Two mice received SCI with abnormalities in the force versus time curve generated by the IH device indicating bone contact or spinal cord movement during impact. Based on these pre-determined exclusion criteria, these two mice were excluded from further analyses.\n\nBehavioral analysis\nLocomotor hindlimb function was assessed using the BMS as described previously.\n18\nTwo observers blinded to group inclusion observed and scored mice in an open field for 4\u2009min at 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days post-injury (dpi). Each hindlimb was scored separately based on movement (e.g., ankle placement and stepping), coordination, and trunk stability, then averaged to generate a single score for each animal. A score of 0 indicates complete paralysis while a score of 9 indicates normal locomotion. The BMS subscore is sensitive to atypical patterns of locomotor recovery\n18\nand was used to analyze specific aspects of locomotion (e.g., paw placement and coordination).\n\nTissue processing and histochemistry\nAt 3, 7, 14, or 28\u2009dpi, mice were anesthetized with a lethal dose of ketamine (150\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (15\u2009mg/kg), then transcardially perfused with cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (0.1\u2009M, pH 7.4), followed by perfusion with cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Dissected spinal cords (1\u2009cm) were post-fixed for 2\u2009h in 4% PFA, then rinsed and stored in cold phosphate buffer (0.2\u2009M, pH 7.4) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Tissue was cryoprotected in 30% sucrose at 4\u00b0C for one week, then rapidly frozen using optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetek USA, Inc., Torrance, CA) on dry ice. Tissue was systematically randomized into blocks with equal group distribution in each block to ensure uniformity of staining across groups. Tissue was stored at \u221280\u00b0C before sectioning. Tissue blocks were cut in serial cross sections (10\u2009\u03bcm thick) and mounted onto Colorfrost plus slides (Fisher #12-550-17).\nAs validated and described previously, spared tissue was identified using a combination of eriochrome cyanine (EC) and neurofilament (NF) (Aves Labs, #NFH) to label myelin and axons, respectively.\n19\n,\n20\nFor immunohistochemical analyses of macrophage phenotypes, sections were incubated with goat anti-CD206 (1:100 dilution, AF2535, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), goat anti-Arg1 (1:100, SC-18354, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), rat anti-CD86 (1:100, 553689, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), or rat anti-MARCO (1:1000, MCA1849, BioRad, Hercules, CA). Slides were incubated with these primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C in 0.1M PBS with 5% normal donkey serum, 0.1% fish gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich, G7765), 1% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100. Sections were subsequently incubated with a biotinylated tomato lectin (1:1000, L0651; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to counterstain for total macrophage numbers.\nDetection of primary antibodies was performed with donkey anti-rat Alexa Fluor (AF) 488, donkey anti-rabbit AF 568, and streptavidin AF 647 (all secondaries at 1:1000 dilution, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) for 1\u2009h at room temperature. To validate antibody staining, negative controls were run without primary antibody, and full dilution curves were analyzed.\nThe EC/NF images were captured using an Olympus AX-80 and Aperio Scanscope. To quantify spared tissue, the regions of dense EC staining were outlined and measured using the MetaMorph analysis program (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). To quantify macrophage activation, three or four regions of interest (ROI) were captured per subject using an Axioplan 2 imaging microscope (Carl Zeiss) at 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification. The ROI were taken from within the lesion epicenter using NF/EC stained serial sections as references (\nFig. 3A\n). Threshold based area measures of positive signal within the ROI were performed using MetaMorph to determine total area of positive signal. The total area of positive signal of macrophage markers (Arg1, CD206, MARCO, CD86) was then normalized to total tomato lectin (TomL) positive area for each ROI to determine proportion of positive macrophages within the lesion.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nCompression alters spinal cord injury macrophage activation at 7\u2009dpi. (\nA\n) Three regions of interest (ROI; dorsal and left and right) within the lesion epicenter of each animal were analyzed at 7\u2009dpi for macrophage density (total tomato lectin [TomL] positive area). The TomL + area was similar across the four injury paradigms: 50 kdyn, 75 kdyn without compression (open bars) and 50 kdyn, 75 kdyn with compression (black bars). (\nB\n) Percent of TomL+ cells positive for Arginase 1 (Arg1) across treatments. (\nC\n) Percent of TomL+ cells positive for CD206 across treatments.

Scale bar\u2009=\u200950\u2009\u03bcm.\nBecause of unknown, at the time, temperature inconsistencies during tissue processing and sectioning, some cross sections were lost or folded during staining, making analysis impossible. Mice without an obvious and fully intact epicenter were not included for histological analysis, decreasing the total number of mice analyzed for histological analyses from 88 to 71.\n\nStatistical analysis\nInvestigators blinded to experimental groups performed all data acquisition and analysis. Statistical analyses were completed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software). Data were analyzed using one- or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Holm-Sidak test for multiple comparisons. Specifically, repeated measures two-way ANOVA was used to analyze BMS (time [repeated]\u2009\u00d7\u2009injury), 28\u2009d tissue sparing (distance [repeated]\u2009\u00d7injury), and macrophage phenotype (ROI [repeated]\u2009\u00d7\u2009injury). Ordinary two-way ANOVA was used to analyze tissue sparing over time (time\u2009\u00d7\u2009injury). All other outcomes were analyzed using one-way ANOVA or independent sample\nt\ntests when appropriate.\nComparisons include groups differing only in contusion force (50 kdyn vs. 75 kdyn, 50 kdyn 20\u2009sec vs. 75 kdyn 20\u2009sec) or compression (50 kdyn vs. 50 kdyn 20\u2009sec, 75 kdyn vs. 75 kdyn 20\u2009sec); other groups were not analyzed statistically to avoid comparing across multiple independent variables. The robust regression and outlier removal method with a false positive rate for detecting outliers (Q-value) of 1% was used to automatically identify outliers, and imputed mean values were used when necessary for repeated measures.\n21\nResults were considered statistically significant at\np\n\u2264\u20090.05. All data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean unless otherwise noted. Figures were prepared using Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Adobe Systems) and Prism 6.0."

    "Methods": "As part of an ongoing investigation on head impact biomechanics in high school football athletes, 185 participants (16.3 [0.8] years; 180.8 [8.1) cm; 85.0 (18.3] kg; 0.3 [0.7] previous concussions reported) were recruited from three high schools between 2007 and 2014 (School 1,n=\u200994, 2007\u20132011; School 2,n=\u200950, 2011\u20132013; School 3,n=\u200941, 2013\u20132014). At the time of enrollment, all participants were fitted with a new or newly refurbished Riddell Revolution or Revolution Speed helmet that was equipped with a HIT System encoder. Participants were equipped with head impact measurement technology during normal participation in football practices (n=\u2009373) and games (n=\u200994), without intervention from the study team. All participants and their parent/guardian provided written informed assent/consent at the time of enrollment in a manner that was consistent with the host institution's office of Human Subjects.\n\nHIT system\nDescribed elsewhere in detail,\n19\n,\n20\nthe HIT System (Simbex LLC, Lebanon, NH) implements six-axis accelerometers to estimate head center of mass acceleration after impact. Accelerations are continually monitored at 1\u2009kHz until any unfiltered/unprocessed data from a single accelerometer meets or exceeds 14.4\ng\n. At this point, the 8\u2009msec before the threshold and 32\u2009msec after the threshold point are stored locally or transmitted to the sideline computer.\nFor each impact, algorithms filtered impact profiles known to be associated with aberrant impacts (e.g., dropped or thrown helmet), and an investigator present at all sessions marked additional errant impacts not captured by the software. Valid impacts were processed, and the three-dimensional vector sum for linear acceleration and the estimated two-dimensional rotational acceleration were calculated. Data were then filtered to exclude linear accelerations <10\ng\n, which are thought to be associated with common athletic maneuvers.\n19\n,\n21\nData collected from 2013 on included a rotational acceleration estimate correction,\n22\nwhich was applied to all previous data before analyses. A review of the measurement properties of the HIT System was completed by Patton.\n23\n\nConcussion diagnosis\nThroughout the study period, a certified athletic trainer was present at all games and practices. In the event a participant sustained a blow to the head that resulted in signs and symptoms consistent with concussion, a full sideline evaluation was completed. If the athletic trainer deemed the injury to be a concussion, the athlete was removed from further play and referred to the supervising physician for injury diagnosis. The impact resulting in the concussion was marked for later analysis. In cases where the athlete did not immediately display concussive signs and symptoms (i.e., delayed reporting), the athletic trainer referred the athlete to the physician and worked with the athlete and coaching staff to identify the impact most likely associated with concussion.\n\nData analysis\nBefore analysis, head impact data were cleaned by eliminating any outliers, defined by impacts above 200\ng\n(\nn\n=\u200910,683) and removal of one athlete who fell outside of three standard deviations from the group mean for time between impacts.\nTo evaluate the relationship between impact magnitude and time relative to concussion, 31 concussive impacts identified during the study period were extracted. Control athletes were identified by matching to the following characteristics from the concussed athlete: number of impacts before the final impact (i.e., concussive impact), final impact linear acceleration, final impact rotational acceleration, final impact location, athlete position, athlete team (see\nTable 1\n). Among the matched pairs, one participant served as both a concussed and control and four participants functioned as controls in two instances.

The initial evaluation of impact magnitude (i.e., linear and rotational acceleration) of the final impact and the preceding 19 impacts (20 impacts total) were multi-variable analyses of variance between the Concussed and Control groups. To account for time, impact magnitudes in the 24\u2009h before the final impact were inspected visually on both a continuous timeline and at 15\u2009min intervals. Impact counts between groups for the final 3\u2009h were evaluated using paired samples t-tests, revealing a greater number of impacts among the Concussed athletes (see below).

    "Methods": "Study design\nThis prospective, longitudinal, observational, comparison study recruited teenage (13\u201319 years) subjects from soccer and non-contact sport clubs in Germany between February and May 2015 (see\nFig. 1\n). Participants were tested before (pre-training) and immediately, within 15\u2009min, after training (post-training). Training consisted of a sport practice lesson that was of similar length and intensity between the groups. One pre- and one post-training session were obtained per day of testing, with one to 4 days of testing attained per week.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSchematic of the two tasks displayed on iPad screen. (\nA\n) ProPoint task on the iPad with white arrow indicating direction of a correct response (toward the target square). (\nB\n) AntiPoint task on the iPad with white arrow indicating direction of a correct response (away from the target square).\n12\n\nParticipants\nThe ethics committee of the University of Munich as well as the University of Texas Health Science Center Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects approved the study, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant as well as their legal guardian if the participant's age was below 18 years. Inclusion criteria for the subjects in the soccer player cohort were participation in organized soccer training at least three times a week, being male, age 13\u201319 years, and right-handed. Subjects who had a history of diagnosed or suspected traumatic brain injury within the last year, neurological disorder, psychiatric illness, or learning disorder were excluded. The soccer player group consisted of 16 soccer players (mean age 15.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7 years).\nA comparison cohort of 14 age-matched, right-handed, male athletes (mean age 14.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1 years), participating in either table tennis (\nn\n=\u20099) or swimming (\nn\n=\u20095), both non-contact sports, were recruited from competitive athletic clubs. Both table tennis and swimming are sports with equal intensity of physical activity level to soccer, as measured by maximum oxygen consumption,\n18\u201321\nbut with very low risk for exposure to RHI. The comparison cohort exclusion criteria were: history of suspected or diagnosed concussion or other traumatic brain injury, participation in organized training in a contact sport, neurological disorder, psychiatric illness, or learning disorder.\n\nStudy protocol\nAll study participants were tested before and after training in their respective sport. The soccer players were exposed to RHI (mean 7.2\u2009\u00b1\u20096.1, range 0\u201322) during the sport practice lesson on testing days. None of the athletes in the comparison group participated in any form of activity during training that could be considered a head impact. Depending on their presence on the testing day, soccer players were tested on a mean of 7.8 (standard deviation [SD] \u00b12.6, range 3-11) days, and controls were tested on a mean of 4.1 (SD \u00b12.7, range 1\u20138) days over the course of the spring season. The number of headers performed by each soccer player during training was counted and classified through observation by a trained research assistant. The type of head ball (long: e.g., goalkeeper kick or corner crosses of more than 30\u2009m; short: e.g., players throwing the ball to each other in practice drills; high: e.g., goalkeeper punts (high velocity ball punt by the goalkeeper and commonly headed by a center midfielder) and any other type of head impact were noted.\n\nStimulus and tasks\nThe study was performed on iPad 2 tablets (\nFig. 1\n), which have a 9.7 inch screen (diagonal) with a LED-backlit, capacitive display and pixel resolution of 1024-by-768. An application was installed on the iPad 2\n22\nthat contained two pointing tasks: ProPoint and AntiPoint (\nFig. 1\n). The ProPoint task provides a measure of sensorimotor function. In the ProPoint task (\nFig. 1A\n), the subject is asked to place and hold the index finger on a circle (diameter\u2009=\u20091.4\u2009cm and viewing angle of 2.4 degrees, from a viewing distance of 33\u2009cm) in the center of the iPad screen until a stimulus in the form of a white square appears in one of four possible locations surrounding the center circle (left, right, up, and down). The subject must then pick up his finger and tap on the white square as quickly as possible. The AntiPoint task (\nFig. 1B\n) is identical to the ProPoint task with respect to visual stimuli and amplitude of pointing movements; however, the subject must instead quickly tap on the square that is opposite to the white stimulus square that appears on the screen. The AntiPoint task measures cognitive control and recruits the frontal lobe because the response requires the subject to inhibit a stimulus-directed hand-pointing movement and generate instead a willful or internally based (\u201copposite\u201d) hand-pointing response.\n23\n,\n24\nEach subject completed at least 48 trials for each of the ProPoint and AntiPoint tasks. If the subject made an error (touched a location more than 3.3 degrees (1.9\u2009cm) from the center of the correct location, calculated by the iPad), the trial was scored as an error and presented in random order again at the end of the task, up to a maximum of 60 total trials. Overall, participants performed an average of 49.7 trials (SD \u00b12.8). For each trial, the RT (the duration in msec from the onset of the stimulus to the time when the subject's finger taps on a goal location) and whether the response was correct or not (within 3.3 degrees of goal location) was recorded. Each testing session took about 2\u2009min to complete.\nThere were three testing sessions from three participants in the soccer group in which participants performed the opposite task. Because these participants did not complete a single correct trial that could be used in our analyses of RT, these testing sessions (all post-training session, ProPoint task [\nn\n=\u20091] and AntiPoint task [\nn\n=\u20092]) were excluded from the data analysis. Further, there were six testing sessions (from four soccer players, pre-training [\nn\n=\u20091] and post-training session [\nn\n=\u20095]) in which the participants either initially performed the task incorrectly for a number of trials or switched in the middle of a task to performing the task incorrectly for a number of trials, but then corrected themselves and performed the correct task. Even including these set-shifting errors, subjects made few errors (mean 3.3% across all trials).\n\nAnalysis\nSample size calculation\nThe estimated SD for RT was approximately 23\u2009msec for ProPoint and 38\u2009msec for AntiPoint based on a previous study.\n12\nA sample size of 14 per group is sufficient to detect 25\u2009msec and 40\u2009msec differences between groups in RT for ProPoint and AntiPoint tasks, respectively, at a 5% significance level and 80% power.\nDependent measures\nThe key dependent variable recorded by the iPad during the testing sessions was RT, in msec, defined as the duration of time from the appearance of the target stimulus to the subject's touch response on the iPad touch screen. The RTs were adjusted by subtracting the externally measured (with photodiode, microphone, and storage oscilloscope; see Kirchgessner and coworkers\n25\n) average delay of detecting a touch event on the capacitive device (73.88\u2009msec). Only correct trials were used in the analysis of RT (see above). This removed 3.0% of trials and 3.6% of trials for ProPoint and AntiPoint task, respectively. Conditional means were calculated for each Task (ProPoint and AntiPoint), each session, and each participant.\nIn addition, individual RTs that were greater than 2.75 SDs away from the respective conditional mean were excluded, removing an additional 5.2% and 4.4% of trials for ProPoint and AntiPoint task, respectively.\nMixed model analyses\nThe conditional mean RTs, for each pointing task at each session, were compared across groups in a mixed effects model analysis in which the main fixed effect was group (soccer group vs. comparison group) with random effects for the intercept and slope of session to account for correlation between multiple sessions per subject. Within the soccer group, additional mixed effects models, with random intercepts and slopes, were estimated to assess the effect of numbers of each type of headers (long, short, and high) on RT by including an interaction term for the number of headers and sessions. We also evaluated the effect of all headers cumulatively over all sessions on the change of their RT by also including an interaction term. All mixed models were adjusted for fixed effects of age, group, and time since first session. A\np\nvalue <0.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "By leveraging legacy datasets from studies led by TED Co-Investigators, the wider international TBI community, and the ongoing TRACK-TBI study, the TED Metadataset has been created. The TED Metadataset contains granular data on nearly 5000 mild, moderate, and severe TBI study participants across eight studies. The constituent studies include TRACK-TBI Pilot, TRACK-TBI, COBRIT, TBICare, Concussion Research Consortium, ProTECT III, and Mission Connect, and a NINDS-funded mTBI imaging study. These datasets combine to form a wealth of TBI clinical research studies addressing the spectrum of injury severity, and include a wide range of COAs, neuroimaging data, and biospecimens.\n\nExtensive and ongoing work by TED teams has resulted in a methodology that permits harmonization of data collected from the myriad outcome assessments used in the different studies that comprise the Metadataset.39Individual tables map the baseline characteristics and clinical variables that have been collected across Metadataset studies (Supplementary Appendix) (see online supplementary material athttp://www.liebertpub.com) and a table of contents is accessible through the TED website (https://tbiendpoints.ucsf.edu/).

    "Methods": "Animals\nSubjects were male Long-Evans rats (\nN\n=\u200930), 3 months of age when training began. Rats were food restricted to 85% free-feeding weight (14\u201320\u2009g of maintenance chow daily); water was available\nad libitum\n. Rats were pair-housed until surgery, after which they were singly housed in standard cages on a (12:12) reverse light cycle, with a plastic hut and shredded paper towel available as enrichment. Housing and testing were performed in accord with the Canadian Council on Animal Care, and all procedures were approved by the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee.\n\nApparatus\nBehavior was conducted in a bank of 12 standard operant chambers (Med Associates, St Albans, VT) equipped on one side with a five-hole array and on the other with a tone generator, two retractable levers, two lights above the levers, a sucrose pellet dispenser (45-mg pellets; Bio-Serv, Flemington, NJ), and a houselight. The left, center, and right (1, 3, 5) holes in the five-choice panel and the pellet dispenser were used in this experiment.\n\nBehavioral training and baseline\nTraining\nRats were trained similar to previously published parameters.\n29\nRats were habituated to the chamber with sugar pellets placed in the food hopper, and in holes 1, 3, and 5 for one to two sessions. In the first stage of training, rats learned to respond to an illuminated hole 3 to receive one pellet until they successfully completed 30 trials in a single session. In stage two of training, rats responded first to the illuminated hole 3, which turned on a light in either hole 1 or 5 (pseudorandomly), and correct responses were reinforced with a single sugar pellet. Finally, in the last stage, a differential was introduced, with hole 1 delivering four pellets and hole 5 delivering a single pellet. The location of the larger reward hole (hole 1 or 5) was kept constant for each rat throughout training and testing, but counterbalanced between subjects.\nDelay Discounting Task\nAfter the above training, the delay discounting task began. A task schematic is provided in\nFigure 1\n. Sessions lasted 40\u2009min and consisted of four blocks of 12 trials, each of which had a fixed length of 40\u2009sec. A trial began with the illumination of hole 3 and a nose poke would illuminate both choice holes 1 and 5. Failure to respond within 10\u2009sec was scored as an omission and activated the intertrial interval (ITI). Rats chose between the large (four-pellet) and small (one-pellet) option (counterbalanced as above). The small option was always delivered immediately, whereas the delay to the large option increased in a step-wise fashion across successive blocks of trials, from 0 to 5, 10, and finally 20\u2009sec. Every block began with two forced-choice trials to ensure rats were exposed to the current delay contingency. After a choice was made and the reinforcer delivered, there was an ITI equal to the remaining trial time (40\u2009sec minus the delay to reinforcement). Rats were trained until a statistically stable choice baseline emerged (approximately 30 sessions).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSchematic diagram of the delay discounting task. Rats started a trial by nose poking the illuminated center hole. They then chose between a small (1 pellet) and large (4 pellets) option. The small option was delivered immediately, whereas the large option was associated with some level of delay to reinforcement. Across four blocks of 12 trials each, the delay to the large reinforcer was increased from 0 to 5 to 10 to 20\u2009sec. The total trial time was held constant across all blocks. Each block began with two forced choice trials to demonstrate the delay.\n\nSurgery\nRats were matched for task performance and then assigned to severe TBI (\nn\n=\u200910), milder TBI (\nn\n=\u200910), or sham (\nn\n=\u200910) groups. TBI rats were given a bilateral frontal CCI, as previously described, with either severe or milder settings.\n13\n,\n28\nAlthough a truly mild injury is typically induced by closed-skull techniques, these milder settings allow a direct comparison between a severe and much less severe form of injury within the CCI model. In brief, rats were anesthetized and placed in a stereotaxic frame. Ketoprofen (5\u2009mg/kg, subcutaneously [s.c.]), lactated ringer solution (8\u2009mL, s.c.), and bupivicane (0.1\u2009mL of 0.5% solution, s.c. at incision site) were administered. Under aseptic conditions, a mid-line incision was made in the scalp and the fascia retracted. A 6.0-mm-diameter circular craniotomy was performed centered at anteroposterior +3.0, mediolateral 0.0\u2009mm from bregma. A TBI was then induced using an electromagnetic CCI device (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) with a circular, flat-faced, 5-mm-diameter tip, at a rate of 3\u2009m/s to a depth of \u22122.5\u2009mm for 0.5\u2009sec (severe) or a rate of 1\u2009m/s to a depth of \u22120.8\u2009mm for 0.5\u2009sec (milder, \u223c11% of severe force). Post-injury, bleeding was stopped with sterile gauze and the incision sutured. Sham procedures included everything above with the exception of craniotomy and impact. Ketoprofen (5\u2009mg/kg) was administered for pain management 24\u2009h post-surgery.\n\nBehavioral assessment\nDelay Discounting Task\nAfter 1 week of recovery, testing resumed 5 days per week on the DDT until week 8 post-injury.\nMorris Water Maze\nAt week 9 post-injury, rats were assessed in acquisition for 4 days using a fixed-platform MWM paradigm, followed by 4 days using a repeated acquisition paradigm, with a novel platform location each day.\n12\nFor the standard acquisition paradigm, rats were given four trials daily with a 15-min ITI. Each trial began with a pseudorandomized start point at the four cardinal directions on the maze (N, E, S, W), and the platform remained located in the interior of the SE quadrant. If a rat failed to locate the platform within 90\u2009sec, they were guided by hand to the platform. Rats were allowed to remain on the platform for 10\u2009sec and then were removed to a heated cage. On the fifth day, rats were given a 30-sec probe trial in which the platform was removed. The repeated acquisition paradigm began after the probe trial on the fifth day, conducted as specified above, except that the platform location was randomized at the start of each day (NW, NE, SW, SE), and the first trial was considered a learning trial and not included in the data analysis. Latency and path data were recorded using AnyMaze (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL).\n\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis of cytokine levels\nAfter MWM testing completed, at approximately 10 weeks post-injury, one half of the animals (\nn\n=\u200915) were rapidly decapitated, the orbitofrontal and ventral aspects of medial pre-frontal cortex extracted, rapidly frozen on dry ice, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Tissue was lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (pH 8.0) with protease and phosphotase inhibitors. Samples were spun at 13,000 RPM, supernatant extracted, and measured for protein content. Samples were then analyzed for interleukin (IL)-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1), and interferon-gamma IFN\u03b3 by multi-plex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Quansys Q-plex, Logan, UT). In brief, with washes between each step, standards and samples were placed in antibody pre-coated plate wells and incubated under agitation for 90\u2009min, then incubated with a detection mixture (secondary antibody) for 60\u2009min, incubated with a streptavidin/horseradish peroxidase solution for 15\u2009min, and incubated with a coloring reagent until color gradient appeared in standard wells. Optical density was then read using a Q-view imager. Protein concentrations were calculated using the standard curve.\n\nHistology and lesion analysis\nThe other half of subjects (\nn\n=\u200915) were transcardially perfused with saline, followed by 3.7% formalin. Brains were removed and post-fixed in formalin for 24\u2009h and then placed in 30% sucrose solution. Following 3 days in sucrose, brains were sliced at \u221220\u00b0 on a cryostat at 50\u2009\u03bcm and mounted to gelatin-subbed slides.\nLesion analysis\nSlides were stained with cresyl-violet and imaged on a Zeiss microscope (Carl Zeiss, jena, Germany). The total remaining area, lesion area, and ventricular area for five brain sections, evenly spaced through the injury location (+6, +4.5, +3, +1.5, and 0\u2009mm from bregma) were measured using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and the volume estimated using the Cavalieri method.\n30\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe percent choice of the large option in the DDT was used to estimate the slope of the hyperbolic discounting function (\nk\n) using the following equation: V\u2009=\u20091 / (1\u2009+\nk\n*D), where V represents the subjective value (preference for the large option expressed as percent choice of large) and D represents the delay to reinforcement, as outlined in previous work.\n14\nThis measure provides a single value for impulsivity to be compared within and across subjects over repeated testing.\nStatistical tests were conducted using R statistical software (\nhttp://www.r-project.org/\n), using the\nstats\n,\nlme4\n, and\nlmerTest\nlibraries. Transformations were applied to the data as appropriate to normalize distributions. A log transformation was used for\nk\nvalues, MWM latencies, and lesion volumes, and the arcsine-square root transformation was used for the percent time in the MWM probe. Repeated-measures data (impulsivity, MWM, lesion) were analyzed using linear mixed-effects regression, with individual rat intercepts as the random effect.\np\nvalues were estimated using the\nlmerTest\nlibrary. The probe trial of the MWM and cytokine levels were compared in one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs), whereas raw choice values on the DDT were analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA. Any main effects of group were followed up by Tukey's honest significant difference (HSD) post-hoc tests. Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed on cytokine data. A\np\nvalue of less than 0.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "Seventy-one male C57BL/6 mice (5-week-old) were used for these experiments. Mice were housed in 12-h day/night cycles in a pathogen-free environment. Food and water were provided freely. All experiments were approved by the Boston Children's Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Boston, MA) and complied with the National Institutes of Health's \u201cGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\u201d\n\nHousing conditions\nMice were randomized to two different housing conditions: EE (\nn\n=\u200933) or NC (\nn\n=\u200938). EE housing consisted of a Marlau\u2122 cage,\n18\na two-floor cage that offers features designed to stimulate mice such as running wheels, a climbing ladder, a slide tunnel, and mazes. Mice in EE housing were housed 10\u201315 animals per Marlau cage starting 3 days before injury and for the duration of the experiments until they were sacrificed. Mice in EE housing were only removed for behavioral testing. Mice in NC housing were housed 5 animals per cage in standard, translucent, plastic mouse cages.\n\nRepetitive mild traumatic brain injury\nMice were randomized to undergo TBI (\nn\n=\u200938) or sham injury (\nn\n=\u200933) resulting in four experimental groups for the remainder of the study: EE-sham (\nn\n=\u200914); EE-TBI (\nn\n=\u200919); NC-TBI (\nn\n=\u200919); or NC-sham (\nn\n=\u200919). The mouse rmTBI model was used as previously described.\n19\nBriefly, mice (5-week-old males) were anesthetized with 4.5% isoflurane for 45\u2009sec in a 70:30 mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen. Anesthetized mice were then placed on a delicate task wiper (Kimwipe; Kimberly-Clark, Irving, TX) and grasped by the tail. The head was placed directly under a hollow guide tube 71\u2009cm in length. A 54-g metal bolt was then used to deliver the impact to the dorsal aspect of the skull, between the coronal and lambdoid sutures, resulting in rotational acceleration of the head through the Kimwipe. Injured mice underwent seven concussive injuries over 9 days (one injury daily for 5 days, 2 days recovery, then one injury daily for 2 days for a total of seven injuries in 9 days); sham-injured mice underwent anesthesia exposure only. All mice recovered in room air. Loss of consciousness (LOC) was defined as the time from removal of anesthesia to spontaneous righting. For all behavioral testing, experimenters were blinded to injury status, using color-coding stored in a password-protected computer.\nAt 3 days after the last injury, a randomly chosen subset of mice (NC-sham, NC-TBI, and EE-TBI,\nn\n=\u20094/group) were sacrificed for histology without any behavioral testing; the remaining mice (NC-sham, NC-TBI, and EE-TBI,\nn\n=\u200915/group; EE-sham,\nn\n=\u200914/group) underwent behavior testing starting at 3 weeks after the last injury/anesthesia and were sacrificed 5 weeks after the last injury for histology.\n\nBehavior testing\nAssessment of motor function\nThree weeks after the last injury, motor function was assessed by rotarod testing,\n19\nwhich consisted of 1 day of training and 2 days of testing (NC-sham, NC-TBI, and EE-TBI, n\u2009=\u200915/group; EE-sham,\nn\n=\u200914/group). Mice were placed on a rotating drum, 4\u2009cm in diameter, suspended within a box. The first day consisted of training and habituation as follows: Each mouse was individually placed on the rotating drum (4 revolutions per minute [rpm]) for 5\u2009min and was immediately placed back on the rotating drum if the mouse fell off the drum during the 5-min training period. Testing was performed on days 2 and 3. Testing consisted of four testing trials per day. Mice were placed on the rotating drum (4\u2009rpm) for 10\u2009sec to acclimate, after which the rod acceleration was increased by 0.1\u2009rpm/sec. Latency to fall was recorded. Mice received a minimum of 5\u2009min of rest between trials.\n\nAssessment of locomotor activity\nLocomotor activity and anxiety were assessed 24 days after the last injury with the open field test (NC-sham, NC-TBI, and EE-TBI,\nn\n=\u200910/group; EE-sham,\nn\n=\u20099/group). Mice were placed in an opaque circular arena, 45\u2009cm in diameter with walls 20\u2009cm in height. The arena was placed inside a plastic transparent box with a tracking system and then placed inside a closed container to minimize distractions. The circular arena was broken up in to three concentric circles, an \u201cinner\u201d circle (20\u2009cm in diameter), a \u201cneutral\u201d circle (40\u2009cm diameter), and an \u201couter\u201d circle (60\u2009cm diameter). Mice were tracked for 10\u2009min using Noldus EthoVision 11.5 (Noldus Information Technology bv, Wageningen, The Netherlands). Time spent in each circle was then recorded: time spent in the inner ring constituted the least anxious behavior, whereas time spent along the perimeter, in the outer ring, constituted anxious behavior.\n\nAssessment of exploratory activity\nExploratory activity was assessed at 27 days after the last injury using the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM; NC-sham, NC-TBI, and EE-TBI,\nn\n=\u200915/group; EE-sham,\nn\n=\u200914/group). The maze is a plus-shaped, elevated platform (85\u2009cm tall) consisting of two closed arms and two open arms (30\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009cm) extending opposite one another from a square-shaped decision zone in the center (Lafayette Instruments, Lafayette, IN). Mice were placed in the center of the maze facing one of the closed arms, then allowed to explore the maze for 5\u2009min while being tracked (Noldus Ethovision 11.5; Noldus Information Technology bv). The maze was cleaned with Clidox (1:18:1 Clidox Base/Water/Clidox Activator) between each individual trial. Percent time in each arm was calculated: Less time spent in the open arms constituted less exploratory behavior.\n\nAssessment of spatial learning and memory\nSpatial learning and memory was evaluated 30 days after the last injury for 4 consecutive days, using the Morris Water Maze (MWM; NC-sham, NC-TBI, and EE-TBI,\nn\n=\u200915/group; EE-sham,\nn\n=\u200914/group).\n19\n,\n20\nA white circular tub (83\u2009cm diameter, 60\u2009cm deep) was filled with water, approximately 24\u00b0C in temperature, to 29\u2009cm deep. Four clearly visible shapes were placed at four points along the walls of the tub, forming four distinct quadrants. A clear, plastic target platform, 10\u2009cm in diameter, was placed in one quadrant, 1\u2009cm below the water's surface. Five hidden trials were performed in which the target platform was not visible. Each hidden trial consisted of four subtrials in which mice were released from each quadrant in a random order. Mice were released facing the wall and given 90\u2009sec to find the platform, mount it, and remain for 7\u2009sec. Mice that failed to locate the platform were gently guided by the experimenter to the platform and allowed to remain there for 10\u2009sec. Mice were subjected to a maximum of two hidden trials a day, with a minimum of 20\u2009min between each subtrial. On day 5, two visible trials were performed in which a red reflector was placed on the platform. Probe trials were conducted on days 4 and 5, during which the platform was removed from the tank. Mice were placed in the quadrant furthest from the platform and given 60\u2009sec to explore the tank. Noldus Ethovision 11.5 software (Noldus Information Technology bv) tracked time spent in the target quadrant where the platform was previously located.\n\nForced swimming test\nThe forced swimming test\n21\nwas used to evaluate depression-like behavior 38 days post-injury (NC-sham, NC-TBI, and EE-TBI,\nn\n=\u200910/group; EE-sham,\nn\n=\u20099/group). Mice were placed individually in glass cylinders (40\u2009\u00d7\u200918\u2009cm, height\u2009\u00d7\u2009diameter) containing water up to 30\u2009cm at 25\u00b0C for 5\u2009min, and the session was recorded with a video camera. An experimenter, blinded to the animal treatments, observed the videotapes and recorded total immobility time. A mouse was considered immobile when floating and making only the necessary movements to keep its head above the water surface. Experiments were performed between 9:00 and 11:00\npm\n.\n\nSynapse-specific expression by western blot\nMice were sacrificed at 3 days (\nn\n=\u20094/group) and 5 weeks (NC-sham, NC-TBI, and EE-TBI,\nn\n=\u200915/group; EE-sham,\nn\n=\u200914/group) after the last injury for western blot.\n\nTissue preparation and subcellular fractionation\nMice were deeply anesthetized, perfused with phosphate-buffered saline buffer, and brains were dissected to remove the hippocampus and frontal cerebral cortex (including corpus callosum), which were then immediately placed on dry ice and stored in a \u221280\u00b0C freezer until use. The synaptosome fraction\n22\nwas prepared as follows. Tissues were homogenized on ice with a Dounce homogenizer in 10 volumes of Buffer I (320\u2009mM of sucrose, 10\u2009mM of Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 1\u2009mM of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA], 1\u2009mM ehthylene glycol tetraacetic acid, 1\u2009mM of Na\n3\nVO\n4\n, and 5\u2009mM of NaF) and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Life Science, Indianapolis, IN). Homogenates were centrifuged at 800\ng\nat 4\u00b0C for 10\u2009min to obtain supernatants (S1) and to remove nuclei and incompletely homogenized material (P1). The S1 supernatants were centrifuged at 11,000\ng\nat 4\u00b0C for 15\u2009min to obtain a crude synaptosomal fraction (P2) and supernatant (S2). The P2 was suspended in Buffer II (320\u2009mM of sucrose, 10\u2009mM of Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 1\u2009mM of EDTA, 1\u2009mM of Na\n3\nVO\n4\n, 5\u2009mM of NaF, 0.5\u2009mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Triton X100, and cocktail) and then centrifuged at 150,000\ng\nat 4\u00b0C for 1 hour to obtain (P3) and supernatants (S3). The P3 pellets were suspended in Buffer I containing 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).\n\nWestern blots\nEqual amounts of protein (20\u2009\u03bcg) were separated by 4\u201315% SDS gradient gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidenedifluoride membranes, and blocked with 5% nonfat milk. After blocking, proteins were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with antibodies targeting proteins glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1; 1: 1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA), phosphorylated GluR1 (p-GluR1; [s845]; 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), p-GluR1 (s831; 1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), \u03b2-actin (1:5000; Abcam), nuclear receptor 1 (NR1; 1:1000; Abcam), N-methyl-\nd\n-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit 2A (NR2A; 1:1000; Millipore, Billerica, MA), NMDA receptor subunit 2B (NR2B; 1:1000; Abcam), amyloid precursor protein (APP; 1:1000; Millipore), phosphorylated Ca\n2+\n/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (p-CaMKII; 1:2000; Cell signaling Technology), calpain-1 (1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95; 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), and sodium potassium ATPaes (Na/K-ATPase; 1:1000; Millipore). Proteins were then incubated with horseradish-peroxidase\u2013conjugated secondary antibodies for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Data were scanned and pixel intensities were retrieved directly from blots using Image Quant LAS 4010 (GE Healthcare Biosciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ). Films were exposed at different times to ensure the optimum density, and pictures were assayed using ImageJ software (Sun Microsystems, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Protein levels were first normalized to internal control levels for each sample and then were measured as fold changes with respect to controls.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll experiments were replicated three times independently. Sample-size calculations were based on our previous studies, accounting for expected performance of uninjured and injured groups and a [clinically meaningful] moderate effect size of intervention. Summarized data are presented as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean. MWM and rotarod latencies (with normal distributions) were analyzed by repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA; group\u2009\u00d7\u2009time) or linear regression, controlling for injury (sham or closed head), cage (EE or NC condition), and time (using clustered robust standard errors). EPM and open field were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey honest significant difference (HSD) post-hoc test. Open field frequencies were analyzed using a Kruskal-Wallis test. Western blot data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA followed by the intergroup Tukey HSD post-hoc test. Data was graphed using GraphPad Prism (version 5; GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA) and analyzed with STATA software (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). Statistical significance was set at *\np\n<\u20090.05 and **\np\n<\u20090.01."

    "Methods": "Study population\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the home institution and written informed consent was obtained from the participants or their legally authorized representatives. A total of 42 adults with TBI were examined approximately 3 months following injury (mean 104\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD 18 days), as part of a planned longitudinal study. Recruitment spanned a 40-month period between August 2012 and December 2015. Commonly used clinical indices of TBI severity were abstracted from the medical record or measured prospectively during hospitalization. These included the initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) from the emergency department; time to follow commands (TFC), defined as the number of days between the TBI and consistent following of simple motor commands over a 24-h period; and duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), defined as the number of days between the TBI and the date of the first of two scores \u226525 on the Orientation Log\n23\nadministered \u226472\u2009h apart. For patients who were discharged from rehabilitation care while still in PTA, their PTA duration was estimated conservatively at days between TBI and rehabilitation discharge +1.\nSubjects were included based on age between 18\u201364 years and a history of non-penetrating TBI of at least moderate severity defined by at least one of the following: 1) GCS <13 in the emergency department (not due to sedation, paralysis, or intoxication); 2) documented loss of consciousness for \u226512\u2009h; and 3) PTA \u226524\u2009h. Participants were excluded for: 1) history of prior TBI, central nervous system disease, seizure disorder, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder; 2) history of abuse of alcohol or stimulants (e.g., cocaine) likely to have resulted in neurologic sequelae; 3) pregnancy; 4) inability to complete MRI scanning due to ferromagnetic implants, claustrophobia, or restlessness; 5) non-fluency in English; and 6) level of disability too great to allow for completion of testing and scanning 3 months post-TBI. To maximize the likelihood of TAI in the absence of large focal brain lesions, participants also were excluded if the total estimated volume of focal intraparenchymal lesions was greater than 5\u2009cm\n3\nfor subcortical lesions and 50\u2009cm\n3\nfor cortical lesions. In addition, 35 healthy volunteers matched to TBI subjects by age, gender, and years of education were recruited. Exclusion criteria for controls were the same as above, with an additional exclusion for any history of TBI resulting in loss or alteration of consciousness.\n\nDTI acquisition and processing\nBrain MRI examinations were performed on a 3 tesla MRI scanner (Siemens Trio, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), which included two 30-direction DTI acquisitions with two b-values (b\u2009=\u20090\u2009sec/mm\n2\nand b\u2009=\u20091000\u2009sec/mm\n2\n). Seven b0 images were spaced out throughout the acquisition. DTI was acquired at 2.2\u2009mm isotropic resolution using an echo time of 84\u2009msec, repetition time of 6500\u2009msec, and flip angle of 90\u00b0. In addition, a high-resolution T1 magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo sequence was acquired at 1\u2009mm isotropic resolution using an echo time of 3.08\u2009msec, repetition time of 1620\u2009msec, and a flip angle of 15\u00b0. T1-weighted images were utilized for manual segmentation of focal lesions by a trained observer under supervision of a neurologist with extensive experience in lesion assessment. Also, accuracy of lesion segmentation was also verified by a neuroradiology fellow (J.B.W.). Each subject's T1-weighted image was then registered to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using a diffeomorphic registration procedure.\n24\nThe resultant transformations were then used to map each subject's focal lesion masks into standard space, where the volume of encephalomalcia was subsequently quantified.\nDTI volumes were first visually inspected for artifacts. Subsequently, the two DTI acquisitions were concatenated to improve signal-to-noise ratio. The image processing tools available in FMRIB Software Library (FSL) were then used to correct DTI volumes for eddy current distortions and remove non-brain tissue.\n25\n,\n26\nUsing a tensor-based registration procedure, which combines affine and diffeomorphic registration steps (DTI-TK),\n27\n,\n28\neach subject's DTI data was first registered to an unbiased population-specific DTI template\n29\nbefore ultimately being co-registered to a standard-space DTI template (IIT-256).\n30\nThis procedure was motivated by previous studies demonstrating that voxel-wise analyses of DTI data are particularly sensitive to accuracy of co-registration, which can be improved by utilizing information encoded by the entire diffusion tensor.\n31\n,\n32\nIn a recent head-to-head comparison, DTI-TK outperformed other commonly used methods of DTI co-registration,\n33\nimportant for minimizing potential shape and volumetric confounds of voxel-wise DTI data analysis in clinical populations.\n28\nCo-registered DTI data were then resampled into the standard MNI coordinate system and subject-specific voxel-wise maps of FA were derived. Finally, to restrict analysis to white matter, each subject's FA map was masked using a custom white matter mask derived from FSL's fast segmentation\n34\napplied to the 1-mm MNI 152 template brain, combined with white matter ROIs from the ICBM-152 Johns Hopkins White Matter Atlas\n35\nto better represent deep white matter structures.\n\nDTI analysis\nTo compare group-wise differences in FA with inter-individual consistency in the TBI group, DTI data was analyzed in both a group-wise and a subject-specific fashion. Following pre-processing, group level voxel-wise comparison of FA between TBI subjects and controls was performed using the nonparametric permutation tool \u201crandomize,\u201d\n36\npart of FSL, while utilizing the threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) method of multiple comparison correction.\n37\nIndividual DTI analysis was performed using the DisCo-Z method, which has previously been described in detail.\n19\nBriefly, subject-specific FA maps in both the control and subject groups are initially Z-transformed using the voxel-wise mean and standard deviation of the control population. Z-thresholds for the control and subject populations are then corrected to maintain identical alpha between groups, thereby eliminating bias resulting from differing degrees of freedom and non-independence of control subject responses with respect to the reference mean and standard deviation.\n19\n,\n38\nThe magnitude of threshold adjustment, which depends only on the size of the control population, renders the probability of obtaining voxel-wise extrema from DTI scalar maps equivalent in two otherwise identical groups.\n19\nTo focus specifically on TAI, we only considered the lower portion of this distribution (clusters of abnormally low FA).\nSpatial consistency of injury patterns was then assessed across a range of DisCo-Z thresholds (0 < |DisCo-Z| < 4) by computing effect overlap maps in a manner analogous to that proposed by Seghier and Price.\n39\nSubject-specific DisCo-Z maps are computed at each threshold value, then combined across subjects to form an overlap map in which the value of each voxel represents the proportion of subjects with effects present at that voxel for a given threshold. A weighting function is then applied to penalize lower thresholds, and final threshold-weighted overlap map (OM) is derived by taking the area under the curve of the cumulative histogram at each voxel across subjects. We utilized the following linear weighting function proposed by Seghier and Price,\n39\nwhich ensures OM values range from 0\u20131, with 1 indicating an effect in a particular voxel is present in each subject at each threshold:\nAdditionally, to examine whether more severely impaired processing speed is associated with a specific, consistent pattern of injury, we computed overlap maps separately among the TBI subjects with and without impaired processing speed.\nTo illustrate the relative frequency of regional injury across TBI subjects, each subject's DisCo-Z map was calculated at a single threshold, |DisCoZ| > 2. Additional spatial thresholding was applied using Monte Carlo simulation to determine the necessary cluster size correction to maintain a family-wise error rate at\np\n<\u20090.05 based on the average smoothness of the FA data (3.8\u2009mm). This additional correction takes advantage of the notion that voxel-wise extrema resulting from TAI are more likely to be spatially contiguous than extrema resulting from chance. Next, the ICBM-152 Johns Hopkins White Matter Atlas\n35\nwas used to define 28 ROIs in an automated fashion (\nTable 1\n;\nFig. 1\n). For each region, the frequency of injury across the population was calculated. A region was considered to be injured in a particular subject if it contained any abnormal voxels in the subject's final DisCo-Z injury map. The number of regions containing injury across the population also was calculated.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nMap of regions of interest used to investigate relative frequency of regional injury across traumatic brain injury (TBI) subjects, as well as the frequency distribution of injured tracts within individual TBI subjects.

The Processing Speed Index (PSI) from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV was selected as a measure likely to be sensitive to the spatial extent of TAI in TBI.\n40\nFirst, a regression analysis was performed between the PSI standard score and voxel-wise FA within the TBI population using permutation testing with TFCE for multiple comparison correction. Correlations were deemed significant if the corrected\np\nwas <0.05. Then, to examine the utility of individual DisCo-Z maps in predicting post-traumatic deficits, we performed a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for identification of TBI patients with impaired processing speed, defined as <1.5 SD below the control group mean, a commonly -used cutoff for determining impairment on neuropsychological tests. For this analysis the total number of abnormal voxels in each subject's DisCo-Z map is extracted and square root transformed to improve normality.\n20\nClassification accuracy of the DisCo-Z measure was compared with that of FA measurements in ROIs commonly used to index severity of TBI by assessing the area under the ROC curve. Comparison ROIs including sub-regions of the corpus callosum, sub-regions of the corona radiata, superior longitudinal fasciculi, and posterior limbs of the internal capsules. Lastly, we assessed classification accuracy of subject-specific DTI analysis while controlling for age and focal lesion volume by repeating the ROC analysis after regressing the effects of these covariates from the DisCo-Z measure."

    "Methods": "Study design\nThis retrospective study used data from the Rick Hansen Spinal Cord Injury Registry (RHSCIR), which is a prospective registry of patients with a new tSCI from 18\u2009SCI acute and 13 rehabilitation facilities located in 16 cities across Canada. All RHSCIR participating acute facilities were Level I/II trauma centers at the time of study,\n21\n,\n22\nand all RHSCIR facilities would be considered to be acute SCI specialty centers as defined by the recommended attributes in Parent and coworkers and Noonan and coworkers.\n4\n,\n22\nEach participating facility obtained institutional research ethics board approval to enroll patients. A core data set was collected for all registrants, whereas an expanded data set was collected for those who provided informed consent. Further details about RHSCIR have been previously published.\n23\n,\n24\nThis study included patients who were admitted to an acute RHSCIR facility between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2013, provided informed consent for the collection of the expanded data set, and had level of injury at L2 and above (\nFig. 1\n). The fairly narrow time range was chosen to minimize the effect of evolving care practice,\n2\n,\n25\nspecifically as a result of the guidelines regarding early transport to SCI center that have been published in recent years.\n2\u20135\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nFlow of patients in the RHSCIR and selection of patients for analysis. RHSCIR; Rick Hansen Spinal Cord Injury Registry; FSA, Forward Sortation Area.\n\nStudy variables\nPatient variables included age at time of injury and gender. Injury variables included injury mechanism (fall, transport, sports, assault, other), kinetic energy related to injury mechanism (low, high energy [i.e., any injury involving a high velocity situation, e.g., gunshot wound, pedestrian struck, auto crash >65\u2009km/h or falls >6\u2009m]), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) at admission (severe to moderate decreased level of consciousness, 3\u201312; mildly altered level of consciousness, 13\u201315), Injury Severity Score (ISS) at admission (\u2264 25; > 25 indicating major trauma to another body region in addition to the spine),\n26\nneurological classification by American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS) (A, B, C, D) and neurological level at admission (high cervical, C1-C4; low cervical, C5-T1; thoracic, T2-T10; thoracolumbar, T11-L2), both of which were derived from the International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI (ISNCSCI) examination.\n27\nMissing ISS data were imputed based on the joint distribution of AIS and neurological level at admission.\nGeographical factors\nThe RHSCIR acute facility where patient was admitted and the forward sortation area (FSA) of injury location were obtained from RHSCIR. FSA is a well-defined zone within a larger geographic region based on the first three characters of the postal code.\n28\nSystem factors\nThe following durations (in hours) were calculated: time between injury and admission to non-RHSCIR acute facility, and time between injury and admission to RHSCIR acute facility.\nOutcome variable\nThe primary outcome variable in this study was triage pattern (direct vs. indirect admission). Direct admission was defined as occurring when patients were transported directly from site of injury to a RHSCIR acute facility; indirect admission was defined as arrival at a RHSCIR acute facility from site of injury via one or more hospitals.\n\nGeomapping analysis\nMapQuest application program interface (API) (MapQuest Inc.) integrated with SAS software was applied to determine the centroid of each FSA, yielding a unique combination of latitude and longitude coordinates of each FSA's geometric center. These coordinates and that of RHSCIR acute facilities, as calculated by Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology, were used to determine the road distance between injury and RHSCIR facility. Road distance was categorized as either <40\u2009km, 40\u2013350\u2009km, or >350\u2009km. The lower category (40\u2009km) was based on trauma destination decision guidelines that advise trauma patients be transported to the most appropriate trauma center if transport time would be <40\u2009min;\n29\nequivalent to \u223c40\u2009km if driving at 60\u2009km/h. The upper category (350\u2009km) was based on the average distance traveled by helicopter with one tank of fuel if one was deployed for transportation of patients.\nThe geographical distribution of tSCI was estimated and illustrated using Maptitude 2013 (Caliper Corporation) overlaid with population density obtained from Demography Division, Statistics Canada (2011).\n30\nPositions were marked for each patient randomly within the reported FSA of injury.\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive analysis was performed to describe the entire study population. Further analysis was performed with the cohort of individuals whose injury location was within 40\u2009km of the RHSCIR acute facility, within which the direct admissions were compared with the indirect admissions using bivariate analysis. Differences among medians of continuous variables were compared using Wilcoxon rank sum test, and differences among percentages of categorical variables were examined using the X\n2\ntest. A multivariate logistical regression model was developed to examine the variables associated with indirect admission. Variables that were statistically and clinically significant, and provinces with indirect admissions within 40\u2009km of a RHSCIR acute facility, were considered for inclusion in the multivariate regression model.\nA sensitivity analysis was performed to examine cohort selection bias between patients included and those who were excluded because of missing FSA data. Cohorts were compared based on age, gender, injury mechanism, AIS, and neurological level at admission.\nA\np\nvalue of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. All analyses were performed using SAS software, Version 9.4 of the SAS System for Windows, copyright \u00a9 2013, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC.\n\nSimulation modeling\nAge and gender distribution, probability of triage pattern (direct/indirect admission), and distribution of road distance between injury location and RHSCIR acute facility, all of which were derived from the analysis cohort in this study, were used in the ACT model to explore the impact of triage pattern on process of care.\nThree scenarios were analyzed: 1) current direct admission rate (baseline), 2) 100% direct admission, and 3) 100% indirect admission. The outcome of interest was time to admission, which was defined as the duration between time of injury and admission to a RHSCIR acute facility. The model was run 15 times and the final outcome was the average of the 15 replications. Outcome was calculated with the following equation: outcome\u2009=\u2009(time to admission\nscenario\n\u2013 time to admission\nbaseline\n)/time to admission\nbaseline\n."

    "Methods": "Animal care\nBarrier-raised and specific pathogen-free male Sprague-Dawley rats 16 weeks of age were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Animals were individually housed in a temperature- and light-controlled room on a 12-h light/dark cycle. Rats were fed commercially available rodent chow (2018 Teklad Global 18% Protein Rodent Diet; Harlan Laboratories Inc., Indianapolis, IN) and tap water\nad libitum\n. All experimental procedures conformed to the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources Guide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals and were approved by the Institutional Care and Use Committee at the Gainesville VA Medical Center (Gainesville, FL).\n\nExperimental design\nRats (\nn\n= 10\u201312/group) were stratified by body mass into the following groups: 1) Sham surgery (T\n9\nlaminectomy) + vehicle (SHAM); 2) T\n9\nlaminectomy + severe contusion SCI + vehicle (SCI); 3) SCI+TE; and (4) SCI+TE+FIN. Animals received TE (7.0 mg/week in 0.1 mL of sesame oil, intramuscular [i.m.]) or vehicle (0.1 mL/week of sesame oil, i.m.) at time of surgery and at weekly intervals thereafter in combination with daily FIN (5.0 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous [s.c.]) or vehicle (90% safflower oil/10% ethanol) for the duration of the experiment. Blood was sampled from the tail tip at monthly intervals. Animals were assessed for open-field locomotion by two blinded observers using the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale\n21\nat day 7 and every other week thereafter. Declomycin and calcein (all chemicals obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, unless noted) were administered (15 mg/kg body weight, s.c.) at 10 and 3 days before sacrifice, respectively, for fluorochrome labeling of bone surfaces. Rats were sacrificed 8 weeks post-surgery, by thoracotomy and exsanguination while under isoflurane anesthesia, because cancellous and cortical bone loss peak within this time frame in our rodent SCI model (unpublished laboratory data). Blood was acquired by intracardiac puncture, and the left and right femurs and tibias, prostate, and levator ani/bulbocavernosus (LABC) muscle complex were excised and weighed.\nBlood was centrifuged at 3000\ng\nand serum aliquots were separated and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until analyzed. Bones were measured with a digital micrometer (Mitutoyo, Aurora, IL). Femurs were wrapped in saline-saturated gauze to prevent dehydration and stored at \u221220\u00b0C for microcomputed tomography (\n\u03bc\nCT) and bone mechanical testing. Tibias were fixed in formalin for 48 h and then stored in 70% ethanol at 4\u00b0C before histomorphometry. The prostate and LABC were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\n\nSurgery and post-surgical care\nAnimals were kept on a circulating water-heated pad to maintain body temperature and remained under isoflurane anesthesia during surgery. The T\n9\nsegment of the spinal cord was exposed by laminectomy under sterile conditions and a 250-kdyne force was applied to the spinal cord with the Infinite Horizons Impactor (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, Lexington, KY), which induces a severe mid-thoracic contusion SCI, according to our published methodology.\n11\n,\n12\nConfirmation of T\n9\nlaminectomy/injury was verified at time of surgery using anatomical landmarks and during dissection at sacrifice. Animals received buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg, s.c.) and ketoprofen (5.0 mg/kg, s.c.) to reduce pain and inflammation for 36 h post-SCI, and ampicillin was administered (100 mg/kg, s.c.) for 5 days post-surgery. Post-operative care included daily examinations for signs of distress, weight loss, dehydration, fecal clearance, bladder dysfunction, and for urinary tract infections (none noted). Manual bladder expression was performed at least twice-daily until spontaneous voiding returned. Ringer\u2019s (s.c.) was provided post-surgery to promote rehydration. In order to assist with body mass recovery, animals received a daily nutritional supplement (Jell-O cube with added protein and fat) with sliced apples and Fruit Loops (Kellogg\u2019s, Battle Creek, MI).\n\nDrug administration\nTE (Savient Pharmaceutical, East Brunswick, NJ), a slowly released testosterone ester that maintains serum testosterone in the supraphyiological range,\n22\nwas dissolved in vehicle (sesame oil) and injected into alternating quadriceps musculature once-weekly, under brief isoflurane anesthesia. The TE dose (7.0 mg/week) was chosen because we have previously reported that it completely prevents cancellous bone loss in male rodents after contusion SCI,\n11\n,\n12\neffects that are blunted with lower TE doses,\n11\nand because this drug regimen mimics a recent clinical trial in our laboratory assessing the musculoskeletal and prostate responses to TE treatment in non-neurologically impaired hypogonadal men.\n19\nFIN (Sigma-Aldrich), a type II 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor that suppresses circulating\n23\nand intraprostatic DHT,\n24\nwas dissolved in vehicle (90% safflower oil/10% ethanol) and injected (5.0 mg/kg, s.c.) daily. The FIN dose was chosen based on findings of a pilot study in which control rats received TE, along with graded FIN doses (5.0, 7.5, or 10.0 mg/kg daily, s.c.). The 5.0-mg/kg FIN dose prevented prostate enlargement over 21 days, with no differences in prostate mass noted among doses.\n\nBone histomorphometry\nWe evaluated cancellous and cortical bone characteristics at the proximal tibial metaphysis and tibial diaphysis, respectively, using standard histomorphometric techniques, as previously described.\n11\nBriefly, the right tibia was excised at sacrifice, cut in half cross-sectionally with a Dremel Moto Tool (Dremel, Racine, WI), placed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin for 48-h tissue fixation, dehydrated in ethanol, and embedded undecalcified in methyl methacrylate. Proximal tibiae were sectioned longitudinally at 4- and 8-(m thicknesses with a Leica/Jung 2065 microtome. The 4-(m bone sections were stained by the Von Kossa method with a tetrachrome counterstain (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA) for the assessment of cancellous bone structure, and the 8-(m bone sections of the proximal tibial metaphysis remained unstained to measure fluorochrome-based indices of bone formation. The tibial diaphyses were sawed in 200-\n\u03bc\nm-thick cross-sections with an Isomet low-speed saw (Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL) at a location 1\u20132 mm proximal to the tibiofibular junction and ground to a thickness of 50\n\u03bc\nm before the histomorphometric evaluation of cortical bone fluorochrome-based indices of bone formation. The sample area at the proximal tibial metaphysis began 0.5 mm distal to the growth plate and excluded the primary spongiosa and cancellous bone within 0.25 mm of the endocortical surfaces. Osteoblast (Ob.S/BS, %) and osteoclast (Oc.S/BS, %) surfaces were calculated as percentages of total cancellous perimeter, using the Osteomeasure System (Osteometrics, Atlanta, GA). Fluorochrome-based indices of cancellous (proximal metaphysis) and cortical (diaphysis) bone formation were measured under ultraviolet illumination. Mineralizing surface (MS), an index of active bone formation, was calculated as the percentage of cancellous (MS/BS), periosteal (Ps.MS/BS, %), and endocortical (Ec.MS/BS, %) bone surfaces with a double fluorochrome label. Mineral apposition rate (MAR), an index of osteoblast activity, was calculated by dividing the interlabel distance by the time interval between administration of fluorochrome labels (i.e., 7 days). Bone formation rate (BFR/BS) was calculated at each skeletal site by multiplying MS/BS by MAR.\n\nMicrocomputed tomography analysis of bone morphometry\nThe right femoral metaphysis and diaphysis were scanned with a Bruker Skyscan 1172\n\u03bc\nCT (Bruker Microct, Kontich, Belgium) according to our published methods.\n8\n,\n11\n,\n12\n,\n25\nThe acquisition settings were as follows: 80 kVP/120\n\u03bc\nA; 0.5 mm aluminum filter; 2K camera resolution; 9.86\n\u03bc\nm voxel size; 0.7-degree rotation step; and 180-degree tomographic rotation. The cancellous region of interest (ROI) at the distal femoral metaphysis began 2 mm proximal to the growth plate and encompassed a total of 3.5 mm. The cortical ROI at the distal femoral metaphysis began at 19% of the total femur length, in order to avoid all residual growth plate in this region, and encompassed a total of 2 mm. This skeletal site was chosen because it is a primary site of bone fractures that required hospitalization in the SCI population.\n5\nThe ROI at the femoral diaphysis began at 45% of the femur length, to avoid the third trochanter, and encompassed 2 mm. Cross-sectional images were reconstructed in NRecon using a filtered back-projection algorithm and two-dimensional/three-dimensional morphometric parameters were analyzed in CTAn (Bruker Microct. Cancellous measurements at the distal femur include: cancellous bone volume (BV/TV, %); trabecular number (Tb.N, #/mm); trabecular separation (Tb.Sp, mm); trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, mm); and trabecular pattern factor (Tb.Pf, #/mm). Cortical measurements include: total cross-sectional bone (plus medullary) area (Tt.Ar, mm\n2\n); cortical bone area (Ct.Ar, mm\n2\n); medullary area (Ma.Ar, mm\n2\n); cortical area fraction (Ct.Ar/Tt.Ar, %); and cortical thickness (Ct.Th, mm). Additionally, medullary volumetric (v)BMD (cancellous bone only) was evaluated using the previously defined ROI within the distal femur and cortical volumetric tissue mineral density was assessed using the previously defined distal femur and femoral diaphysis ROI. Densities were determined following calibration with hydroxyapatite phantoms.\n\nBone mechanical testing\nSubsequent to\n\u03bc\nCT the right distal femora underwent an anterior-posterior cantilever mechanical test using our recently described methods,\n8\nwhich results in a reproducible supracondylar fracture. Briefly, femora were thawed to room temperature and cut cross-sectionally near the midshaft with a Dremel MotoTool (Dremel, Mt. Prospect, IL). The mid-shafts of the distal femora were embedded vertically in fiberglass resin (Bondo, St. Paul, MN) inside separate hard plastic cuvettes [measuring 1.25 cm (length) \u00d7 1.25 cm (width) \u00d7 4.5 cm (depth)] with the distal ~8 cm of the femora remaining unembedded. The unembedded portion of the distal femora was wrapped in saline-saturated gauze throughout this process to ensure the bone remained adequately hydrated. The cuvette was then secured in a horizontal position on a servohydraulic testing machine (MTS 858 Bionix Test System; MTX, Eden Prarie, MN) with the anterior portion of the femur facing up. A flat steel fixture attached to the MTS was placed in direct contact with the unembedded anterior portion of the femur at a distance ~5 cm from the distal end. Subsequently, 10 cycles of sinusoidal preload (from 0 to 10 N) were applied to the femur in the anterior-to-posterior direction, followed by the bending load that was applied at 1.0 mm/s until failure of the specimen, which resulted in a supracondylar fracture. The maximum load (N), displacement at maximal load (mm), and stiffness (N/mm) were determined from the load-deformation curves that were generated by the MTS software, and the distance from the distal end of the femur to the fracture was measured to assess reproducibility of the fracture location across samples.\n\nSerum measurements\nSerum measurements were performed in duplicate on a single plate. Testosterone was determined by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) that has a sensitivity of 0.02 ng/mL and an intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) <9% (ALPCO Diagnostics, Salem, NH). Total pro-collagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP; a circulating marker of whole-body bone formation) was determined by EIA with a sensitivity of 0.7 ng/mL, and an intra-assay CV <7.4% and tartrate resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRAP5b; a circulating marker of whole-body bone resorption) was determined using an EIA that requires 25\n\u03bc\nL of serum and has a sensitivity of 0.1 U/L and an intra-assay CV below 5.8% (Immunodiagnostic Systems, Fountain Hills, AZ).\n\nStatistical analysis\nResults are reported as means \u00b1 standard error of the mean. An \u03b1 level of\np\n< 0.05 was defined as the threshold of significance. Mixed-model repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used to analyze variables that were assessed at multiple time points. One-way ANOVAs were used to analyze data that were assessed at a single time point. Fisher\u2019s least significant difference post-hoc tests were performed for multiple comparisons among groups, when appropriate. Hormone values that were below the lowest detectable standard are reported as such and were assigned a value equal to the sensitivity of each individual assay for the purposes of statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed with the SPSS statistical software package (v15.0.0; IBM, Chicago, IL)."

    "Methods": "This study was conducted and reported according to the criteria of the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement.31\n\nStudy design\nThe TRACK-TBI Pilot study was a multi-center, prospective observational study conducted at three Level I trauma centers in the U.S.: San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH), University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), and University Medical Center Brackenridge in Austin, Texas, using the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) TBI Common Data Elements (CDEs) version 1 (\nhttps://commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov/TBI.aspx\n). Eligible subjects were enrolled upon presentation to the ED through convenience sampling at all three sites between April 2010 and June 2012. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained at all sites. Informed consent was obtained for all participants prior to enrollment in the study. For participants unable to provide consent due to their injury, consent was obtained from their legally authorized representative. Participants were re-consented, if cognitively able, at later inpatient and/or outpatient study follow-up assessments. The current analysis focuses on post-concussive symptoms as measured by the RPQ; other outcome measures obtained at 6 months post-injury included the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E), Brief Symptom Inventory-18 Item, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version, Trail Making Test, and\nCalifornia Verbal Learning Test, Second Edition,\nas previously described.\n30\n\nPatient selection\nInclusion criteria for the TRACK-TBI Pilot study were adult patients (age \u226516 years) presenting to one of the participating Level I trauma centers suffering external force trauma to the head with sufficient indications to triage to clinically indicated head computed tomography (CT) scan within 24\u2009h of injury. There were no requirements for visible pathology on CT scan.\n30\nExclusion criteria were pregnancy, comorbid life-threatening disease, incarceration, serious psychiatric and neurologic disorders that would interfere with outcome assessment, and non-English speakers due to limitations in participation with outcome assessments. For the present study, our analysis was restricted to the subset of patients with mTBI, defined by a GCS score \u226513.\n\nMeasurements\nTo assess the presence/absence and severity of post-concussive symptoms, subjects completed the RPQ at 6 months following injury, in person with trained study personnel, preceded by the Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test to assess capacity. All study personnel were trained on outcome measure administration by a single neuropsychological outcomes coordinator from UPMC. As previously described, the RPQ is a sensitive and validated assessment tool for the presence of post-concussive symptoms\n16\n,\n17\n,\n25\u201329\nand is a core level NINDS TBI CDE.\n32\nIt is comprised of questions directed toward the following 16 symptoms: headache, nausea or vomiting, dizziness, sensitivity to noise, disrupted sleep, irritability, frustration, fatigue, depression, impaired memory, poor concentration, slowed thinking, blurred vision, double vision, light sensitivity, and restlessness. Each symptom is rated on a 5-point scale to assess whether the symptom has been absent, no more of a problem, or a mild, moderate, or severe problem in the 24\u2009h prior to completing the questionnaire, compared with pre-injury. As recommended by previous research,\n33\nthe scores 0 and 1 were collapsed into a single category, scored at 0 points. This resulted in a 4-point scale with the following categories: symptom is absent or no more of a problem (0), symptom is mild (1), symptom is moderate (2), or symptom is severe (3). The total score was determined by adding up all scores 0 to 3, which results in a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 48. Subject responses may then be clustered into distinct neuropsychiatric domains: i) cognitive deficits (impaired memory, poor concentration, slowed thinking); ii) somatic complaints (headaches, blurred or double vision, noise sensitivity, dizziness, nausea, sleep disturbances, fatigue); and iii) psychological complaints (irritability, depression, frustration, restlessness).\n16\n\nSelection of candidate predictors\nA systematic literature search was performed using subheadings and text words in EMBASE and Google Scholar to identify systematic reviews and prior published prediction modeling developing studies that assessed predictors of post-concussive symptoms (or related outcomes) following mTBI (see\nAppendix A\nfor the EMBASE search strategy). To maximize the potential application of a prediction model to clinical practice, candidate predictors not readily available in the ED or during initial clinical evaluation were excluded. The following were chosen as candidate predictors: age, gender, years of education, pre-injury seizures, pre-injury migraine or headache, pre-injury psychiatric disorders, blood alcohol level (BAL >80\u2009mg/dL [U.S. legal limit]; \u2264 80\u2009mg/dL; not measured), GCS score, CT abnormalities (present; absent), post-traumatic amnesia (PTA; present; absent; not measured), LOC (present; absent; not measured), and extracranial injury. We further included whether subjects suffered a prior TBI per self-report as a potential candidate predictor. Prior TBI was assessed using the NINDS TBI CDEs version 1,\n34\nand classified as yes (with or without hospitalization) or no. Although not found in systematic reviews and previous prediction modeling studies, we hypothesized that deficits from repeated TBIs may be cumulative and thus may result in greater post-concussive symptoms burden. Information on candidate predictors was gathered through abstraction of medical records and from patient interviews during the index hospital visit.\n\nStatistical analysis\nBaseline characteristics of the overall study population were reported as medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) and frequencies and percentages for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. To verify whether loss to follow-up resulted in possible bias, we compared baseline characteristics of included patients with those patients who had a missing 6-month RPQ (\nn\n=\u2009199), using the Pearson chi-squared statistic for categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney\nU\ntest for continuous variables. Missing data on candidate predictors were subsequently imputed with a single imputation technique, meaning that values for the missing data points were estimated in a regression model using all other predictor variables and outcomes as independent variables.\nWe described the RPQ total scale and subscales (mean, SD, range), and assessed the association between the RPQ total scale and subscales and functional outcome (as measured by the GOS-E), as well as intercorrelations between scales, using the non-parametric Spearman's Rho correlation coefficient. We subsequently calculated Cronbach's alpha for the RPQ total scales and subscales as a measurement of internal consistency.\nTo calculate the effect of candidate predictors on the RPQ cognitive, somatic, and emotional subscales, we used univariable linear regression models with the candidate predictor of interest as independent variable and the RPQ subscale as dependent variable. To assess the adjusted effect of candidate predictors, we used multivariable linear regression models with all candidate predictors as independent variables. Unstandardized \u00df's and\np\nvalues were reported. The \u00df coefficient indicates the change in outcome (points on the RPQ scale or subscale) for one unit change in the predictor variable. To enhance comparability of effect estimates for the different subscales, we additionally calculated standardized \u00df coefficients. A standardized \u00df indicates the change in outcome in standard deviations (SDs) for one SD change in the predictor variable.\nTo assess whether the predictor effects differed across cognitive, somatic, and emotional subscales, we tested for interaction between the predictors (summarized in the predicted values of the RPQ total scale) and the subscales. We created three rows per patient in the database: one with the cognitive outcome, one with the somatic outcome, and one with the emotional outcome. We subsequently fitted a random effects model with a random intercept for patient number, the predicted value of the total RPQ scale based on the full multivariable model, \u201coutcome type\u201d and an interaction between \u201coutcome type\u201d and predicted value.\nWe developed the final model by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) method. This method shrinks the \u00df coefficients in order to obtain less extreme \u00dfs to enhance the external validity of a prediction model.\n35\nVariables with \u00dfs that are unstable are shrunk to zero and omitted from the model. It should be noted that Lasso shrinkage focuses on the overall fit rather than statistical significance of individual predictors. As a consequence, predictors with a\np\nvalue >0.05 could still be included in the final model. External validity of the final model was further enhanced by performing bootstrap validation with 100 samples.\nThe interaction test, Lasso shrinkage, and bootstrap validation were analyzed with R (version 3.2.2.) using the lme4,\n36\npenalized,\n37\nand foreign\n38\npackages. All other analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21. A\np\nvalue <0.05 was considered statistically significant in all analyses.\n\nSensitivity analyses\nAlthough a prediction model with a linear outcome is statistically more appealing, models with a binary outcome variable are often preferred for clinical interpretation. We therefore performed multivariable logistic regression analysis with the variables obtained after Lasso shrinkage as independent variables and the dichotomized RPQ scale as dependent variable. For the dichotomization of the RPQ, we utilized the eight symptoms mentioned in the ICD-10 criteria. Subjects were subsequently diagnosed with PCS if they meet three or more of the following symptoms: 1) headache, 2) dizziness, 3) fatigue, 4) irritability, 5) insomnia, 6) memory problems, 7) concentration issues, and 8) frustration or depression (in ICD-10 explained as reduced tolerance to stress, emotional excitement, or alcohol). It should be recognized that the RPQ cannot be used to truly diagnose ICD-10 PCS since the RPQ is based on self-report rather than clinical examination and does not include information on symptom duration and clinical significant impairment. In addition, there is no consensus as to whether symptoms should be included if they are rated as \u201cmild symptom or worse\u201d or if they are rated as \u201cmoderate symptom or worse.\u201d\n39\nWe therefore applied both classifications.\nWe further examined the influence of attrition on estimates of the predictors by simulating three scenarios:\n1.\u2002The patients lost to follow-up have relatively favorable outcomes in comparison to those included in current study.\n2.\u2002The patients lost to follow-up have similar outcomes to those included in current study.\n3.\u2002The patients lost to follow-up have relatively unfavorable outcomes in comparison to those included in current study.\nFor the first scenario, we simulated the outcome of those lost to follow-up by generating random numbers with the range 0\u201348 (possible scores on RPQ), a mean of 0.00 (25th percentile of those included), and a SD of 10.0 (actual SD of those included). For the second scenario, we simulated outcome of those lost to follow-up with the range 0\u201348, a mean of 5.0 (median of those included), and a SD of 10.0 (actual SD of those included). For the third scenario, we simulated outcome with the range 0\u201348, a mean of 15 (75th percentile of those included), and a SD of 10.0 (actual SD of those included). For simplicity, we did not predetermine the associations between predictors and attrition, while acknowledging that this may play a role in the influence of attrition on effect estimates."

    "Methods": "Eight young adult female Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were used in this experiment. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Louisville. After a week of acclimatization and baseline data collection, the animals received moderate spinal cord contusion injuries (NYU, 12.5\u2009g/cm) at T10 as described previously.22Locomotor function was assessed at least weekly using the Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) Open Field Locomotor Scale,23and video-based kinematic and gait analysis was performed biweekly. As described previously,7we used a three segment, two angle model of the hindlimb, and \u201cjoint\u201d excursions were measured as the hip\u2013ankle\u2013toe (HAT) and iliac crest\u2013hip\u2013ankle (IHA) angles. Two gait indices were also used, the regularity index (RI) and the plantar stepping index (PSI), based on ventral-view video allowing paw placement order, timing, and location to be determined for every step taken (from initial contact to lift-off) using MaxTraq software (Innovision Systems Inc., Columbiaville, MI) and custom-designed Excel macros. The RI is calculated as the number of correctly patterned plantar steps over the total number of steps (dorsal and plantar).24The PSI is calculated as the number of plantar hindlimb steps over the total number of forelimb step.25\n\nAt 6 weeks post-injury, the animals entered a 4 week dynamic stretch protocol that was performed 5 days a week for 4 weeks. Dynamic stretching consisted of the same six bilateral stretches of major hindlimb muscle groups as our previous static stretching protocol;6,7however, instead of holding the limb at the end ROM of each stretch for 1\u2009min, each stretch was held for only 2\u2009sec, followed by a 1\u2009sec release, repeated 20 times over a 1\u2009min period. A metronome (at 1\u2009Hz) was set to the 2-1 ratio, using different tones, in order to give an audible clue to the rat physical therapists (PT) allowing them to maintain the rhythm and ensuring that timing was consistent and accurate between therapists for each animal every day. During the 4 weeks of stretching, BBB scores were assessed three times weekly (Monday a.m., Monday p.m., and Friday p.m.).\n\nTonic stretching triggered several observable responses in both the stretched and unstretched limbs that rat PTs took note of.6Dynamic stretching resulted in a new and highly consistent response that was observed as paw \u201cvibrations\u201d: high frequency and low amplitude fluctuations in one or two joints. Because of its resemblance to human clonus, which can be triggered by sudden stretching or upon the release of stretch,26,27we sought to better understand this phenomenon. To quantify this response, single stretching sessions for four animals were recorded (digital video at 100\u2009Hz frame rate with the same PT stretching all animals). Most often vibrations occurred in both limbs simultaneously; however, kinematic analysis was performed on the contralateral limb, as more joint markers were easily viewable and could be tracked with the software for analysis. The toe, ankle, knee, hip, and iliac crest were marked with a black marker for kinematic analysis of the movement using MaxTraq software. Three vibration responses per stretch per animal were analyzed for ROM (excursion of movement) and frequency (peaks per second). Averages of these outcome measures from the four animals for each stretch are reported in the Results.\n\nAfter the last week of stretching (week 4), four of the eight animals were euthanized 2\u2009h after the last stretching session, and the other four animals were maintained for an additional 5 weeks. The spinal cords and major hindlimb muscles (tibialis anterior [TA], medial gastrocnemius [MG] and biceps femoris [BF]) were dissected out, post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose. Muscles (mid-belly) were sectioned at 10\u2009\u03bcm and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin. Muscle fibers (MF) were analyzed for the presence of centralized nuclei, a marker of regeneration.28Spinal cords were sectioned at 50\u2009\u03bcm and stained with eriochrome cyanine to determine the percentage of white matter sparing at the injury epicenter using ImageJ software as described previously.22"

    "Methods": "Animal preparation\nFemale 2- to 3-month-old Yorkshire swine (\nN\n=\u200912) with an average weight of 24.3\u2009kg were utilized in this study. The animals were housed indoors and were fed standard pig chow and water\nad libitum.\nThe animals were housed in a facility that was accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. The protocol was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania and all animals received care in strict compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (U.S. National Research Council, 1996).\nClosed-head rotation induced diffuse brain injury using the HYGE pneumatic actuator\nAnimals were fasted for 18\u201320\u2009h prior to the injury procedure, with water allowed\nad libitum.\nAfter pre-medication with midazolam (4.0\u20136.0\u2009mg/kg), anesthesia was induced with 5% isoflurane by snout mask, followed by intubation and isoflurane at maintenance levels (1.5\u20132.0%). Closed-head rotational acceleration-deceleration\u2013induced TBI was administered using the HYGE pneumatic actuator, a model capable of producing pure impulsive non-impact head rotation in different planes (\nFig. 1\n) at controlled rotational acceleration levels (thus controlling severity).\n17\u201319\nBriefly, under anesthesia, the animals' heads were secured to a padded snout clamp, which, in turn, was mounted to the HYGE device using a custom linkage assembly that converts the linear motion of the actuator to an angular (rotational) motion. Rapid head rotation was performed in the coronal plane at peak angular velocities of 131\u2013195 radians/sec (\nn\n=\u20097).

The live posterior quadrant was immediately dissected on a cold block, and the hippocampus was removed and blocked transversely to the long axis. Approximately 1cm of the dorsal hippocampus was then transferred to sucrose cutting solution (see\nMethods\n) and then 350\u2009\u03bcM sections were cut on a vibratome. These sections were transferred to an interface chamber\n(C)\n, where stimulation (red circles) and recordings (black arrows)\n(D)\nwere performed in the Schaffer collaterals (CA1) and the medial and lateral perforant path (dentate). A typical trace from CA1\n(E)\nhad a prominent fiber volley (FV) (arrow) immediately following the stimulation (artifact removed, *) followed by an excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP). (D) Modified from\nhttp://anatomie.vetmed.uni-leipzig.de/external/hippocampus/hippocampus_schema_gross.jpg\n\nTemporal lobectomy and hippocampal dissection\nAt 7 days post-TBI (or sham procedures), animals were induced with midazolam (2.5\u20133.0\u2009mg/kg) combined with ketamine (6.0\u20138.0\u2009mg/kg), intubated, and maintained on isoflurane as above (1.5\u20132.0%). Animals were then transferred to a surgical suite where a craniotomy was performed to expose the entire surface of the cerebral cortex, and the dura was resected. The heart was accessed and a transcardial perfusion was performed initially using a sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; 3\u2009mM KCl, 2.5\u2009mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 26\u2009mM NaHCO\n3\n, 10\u2009mM glucose, 1\u2009mM MgCl\n2\n, 2\u2009mM CaCl\n2\n, with sucrose replacing Na+ to match CSF osmolarity) chilled to 4\u00b0C. The left posterior quadrant of the brain was extracted using a scalpel (\nFig. 1\n), and the remainder of the brain was then immediately transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde fixation for histopathological analysis of the contralateral hemisphere. The live extracted tissue (prior to paraformaldehyde administration) was dissected on a cold block to isolate the hippocampal formation.\n\nHippocampal slice acquisition and field potential recordings\nSham animals (\nn\n=\u20092) and injured animals (\nn\n=\u20091) were utilized in an initial study to develop the extraction and pathway stimulation and recording paradigms. Recordings in response to all stimulation paradigms in the study were obtained following sham conditions (\nn\n=\u20093 animals) and following coronal plane rotation (\nn\n=\u20095 animals) with\nn\n=\u20094\u20138 hippocampal slices assessed per animal. One animal rotated in the coronal plane was utilized for histopathology only (\nn\n=\u20091). For hippocampal slice electrophysiology, the extracted hippocampus was blocked to a 1-cm section transverse to the long axis, affixed to a vibratome stage (Leica, VT1200S), and cut to a thickness of 350\u2009\u03bcm in ice-cold (2\u00b0C) oxygenated aCSF (5% CO\n2\n, 95% O\n2\n) with sucrose replacing NaCl to equal osmolarity (see above). Slices were then incubated in oxygenated aCSF (130\u2009mM NaCl, 3\u2009mM KCl, 1.25\u2009mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 26\u2009mM NaHCO\n3\n, 10\u2009mM glucose, 1\u2009mM MgCl\n2\n, 2\u2009mM CaCl\n2\n) at 35\u00b0C for 1\u2009h.\nRecordings were performed at room temperature on an interface chamber using glass electrodes (3\u20134\u2009MOhm) filled with aCSF and an AxoPatch 1D amplifier in current clamp mode (Molecular Devices, CA). Slices were continuously perfused with oxygenated aCSF. Traces were digitized and analyzed using the PClamp 10.0 software package (Molecular Devices, CA). Recordings were performed in area CA1 while stimulating the Schaffer collaterals, and in the dentate while stimulating either the medial or lateral perforant path of the dorsal blade of the dentate gyrus. Care was taken to utilize the same distances between stimulating and recording electrodes (\u223c2\u2009mm), as well as between the medial and lateral perforant path.\nPreliminary experiments revealed a waveform similar to previously reported rodent results in area CA1 that had a prominent fiber volley (FV) and field EPSP (\nFig. 1\n). To confirm the waveform constituents, the EPSP was blocked with glutamatergic antagonists (APV, 50\u2009\u03bcM, CNQX, 6\u2009\u03bcM), after which the FV was completely blocked by the application of tetrodotoxin (TTX) (0.4\u2009\u03bcM; data not shown), leaving only the stimulation artifact (removed for clarity in all presented traces). Input\u2013output (I/O) curves were generated and paired-pulse paradigms were utilized to examine changes in excitability and neurotransmitter release probabilities in slices from injured versus sham animals. Stimulation was applied with a concentric bipolar stimulating electrode in the range of 50\u2013500\u2009\u03bcA. The stimulation current eliciting half of the maximal I/O response was determined, and two pulses at this current level were then given 50ms apart for the paired-pulse paradigm. This paired-pulse paradigm was repeated 10 times with a 10\u2009sec interval between trials. To calculate paired-pulse facilitation or depression, the linear portion of the second EPSP slope (approximately 75% of the deflection) was compared to the first EPSP slope, utilizing the same time window relevant to the stimulus artifact for both pulses. FV slopes were calculated using the linear portion of the initial negative deflection that was sensitive to TTX in initial experiments. I/O curves were initially generated using standard methodology with stimulation current as the input, but also were calculated using the measured FV slope as the input compared with the EPSP \u201coutput.\u201d These procedures were used for CA1 inputs from the Schaffer collaterals and for the dentate gyrus inputs from the perforant path, at both the medial and lateral portion of the dorsal blade of the gyrus.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe experimental design for these studies was a variation on a split-plot design, and therefore data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with two fixed factors, using the principles outlined in Morris.\n20\nAn interaction term was included between the two factors in each ANOVA. A variation on this approach that included FV slope as a continuous variable was used for the analysis of the EPSP data.\nAll statistical models considered animals to be independent experimental units. Animal was modeled as a random effect; thus, we consider the animals in our study to represent a random sample of the population of animals under consideration. Within each animal, replicate slices were collected. These slices were assumed to be correlated within animals; they were not assumed to be independent units of analysis. Thus, two separate covariance terms were included in the statistical model: one for the repeated measurements on the same slice within animal, and one for repeated measurements on different slices within animals. Operationally, we carried this out by including a separate random term, nested within animal in our statistical model. An example of the implementation of this model is included in the\nsupplementary Figure S1\n. Recording time post-extraction was not examined as a factor in this analysis.\nThe general hypothesis-testing strategy involved first applying ANOVA to test for the main effect of injury and the interaction between injury and either current or region; if this indicated statistical significance, individual effects were examined using Wald tests and estimates presented with 95% confidence intervals. The outcome data were log transformed to achieve approximate normality (with estimates exponentiated to return to the original scale).\nFour separate statistical analyses were performed. First, for the paired pulse experiments, the factors in the ANOVA included injury group (injury present or absent) and brain region (CA1, medial perforant path [mPP], lateral perforant path [lPP]), and their interaction. The ratio of the slope of the EPSP for pulse 2 and pulse 1 was used as the outcome (results of this analysis shown in\nFig. 3\n). Second, in order to assess mean differences in FV between injured and sham animals, the factors in the ANOVA were injury group and current (10 levels applied to each brain slice within each animal), and their interaction (\nFig. 4\n). Third, we considered differences in mean EPSP as a function of injury group and current, using an analysis that followed the same protocol as described above where we considered differences in mean FV slope (\nFig. 5A\n). The relationship between current and FV slope was visualized by determining the following: 1) the mean FV slope across slices (4 to 8 per animal) for each animal and 2) the mean of the mean FV slope determined across animals. This was done at each current level. Lastly, we considered whether mean EPSP differed as a function of FV slope between sham and injured animals. We plotted these data in two ways. To present the data in a previously described manner, we first plotted the data using the mean EPSP as a function of the mean FV slope at each current level (\nFig. 5B\n). We then used a mixed effects model to ask whether mean EPSP differed as a function of injury group and FV slope. Thus, the fixed effects factors in this statistical model were injury group, FV slope, and their interaction. The model also included current since mean EPSP was shown to increase with current for the ranges examined.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nChanges in paired pulse facilitation and depression post-TBI.\n(A)\nPaired pulse facilitation (PPF) as demonstrated in area CA1, where an increased slope (S2) was evident in the second pulse (50\u2009msec interpulse interval). An analysis of variance including injury group and an interaction with brain region yielded evidence of a significant main effect of injury [F(1,6)\u2009=\u200911.5,\np\n=\u20090.015], as well as evidence of differences in the effect of injury in the three different brain regions [F(2,98)\u2009=\u20093.29,\np\n=\u20090.042].\n(B)\nCompared with sham, recordings in area CA1 suggested PPF was reduced by a factor of 0.79 (95% CI 0.69, 0.91;\np\n=\u20090.006] following mild head rotation.\n(C)\nResponses to stimulation in the dentate (medial perforant path [mPP]) suggested injured animals showed a reduction of 0.91-fold (95% CI 0.80, 1.05) relative to sham animals (\np\n=\u20090.18).\n(D)\nSimilar PPF occurred in sham recordings in the lateral perforant path (lPP), with a reduction of 0.90-fold (95% CI 0.78, 1.03) in injured versus sham animals (\np\n=\u20090.097). Note that these results for mPP and lPP did not achieve statistical significance. To visualize both between animal variation as well as within-animal variation arising from the multiple slices, the data are presented as boxplots for each individual animal; the horizontal line is the median, the box is the interquartile range (IQR) and each vertical line is the box \u00b11.5 IQR truncated at the minimum and maximum values for each animal. Outliers are shown as individual points.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 4.\nDecrease in fiber volleys in CA1 at 7 days following mTBI. On average fiber volley slope in area CA1 was a factor of 0.52-fold (95% CI 0.47, 0.93) lower post-injury than sham (F(1,6) 0\u2009=\u20098.3,\np\n<\u20090.028), with no evidence of an injury interaction with current [F(9, 421)\u2009=\u20090.78,\np\n=\u20090.63]. In region medial perforant path (mPP), the mean fiber volley slope of injured animals was a factor of 0.90-fold (95% CI 0.66, 1.313), compared with sham, [F(1,6)\u2009=\u20090.27,\np\n=\u20090.62, NS for the main effect and F(9, 432)\u2009=\u20090.38,\np\n=\u20090.95, NS for the interaction]. In region lPP fiber volley slope was a factor of 0.66-fold (95% CI 0.58, 1.19) lower post-injury than sham [F(1,6)\u2009=\u20094.67,\np\n=\u20090.25 and F(9, 432)\u2009=\u20091.72,\np\n=\u20090.083 for the interaction] but also not significant. Data shown are empirical means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM) where the SEM is based on the number of animals per group.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 5.\nPost-TBI output (EPSP) levels as a function of input (FV slope).\n(A)\nInput/output curves were generated via stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals and medial and lateral perforant path in the dentate region. The injured group trended towards higher mean EPSP levels in CA1 and medial perforant path, and lower levels in lateral perforant path, but these were not significant at individual current levels. (B) The empirical mean EPSP is plotted as a function of mean FV slope for each level of current. In the CA1 region we found strong evidence of an interaction between injury and FV slope [F(2, 428)\u2009=\u20096.95,\np\n=\u20090.001], indicating the presence of an injury effect that differed as a function of FV slope. These results suggest that for a given input (FV) in area CA1, there is a greater output (EPSP) post injury. The results for this interaction for medial perforant path (mPP) did not achieve statistical significance [F(2, 437)\u2009=\u20092.28,\np\n=\u20090.10] and there was no evidence of an effect of injury by FV slope interaction in the lateral perforant path (lPP) [F(2,447)\u2009=\u20090.35,\np\n=\u20090.70, NS]. There was also no evidence of an overall effect of injury in the lPP [F(1,6)\u2009=\u20090.023,\np\n=\u20090.89\u2009NS]. Data presented as animal mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean.\nFV slope was modeled statistically using a cubic spline; this is a simple approach to allowing a curvilinear model without specifying a particular parametric form. Of particular interest was the interaction between injury group and FV slope; presence of a significant interaction would suggest that the effect of injury was dependent on the magnitude of the FV slope. This model is similar to the analysis we used to test the effect of current on FV slope. Here, instead of a current by injury interaction, we anticipated a FV slope by injury interaction. The second plot (\nsupplementary Fig. S1\n) was used to simply visualize the results of this model. As such, we plotted the estimated mean EPSP as a function of FV slope for each current and each injury group. We did this for each brain region. For simplicity, we plot only the mean function; these results should be considered hypothesis generating and are intended to supplement our main finding which were based on more traditional analytic approaches (\nFig. 5B\n). For all I/O and FV curves, the standard error of the mean (SEM) was calculated based on the variation in the means for each animal (\nn\n=\u20093 sham or\nn\n=\u20095 injured). We used two-sided tests and a Type I error rate of 0.05. Analyses were carried out in R Studio Version 0.99.467 using R (R Core Team 2016) version 3.3.0 and the nlme package.\n21\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nBrain hemispheres (contralateral to the live-tissue excision) were blocked into coronal sections at 0.5\u2009cm intervals for gross examination and photography. All tissue samples were processed in paraffin using standardized protocols. Paraffin blocks containing the temporal lobe, including the hippocampal formation, were sectioned at 8\u2009\u03bcm and mounted on glass slides. Immunohistochemistry was performed using techniques as previously described.\n22\nBriefly, following deparaffinization and rehydration, sections were immersed in aqueous hydrogen peroxide (10\u2009min) to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. Antigen retrieval was performed in a microwave pressure cooker containing TRIS EDTA buffer and subsequent blocking achieved using 50\u2009\u03bcL of normal horse serum (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) per 5\u2009mL of Optimax buffer (BioGenex, San Ramon, CA) for 30\u2009min. Incubation with the primary antibody was performed for 20\u2009h at 4\u00b0C. Specifically, monoclonal antibodies specific for the heavy subunit of neurofilament (NF-200; N-0142; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) and the N-terminal amino acids 66\u201381 of the amyloid precursor protein (APP; 22C11, Millipore, Billerica, MA) were applied at a concentration of 1:2\u2009K and 1:50\u2009K, respectively, to permit detection of axons and axonal pathology.\n23\u201326\nA biotinylated universal secondary antibody was then applied for 1\u2009h (Vectastain Universal Elite kit; Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) followed by an avidin biotin complex as per the manufacturer's instructions (Vectastain Universal Elite kit).\nFinally, visualization was achieved using the DAB peroxidase substrate kit (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). Counterstaining with hematoxylin was performed and sections were examined using light microscopy on a Nikon E600 eclipse and images acquired via a Nikon RI1 camera. Positive control tissue included identically prepared tissue from swine exposed to higher level coronal rotational acceleration (280 radians/sec) using the same model, with previously confirmed axonal pathology. Omission of the primary antibody was performed on the same material to control for non-specific binding. In all animals, the presence, morphology, and distribution of axonal pathology was assessed in the temporal lobe including regions relative to electrophysiological findings, specifically the stratum moleculare layer of the dentate gyrus and the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Observations were conducted blind to the injury status by two independent observers (V.E.J. and J.A.W.)."

    "Methods": "Experimental animals\nTwelve-week-old C57BL/6 male mice purchased from Charles River were housed in the animal facility of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism) with a 12\u2009h/12\u2009h light/dark cycle (6:30 to 6:30 h) with free access to standard food and water for a week before the experiments. All experiments were designed to minimize the number of animals used and were approved by the National Institutes of Health (NIH)/NIAAA Animal Care and Use Committee (Animal Study Protocol LMS-HK-13) and conducted in accordance with the NIH Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\nrCHIMERA injury model\nThe mice were randomly divided into two groups, rCHIMERA and sham, before the procedure was begun. The mice were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane for 2\u2009min in oxygen (1\u2009L/min), and mounted supine on a holding platform of CHIMERA apparatus angled \u223c32 degrees so that the top of mouse head lay flat over a hole in the head plate. Two lines across the piston hole were used to align the mouse head, to limit the impact on the dorsal cortical region covering a 5\u2009mm area surrounding bregma. The impact kinetic energy and velocity of the piston was controlled by the impactor system, which includes an air tank, pressure regulator, digital pressure gauge, two-way solenoid valve, and trigger button. Input kinetic energy (Ek) was calculated using the formula: Ek\u2009=\u2009\u00bd\u2009mv\n2\n(v: velocity (m/sec), m: mass of piston). In this study, a 0.6J kinetic energy was delivered to mouse head by a 50\ng\npiston. The nose cone delivering isoflurane anesthesia was removed, and isoflurane was discontinued when the impact occurred. The injured mice received three impacts 24\u2009h apart. Sham mice were given all procedures except for the impact. After each impact, mice were monitored for the loss of righting reflex (LRR), which is the time interval from the anesthesia state to the first sign of righting reflex, and continuously observed until full recovery. No skull fracture, hematomas, apnea, or death was observed in any injured mice.\nThe investigators who performed histological or behavioral tests as well as data analyses in this study were not aware of the study group assignments, which were revealed only after all analyses were completed.\n\nAssessment of behavioral changes\nThe beam walk test was performed at 1, 3, and 5 days after injury. A 7\u2009mm wide and 50\u2009cm long beam was elevated at an angle of \u223c55 degrees. Mice were individually placed on the lower end of the beam, and the time taken to walk uphill to the end of the beam was recorded and averaged for two trials per mouse. The Morris water maze (MWM) test was conducted at 1 and 6 months after rCHIMERA and sham procedures. A 120\u2009cm diameter tank was placed in a room that had objects located along the walls to serve as distinct visual cues. The tank was filled with water (22\u201324\u00b0C) rendered opaque using nontoxic white paint, and a 10\u2009cm\n2\nplatform was submerged 0.5\u2009cm under water midway between the center and the edge of the tank. The acquisition trials consisted of four 90\u2009sec trials daily for 4 days. The tank was divided into four virtual quadrants such that the platform was centered in one quadrant and the time taken by the mice to find the submerged platform was recorded. In case the mouse failed to locate the platform after 90\u2009sec it was gently guided to the platform and allowed to remain on the platform for 10\u2009sec. A single 60\u2009sec long probe trial was performed 24\u2009h after the last acquisition trial, to assess spatial memory. The platform was removed for this trial, and the time spent by the mice in the quadrant where the platform had been located was recorded.\n\nImmunohistochemical analysis\nA subset of rCHIMERA injured mice was anesthetized with isoflurane and transcardially perfused by 0.1M phosphate buffer (PB) (pH 7.4) and fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M PB solution at different time points after injury. Their brains were carefully removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution overnight, and transferred into 30% sucrose solution until sinking to the bottom of tube at 4\u00b0C, then embedded with O.C.T. compound medium (VWR, Tissue-Tek, 4583, PA, USA) and frozen on dry ice and stored at \u221280\u00b0C freezer until used. Coronal sections (30\u2009\u03bcm) were sliced by Leica Cryostat (Leica Biosystems Inc. IL, USA) and stored in cryoprotectant solution at \u221220\u00b0C. Sections from approximately the same position (\u22121.68\u2009mm bregma) from each mouse brain were selected for immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence staining for all biomarkers. Standard Avidin-Biotin Complex (ABC) method was performed on free-floating sections for IHC staining. Briefly, sections were washed through with 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 0.1% Triton-100 (3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009min) before quenching of endogenous peroxidase using 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 20\u2009min at room temperature (RT), then blocking with 5% of goat serum at RT for 1\u2009h and probing with the primary antibodies: Iba-1 (Wako, 019-19741, Richmond, VA), GFAP (Sigma Aldrich, cat# G9269, Saint Louis, MO, USA) and APP antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific: 36-6900) at 4\u00b0C overnight. The sections were washed again and incubated with biotin-SP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch labs, INC, Code# 111-065-003, PA, USA) for 1\u2009h at RT. ABC was prepared at least 30\u2009min before applying onto sections for 30\u2009min at RT from VECTASTAIN Elite ABC Kit (Vector laboratories, Inc; cat# PK-6100, CA, USA). After rinsing, sections were incubated in 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate solution (Vector laboratories, Inc; cat# SK-4100) until desired stain intensity, then washed and air dried overnight. Before sections were mounted on the slides and covered with Permount media (Fisher Scientific; cat# SP15-100, MA USA), they were dehydrated in 70\u2013100% ethanol and cleared in xylene solutions. The procedure of immunofluorescence staining was similar to IHC staining except that the sections were incubated with Iba-1, GFAP, and APP antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight and Alexa fluor-488-conjugated F (ab\u2019)2 fragment goat ant-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch labs, Inc.: 111-546-003) at RT for 1\u2009h. After washing, sections were mounted on the slides and covered with mounting medium containing DAPI (Vector laboratories, Inc: H-1500). Photomicrographs from IHC staining were digitally scanned with Nanozoomer (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Iwata-City, Japan). Immunofluorescence images were captured by an Olympus 1X81 microscope for Iba-1 and GFAP proteins in the optic tract (OT), corpus callosum (CC), hippocampus (HP), cortex (CX), and APP in CC. The GFAP protein expression in the regions of interest (ROIs) was quantified by measuring the fluorescence intensity per \u03bcm\n2\nafter subtracting the background intensity, and so was the APP protein in CC. The number of Iba-1 positive cells in the ROI was manually counted and presented per mm\n2\nusing Metamorph software (Molecular Devices Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA).\n\nRelative expression of GFAP and Iba-1 by Western blotting\nTotal proteins were extracted from the CX and HP from both rCHIMERA and sham mouse perfused brains at 1 month after injury. The protein concentration was measured by BCA kit (life technologies; product# 1856136, CA, USA). The same amount of protein from each sample was separated on 4\u201312% Bis-Tris gels (Life technologies: NW04120BOX) under denaturing and reduced conditions, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with the following primary antibodies: GFAP (1:5000, Thermo Scientific: cat# MS-1376-P), Iba-1 (1:1000, Wako, 019-19741), phospho-tau (Ser202) (1: 1,000, Cell Signaling Technology, product# 11834, MA, USA) and GAPDH (1:5000, Cell Signaling Technology, product#: 5174S, MA, USA), and with peroxidase-conjugated F(ab\u2019)\n2\nfragment goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (H+L) as a secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch lab, Inc., code number: 111-036-003). The proteins were detected by Pierce supersignal west pico chemiluminescent detection substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). All images of immunoblots were taken and quantified using KODAK 1D software (Eastman Kodak, NY, USA).\n\nMeasurement of gene levels of GFAP, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and APP by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)\nrCHIMERA and sham mice were perfused by 0.1M PB and euthanized at 1, 3, and 7 days post-injury. Their CX and HP were dissected and quickly frozen on dry ice and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Total RNA from each brain region was extracted by Trizol Reagent (Life technologies, cat# 15596-026) following the manufacturer's protocol, and 2\u2009\u03bcg of total RNA was reverse transcribed to 20\u2009\u03bcL cDNA using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystem, cat# 4368814, CA, USA). Two pairs of primers for each target gene crossing exon junction were picked by Primer3 Plus software and synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Iowa, USA); 10\u2009\u03bcL of PCR mixture including 1xSYBR Green Master mixture (QIAGEN: cat# 204143, CA, USA). 0.5\u2009\u03bcM of sense primer and reverse primer, and 1\u2009\u03bcL of cDNA temple was loaded into each well of 384 well PCR plate (Applied Biosystem: cat# 4309849) and run on an ABI 7900 HT machine. The PCR program was: initial denaturation: 50\u00b0C for 2\u2009min, 95\u00b0C for 15\u2009min; then 40 cycles: 95\u00b0C for 20\u2009sec, 55\u00b0C for 20\u2009sec, and 72\u00b0C for 20\u2009sec. As an internal control, 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) was used. Data were analyzed using the comparative C\nT\nmethod. The interesting gene relative mRNA to housekeeping gene 18S rRNA were calculated as 2\n-\u0394\u0394Ct\nvalue.

    "Methods": "Study design and animals\nAll animal procedures followed guidelines established by the National Institute of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, Animal Research: Reporting of\nIn Vivo\nExperiments (ARRIVE), and were approved by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) and University of Miami's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Animals were randomized to experimental groups. Surgical procedures were performed under aseptic conditions. To identify which rodent strain best supported xenotransplantation, Fisher 344 and Sprague\u2013Dawley (SD) with unilateral PBBI were produced. SD and Fisher 344 animals served as test strains to establish efficacy of a chemical immunosuppression regimen. The ATN SD \u201cnude\u201d rats served as positive control, as they lack T-cell-mediated immunity (see\nTable 1\nfor animal use). All animals were acquired from Envigo (Indianapolis, IN) at 2\u20133 months of age, and were operated on at an initial weight of \u2265280\u2009g. Following establishment of the transplant paradigm, behavioral assessments were evaluated in a separate study with immunosuppressed SD rats. The sample size calculations are described in the subsequent behavior testing section. Digitizing behavioral data from recorded video tapes, green fluorescent protein (GFP) cell number quantitation in histological sections using unbiased stereology was performed by investigators blinded to the study design and experimental groups. They were also not involved in surgeries, behavior testing, or planning of the experiments.\nTable\n1.\nExperimental Groups, Sample Size, and Figures\nExp no.\nMeasurement\nExperimental group\nn\n/group\nResults\n1\nEngraftment\nWeek 1 post-transplantation\nAthymic SD PBBI+hNSC\n1\nWeek 1 post-transplantation\nSD PBBI+hNSC\n2\nFig. 2\nWeek 2 post-transplantation\nAthymic SD PBBI+hNSC\n1\nWeek 2 post-transplantation\nSD PBBI+hNSC\n2\nFig. 3\nWeek 5 post-transplantation\nAthymic SD PBBI+hNSC\n1\nWeek 5 post-transplantation\nSD PBBI+hNSC\n2\nFig. 1\nWeek 8 post-transplantation\nAthymic SD PBBI+hNSC\n7\nWeek 8 post-transplantation\nFisher PBBI+hNSC\n6\nWeek 8 post-transplantation\nSD PBBI+hNSC\n10\nFigs. 1\u20133\n2\nMorris Water Maze\nSD-Sham\n11\nFig. 7A and B\nSD-PBBI-Vehicle\n9\nSD-PBBI+hNSC\n9\na\nWeek 8 post-transplantation\nSD-PBBI+hNSC\n6/9\na\nFigs. 4\nand\n\u200b\nand6\n6\nWeek 16 post-transplantation\nSD-PBBI+hNSC\n3/9\na\nFigs. 1\n,\n\u200b\n,3\n3\n,\n4\u20136\nOpen in a separate window\na\nThree animals from this group were allowed to survive for 16 weeks post-transplantation histology.\nThe first column lists the major experiment. The subsequent columns lists outcome measured, experimental groups, and number of rats per group, and in which figures the results are presented.\nPBBI, penetrating ballistic-like brain injury; hNSC, human neural stem cell.\n\nAnesthesia\nAnesthesia was induced with isoflurane (2\u20135%) delivered in a mixture of 70% nitrogen and 30% oxygen. Body temperature was maintained at normothermia (37\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C) throughout all surgical procedures by means of a homeothermic heating system (Harvard Apparatus, South Natick, MA).\n\nPBBI\nThe PBBI apparatus consists of a penetrating probe (Kadence Science, Lake Success, NY), a stereotaxic frame (Kopf, Tujunga, CA) equipped with a probe holder, and a hydraulic pressure-pulse generator (4B080; MITRE, MA). The penetrating probe is made of a 20G stainless steel tube with fixed perforations along one end that are sealed by a piece of airtight elastic tubing. The anesthetized rat was secured in a stereotaxic frame, and an incision was made along the midline to expose the dorsal surface of the skull. A cranial window was made at +4.5\u2009mm anterior-posterior (AP) and +2mm medial-lateral (ML) from bregma on the right frontal pole. The multi-port balloon-tipped probe was inserted through the burr hole 12\u2009mm into the brain at an angle 25 degrees lateral from midline and 50 degrees deep from the surface. The balloon was then rapidly expanded with water to 6.33\u2009mm diameter for 40\u2009ms by activating the HPD-1700 generator to induce a unilateral PBBI at 10% brain volume. This level of expansion produced a severe but survivable (< 10% mortality) temporary cavity mimicking a ballistic shockwave. The probe was retracted from the rat, the wound was closed with 9\u2009mm wound clips, and the incision site was treated with topical antibiotic.\n77\n\nCell transplantation\nTransplants were performed 7\u201310 days following injury. This time point was selected based on the expected abatement of the initial injury-induced inflammatory response and the scheduled immunosuppression regimen, and to avoid freezing or prolonged storage of cells. The anesthetized rat was secured in a stereotaxic frame, and the scalp was reopened along the midline to expose the skull surface. A Hamilton 8000 Gastight 10\u2009\u03bcL micro syringe was backfilled and flushed with suspension media and then attached to a World Precision Instruments UMP3 micro syringe injector and micro4 controller. The syringe was filled with NSI-566 cells in suspension media (concentration of 100,000 cells/\u03bcL).\n47\nA burr hole was made at \u22122.5\u2009mm AP and +3\u2009mm ML from bregma, ipsilateral to the injury. The micro syringe was lined up at \u22122.5\u2009mm AP and +3\u2009mm ML from bregma and advanced vertically 6\u2009mm deep into the brain. Using the micro pump preset, 2\u2009\u03bcL were injected at a rate of 1\u2009\u03bcL/min. The needle was then retracted to 4\u2009mm depth from the brain surface, and another 2\u2009\u03bcL were injected. The transplant locations were within the perilesional zone (PLZ) of the injury, adjacent to the primary injury cavity. This PLZ was previously determined by autoradiographically mapping regional metabolic disruption and secondary cell death in this region following injury.\n78\n\nImmune suppression\nTacrolimus was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 3\u2009mg/kg beginning 2 days prior to transplantation and continued daily for 2 weeks, then switched to 1\u2009mg/kg/day for the rest of the survival period. Methylprednisolone was injected i.p. weekly beginning on the day of transplant at 10\u2009mg/kg, continuing thereafter at 1\u2009mg/kg throughout the course of survival. Mycophenolate mofetil in 5% dextrose was injected i.p. 30\u2009mg/kg daily, only for the 1st week following transplantation.\n71\n,\n79\n,\n80\nThe animals were maintained on a 12\u2009h/12\u2009h light/dark cycle and given food\nad libitum.\nThey were provided an enhanced recovery diet following surgical procedures until baseline weight was re-established. Immune-deficient animals were handled under a laminar airflow hood, in a dedicated closed vivarium room, with sterile gloves for all long-term care procedures.\n\nBehavior testing with the Morris water maze (MWM) test\nSample size calculations for behavioral outcome in this model were computed\na priori with\nsoftware \u201cG*Power 3.1\u201d with type I error \u03b1 set at 0.05 with power (1-type II error \u03b2) 0.8 and estimated effect size (Cohen's\nd\n)\nd\n=\u20090.66.\n77\nLearning and memory were assessed at 8 weeks following transplant using the MWM with video tracking system. A platform was placed in a pool (75\u2009cm deep; 175\u2009cm diameter filled to a depth of 60\u2009cm with water maintained at temperature of 22\u00b0C) just under the water level at a fixed location 35\u2009cm from the wall of the pool in the northeast quadrant. For each trial, the rat was released into the pool facing the wall from north, south, east, or west starting positions. The north and east start positions were designated short arms and the south and west positions were designated long arms. Start position of each trial was semi-random, alternating short and long, with each start point used once daily. Once released, the rat was allowed to swim until it reached the platform, or until a period of 60\u2009sec had elapsed. If the rat failed to reach the target in the given period, it was manually placed on the platform. Once on the platform, the rat was allowed 10\u2009sec rest before being returned to the cage for a 4\u20135\u2009min inter-trial rest. Four trials (one at each start position) were performed daily over the course of the first 4 days. Latency to platform presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation in contrast to previously used methods with the TBI, PBBI models with cell transplantation, where the deficit persisted at least 10 weeks following injury.\n47\n,\n65\n,\n77\n,\n81\nThe EthoVision Video Tracking Software (Noldus EthoVision XT) was used to confirm latency to reach platform (which was manually recorded with a stopwatch immediately after the trial); path length and swim speed were traced from video using EthoVision. Animals with evidence of far greater than average transplant rejection (criteria such as surviving transplant cell counts at 8 weeks below one third of average cell survival, and the presence of immune cells) were excluded from behavior analyses.\n\nSpecimen collection and histology\nRats were perfused transcardially with 0.1\u2009M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1M phosphate buffer. Brains were dissected out and post-fixed in 4% PFA for 12\u2009h, then transferred to a 30% sucrose solution for 24\u2009h. Brains were frozen in M-1 embedding matrix using dry ice, and stored at \u221220\u00b0C before being sectioned on a cryostat at 40\u2009\u03bcm thickness. Sections were stored free floating in 0.02% sodium azide in PBS prior to immunohistochemistry. Samples were assessed with the following primary antibodies: anti-GFP (Millipore MAB1083), NeuN (Millipore MAB377), doublecortin (DCX) (Millipore AB2253), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (Dako Z0334), Olig2 (Millipore AB9610), HuNu (Millipore MAB1281), Ki67 (Millipore AB9260), nestin (Millipore ABD60), MBP (Covance, SMI 94), and Calbindin (Cell Signaling #2136X). Appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies were used (Life Technologies) with 2-(4-amidinophenyl)-1H-indole-6-carboxamidine (DAPI) prior to mounting and imaging.\n\nImaging and analysis\nVolumetric GFP cell counts were generated using the physical fractionator method in StereoInvestigator (version 10.6 Stereo Investigator, MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT) on evenly spaced (0.2\u2009mm apart) brain sections, and used to calculate estimated total cell survival. The percentage of NeuN and GFP double-positive cells in grafts was determined by analysis of raw image files with Imaris 6.0.0.1 software. High-resolution fluorescent images were generated on a confocal microscope (\nn\n=\u20093\u20135 sections/brain; 3 brains/group). Using Imaris analysis software (version 8.0.1), and based on NeuN-positive host hippocampal neurons, the fluorescence intensity and object diameter were estimated. This served as the threshold for NeuN signal; similarly, a GFP limit was set using the transplanted cells. Points of NeuN-positive signal were automatically counted by approximate diameter and intensity based on host neurons (using the Spots tool). Similarly, GFP-positive points were counted based on diameter and relative background subtraction. The co-occurrence of both signals as calculated by the Imaris software was used to estimate NeuN positivity of grafts at 8 and 16 week time points. The synaptophysin signal was similarly analyzed in Imaris by comparing the occurrence of synaptophysin-positive spots at a set signal threshold in sample sites from transplant location versus contralateral regions of host brain expressing no GFP signal. The incidence of synaptophysin signal was compared overall between GFP-negative and GFP-positive tissue.\n\nStatistical analysis\nHistopathological and behavioral end-points were compared by independent samples\nt\ntests or analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Fisher protected least significant difference (PLSD) post-hoc and paired\nt\ntest analyses when appropriate (SigmaStat). All data are presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation, and\np\nvalues <0.05 were considered significant.\n77\n,\n82\nFor all experiments, the trained investigators performing the behavioral and neuropathological assessments were blinded to the experimental groups. MWM results were compared using two way repeated measures ANOVA followed by Tukey's test. Data were graphed using GraphPad version 6.0."

    "Methods": "All procedures conformed to the guidelines of the International Association for the Study of Pain, and were approved by the animal care and use committee of the University of Texas McGovern Medical School at Houston. Male, adult, Sprague-Dawley rats (200\u2013300\u2009g) were used in this study. Animals were housed two per cage in a controlled environment (12\u2009h reversed light/dark cycle, 21\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C) with standard food and water. The rats were allowed to adjust to their environment for a week before experimentation.\n\nSpinal cord injury\nMale, adult, Sprague-Dawley rats (200\u2013300\u2009g) were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (80\u2009mg/kg), xylazine (20\u2009mg/kg), and acepromazine (0.75\u2009mg/kg). Animals received a laminectomy at T10 followed by a spinal contusion using the Infinite Horizon impactor (150 kdyne, 1\u2009sec dwell time). Sham animals received a laminectomy and were treated identically except for the spinal impact. The surgical site was flushed with 1\u2009mL of normal saline. The overlying muscles were sutured over the spine and the skin flaps were then stapled with wound clips. Rats were returned to their cages, which were placed on heating pads to maintain temperature at \u223c37\u00b0C. Animals received twice daily injections (intraperitoneal [i.p.]) of a Lactated Ringer's solution (2\u2009mL) and analgesic (buprenorphine; 0.02\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) for 5 days post-injury and prophylactic antibiotics (Baytril, 2.5\u2009mg/kg) for 10 days. Manual bladder evacuations were performed twice daily until neurogenic bladder voiding returned. Rats were checked for signs of spontaneous pain, which can include marked inactivity, excessive grooming, and/or autotomy. Autotomy is rare in the spinal contusion model, and any animals exhibiting severe autotomy were euthanized immediately.\n\nBehavioral tests\nTo gauge effects of SCI on locomotor function, animals were placed in an open field (child's pool) and their spontaneous behavior was observed in white light and scored on the 21-point Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale.\n35\nAnimals that had a BBB score of 1 or more than 1 at 1 day after surgery were excluded. Animals received a standard 5-day sequence of tests for hindlimb reflex sensitivity prior to impact, then before and after retigabine treatment, as described previously.\n10\nAll reflex data were collected by experimenters blinded to any drug treatment during the animals' active phase under red light. Prior to each test, the animal was habituated for 20\u2009min per day in each of the testing chambers over a 5-day period. Below-level hypersensitivity to heat was tested with the Hargreaves radiant heat method using an IITC Plantar Analgesia Meter (Woodland Hills, CA) to measure the latency for hindpaw withdrawal. If no withdrawal occurred within 20\u2009sec, the stimulus was terminated to prevent possible tissue injury. Each hindpaw was tested, separated by 5\u2009min. This test sequence was repeated three times at 20-min intervals. The mean of six latency measurements (three from each hindpaw) was used for each data point for each animal. Below-level signs of mechanical hypersensitivity were tested with a series of calibrated von Frey filaments (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL) delivered to the glabrous surface of the hindpaws.\n36\nThresholds were determined with the \u201cup-down\u201d method.\n37\nOnly one test series was applied to each hindpaw.\nConditioned place preference (CPP) tests were performed as previously described.\n19\nBriefly, each rat was habituated to the device on the first day following a 3-day sequence of twice daily conditioning sessions (conditioning phase). In one session, the rat was restricted to the innately non-preferred white chamber for 60\u2009min, starting 5\u2009min after delivery of retigabine (10\u2009mg/kg, i.p.). In the other daily session, the rat was restricted for 60\u2009min to the innately preferred black chamber 5\u2009min after delivery of vehicle. In the testing phase, 1 day after the last conditioning session, the rat was introduced (without any injection) into the open central gray chamber and the time spent in each of the three chambers was recorded for 15\u2009min. Conditioning to retigabine was indicated by greater time spent in the white, compared with in the black chamber, during the testing phase (i.e., if the time in white minus time in black was positive).\n\nDissociation and culture of DRG neurons\nAfter rats were intracardially perfused with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) under deep anesthesia induced by injection (i.p.) of 75\u2009mg/kg Beuthanasia (Merck Animal Health, Kenilworth, NJ), the thoracic and lumbar segments of the vertebral column were removed and the L4 and L5 DRGs were excised. The ganglia were then minced, and the fragments transferred into Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM; Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) containing collagenase (0.6\u2009mg/mL, Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and trypsin (0.4\u2009mg/mL; Worthington, Lakewood, NJ), and incubated for 40\u2009min at 34\u00b0C. The cells were spun down and transferred to 35\u2009mm Petri dishes poly-L-lysine (50\u2009mg/mL)-precoated cover glass (8\u2009mm, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) and incubated with DMEM (without serum) at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO\n2\novernight. After an 18\u201324\u2009h incubation, living cells were digitally imaged and recorded.\n\nIn vitro recording of DRG neurons\nElectrodes with a resistance of \u223c2\u2009M\u03a9 were pulled from BF150-86-10 glass capillaries (inner diameter, 0.86\u2009mm; outer diameter, 1.5\u2009mm; Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA) using a micropipette puller (P-2000, Sutter Instrument Co, Novato, CA). Neurons were visualized using differential interference contrast (20\u2009\u00d7\u2009) optics on an inverted microscope (Axiovert 200M, Zeiss Oberkochen, Germany). Images of cells were taken with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. Neurons (soma diameter <30\u2009\u03bcm) were recorded in the whole\u2013cell configuration using an EPC-10 amplifier (HEKA Instruments, Lambrecht, Germany). After forming a tight seal (> 1\u2009G\u03a9), the membrane was ruptured. After the whole\u2013cell configuration was established, the cell membrane capacitance and series resistance were electronically compensated. In current-clamp mode RMP and SA were recorded. All experiments were performed at room temperature (\u223c23\u00b0C). Signals were filtered at 1\u2009kHz, digitized at \u226510\u2009kHz, and acquired using the Pulse software program (HEKA). The pipette solution contained (in mM) 134\u2009KCl, 1.6\u2009MgCl\n2\n, 13.2\u2009NaCl, 3 EGTA, 9 HEPES, 4\u2009Mg-ATP, and 0.3\u2009Na-GTP (pH 7.2, 300\u2009mOsM). The bath solution contained (in mM) 140\u2009NaCl, 3\u2009KCl, 1.8\u2009CaCl\n2\n, 2\u2009MgCl\n2\n, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose (pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH, osmolarity 320\u2009mOsM).\n\nIn vivo recording of DRGs\nSomally generated afferent activity was recorded extracellularly from rat dorsal root axons. Under deep anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital (50\u2009mg/kg, i.p.), a laminectomy was performed on vertebrae L3\u2013L6. The dura mater was gently peeled to expose nerve tissue, which was covered with mineral oil. Small filaments were teased from dorsal roots L4 and L5, and individually mounted on gold wire electrodes for the recording using a DAM80 differential amplifier. Units responding to cutaneous stimulation of the hindlimb with a 250\u2009mN von Frey filament were selected. Possible reduction of mechanical hypersensitivity of single units was evaluated by applying a series of graded von Frey filaments (less than 250\u2009mN) to the receptive field before and after i.p. injection of retigabine (10\u2009mg/kg). The SA was recorded before and after disconnecting the DRG from the periphery.\n\nDrug application\nDrugs were dissolved in distilled water at 1000 times their final concentration and kept frozen in aliquots except for capsaicin, which was prepared as a stock solution dissolved in ethanol. Stock solutions were diluted in extracellular solution just before use and held in independent syringes connected to an array of fused silica columns (inner diameter, 200\u2009\u03bcm). The column mouth was about 100\u2009\u03bcm upstream from the cell examined. Rapid solution exchange was achieved by shifting the columns horizontally with a micromanipulator. Cells in the recording chamber were continuously bathed in the extracellular solution. Each drug solution was delivered to the recording chamber by gravity. Drugs and chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) except retigabine (Toronto Research Chemicals, Ontario).\n\nWestern blotting\nOne month after surgery, animals were deeply anesthetized with Beuthanasia and perfused with ice-cold PBS. Four DRGs (L4, L5) from each rat were removed and immediately placed on dry ice. DRGs were homogenized in 300\u2009\u03bcL lysis buffer (RIPA, Teknova) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). After homogenization, samples were sonicated three times (10\u2009sec pulses), and centrifuged at 14,000\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. The protein concentration of lysates was determined by the BCA method (Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit). Samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad, 4\u201320% Tris-HCl) by 1:1 dilution with Laemmli buffer and 30\u2009\u03bcg of protein was loaded in each well. After electrophoresis, the gel was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk in PBS +0.1% Tween 20 prior to incubation with antibody against KCNQ5 (Alomone, APC-155), or \u03b2-actin (Abcam, ab8226) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The membrane was incubated with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG for 1\u2009h at room temperature and developed using the ECL kit (Pierce). Protein expression was quantified by optical density using Image J software (NIH). Color molecular weight standards were run on each gel. \u03b2-actin was detected as a loading control.\n\nQuantitative RT-PCR analysis\nTotal RNA was extracted from homogenized DRG with on-column DNase digestion (E.Z.N.A. Total RNA Kit I) and cDNA was synthesized by MMLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using random primer. Rat KCNQ2 primers were 5\u2032-CCGGCAGAACTCAGAAGAAG-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-TTTGAGGCCAGGGGTAAGAT-3\u2032 (reverse)\n26\n; rat KCNQ3 primers were 5\u2032-ATACACATTTATCTGCTCTTCCTTTTA-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-TGCTCTCAGTTTATCCGAATCAA-3\u2032 (reverse),\n38\nand rat glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) primers were 5\u2032-CCCCCAATGTATCCGTTGTG-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-TAGCCCAGGATGCCCTTTAGT-3\u2032 (reverse).\n39\nMessenger RNA (mRNA) abundance was determined by real-time PCR (LightCycler 480; Roche) with SYBR Green Master Mix (Sigma). Preincubation at 95\u00b0C for 3\u2009min was followed by 45 amplification cycles (95\u00b0C for 30\u2009sec, 57\u00b0C for 30\u2009sec, and 72\u00b0C for 30\u2009sec) and fluorescence collection at 60\u00b0C. Gene expression was normalized to GAPDH and averaged over three replicates from each of three to four animals in each group.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAnalysis was performed with Sigmaplot 11 (Systat Software, San Jose, CA) and Prism 5.0 (Graphpad, La Jolla, CA). Pooled data are presented as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean. All comparisons among animal groups were tested for significance using the Student's unpaired\nt\n-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures followed by Bonferroni's\npost hoc\ntests. Paired\nt\n-tests were used to analyze treatment effects within animals. The SA incidence among different groups of animals was compared using Fisher's exact tests. For all statistical analyses,\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Significant differences are indicated in each figure (*\np\n<\u20090.05; **\np\n<\u20090.01; ***\np\n<\u20090.001). The\nn\nin all experiments indicates the numbers of DRG neurons (electrophysiology) or rats (behavior) tested in each group."

    "Methods": "TBI gene list compilation\nTo generate a list of genes previously associated with clinical outcomes after TBI, we conducted a PubMed review using the following search terms: (\u201cbrain injury\u201d OR \u201cbrain injuries\u201d OR \u201cconcussion\u201d OR \u201cbrain concussion\u201d OR \u201chead injuries\u201d OR \u201chead injury\u201d) AND (\u201cgenetic\u201d OR \u201cgenetics\u201d OR \u201cgene\u201d OR \u201cgenes\u201d OR \u201cpolymorphism\u201d OR \u201cDNA\u201d OR \u201cgenetic polymorphism\u201d OR \u201cgenetic variation\u201d OR \u201cgenetic variability\u201d OR \u201cgenotype\u201d). In addition, the search was limited to English language articles, human studies, clinical research, and non-review articles using PubMed filters. The search was conducted from January 1, 1995, through September, 15, 2016. Inclusion criteria for articles required that each article evaluate the association of genetic variation (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms or other measure of genetic variation) with clinical or functional outcomes after traumatic brain injury. Genes were included only if a significant association was found. Articles evaluating the association of genetics with non-clinical outcomes (e.g., pathology post-mortem) or evaluating the association of gene expression or protein/biomarker levels with outcomes were excluded. Review articles and case reports also were excluded. Initially, 1269 articles were identified. After review of titles and abstracts, 1109 were excluded. After review of full manuscripts, 55 were excluded and the final number of studies included was 105. We then manually compiled a list of genetic loci that demonstrated a significant association with clinical or functional outcomes after TBI. Outcomes were grouped into Survival/Global functioning (e.g., Glasgow Outcome Scale), Cognitive (e.g., neuropsychological/intelligence measures), Behavioral/Emotional (e.g., Child Behavioral Checklist, anxiety, depression), and Medical Sequelae (e.g., seizures, dementia).\n\nFunctional enrichment analysis\nWe used ToppGene Suite\n47\nto systematically analyze this list of compiled TBI genetic loci. ToppGene Suite is a comprehensive platform for gene set enrichment analyses and machine learning-based candidate gene ranking. It is widely used, principally for linking biological states to observations of transcriptome or exome analyses.\n48\u201353\nThe current backend knowledgebase for ToppGene Suite is a comprehensive collection (more than 12 million gene annotations) of diverse gene set libraries compiled from a variety of publically available gene annotation databases and resources. ToppGene detects functional similarities or enrichment of a given gene list based on ontologies, pathways, phenotypes, and drug\u2013gene association. Although there are several enrichment analyses tools available, the strength of ToppGene is its extensive collection of functional annotations compared to other system biology tools.\n54\n,\n55\nBiologic processes demonstrating enrichment at a\np\nvalue of 0.05 (Bonferroni corrected) were considered to be significantly associated with the manually compiled gene list.\nTBI candidate gene discovery and prioritization\nAfter identifying genetically influenced biologic processes associated with TBI outcomes using information from previous genetic and TBI studies, we sought to identify additional TBI candidate genes and variants among these biologic processes likely to have the greatest impact on recovery after TBI. Using the theoretical basis that genes common among several processes would be more likely to have the greatest influence on recovery, the first approach we took was to identify genes common among these processes. Because it is possible that genes not common among several or more processes may also have a substantial impact on recovery, we took another systems biology\u2013based approach to identify other candidate genes. In this second approach, we ranked all known genes associated with each of the enriched TBI-relevant biological processes using ToppGene\n47\nwith default parameters.\n56\nToppGene ranks candidate genes based on functional similarity to a user supplied training set (known TBI associated genes in this case). Functional similarity is computed using a variety of gene annotations (pathways, biological processes, phenotype, literature, protein interactions, and co-expression) in an integrative systems biology\u2013based machine learning approach. Using this second approach,\na priori,\nwe considered genes ranked in the top 5% likely to be significantly associated with recovery from TBI."

    "Methods": "Study subjects\nThis study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden, and reviewed by The Medical Products Agency - Sweden. It was conducted according to Good Clinical Practice, the revised Declaration of Helsinki, and the ISO 14155:2011 standard. The study was registered at\nClinicalTrials.gov\n(Identifier: NCT02282228) before the recruitment of the first study participant.\nAll patients were referred to Sahlgrenska University Hospital for operation of cSDH, during the period September 2015 to January 2016. The HC group was recruited in the same period as the patients and matched to the patient cohort for age and sex. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before any study-related procedure was initiated. Safety follow-up for participants was performed >12\u2009h after the diagnostic procedure. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in\nTable 1\n.\nTable\n1.\nInclusion and Exclusion Criteria for Patients and Controls\nInclusion criteria patients\nInclusion criteria controls\nExclusion criteria patients and controls\nAdmitted for surgery of cSDH\nHealthy\u2014i.e., no significant medical history\nPregnant or breastfeeding women\nCT brain scan within 96\u2009h\n\u226518 years of age\nShunt or other foreign object implanted in the brain\n\u226518 years of age\nSigned a written informed consent\nParticipation in any other clinical study that could interfere with the result in the ongoing study\nBe able to have a normal conversation and understand the information about the study, corresponding to Glasgow Coma Scale (Verbal Response) of 5\nSigned a written informed consent\nOpen in a separate window\ncSDH, chronic subdural hematoma; CT, computed tomography.\n\nMeasurements\nEligible patients were included in the study on arrival at the neurosurgical unit. They were measured with the microwave device (Strokefinder MD100, Medfield Diagnostics AB, Gothenburg, Sweden) before operation of cSDH. Measurements were performed with the subjects lying in a hospital bed. A thin disposable plastic protective cover (evercare\n\u00ae\nBanded Bag - REF 1855 - \u00d8 140\u2009cm, OneMed Group Oy, Helsinki, Finland) was mounted around the device for hygienic reasons before the subject's head was positioned in the device. The subjects were required to lie still for the duration of the measurement (approximately 45\u2009sec). No significant movements were visually observed during any subject measurements. Two investigators performed all measurements.\nThe Strokefinder MD100 is designed like a headrest for placement on a hospital bed or ambulance stretcher (\nFig. 1\n). The device has eight antennas mounted in four pairs, where the pair in contact with the back of the patient's head is mounted at the bottom, and the other three pairs are mounted on separate arms. When the patient's head has been positioned in the device, the fastening mechanism is tightened until sufficient antenna contact with the head is achieved, without causing discomfort to the subject. The investigators followed a standardized procedure to position the patient's head, and carefully inspected that the head was placed symmetrically in the device. The measurements were started from a tablet computer, which was connected wirelessly to the main unit. The proprietary software included a test verifying that all antennas achieved good contact with the subject's head. If the test showed that one or more antennas did not achieve good contact, the subject's head was repositioned and the antenna positions and contact pressure controlled until the test was approved. The device automatically performed three consecutive measurements during the diagnostic procedure.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nThe Strokefinder MD100 device (Medfield Diagnostics AB, Gothenburg, Sweden). Reprinted with permission.\n\nCT-scan assessment\nThe patients' CT-scans were reviewed. Volume and attenuation of the hematomas and midline shift were measured. The volume of the hematomas was estimated by delineating the hematomas manually using the ITK-SNAP software (Version 3.4.0, University of Pennsylvania), and the software then automatically calculated the volume. A neuroradiologist (author LJ) then measured the attenuation of the hematomas and confirmed the accuracy of the volume and midline shift measurements.\n\nMicrowave data pre-processing and analysis\nThe raw microwave data consisted of all antenna combinations (channels), including both reflection channels (same antenna sending and receiving) and transmission channels (one antenna sending, the other antennas receiving). The full frequency range was approximately 0.1\u20131.95 GHz. The raw data were pre-processed\u2014i.e., prepared and transformed into a format suitable for the diagnostic algorithm, by excluding channels with high attenuation (i.e., low signal-to-noise ratio, because of a relatively long direct path through the brain) and channels that measured more peripheral regions relative to the commonly lateral location of cSDH.\nFigure 2\nillustrates the excluded channels. For each measurement, all selected frequencies of the retained channels were combined into one complex vector. The three measurements on each subject were averaged into one mean measurement. No further pre-processing of the raw data was performed.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nThe reflection and transmission coefficients for antennas 1 and 2 (at subject's forehead) and antennas 7 and 8 (at back of subject's head) were removed, except for channels between the lateral antennas (3 to 6) and forehead/back of head antennas. The dashed lines indicate the channels that were removed.\nThe classifier developed by Persson and coworkers\n15\nwas used on the pre-processed data. A LOO cross-validation procedure was used\u2014i.e., the subject measurement to be classified was not included in the training data\u2014to avoid overfitting. The classifier performance depends on which so-called subspace dimensions are retained.\n15\nA repeated LOO procedure was used to identify the subspace dimensions and frequency interval that yielded optimal classifier performance.\nThe diagnostic performance was evaluated using the ROC and the AUC. An AUC of \u223c0.5 represents a useless diagnostic test, equal to relying on chance. An AUC of 1.0 represents a perfect test that classifies all subjects correctly. The specificity at 100% sensitivity was derived from the ROC. A scatter plot was used to show the classifier decision value for all subjects.\n15\nThe frequency was swept from 0.1\u20131.95 GHz with 50\u2009MHz step-size and a minimum frequency interval of 400\u2009MHz. The highest AUC on average for all frequency intervals was given by keeping only the first subspace dimension, and this classifier setting was therefore used throughout all tests in this study. The frequency interval 0.75\u20131.95 GHz yielded the highest specificity at 100% sensitivity and was therefore used throughout all tests in this study.\nTo test the robustness of the classification with the selected pre-processing and classification parameter settings, 100 repeated LOO procedures were performed on data sets where a few random subjects were removed each time. We chose to remove two random subjects from the full data set for each iteration. The mean and standard deviation of the AUC were calculated from the 100 iterations. If the mean AUC is close to the AUC for the full data set and the standard deviation is relatively small, this indicates that the selected parameter settings for the classification are robust\u2014i.e., the result does not fluctuate substantially depending on the exact configuration of the data set.\nTo validate that the classifier did not become overfitted (model being fitted to irrelevant information/noise) to the data, 100 repeated LOO procedures were performed on data sets where the subjects were randomly assigned to one of the two classes\u2014i.e., each subject was assigned to either the cSDH group or the HC group regardless of the true diagnosis. For such random data sets, it is expected that the groups cannot be differentiated\u2014i.e., an AUC \u223c0.5 is expected. It is a useful check for bias of the mathematical model, which would cause deviations from the expected performance.\n17\nThe mean and standard deviation of the AUC were calculated from the 100 iterations."

    "Methods": "In the ACT Model, the DES simulates individuals with tSCI from injury through to rehabilitation in the PCM. Then, as individuals are discharged into the community, they enter the HPM where long-term outcomes and costs are assessed and calculated (Fig. 1). Data sources populating the model were the RHSCIR and process maps describing the RHSCIR acute and rehabilitation facilities, supplemented by literature review, subject matter experts, and other data sources including the National Trauma Registry and the National Rehabilitation Reporting System\u2014of which both are from the Canadian Institute for Health Information.\n\nGeneralized linear models, including multiple linear regression and logistic regression analysis, were used to estimate the effect of demographic and injury attributes on outcomes in the DES, depending on the distribution of response variables and their statistical properties (Fig. 2). Age- and gender-specific incidence of tSCI input in the DES can be taken from RHSCIR data or from predictions calculated from the IFM. Based on the incidence, the DES creates simulated individuals with tSCI with attributes such as date and time of injury, mechanism of injury, neurological injury severity and level, and injury energy. Decision protocols, such as pre-hospital protocols that determine whether patients are directly admitted to specialized acute care facilities, also are applied to the simulated cohort. As the simulated individuals with tSCI reach specialized acute care and transition through to rehabilitation, they consume resources and accumulate properties such as therapeutic episodes (e.g., surgery), length of stay, secondary complications, and changes to neurological impairment (Fig. 3). A powerful feature of the model is that these properties, or outcomes, can be assessed in comparison with system outcomes, such as total direct care cost, to evaluate the net effect on the healthcare system.\n\nLong-term outcomes, such as health-related outcomes, quality adjusted life-years, and healthcare costs, are calculated in the HPM, which tracks the health and economic outcomes of simulated individuals after exiting the healthcare system and through their rest of life (Fig. 411\u201314). Integration of the PCM and HPM allows for the evaluation, from a system level perspective, of the effect of intervention on patient and system outcomes in each phase of care and the rest of the individual's life."

    "Methods": "The development of the ACT simulation model for traumatic SCI care has been previously described.16\u201318The ACT project was implemented in Canadian facilities participating in a prospective longitudinal traumatic SCI patient registry, referred to as the Rick Hansen SCI Registry (RHSCIR). Participating sites in the RHSCIR include include high volume acute trauma facilities and specialized rehabilitation facilities in Canada.19RHSCIR data used in the ACT model relate to patient and injury characteristics, timing to care, and outcomes (e.g., LOS, mortality, discharge American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale [AIS] grade). The full list of data variables has been previously published.18\n\nACT methodology incorporated process mapping to document patient flow and resources at participating facilities and to provide the basis for the computer simulation of the ACT model. For a detailed description of process mapping, readers can reference Noonan and coworkers.16The purpose of the Level 1 process maps was threefold: 1) to document patient flow and basic processes of SCI care starting from the point of injury through to community reintegration, 2) to identify and capture important differences in the delivery of care among facilities, and 3) to identify facilities for detailed simulation.\n\nDiscrete event simulation (DES) modeling was used to further characterize the pre-hospital, acute, and rehabilitation phases of care. The DES methodology was described in detail by Noonan and coworkers.16DES requires detailed input data. The RHSCIR was the most appropriate data source for developing the simulation model, as it captures data elements from healthcare facilities across Canada from the time of injury through to 1, 2, and every 5 years post-injury until death or a participant's voluntary withdrawal from the study. Data from RHSCIR were supplemented by additional hospital and national databases, including the Canadian Institute for Health Information National Rehabilitation Reporting System. In instances in which data were not available, literature searches were conducted and relevant information was obtained from subject matter experts. Examples of data derived from the published literature include incidence of secondary complications; dependence of LOS on injury type, complications, and comorbidities; and economic data such as direct healthcare costs. The current ACT model simulates nine acute facilities and seven rehabilitation facilities in Canada.\n\nDefining LOS\nVariability in the reporting and capture of LOS was explored using two approaches: 1) a search of representative Canadian and international databases and data sets was conducted to document existing variability in the definitions of LOS; and 2) a literature review of international reports of LOS was conducted to obtain a global snapshot of variability of LOS. PubMed was searched using the search terms\nspinal cord injury\nAND (\nlength of stay\nOR\nduration of care\nOR\nhospital days\nOR\nepidemiology\n), for the period 2006\u20132016.\n\nLOS Modeling\nTo model and predict LOS for different participating jurisdictions, regression analysis was performed using simulation inputs. In the context of this modeling activity, jurisdiction refers to both an acute and a rehabilitation facility. Inputs included age, gender, direct admission to specialized center, time from injury to admission to a specialized center, death in acute care, mechanism of injury, neurological level of injury, AIS grade, and a jurisdiction adjusting factor. The jurisdiction adjusting factor incorporated clinical protocols, therapeutic decision making, and resource capabilities, the details of which were reported by Noonan and coworkers.\n16\nThe simulation generated and accommodated theoretical cohorts of patients with differing demographics or injury characteristics, and predicted mean LOS for participating jurisdictions.\nBecause the calculation of LOS for jurisdictions includes predictors related to 1) patient demographics, 2) injury characteristics, and 3) a jurisdiction adjusting factor, the impact of changing patient demographics and/or injury characteristics can be determined by leaving the jurisdiction adjusting factor unchanged. When LOS does not change significantly after switching patient demographics and/or injury characteristics, it is assumed that the LOS is driven primarily by the jurisdiction specific adjusting factor.\nJurisdictional differences in processes of care may be captured in part by calculating LOS using different definitions. For example, acute LOS can be calculated for one particular acute facility, or alternatively as the accumulated LOS for all acute facilities visited during the acute phase of care. This is important because some patients are treated at only one acute facility following injury, whereas others are treated at multiple acute facilities. To illustrate the impact of definitions, mean and median acute LOS were calculated, using a cohort of patients from two participating RHSCIR acute facilities prior to 2012, using different parameters: 1) the interval between date of admission and date of discharge from the designated (RHSCIR) acute facility, and 2) the interval between date of admission to any acute facility to date of final discharge from any acute facility. The cohort included participants admitted to the RHSCIR acute facility. Only participants who also went to rehabilitation were included in the cohort to reduce variation. LOS was calculated with outliers (defined using the 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009interquartile range rule) removed, and the sign test was used to test for significant differences between parameters 1 and 2 for each facility."

    "Methods": "This study collected on-field head impact data from athletes participating in a local youth football organization over 4 years (2012\u20132015). The study protocol was approved by the Wake Forest School of Medicine Institutional Review Board and participant assent and parental consent were acquired for participation in the study. Youth football players participating in a local youth football organization were prospectively recruited and enrolled in this study. The study staff worked with the organization's executive board and coaches to arrange informational meetings for the parents and players so that study representatives could describe the study and provide informed consent and assent. Study representatives also attended several existing events held by the organization including summer conditioning, sign-up nights, and equipment distribution day. Those not present during the organized events were sought out individually. Informed parental consent and subject assent was obtained from each subject by members of the study staff. Participation in the study was voluntary. Athletes also had to properly fit into a Riddell Speed Youth medium size or larger helmet to be included in the study. Levels of play are mandated by the national governing organization's age and weight requirements as shown inTable 1. The three levels included in this study will be referred to as levels A, B, and C. One team was studied at each level for each year data were collected for that level, and all 4 years of data collection were completed at the same organization.\n\nHead impact data were collected for all pre-season, regular season, and playoff practices and competitions by instrumenting players' helmets with the Head Impact Telemetry (HIT) System head acceleration measurement device. All helmeted practices were included in the session type practice; this included both helmet-only and padded practices. Video was recorded for all practices and competitions to verify the times that the athletes were helmeted. Impacts occurring while the players were not wearing helmets were removed from the data set. Each participant in the study was properly fitted with a Riddell Youth Speed helmet with the HIT System installed. The HIT System measures location and magnitude of head impacts with an encoder, which is an array of six spring-mounted single-axis accelerometers oriented normal to the surface of the head, a telemetry unit, data storage device, and battery pack. The encoder is designed to fit between the existing padding of the helmet. The spring-mounted accelerometers allow the encoder to remain in contact with the head throughout the duration of a head impact, ensuring measurement of head acceleration, not helmet acceleration.32In addition to the encoder, the HIT System includes a sideline base unit with a laptop computer connected to a radio receiver. Each time one of the six accelerometers in an instrumented helmet records an impact greater than 10g, data acquisition is initiated, and a total of 40\u2009ms of data with 8\u2009ms of pre-trigger data is recorded at 1000\u2009Hz. Impacts were collected using the standard HIT System processing with a peak resultant linear acceleration threshold of 10g. Data from the encoder are transmitted wirelessly to the sideline base unit. The data are then used to compute peak resultant linear acceleration, estimated peak resultant rotational acceleration, location of impact, and other biomechanical indicators. All peak resultant rotational acceleration data were scaled by a factor of 0.648, as per Rowson and colleagues.33The HIT System has been described in previous literature, and has been found to reliably measure head impact exposure.32,34,35\n\nHIE was quantified in terms of impact frequency, peak head acceleration, and head impact location. Total number of impacts in a season of play as well as in each session (practice or competition) were computed. Head acceleration was described in terms of mean, 50th percentile, and 95th percentile linear and rotational acceleration. Four general locations were used to describe impact locations on the helmet: front, top, back, and side.36Inference was based on mixed effects linear models and Wald tests to assess differences in the number of impacts and linear and rotational accelerations among levels of play, session types, and year of data collection while controlling for repeated measures across seasons. The models were adjusted for confounding factors including level, impact date, and year of data collection. Because the aims were primarily descriptive, type 1 error was set at 0.05 for each inference. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC)."

The detailed characteristics of this sample have been described in detail elsewhere.\n16\nThe inclusion criteria included CT scan to assess for evidence of acute TBI within 24\u2009h of injury, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score 13\u201315 (upon emergency department [ED] arrival), loss of consciousness (LOC) <30\u2009min, post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) duration <24\u2009h, and age 18\u201355 years (inclusive). Exclusion criteria were: lack of fluency in English, contraindication for MRI, and a reported history of previous TBI resulting in LOC >5\u2009min. Four of the subjects were excluded because of artifacts in the rsfMRI data.\nCT was performed within 2\u20133\u2009h of TBI. MRI was performed within 11.2\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 days (range, 5\u201318) post-injury. A 7\u2009min. rsfMRI single shot gradient-echo echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence was acquired (repetition time [TR]\u2009=\u20092000\u2009ms, echo time [TE]\u2009=\u200928\u2009ms; flip angle\u2009=\u200990 grad; field of view [FOV]\u2009=\u2009220\u2009mm; voxel size\u2009=\u20093.4\u2009\u00d7\u20093.4\u2009\u00d7\u20094.0\u2009mm). The subjects were asked to close their eyes, relax, not focus their attention on anything specific, and not fall asleep. All CT examinations were performed on a GE Lightspeed 64-row-detector CT scanner, and all MRIs were performed on the same 3T GE Signa EXCITE scanner equipped with an eight channel phased array head radiofrequency coil (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI), using the same scanner software version. The following conventional 3T MRI sequences were performed: 1) axial three-dimensional (3D) inversion recovery fast spoiled gradient recalled echo T1-weighted images (TE\u2009=\u20091.5\u2009ms; TR\u2009=\u20096.3\u2009ms; inversion time [TI]\u2009=\u2009400\u2009ms; flip angle, 15 degrees) with 230\u2009mm FOV, 156 contiguous partitions (1.0\u2009mm) at 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256 matrix; 2) axial T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images (TE\u2009=\u2009126\u2009ms; TR\u2009=\u200910\u2009sec; TI\u2009=\u20092200\u2009ms) with 220\u2009mm FOV, 47\u201348 contiguous slices (3.0\u2009mm) at 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256 matrix; and 3) axial magnetization-prepared gradient echo T2*- weighted images (TE\u2009=\u200915\u2009ms; TR\u2009=\u2009500\u2009ms; flip angle 20 degrees) with 220\u2009\u00d7\u2009170\u2009mm FOV and 47\u201348 contiguous slices (3.0\u2009mm) at 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009192 matrix. The MRI scanner and the scanning protocol used were the same for the group of patients and for the healthy control group.\nEach patient's head CT upon ED presentation and semiacute brain MRI were characterized using the TBI common data elements (TBI-CDE).\n17\nEach CT and MRI was anonymized and reviewed by a board certified neuroradiologist blinded to the data. The mTBI patients were divided into two subgroups: 1) CT/MRI positive (\nn\n=\u200931; age:\n=\u200934\u2009\u00b1\u200912.2 years), defined as patients with any acute traumatic intracranial lesion (epidural hematoma [EDH], subdural hematoma [SDH], subarachnoid hemorrhage [SAH], contusion, or evidence of traumatic axonal injury[TAI]) and/or depressed skull fracture on either CT or MRI, and 2) CT/MRI negative (\nn\n=\u200944; age:\n=\u200931\u2009\u00b1\u20099.5 years), defined as patients without any such abnormality on either CT or MRI.\n14\nThe radiological MRI findings of the CT/MRI positive TBI group are displayed in\nTable 1\n.

A trained neuropsychologist administered the following behavioral and cognitive tests to the mTBI patients 6 months after injury: the Rivermead Postconcussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ) consisting of 16 physical and psychosocial symptoms frequently reported after mTBI, the California Verbal Learning Test\u2013Second Edition (CVLT-II) to evaluate learning, short and long-term memory, and the Trail Making Tests (TMT) A and B to evaluate attention, processing speed, and cognitive flexibility to switch tasks as well as executive function. No cognitive testing data were available for the control group.\nThe control group consisted of 47 healthy subjects matched with the patients group by age (\n=\u200928.8\u2009\u00b1\u20099 years; ANOVA:\nF\n=\u20092.5\np\n=\u20090.08) and education (ANOVA:\nF\n=\u20092.5\np\n=\u20090.08) without previous diagnosis of TBI, or neurological or psychiatric disorders. The shape of the age distributions measured by K-S was not significant between the control group and either the mTBI CT/MRI positive or the mTBI CT/MRI negative group (\np\n=\u20090.30 and\np\n=\u20090.40, respectively).\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe summary of the imaging data preprocessing and analysis is shown in\nFigure 1\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nImaging data preprocessing and analysis summary. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nResting-state fMRI data were first preprocessed and then analyzed using probabilistic independent component analysis (ICA), implemented in MELODIC, followed by a network-based approach with FSLNets, a toolbox for performing basic network modelling from fMRI time series data. All procedures are part of FSL (\nhttp://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl\n).\nFirst we performed standard preprocessing of resting-state fMRI data, which included brain extraction,\n18\nmotion correction,\n19\nand spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel with a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of 6\u2009mm and high-pass temporal filtering with a 100\u2009sec cutoff. Functional scans were then registered to each subject's high-resolution MPRAGE scan using affine linear registration (FMRIB's Linear Image Registration Tool [FLIRT]) and further registered to the common Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard space using linear affine registration with 12 degrees of freedom.\nWe then used ICA-based Xnoiseifier artifact removal (FIX) to de-noise single subject data.\n20\nFor this, we performed a single-session ICA and the resulting components were introduced into FIX, which identified the \u201cbad\u201d components and removed them from the individual preprocessed fMRI timeseries. Fifteen subjects were selected to create a training data set to classify the ICA components into \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad.\u201d Then, in order to obtain the study group maps, a group-level ICA was performed in the new \u201cclean\u201d data using temporal concatenation of fMRI data from all the subjects, and restricted to 25 independent components (ICs).\nA dual regression approach\n21\nwas then used to find between-group differences in the connectivity maps for each component. The group-ICA maps were first regressed against each individual preprocessed fMRI series (spatial regression) to obtain sets of time series that are specific to each subject and each IC. At a second stage, these time series were regressed again to the individual fMRI data (temporal regression) to obtain IC Z-maps specific for each subject and each component. Finally, these individual maps were compared between subjects using a voxelwise general linear model (GLM) analysis with permutation testing to correct for multiple comparisons\n22\nusing threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) family-wise error corrected (FWE) corrected at\np\n\u2264\u20090.05. Further, to assess resting-state network interactions, whole brain connectivity matrices were created from the individual network time series with FSLNETs\n23\n(\nhttp://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSLNets\n). In these matrices, nodes were defined from the group ICA maps. Time series were then obtained by the spatial regression of these maps to the preprocessed 4D data sets (i.e., first stage of the dual regression procedure). Because of the nature of ICA maps, each node would be a map covering the whole brain with the strongest weight of the regions showing higher Z-scores in that specific map. After defining the nodes and their associated time series, each edge represents the connectivity between pairs of nodes, computed using full correlation. These matrices were then analyzed in a group-level approach, and GLM was used to find group differences and correlations with cognitive and clinical outcomes. Results of the RSNs interactions were corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR)."

    "Methods": "Model and drug\nThe Sprague\u2013Dawley tabletop blast model produces a peak impulse of 50 psi. Finite element modeling reveals that the wave produced is 1\u2009ms in duration (\nFig. 1\n). The blast was delivered to the right side of the rat's skull with the head freely mobile and body protected by PVC tubing. The West Virginia University Animal Care and Use Committee approved this study, and all experiments were conducted in accordance with the national guidelines for the use and care of laboratory animals. A total of 120 3\u20136-month-old male Sprague\u2013 Dawley rats were used for this study. Sal (Tocris) was dissolved in 0.9% saline and administered at a concentration of 1mg/kg at a single time 5 minutes post-blast. 0.9% saline was used for the vehicle in rats not receiving Sal.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nBlast model schematic and finite element modeling representations showing that the tabletop model produces short duration waves, a rapid spike in pressure, and consistency in pressure readings at the tube exit. The shockwave combines with the contact wave and expansion wave to form a blast wave over time.\n\nStudy design\nRats for the biochemical characterization studies were divided into control or blast groups based on time of euthanasia (30\u2009min, 24\u2009h, or 21 days). The time points were chosen to look at 1) acute ER stress activation, 2) subsequent iron toxicity, and 3) tauopathy. Sham rats were anesthetized but not exposed to blast. The\nn\nnumbers for each assay are outlined in detail subsequently. The rats for behavior were divided according to assay and time point (72\u2009h, 7 days, and 1 month).\n\nCell culture\nNG-108 cells were cultured in a humidified incubator (5% CO\n2\nat 37\u00b0C) in T75 culture flasks. High-glucose (4.5\u2009g/L) Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin, streptomycin, and hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine (HAT) medium. When cells were 70% confluent, the media was replaced with differentiation media (DMEM with 5% FBS, penicillin, streptomycin, HAT, and 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]) and allowed to differentiate for an additional 3 days.\nDifferentiated cells were seeded (1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n5\n) onto 12 well plates for treatment (\nn\n=\u20095). On each plate, wells were divided into four groups: 1) control, 2) Sal, 3) tunicamycin (TUN) + DMSO, and (4) TUN + SAL. TUN was administered (1\u2009\u03bcg/mL) to cells for 6\u2009h prior to collection to activate the ER stress response, and Sal was administered (100\u2009\u03bcM) to cells 30\u2009min prior to collection. Control and TUN cells were administered DMSO (0.5%) 30\u2009min prior to collection. Cells were collected in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for measurement of protein expression.\n\nWestern blot analysis\nFor Western blot, frontal cortex was collected from blast and control rats, which has been shown previously to correlate with behavioral findings.\n13\nIn vitro\ncell collection was also conducted as stated. Protein samples were prepared in 1% SDS, and the assay was performed as previously described.\n14\nPrimary antibodies were rabbit anti-phosphoPERK mAB (1:1000), anti-PERK mAB (1:1000), and anti-phosphoeiF2\u03b1 (1:1000) (Cell Signaling); mouse anti-NF\u03baB p65 (1:200) (Santa Cruz); mouse anti-AT8 (Thermo), and mouse anti-CP13 (kindly gifted by Peter Davies). A rabbit anti-\u03b2-actin mAB (1:10,000) (Cell Signaling) was used as an endogenous control to normalize protein loading. Secondary antibodies were IRDye\n\u00ae\n800CW (goat anti-rabbit) and IRDye\n\u00ae\n680RD (goat anti-mouse) (LI-COR Biosciences). Images were collected and analyzed with an Odyssey fluorescent scanner. Images were converted to gray scale and the values calculated after background subtraction and then normalized to \u03b2-actin to measure relative intensity.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nBrains were rapidly removed and placed into an ice-cold protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail mix (Halt\n\u2122\n; Thermo Scientific; Pittsburgh, PA). Tissues were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at \u221280\u00b0C. Fixed brain tissue for the TBI and control rats were prepared as previously described.\n14\nBriefly, rats were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane and cardiac perfused with ice-cold 0.9% saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde for 15\u2009min. Following perfusion, brains were removed and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24\u2009h. Following fixation, the frontal cortex was sectioned into 4\u2009mm slabs, which were then processed and embedded in paraffin, as previously described.\n15\nBrain slabs were sectioned (10\u2009\u03bcm), mounted onto slides, and prepared for staining. Standard protocols for Perls DAB and cresyl violet were used for the iron staining (Sigma Aldrich).\n\nFST\nDepressive-like behavior was assessed with the FST assay. Two sets of rats were assessed: control and 72\u2009h post-blast (\nn\n=\u20096 per group). The apparatus was filled with water so that the rat could not touch the floor. On habituation day, the rat was placed in the apparatus for 15\u2009min and monitored continuously. It was dried and warmed on a heating blanket following the trial. On test day, the rat was placed in the apparatus for 5\u2009min and tracked with Any-Maze Video Tracking software (Stoelting Co.). Time spent immobile and time to first immobility episode was analyzed.\n\nEPM\nImpulsive-like behavior was investigated with the EPM assay. Four sets of rats were assessed: control, Sal, 7 day blast, and 7 day Sal + blast (\nn\n=\u20099 per group). The two arms of the EPM were 50\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009cm and raised 60\u2009cm from the floor. The closed arms had black siding 30\u2009cm tall. The rat was placed in the middle of the EPM and tracking was performed with Any-Maze software for 5\u2009min. The percentage time spent in the open arms and distance traveled was recorded and quantified.\n\nMWM\nCognitive performance was evaluated with the MWM assay. Three sets of rats were assessed: control, 7 days post-blast, and 21 days post-blast (\nn\n=\u200910 per group). The circular pool was 180\u2009cm in diameter. In the pool, a 10\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009cm platform was submerged 2.5\u2009cm below the surface of the water (20\u00b0C). The training paradigm consisted of 6 days of acquisition with a hidden platform followed by a probe trial on day 7. During spatial acquisition, rats were placed into the maze apparatus four times from four different locations. Each rat had a 2\u2009min trial to locate the platform. Timing stopped if the platform was found, but if the rat did not find it during the 2\u2009min session, it was placed on the platform for 15\u2009sec. On probe day, the rat was placed in the apparatus from a novel entrance point for 1\u2009min. An area encompassing 300% of where the platform had been was outlined to indicate time spent in the appropriate region. Any-Maze was used to measure the distance traveled and the latency to reach the platform on acquisition days. On the probe trial day, it was used to measure how long the rat spent in the area 300% of where the platform had been.\n\nStatistical analysis\nGraphpad Prism software 5.0 (Graphpad Software, Inc.) was used for statistical analysis. A\nt\ntest, one way ANOVA, or two way ANOVA was used depending on the assay. \u03c7\n2\nanalysis was used to quantify the iron staining. Tukey's post-hoc comparison was used for the one way and two way ANOVA. A\np\nvalue of <0.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Participants\nParticipants were part of a prospective, longitudinal study evaluating outcomes of children who sustained a TBI or OI between the ages of 3 and 7 years.\n5\n,\n6\n,\n53\nThey were recruited from three tertiary care children's hospitals and one tertiary care, general hospital in Ohio. Participants completed assessments at multiple visits, including the immediate post-acute period (0\u20133 months after injury); 6 (referred to as \u201cshort-term\u201d throughout), 12, and 18 months after injury; and an average of 3.5 and 7 years after injury (referred to as \u201clong-term\u201d throughout).\nInclusion criteria included hospitalization overnight for traumatic injury (TBI or OI), no evidence of child abuse as the cause of the injury, no history of documented neurological problems or developmental delays pre-injury, and English as the primary language spoken in the home. Severity of TBI was characterized using the lowest post-resuscitation GCS score.\n11\nSevere TBI was defined as a GCS score \u22648. Moderate TBI was defined as a GCS score of 9\u201312 with or without abnormal neuroimaging (moderate TBI) or a higher GCS score with abnormal neuroimaging as defined by an intracranial or parenchymal injury or depressed skull fracture (complicated mild TBI). Mild TBI was defined as a GCS score \u226513 without abnormal neuroimaging. The OI group included children who had sustained a bone fracture (not including skull fractures), had an overnight stay in the hospital, and did not exhibit alterations in consciousness or other signs or symptoms of head trauma or brain injury. The study was approved by the institutional review boards at each of the participating medical centers and informed consent was obtained from participating caregivers.\n\nDNA collection and genotyping\nDNA was collected from saliva samples and purified using the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared Oragene OG-500 self-collection tubes (DNA Genotek, Ottawa, Canada). Oragene allows the collection, stabilization, and long-term storage of DNA from saliva at ambient temperature. Salivary DNA is a valid and reliable alternative to blood DNA for high-throughput genotyping.\n54\nThe HumanExome v1.1 Bead Chip (Illumina, San Diego, CA) was used to perform genotyping using the Illumina iScan system to identify SNPs associated with the following dopamine-related genes: DRD2, SLC6A3, SLC18A2, COMT, and ANKK1. SNPs were selected within genes' boundaries plus 5 kilo bases upstream and downstream from the genes. These candidate genes were chosen based on their associations with outcomes following TBI in adults and their biological relevance in dopamine pathways in adults and children as described. Prior to analysis, quality of SNP calls from the chip was evaluated. SNPs that failed Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium (\np\n<\u20090.0001) or had minor allele frequencies <10% were excluded. Thresholds for quality control for call rates at individual and SNP levels were 99% and 90%, respectively. Cryptic relatedness was checked using Graphical Representation of Relationships (GRR)\n55\n(\nhttp://csg.sph.umich.edu/abecasis/GRR\n). Principal component analysis was employed to confirm European and African continental ancestry, which aligns with self-reported white and black race, using 200 validated ancestry informative markers and HapMap genotypic data from individuals of known ancestry as referent groups. Concordance with self-reported race was >95%. Results of primary and exploratory analyses were similar when run with only participants of European ancestry; therefore, both ancestral groups were retained in analyses to preserve power. JMP Genomics 8.0 (SAS, Cary, NC) was used to determine the degree of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs within this sample in genes exhibiting nominal association (\np\n<\u20090.05) with study outcomes.\n\nOutcome measures\nParents completed the age-appropriate form of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) at all visits, the first of which was based on the child's behavior prior to injury, used in analysis to control for premorbid differences in child functioning. The BRIEF is a parent-report measure of child executive function as evident in everyday behavior.\n56\u201358\nWe analyzed the age-standardized global executive composite\nT\nscore (BRIEF GEC) to assess global executive function behaviors. Higher scores reflect poorer executive functioning.\nParents completed the age-appropriate form of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)\n59\nat all visits, the first of which was based on retrospective recall of the child's behavior prior to injury to control for premorbid differences in child functioning. The CBCL is a parent-report measure of child behavioral adjustment and possesses high test\u2013retest reliability and criterion-related validity. We analyzed the age- and sex-standardized Total Problems\nT\nscore to assess child behavioral adjustment. Higher scores reflect poorer behavioral adjustment.\nBoth outcome measures are National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) recommended common data elements for pediatric TBI and are well validated for the pediatric TBI population.\n60\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS, Cary, NC). Prior to analyses, child outcome data were reviewed for plausibility according to the following rules to reduce the potential influence of outliers: 1) participants with changes in outcome scores between the short-term and long-term time point that exceeded three standard deviations of change were excluded from respective analyses (\nn\n=\u20092 from BRIEF analysis;\nn\n=\u20090 from CBCL analysis); and 2) outcome scores of\nT\n>\u200990 (4 SDs above the normative mean) were winsorized to 90 (\nn\n=\u20095 from BRIEF analysis;\nn\n=\u20091 from CBCL analysis).\nOur primary analysis examined genetic associations with outcome trajectories over time, using a random coefficients longitudinal mixed model including all time points. Using longitudinal analyses, we examined the association of each SNP with executive function and behavioral adjustment recovery trajectories over time and the moderating effect of injury group (TBI vs. OI) on these associations (e.g., SNP\u2009\u00d7\u2009injury group\u2009\u00d7\u2009time interaction). Mixed models included random intercepts, slopes, and subjects. Random slopes were modeled over time. Our exploratory analysis used multiple linear models to examine genetic associations with cross-sectional outcomes in the short-term (6 months post-injury; 0.62\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08 years) and long-term (6.82\u2009\u00b1\u20091.12 years post-injury) phases of recovery, corresponding to the second and sixth study visits, respectively. We employed multiple linear models to examine the association of each SNP with short-term and long-term executive functioning and behavioral adjustment, and the moderating effect of injury group (TBI vs. OI) on these associations (e.g., SNP\u2009\u00d7\u2009injury group interaction). In all models, higher level interactions were examined first, followed by each lower level interaction if nonsignificant at a nominal (\np\n<\u20090.05) level. In all association tests, we used an additive genetic model in which major homozygotes were coded as 0, heterozygotes were coded as 1, and minor homozygotes were coded as 2.\nCovariates initially included and then trimmed if nonsignificant were the child's pre-injury functioning on the measure of interest and socioeconomic status (SES) (defined by averaging sample\nz\nscores for maternal education and median income).\n53\nContinental ancestry was covaried in all models, dichotomized as European versus African, to account for potential confounding related to race. Results were evaluated after correcting for multiple testing using a Bonferroni adjustment taking into account average pairwise LD correlation between all SNPs considered in the analyses (\nr\n=\u20090.16) as a way to correct for the number of independent tests.\n55\nThe results of the SNP times injury group interaction for each SNP are provided in Manhattan plots with both nominal (\np\n<\u20090.05) and multiple testing-adjusted (\np\n=\u20090.0027) significance thresholds indicated. For each interaction that was at least nominally significant, we plotted regression lines for each group by allele status to examine the direction of the interaction and identify the risk allele. When plotting the data, SNPs with <10 participants for minor allele homozygotes were combined with heterozygotes to ensure more robust estimates."

    "Methods": "Study design\nThis prospective, controlled cohort study enrolled a convenience sample of children and youth (birth\u201321 years of age) with blunt head trauma presenting to the ED within 6\u2009h of injury with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 9\u201315. Trauma control patients without head trauma were enrolled simultaneously from the ED within 6\u2009h of injury.\n\nStudy setting and population\nStudy sites included the EDs of three level 1 trauma centers: a pediatric level 1 trauma center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; a pediatric level 1 trauma center in Orlando, Florida; and an affiliated adult level 1 trauma center in Orlando, Florida. This study was approved by the respective institutional review boards of each institution. Informed consent was obtained from patients and/or their legal authorized representatives before enrollment, and assent was obtained for children between the ages of 7 and 18 years.\nEligibility for the study was determined by the treating physician based on the history of blunt head trauma presenting to the ED within 6\u2009h of injury with an initial GCS of 9\u201315. Eligibility was also prospectively verified by the research team before enrollment. Head trauma patients were categorized into children with and without TBI symptoms (loss of consciousness [LOC], amnesia, disorientation, or change in behavior) based on the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine definition.\n23\nHead CT scans were performed at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients were excluded if they: 1) had syncope or seizure preceding their head trauma; 2) had known chronic psychosis, neurological disorder, or active CNS pathology; 3) were pregnant; 4) were incarcerated; 5) had spinal cord injury; or 6) had hemodynamic instability.\nTrauma control patients included patients with GCS 15 presenting to the ED with a traumatic mechanism of injury that did not have blunt head trauma and had a normal mental status post-injury (as verified by the research team) and had no evidence of acute brain injury or hemodynamic instability. These patients were carefully screened to ensure they had no LOC, no amnesia, and no alteration in sensorium or behavior at any time post-injury. Mechanisms of injury included falls, motor vehicle collisions (MVCs), and sports injuries. Trauma controls were enrolled during the same period as head trauma patients. The purpose of including trauma controls was to examine biomarker levels in patients who were exposed to traumatic forces without direct blunt head trauma.\n\nStudy protocol\nAll initial patient assessments were made by emergency physicians board certified in either pediatric or adult emergency medicine and trained by a formal 1-h session on evaluating patient eligibility. At the time of enrollment, the study team carefully reassessed every patient to ensure each patient met inclusion and exclusion criteria. A single blood sample was obtained from each head trauma and non-head-injured trauma control shortly after arrival to the ED and within 6\u2009h of the reported time of injury. A blood sample of 2.5\u20135.0\u2009mL (based on weight) was placed in a serum separator tube and allowed to clot at room temperature before being centrifuged. Volume was based on recommendations of the National Institutes of Health pediatric TBI biospecimens and biomarkers workgroup.\n24\nSerum was placed in bar-coded aliquot containers and stored at \u221270\u00b0C until transport to a central laboratory, where samples were analyzed in batches using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for UCH-L1. Lab personnel conducting the ELISA assays were blinded to the clinical data.\nAfter assessment and treatment in the ED, patients were either discharged home or admitted to the hospital based on severity of their injuries and patient management was not altered by the study. Patients underwent a standard CT scan of the head according to the judgment of the treating physician. CT examinations were interpreted by board-certified radiologists who recorded location, extent, and type of brain injury. Radiologists were blinded to the study protocol, but had the usual clinical information. All physicians, investigators, and research personnel were blinded to the serum biomarker results.\n\nOutcome measurements\nThe primary outcome measure was the presence of intracranial lesions on initial CT scan. Only children who had actual CTs performed were included in this analysis; no surrogate measures were used. Intracranial lesions on CT included any acute traumatic intracranial lesions visualized on CT scan, as defined by any traumatic intracranial lesion including intracranial hemorrhage (epidural, subdural, or subarachnoid hemorrhage) or contusion, cerebral edema, diffuse axonal injury, midline shift of intracranial contents or signs of brain herniation, or pneumocephalus.\n6\nIsolated skull fractures were assessed separately given that the force required to injure the skull may be enough to release biomarkers into the circulation. The secondary outcome measure included the performance of the biomarkers in trauma controls (without head trauma) versus head trauma patients.\nEarlier biomarker studies of myelin basic protein, neuron-specific enolase, and S100\u03b2 in children have shown differential expression of these markers by age,\n25\nso we evaluated the performance UCH-L1 in children of different ages by subdividing them into blocks of 5 years: birth\u2013five years (early childhood); 5\u201310 years (late childhood); 10\u201315 years (early adolescence); and 15\u201321 years (late adolescence/early adulthood).\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics with means and proportions were used to describe the data. For statistical analysis, biomarker levels were treated as continuous data, measured in ng/mL and expressed as means (\u00b195% confidence interval [CI]). Data were assessed for equality of variance and distribution. Logarithmic transformations were conducted on non-normally distributed data. Group comparisons for different trauma groups were performed using analysis of variance with multiple comparisons using Games-Howell's post-hoc test. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were created to detect intracranial lesions on CT scan. Estimates of the area under these curves (AUCs) were obtained (AUC\u2009=\u20090.5 indicates no discrimination and an AUC\u2009=\u20091.0 indicates a perfect diagnostic test). UCH-L1 cutpoints were selected based on the ROC curve to maximize the sensitivity and correctly identify as many patients with CT lesions as possible. Performance was also assessed by sensitivity, specificity, and positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) with 95% CIs. All analyses were performed using the statistical software package, PASW (version 17.0; IBM Corporation\n\u00ae\n, Somers, NY).\n\nBiomarker analysis\nSerum UCH-L1 levels were measured in duplicate for each sample using a validated ELISA platform (Banyan Biomakers Inc., San Diego, CA). The lower limit of quantification for this assay is 0.100\u2009ng/mL and upper limit of quantification is 9\u2009ng/mL. The limit of detection is 0.045\u2009ng/mL. Any samples yielding a signal over the quantification or calibrator range were diluted and reassayed."

    "Methods": "As briefly mentioned above, the ADAPT trial is an observational CER study funded by a cooperative agreement with the United States National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS; U01 NS 081041).10This international study has recruitment sites in the U.S., United Kingdom, Spain, the Netherlands, India, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. All participating centers have obtained Institutional Human Research Review Board (IRB or equivalent) ethics approval for enrolling pediatric patients, and the University of Pittsburgh received IRB approval to coordinate the study. Importantly, all of the clinical sites have allowed data collection of standard therapies to be collected prior to informed consent, followed by obtaining informed consent for patient outcome assessments. Therefore, the cohort represents consecutive children meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria at the clinical sites. The ADAPT trial will recruit 1000 pediatric patients, and the first 200 enrolled (February 22, 2014-December 22, 2014) make up the cohort available for this analysis.\n\nThe full inclusion criteria for the study are: age 0\u201318 years, diagnosis of TBI, placement of an ICP monitor at the study site, and GCS score \u22648 at the time of monitor placement. Site personnel were instructed to utilize the version of the GCS score inTable 1for their assessment of the child's mental status. Children were deemed ineligible for enrollment if there was no documented GCS score recorded before ICP monitor insertion. Importantly, some children had GCS determinations early during the resuscitation procedures\u2014sometimes before endotracheal intubation and other procedures had been performed. On the other hand, other subjects had received sedatives or neuromuscular blocking agents prior to the GCS assessment, which may impact on the E-, V- or M-responses. Centers were instructed to give the most accurate score available to the research team. In some instances, this meant that sites enrolled children with GCS\u2009=\u20093 because the examination was hampered by sedatives, neuromuscular blockers, or both. The sole exclusion criterion was a diagnosis of pregnancy (done as part of the site's routine practices).\n\nFor this analysis, data derived from events that occurred prior to arrival at the study hospital were defined as the \u201cpre-hospital phase of care\u201d and those that occurred after arrival at the study hospital but prior to insertion of the ICP monitor were defined as the \u201cresuscitation phase of care.\u201d In addition to the GCS score at the time of ICP monitor insertion, other variables used in this analysis include: patient demographic characteristics (i.e., age, sex, race, primary language); injury details (i.e., cause, type, and mechanism of injury); severity of illness or injury-related scores (i.e., Pediatric Risk of Mortality [PRISM] III score,18Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS] score,19and Injury Severity Score [ISS]20); pre-hospital events and resuscitation events, including cardiac arrest, hypoxia, and hypotension among others; medications administered; and laboratory results. The definitions of all variables are provided in theSupplementary Table 1(see online supplementary material atwww.liebertpub.com). Coagulation tests were stratified, with prothrombin time (PT) >15\u2009sec and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) \u226532\u2009sec considered abnormal. The primary outcome for this analysis was death within 12 months of ICP monitor insertion and the cause of death was recorded.\n\nTripartite stratification of the GCS and data analysis\nIn this analysis, the GCS was stratified into three parts (tripartite) and patients were assigned to groups based on categories that have been identified in the literature (Group A, GCS score 3; Group B, GCS scores 4-5; Group C, GCS scores 6- 8).\n2\n,\n15\u201317\nIn a parallel analysis, children younger than 5 years of age also were stratified by GCS scores as previous manuscripts describing the utility of GCS score had excluded such children. The demographic and clinical characteristics of these three groups are reported as means and standard deviations for continuous variables and percentages for discrete variables. Analyses of variance were used to test the equality of the means across the groups for continuous variables and the chi-square test was used to compare percentages for discrete variables. When significant differences were identified (\np\n<\u20090.05),\npost hoc\npairwise comparisons were carried out (using\nt\n-test for continuous variables and chi-square for discrete variables) with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (i.e.,\np\n<\u20090.05/3\u2009=\np\n<\u20090.017). Of note, as these analyses were exploratory in nature and no adjustments for multiple tests were applied, results must be interpreted within this context.\nWhen test assumptions were not met, the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare between-group means and Fisher's exact test was used to compare the distributions of percentages. The non-parametric Mann-Whitney\nU\ntest was used for\npost hoc\ncomparisons of the three pairwise comparisons of GCS group (with a Bonferroni correction) when overall tests were significant. The association of GCS group with mortality after recruitment into the ADAPT trial was assessed with a Cox proportional hazards model. To control for confounding effects, a multi-variable Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the independent association of GCS group on risk of death. Covariates included in the model were those characteristics that were significantly imbalanced across the groups, with the exception of the neurological measures, which were excluded because of their collinearity with GCS (due to paralysis). Cox proportional hazards models and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) were used to investigate the fit of the model with using only the M-response, incorporating pupil reactivity with GCS, and incorporating cardiac arrest with GCS."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAdult male Sprague-Dawley rats (275\u2013300\u2009g) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Hartford, CT) and group-housed 2\u20133 per cage with access to standard rat chow and water\nad libitum\n. The room was maintained under a 12/12-h light/dark cycle (6:00\nam\n/6:00\npm\n) at a temperature of 25\u00b0C. Animals were divided into two groups: 1) uninjured laminectomy control (LAM;\nn\n=\u20095) and 2) cervical SCI (\nn\n=\u200910). All animals were allowed to acclimate to the facility and investigators for 5 days after arrival, followed by 1 week of acclimation to behavioral testing equipment. Baseline assessments were performed 1 week pre-injury. Previous data from our lab using this model suggest that at week 5 post-SCI, animals exhibit NP-like behaviors, including increased paw withdrawal responses to acetone and overgrooming. Thus, for this study, all assessments were performed at week 5 post-injury. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (Birmingham, AL).\n\nInduction of cervical level 5 hemicontusion spinal cord injury\nThe dominant paw of each animal was determined before surgery using the Paw Placement test. Animals received a hemicontusion at C5 on the side of the spinal cord ipsilateral to the dominant paw. In this model, the dominant side is injured to standardize the effect of use-dependent plasticity in functional recovery. The Infinite Horizon SCI Impactor device (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, Lexington, KY) was used, as previously described, to induce a severe hemicontusion SCI.\n9\nBriefly, each animal was anesthetized with 4% isoflurane (Piramal Critical Care, Bethlehem, PA) in oxygen for 4\u2009min and maintained on 2% isoflurane in oxygen for the duration of the procedure. Body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C throughout surgery with the use of a rectal thermometer and heating pad. The surgical site was shaved, aseptically prepared for surgery, and an incision was made from the C2 to T2 vertebrae. Muscles were retracted to reveal the vertebral column, and the underlying paravertebral muscles of C4\u2013C6 were removed. The lamina covering the C5 vertebrae was removed bilaterally and animal stabilized on the impactor with clamps on the dorsal processes of C2 and T2. The impactor tip (0.8\u2009mm in diameter) was aligned above the exposed dorsal aspect of the C5 spinal cord in order to cover the side ipsilateral to the dominant paw. A hemicontusion injury was delivered to all animals in the SCI group by the impactor device at a force of 300\u2009kdyn. Animals in the LAM control group received the full surgical procedure through the C5 bilateral laminectomy omitting the contusion injury. Subsequent to impact (SCI) or laminectomy, the musculature and skin were sutured in layers and animals remained in a heated recovery cage until ambulant. Immediately post-surgery and twice a day (\nam\nand\npm\n) for 5 days thereafter, animals received subcutaneous injections of sterile saline (3\u2009mL; Hospira Inc., Lake Forest, IL) and carprofen (5\u2009mg/kg; Rimadyl; Pfizer, New York, NY) as a fluid replacement and analgesic. Post-surgery and once a day (\nam\n) for 5 days thereafter, injections included enrofloxacin (2.5\u2009mg/kg; Baytril; Bayer HealthCare LLC, Shawnee Mission, KS) as a prophylactic antibiotic.\n\nAssessment of cold hypersensitivity\nHypersensitivity to cold was assessed by applying acetone to the hindpaw, which has been shown to elicit a significant increase in withdrawal responses after spinal cord contusion injuries in rats.\n10\n,\n14\n,\n15\nWe utilized methods previously described by Choi and colleagues,\n44\nwith slight adaptations. Animals were placed in a clear Plexiglas box (20\u2009\u00d7\u20099\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009cm) on an elevated platform with a wire mesh bottom to allow access to the plantar surface of the hindpaws. After a 5-min acclimation period, a single drop of acetone (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was produced at the end of a 1-mL syringe. Avoiding contact of the syringe with the paw, the acetone drop was applied to the plantar surface of the contralateral hindlimb 1\u2009cm posterior to the footpad of the third and fourth phalanges. There is a short time delay as acetone evaporates before eliciting the sensation of coolness\n44\n; therefore, a withdrawal response occurring within 20\u2009sec of application was recorded along with the time of withdrawal. Acetone application was performed using three trials for each animal with at least 5\u2009min between each trial. The average time in seconds to withdrawal of the three trials was used to determine withdrawal time. Importantly, for the comparison to the RGS, if the animal had a withdrawal response in any of the three trials, the animal was placed in the \u201cwithdrawal\u201d group for data analysis.\n\nAssessment of supraspinal pain\nSupraspinal sensation of pain was assessed using an adaptation of the RGS methodology from Sotocinal and colleagues.\n36\nFilming for the RGS was performed simultaneously with the acetone test using a high-speed digital camera (Exilim EX-F0; Casio America Inc., Dover, NJ). The animal was filmed in high definition at an operating speed of 60 frames per second with autofocus and backlight correction to produce images in which the animal's face (including nose/cheek, whiskers, eyes, and ears) were clearly visible. The animal's face was filmed 1\u2009min before the application of acetone, and this comprised the \u201cbefore\u201d acetone period and was used to assess spontaneous pain (i.e., before the application of the stimulus). Filming continued as acetone was applied and for 1\u2009min thereafter, which represented the \u201cafter\u201d acetone period and assessment of evoked pain (\nFig. 1\n). This was repeated three times during the testing session during each application of acetone. The camera was held by the investigator for the entirety of filming in order to maintain focus on the animal's face as the animal moved.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nRat Grimace Scale (RGS) data collection scheme. Recording began 1\u2009min before the application of acetone, representing the\nBefore Acetone Period\n. Acetone was applied and the withdrawal timer started. A withdrawal response within 10\u2009sec of application was recorded. Recording was continuous and ended 1\u2009min after acetone was applied. The minute after acetone comprised the\nAfter Acetone Period\n.\nTo prepare for scoring, one screen shot per second was extracted from the video recording for the 20\u2009sec before and 20\u2009sec after the application of acetone by an investigator na\u00efve to the experimental group. The screen shots for all three tests were given a unique coding number, combined into a PowerPoint (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) slide presentation, and randomized using a PowerPoint macro code. Two additional investigators na\u00efve to the screen shot code scored the animal's face on each PowerPoint slide (representing 1\u2009sec of the test) using the RGS. The scale consists of four action units (AUs): orbital tightening; nose and cheek flattening; ear position; and whisker position. Descriptions of each action unit during pain are provided in\nTable 1\n. Each AU received a \u201c0\u201d if signs of pain were absent, \u201c1\u201d if there were moderate signs present, and \u201c2\u201d if there were obvious signs of pain (\nFig. 2\n). If the AU was not clearly visible, it was labeled as \u201cnot assessable\u201d and excluded from further analysis. After scoring, the PowerPoint slide deck was derandomized and the scores for each AU were averaged for each slide. Slide scores were then averaged across three raters, decoded, and categorized into \u201cbefore\u201d acetone and \u201cafter\u201d acetone bins for analysis (\nFig. 3\n). This resulted in two average RGS scores for each animal: one represents the time period before and the other representing the time period after the stimulus. Evaluation of inter-rater reliability was conducted by having all scorers independently evaluate an identical set of eight slide decks from injured and uninjured animals not evaluated in the current study. The percentage agreement was calculated as 93%\u2009\u00b1\u200911%.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nRepresentative images and corresponding Rat Grimace Scale scores. A score of \u201c0\u201d indicated the absence of signs of pain, \u201c1\u201d indicated moderate signs of pain, and \u201c2\u201d indicated obvious signs of pain.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nRat Grimace Scale analysis procedure. After video capture, an investigator na\u00efve to the experimental groups captured screen shots from the digital recording. Another investigator na\u00efve to the experimental groups placed each screen shot onto a PowerPoint slide, gave each slide a unique coding number, and randomized the slides using a randomization matrix. Two investigators na\u00efve to the experimental groups scored each slide, and the scores were averaged. Derandomization was conducted by a separate investigator as was final data analysis. Thus, a minimum of four investigators were involved to maintain anonymity of experimental conditions (i.e., injury or control and before or after acetone).\nTable\n1.\nAction Units and Their Description During Pain Sensation\nRGS action units\nDescription during pain\nOrbital tightening\nThe area of the eye decreases from wide to squinted.\nNose and cheek flattening\nThe nose and cheek display a flatter and longer appearance.\nEar position\nEars appear curled or pointed and often appear spread out.\nWhisker position\nWhiskers appear tense and bunched together or angled down.\nOpen in a separate window\nRGS, Rat Grimace Scale.\n\nTissue preparation for histopathology\nOn day 35 post-SCI, animals were euthanized with 4% isoflurane (Piramal Critical Care, Bethlehem, PA) for 8\u2009min, then transcardially perfused with cold 0.1\u2009M of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) for 5\u2009min, followed by the fixative, Excell Plus (American Mastertech, Lodi, CA), for 20\u2009min. The epicenter was marked with tissue dye (Triangle Biomedical Sciences, Inc., Durham, NC), and the spinal cord from C2 to T2 was removed. Spinal cord tissue was post-fixed in Excell Plus for 24\u2009h at 4\u00b0C and cryoprotected with 10% sucrose/PBS for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C, followed by 30% sucrose for 48\u2009h. A 3-mm section was blocked from the epicenter and embedded into Tissue Tek\n\u00ae\noptimum cutting temperature compound (Scigen Scientific, Gardena, CA) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until sectioning. Serial 30-\u03bcm transverse sections were sliced using a cryostat (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and mounted onto 1% gelatin-coated slides for subsequent evaluation of spinal cord pathology. Tissue sections were collected, such that 10 sets of adjacent sections were obtained, resulting in a 300-\u03bcm intersection interval. From these 10 sets of similarly spaced serial sections, one set was randomly selected for histological assessment of pathology, as described below.\n\nCresyl violet histology\nTo visualize neurons in the gray matter and lesion volume, cresyl violet acetate (Sigma-Aldrich) histology was performed as previously described.\n9\nBriefly, tissue sections were dehydrated using increasing ethanol concentrations from 70% to 100%, followed by clearing with xylene, rehydrated in ethanol, and processed with 0.1% cresyl violet acetate for 5\u2009min. Tissue was rinsed with double-distilled water, followed by 95% ethanol with acetic acid for 2 minutes, dehydrated with alcohol, washed with xylene, and, finally, cover-slipped using Permount (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Walthan, MA) mounting medium.\n\nQuantification of dorsal and ventral horn neurons using stereology\nTissue sections were visualized on an Olympus IX-73 microscope with an Olympus DP-73 digital camera (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) using with Visiopharm newCAST\u2122 stereology software (Visiopharm, Broomfield, CO). The optical fractionator probe was used to estimate the total number of neurons in the dorsal and ventral horns at the lesion epicenter, as previously described.\n45\u201347\nBriefly, a separate contour of the ipsilateral dorsal horn and the ipsilateral ventral horn was traced, and a counting frame (60\u2009\u00d7\u200960\u2009\u03bcm\n2\n) was superimposed on the micrograph at a random location within each contour. The counting frame was then moved by the optical fractionator probe macro to nonoverlapping locations along the x- and y-axes. Neuronal cell counts were evaluated at 400\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification with the following inclusion criteria: 1) an ovoid, triangular, or multipolar cellular profile; 2) soma diameter greater than 10\u2009\u03bcm; and 3) an intact cell membrane with a clearly defined nucleus. Eight sections per animal were evaluated, for a total tissue sampling volume of approximately 2940\u2009\u03bcm\n3\n.\n\nQuantification of percentage of lesion area\nLesion area at the epicenter was determined using an Olympus IX-73 microscope attached to an Olympus DP-73 digital camera with Visiopharm newCAST\u2122 stereology software. Lesion area was obtained at 40\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification by placing a contour around the entire spinal cord and second contour around the injured area, including both gray and white matter. The percentage of the lesioned area was calculated for each section by taking the value of the injured area / total spinal cord area\u2009\u00d7\u2009100. Eight sections per animal were evaluated, for a total tissue sampling volume of approximately 2940\u2009\u03bcm.\n3\nGiven that the injury is a hemicontusion, the percentage lesion area is always less than 50%.\n\nStatistical analyses\nAll data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 7 Statistical Software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) with significance set at a\np\nvalue of\np\n\u2264\u20090.05. All data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean. Pre- and post-injury differences in RGS scores were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance, followed by Holm-Sidak post-hoc analysis. Differences in RGS score between trials with and without a withdraw response were analyzed using Student's\nt\n-test."

Eligible patients were those with an initial Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 9-15 (defined as mmTBI ) for whom an emergency head CT scan was obtained for evaluation of head injury as deemed necessary by the attending ED physician. All sites were aware of and considered available clinical decision rules to guide the need for imaging; however, no formal rules for obtaining a CT were utilized so as to best reflect current practice in the U.S. and Europe.\nTable\n1.\nDescription of Study Site Hospitals\nStudy site\nLocation\nAnnual ED volume\nDesignation\nWashington University, Barnes-Jewish Hospital\nSt. Louis, MO\n95,000\nLevel I\nUniversity of Florida, Shands Hospital\nGainesville, FL\n66,000\nLevel I\nGwinnett Medical Center - Lawrenceville\nAtlanta, GA\n100,000\nLevel II\nDekalb Medical - North Decatur\nAtlanta, GA\n92,000\nNon-trauma\nWayne State - Detroit Receiving Hospital\nDetroit, MI\n90,000\nLevel I\nUniversity of P\u00e9cs Medical Center\nPecs, Hungary\n25000\n\u03a9\nLevel 1\n*\nAlbert Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi Medical Center - University of Szeged\nSzeged, Hungary\n90,000\nLevel 1\n*\nOpen in a separate window\n\u03a9\nThe ED volume is >25,000/year, and the facility cares for more than 2000 neurotrauma cases/year.\n*\nThis is equivalent to a Level I facility in the United States.\nED, emergency department.\nIncluded patients presented within 4\u2009h of injury, received a CT scan as part of routine care, and had the first blood sample obtained for analysis within 6\u2009h of injury.

This was used to describe the study patient's general characteristics and injury patterns.\n\nSerum sample and handling\nBlood samples were collected at time of study enrollment and every 6\u2009h up to the time of discharge (either ED or hospital) or up to 24\u2009h (maximum of five samples during index visit). Patients were evaluated at follow up (Day 35\u2009\u00b1\u20095 days) for neuropsychological testing and to obtain another blood sample. The neuropsychological testing was not part of this study's outcome assessment and blood samples were rarely obtained and therefore were not included in the analysis and are not reported here. Blood samples were processed and the resulting serum was stored at \u221280\u00b0C and then shipped on dry ice to a central repository for storage until time of testing as per a pre-defined specimen handling procedure.\n\nSerum analysis for GFAP, UCH-L1, and S100B\nSerum samples were analyzed for UCH-L1 and GFAP concentration by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at a later time by technicians blinded to clinical data and CT results. Samples were run in triplicate and the mean used to determine the final concentration. If one replicate was more than 4 standard deviations different from the mean of the other two replicates, the mean concentration was determined using just the two replicates. Duplicate and high and low positive controls were included with each plate. Details of the assay procedure can be found elsewhere.\n18\nUCH-L1 and GFAP tests were performed by Banyan Biomarker, Inc. S100B concentrations were determined using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay designed for\nin vitro\ndiagnostic testing (Roche, Cobas 6000). Results for S100B are reported in \u03bcg/L with the standard normal reference intervals of 0.00-0.09\u2009\u03bcg/L. Although various cut-off values have been proposed, for the purposes of this study an S100B \u2265 0.10\u2009\u03bcg/L (100\u2009pg/mL) was considered to be abnormal and could indicate a traumatic abnormality on head CT.\n21\n,\n22\nS100B samples were tested at Halland's Hospital Halmsead, Department of Clinical Chemistry, Halmstead, Sweden.\nThe lower limit of quantification (LLQ) for both UCH-L1 and GFAP was 30\u2009pg/mL (none provided for S100B), and the lower limit of detection (LLD) for UCH-L1, GFAP, and S100B was 10\u2009pg/mL, 20\u2009pg/mL, and 5\u2009pg/mL, respectively.\nTable 3\nsummarizes these values and the intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation for each study serum biomarker. For this analysis, serum concentrations above the LLD but less than or equal to the LLQ were assigned the LLQ value (30\u2009pg/mL for GFAP and UCH-L1; no LLQ provided for S100B). Serum concentrations at or below the LLD were assigned the value of the LLD (5\u2009pg/mL for S100B, 10\u2009pg/mL for UCH-L1, and 20\u2009pg/mL for GFAP). There is no clear standard or ideal method used to analyze values below the LLD (left-truncated values). Some advocate eliminating those values, others suggest imputing values, using a fraction of the LLD, a reverse Kaplan-Meier Estimator, or other techniques to determine a final value.\n23\u201326\nFor this analysis, we chose not to eliminate the values, use a fraction of the value, or use an imputation method, but rather chose to \u201cround-up\u201d for a variety of reasons. The very low values at the LOD and LLQ would not impact our results given the larger variation and it was thought to be a more conservative approach when considering a change over time (less change from baseline if values rise since we were not interested in small non-clinically useful but statistically significant changes). Assay results were not available to the treating clinician and were not used to guide treatment. For this main analysis, we considered results for all samples collected within 24\u2009h after injury.\nTable\n3.\nAnalytical Performances of Each Biomarker\nBiomarker\nS100B\nUCH-L1\nGFAP\nLimit of detection, pg/mL\n5\n10\n20\nLower limit of quantification, pg/mL\nN/A\n30\n30\nIntra-assay coefficient of variation, %\n2.1\n4.5\n3.7\nInter-assay coefficient of variation, %\n2.8\n4.6\n5.8\nOpen in a separate window\nUCH-L1, ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase-L1; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; N/A, not available.\n\nHead CT scans\nEach subject's head CT images were reviewed by an independent committee consisting of three blinded board-certified neuro-radiologists. The neuro-radiologists determined whether a CT scan was positive, defined as the presence of an acute trauma-related intracranial lesion. A charter outlining the criteria and procedures to be followed for scoring the CT scans was developed prior to the reading and interpretation of any of the CT images. Two of the neuro-radiologists, who had no access to any other clinical or laboratory data except subject age and gender, reviewed all of the study subjects' CT scans. Any discrepancy with respect to CT-positive or CT-negative was adjudicated by a third blinded radiologist and in those instances, was the final interpretation. Inter-rater reliability between the two primary radiologists was determined using Cohen's kappa statistic.\n\nOutcomes\nFor this study, the primary clinical outcome was the result of the head CT scan (positive/negative) among patients with repeated blood samples drawn over 24\u2009h post-injury. The main outcomes of interest, however, were the change in the three biomarkers' values over time among CT-positive and CT-negative patients.\n\nData analysis and reporting\nA descriptive analysis for all subjects was performed. Patient groups (CT positive and CT negative) were compared using proportions and means or medians where appropriate. For selected binomial proportions, the exact (Clopper-Pearson) 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were provided. To compare biomarker values between CT-negative and CT-positive patients, the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used.\nIndividual graphical displays of the three biomarkers' serum concentration over time were constructed\u2014one for the patient's individual trend overlaid with a locally weighted scatter plot smoothing (LOESS) plots (with 95% confidence limits) and another scatter plot that showed biomarker concentrations at various time-points obtained post-injury (also overlaid with LOESS plots). This was done to conceptualize the crude kinetics of each biomarker and provide a starting reference for model development.\nFor this study, the main interest was association of the CT results (positive or negative) with the change in each serum biomarker's concentrations measured up to 24\u2009h post injury (CT*Time interaction) that was in addition to (independent of) other important clinical factors. Since it was likely that study subjects would have different initial biomarker concentrations (the baseline starting point or intercept), different biomarker kinetics over time (slope) and potentially correlated data due to the multiple samples obtained, mixed linear models with random effects (intercept and slope) were used for each of the three biomarkers. Given the distribution of biomarker values and model diagnostics, a natural log transformation of the biomarkers' values were utilized (lognormal distribution in SAS PROC GLIMMIX). Based on prior information and potentially theoretical importance, gender and presenting GCS score were mandatorily included in each model. Other factors considered for inclusion were age, race, LOC, and mechanism of injury. The Log Likelihood ratio and Bayesian information criterion tests were used to determine if non-mandatory variables should be included in the model and the optimal covariance matrix for the random effects.\nTwo sensitivity analyses were performed to examine results for consistency. Since there is no consensus on how to handle serum biomarker values below the LLQ and the LOD, the same models were fit using the actual reported values, even when below the detection limits. Some values were reported as 0\u2009pg/mL and these were re-coded to 1\u2009pg/mL so that those values could be log transformed for the models. Since it was likely that patients with a GCS <15 would be imaged regardless of the initial biomarker concentration (at least in the U.S.), we performed the main analysis again but included only patients with an initial GCS\u2009=\u200915. For all model results, we reported the parameter estimates for the transformed values with 95% CI. For the main results, we also back-transformed the parameter estimate values and provide the interpreted percent increase of each biomarker for the variable in the main models.\nFinally, we calculated the sensitivity and specificity for each biomarker at various biomarker values using logistic regression and plotted the areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUROCs) at 6-h intervals (0-6\u2009h, 6-12\u2009h, 12-18\u2009h, and 18-24\u2009h) to determine diagnostic characteristics at these various time intervals; however, one should note that this is only exploratory and the derived AUROC cannot be considered definitive. A\np\nvalue of less than 0.05 was considered significant. All data were analyzed using SAS version 9.4 (Carey, NC) and published guidelines for statistical reporting were adhered to.\n27"

    "Methods": "Participants\nTwenty-seven patients with sTBI (29.3\u2009\u00b1\u20098.9, 21M:6F) were recruited prospectively from the R Adam Cowley Shock Trauma Center at the University of Maryland Medical Center. All participants were over the age of 18. Patients were screened and excluded for history of neurological and psychiatric illness, stroke, brain tumors, or seizures, and contraindications to MR. This population includes patients with a diagnosis of moderate or severe TBI based on an admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3\u201312 and mechanism of injury consistent with trauma. Twenty-seven neurologically intact participants (29.8\u2009\u00b1\u200910.3 years, 16M:11F) served as the control population. Participant demographic information is shown in\nTable 1\n.

A subset of the sTBI patients (\nn\n=\u200919, 31.0\u2009\u00b1\u20099.0 years) and control participants (\nn\n=\u200922, 30.8\u2009\u00b1\u200911.2 years) also received a DKI scan during this visit (\nTable 1\n).\n\nNeuropsychological assessment\nPatients underwent neuropsychological assessment during this visit. The level of cognitive functioning was assessed by the administration of the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) at each visit. Patient outcome was assessed by the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE)\n16\nat the chronic stage of injury.\nIn addition, participants completed the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) battery, which consists of seven subtests assessing processing speed, memory, and attention. Two sTBI participants and two control participants refused participation in the ANAM, resulting in 25 patients with sTBI and 25 control participants included in this behavioral analysis. The specific subtests included in the ANAM battery are the code substitution (CS), code substitution delayed (CSD), match to sample (MTS), math processing (MATH), procedural reaction time (PRT), simple reaction time (SRT), simple reaction time repeat (SRT2).\n17\nFrom each subtest, an individual throughput score was calculated providing a single measure encompassing both accuracy and reaction time. Specifically, the throughput score is the number of correct responses per total amount of time a participant took to respond for each trial, expressed as the number of correct responses per minute.\n18\nWe opted to examine a weighted throughput score (WT-TH), which has previously been referred to as an Index of Cognitive Efficiency.\n19\nThe WT-TH was determined as an overall measure of performance on the ANAM and is given as:\n\nMR data acquisition\nImaging was performed on a 3T Siemens Tim Trio Scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions; Erlangen, Germany) using a 12-channel receiver only head coil. A high resolution T1-MPRAGE (echo time [TE]\u2009=\u20093.44\u2009msec, repetition time [TR]\u2009=\u20092250\u2009msec, inversion time [TI]\u2009=\u2009900\u2009msec, flip angle\u2009=\u20099 degrees, resolution\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u200996, field of view [FOV]\u2009=\u2009220\u2009mm, sl. thick.\u2009=\u20091.5\u2009mm) was acquired for anatomic reference. For the rsfMRI scan, T2*-weighted images were acquired using a single-shot echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence (TE\u2009=\u200930\u2009ms, TR\u2009=\u20092000\u2009ms, FOV\u2009=\u2009230\u2009mm, resolution\u2009=\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200964) with 36 axial slices (sl. thick.\u2009=\u20094\u2009mm) over 5\u2009min 42\u2009sec that yielded 171 volumes. Before the acquisition of the resting state scan, participants were verbally instructed to rest peacefully with their eyes closed.\nFor the DKI acquisition, diffusion-weighted images were acquired with a twice refocused single shot, spin-echo EPI sequence. Thirty diffusion directions with two b-values (1000, 2000\u2009sec/mm\n2\n), along with 4 b\n0\nimages and two repetitions were acquired. Parallel imaging was used with an acceleration factor of two at a TE/TR\u2009=\u2009101\u2009msec/6000\u2009msec. The in-plane resolution was 2.7\u2009mm\n2\n, with a 7/8 partial Fourier factor, at a slice thickness of 2.7\u2009mm to cover the whole brain. The total image acquisition time was about 13\u2009min.\n\nrsfMRI data analysis\nData from two control participants were excluded from the resting state analysis results in a total of 25 control participants and 27 sTBI patients in this resting state analysis. Preprocessing of the imaging data was performed using SPM 8 (\nhttp://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm\n) and included motion correction of the time series, slice timing correction, band pass filtering (.009Hz\u2009<\u2009f\u2009<\u2009.08Hz), and registration of all the 171 volumes to the first volume of the time series. The resting state data were then registered to the individual's T1-MPRAGE images, spatially normalized to standard space using the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template available in SPM 8, and resampled to a spatial resolution of 2.0\u2009mm isotropic. Spatial smoothing was applied to the resting state data using a 5\u2009mm Gaussian kernel. Individual T1-MPRAGE images in MNI space were segmented into white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). The mean Bold Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) time series extracted from the WM and CSF masks as well as the six motion correction parameters were included in the model as regressors to remove the variance related to non-neuronal contributions and motion.\nSeed based functional connectivity (FC) analysis was performed using the CONN-fMRI Functional Connectivity toolbox v13.h (\nhttp://www.nitrc.org/projects/conn\n). The IPS was divided into four bilateral regions using 5\u2009mm spherical regions of interest (ROIs) placed along the length of the IPS (\nFig. 1\n).\n6\nFor each ROI (IPS1, IPS2, IPS3, IPS4), the mean BOLD time series was extracted and correlated with the time series of each voxel within the entire brain. Correlations were converted to normalized z-scores within the CONN-fMRI Functional Connectivity toolbox (\nhttp://www.nitrc.org/projects/conn\n) before further analysis.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nVisualization of the four intraparietal sulcus (IPS) regions of interest (ROIs) based on Bray and colleagues.\n20\nThe ROIs are overlaid on the Montreal Neurological Institute template. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nWithin group rs-FC maps of the four IPS ROIs were created using SPM8. Positive FC maps were thresholded at a voxel-wise\np\nvalue of 0.001 (uncorrected) and cluster extent threshold of\np\nvalue of 0.05 using a false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons. Individual maps were made for the control group and the sTBI group. In addition, between group contrast maps were created and were thresholded at voxel-wise\np\nvalue of 0.025 (uncorrected) and cluster extent threshold\np\nvalue of 0.05 using a FDR correction for multiple comparisons.\n\nDKI data analysis\nDiffusion weighted images were motion and eddy current corrected using SPM8 co-registration. Three dimensional Gaussian smoothing with full width at half maximum (FWHM)\u2009=\u20093.0\u2009mm was applied to improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR). The DKI reconstruction was performed using in-house MATLAB program with constrained linear least squares fitting\n20\n(for a more complete discussion of DKI processing, please see Stokum and associates\n21\n). The DKI processing resulted in maps of various diffusion parameters including mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean kurtosis (MK). Voxel-wise statistical analysis of DKI data was performed using Tract Based Statistics (TBSS).\n22\nThe FA, MD, and MK data were projected onto a mean FA tract skeleton, before applying voxel-wise cross-subject statistics (\np\n<\u20090.01 corrected). To investigate the association between altered diffusion parameters and cognitive performance, whole brain skeletons of MD, FA, and MK were correlated voxel-wise to the ANAM WT-TH scores for both TBI patients and control group while adjusting for age using General Linear Model and the Randomise command within FSL.\n23\nMultiple comparisons were corrected by TFCE (Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement).\nThe ROI analysis was performed for the right and left superior longitudinal fasciculi (SLF), the main WM tract connecting the IPS to the frontal lobe based attention networks. The ROIs were created based on the overlap of the Johns Hopkins University WM atlas\n24\nand the mean FA tract skeleton from the TBSS results. For each participant, the average WM FA, MD, and MK were extracted separately from the right and left SLF ROIs.\n\nStatistical analysis\nGroup differences in demographic data between the sTBI and controls groups were determined using\nt\n-tests for age and years of education. Differences in sex between the two groups were determined using a chi-square test. Given the likely influence of age and level of education on cognitive performance, differences in neuropsychological assessments were determined using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) including age and years of education as covariates. Because previous work has suggested that age has a large impact on structural and functional connectivity, group differences in imaging measures (rs fMRI and DKI) were determined using an ANCOVA including age as a covariate. Potential associations between imaging measures and neuropsychological assessments were investigated using the Pearson partial correlations considering age as a covariate."

Tissue was harvested from rats on PID4, and brains were dissected for synaptoneurosome immunoblotting of NMDAR (NR1, NR2A, andNR2B) and AMPAR (GluR1 and GluR2) subunits.\nExperiment 2 included four groups: Sham-Sal (\nn\n=\u200915), Sham-DCS (\nn\n=\u20099), FPI-Sal (\nn\n=\u200915), and FPI-DCS (\nn\n=\u20099). DCS treated groups were administered 30\u2009mg/kg (i.p.) per dose. On PID4, animals were tested on the NOR task using a 1\u2009h retention interval.\nIn Experiment 3, rat pups were weaned and differentially housed in standard (STD) or EE conditions for 17 days after 24\u2009h of recovery post-surgery. They were returned to standard vivarium housing until behavioral testing using the MWM task, which began on PID30. Experiment 3 consisted of eight groups: Sham-STD-Sal (\nn\n=\u20099), Sham-STD-DCS (\nn\n=\u20098), FPI-STD-Sal (\nn\n=\u20098), FPI-STD-DCS (\nn\n=\u20098), Sham-EE-Sal (\nn\n=\u200911), Sham-EE-DCS (\nn\n=\u200910), FPI-EE-Sal (\nn\n=\u20099), and FPI-EE-DCS (\nn\n=\u200910). DCS treated groups were also administered 30\u2009mg/kg (i.p.) per dose.\n\nFPI\nWe followed our standard lateral FPI protocol previously described in detail.\n19\nIn brief, following general anesthesia induction using 3% isoflurane (1.0\u20131.5\u2009mL/min in 100% O\n2\n) in a chamber, 1.5\u20132.5% isoflurane was maintained via a nose cone in spontaneously respiring P19 rat pups. Body temperature was kept constant (37\u201338\u00b0C) by a thermostatically controlled heating pad. Following aseptic surgical preparation, the head was secured in a stereotaxic frame, and a midline skin incision was made to expose the skull. A 3.0\u2009mm diameter craniotomy was made 3.0\u2009mm posterior to bregma and 6.0\u2009mm lateral (left) of midline. The injury cap was secured over the craniotomy with silicone, and dental cement and was later filled with 0.9% saline.\nOnce the injury cap was secured, anesthesia was discontinued and the animal was attached to the fluid percussion device. When the animal exhibited a hindpaw withdrawal reflex initiated by a toe pinch, a moderate fluid pulse (\u223c2\u2009atm) was delivered. Apnea time was determined by the resumption of spontaneous respiration and loss of consciousness (LOC) time by the return of the hindpaw withdrawal reflex. Positive pressure ventilation was administered through the mask with 100% O\n2\nif the animal remained apneic for at least 30\u2009sec until spontaneous respiration returns. Upon return of the hindpaw withdrawal reflex, the animal was placed back under anesthesia for the removal of the injury cap and the cleaning and closure of the surgical wound. Intradermal injections of 0.25% bupivacaine and topical antibiotic ointment were administered at the surgical site. The animal was then removed from anesthesia and placed in a heated recovery chamber. Sham animals underwent identical surgical procedures, but without the attachment of the injury cap or fluid pulse induction.\n\nEE\nUsed in Experiment 3, the EE chamber consisted of various toys, tunnels, and ladders placed in a two level cage measuring 78\u2009\u00d7\u200936\u2009\u00d7\u200948\u2009cm. Between 14 and 16 animals were housed together in the chamber at a time for 17 days and were then returned to standard vivarium conditions until the start of the MWM training on P50. A total of three EE batches were formed to achieve balanced groups. Every day the animals were removed from the EE cage and returned after the toys and objects were changed and rearranged. A light\u2013dark cycle of 12\u2009h was maintained, and food and water were available\nad libitum\n.\n\nDrugs\nDCS was obtained from Sigma Aldrich (Boston, MA). DCS was mixed in sterile 0.9% saline with a constant injection volume of 0.25\u2009mL/kg. DCS was stored at \u221220\u00b0C. DCS was thawed 15\u2009min prior to each injection time.\n\nTissue processing and Western blotting\nExperiment 1 animals were euthanized on PID4. The brains were removed and sectioned into four 1\u2009mm thick slabs, and dissected on ice into regions of interest. Hippocampal regions ipsilateral and contralateral to the injury site were isolated and homogenized in buffer (0.137\u2009M NaCl, 2.7\u2009mM KCl, 0.44\u2009mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 4.2\u2009mM NaHCO\n3\n, 10\u2009mM HEPES, 10\u2009mM glucose, pH 7.4) with protease inhibitors (Complete\n\u2122\n, Roche, Germany). The homogenate was loaded into a 1\u2009mL syringe attached to a 13\u2009mm diameter Millipore syringe filter holder and forced through one 100\u2009\u03bcm nylon filter and then again through two 5\u2009\u03bcm nitrocellulose filters. The filtered samples were centrifuged at 1000\ng\nfor 20\u2009min, followed by 1000\ng\nfor 10\u2009min. The resulting pellet was re-suspended in 150\u2009\u03bcL homogenization buffer with protease inhibitors and stored at \u221270\u00b0C.\n39\nProtein concentrations of synaptoneurosome fractions were determined using the Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay. Protein (10\u201320\u2009\u03bcg) was prepared in Laemmli sample buffer, electrophoresed on 7.5 and 10% pre-cast Tris-HCl gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Total protein was then quantified using Sypro\n\u00ae\nRuby Protein Blot Stain for normalization. Membranes were subsequently blocked in 5% milk in tris-buffered saline with tween20 (TBST) for 1\u2009h at room temperature and probed overnight with 1:1000 anti-NR1, NR2A, NR2B, GluR1, and GluR2 (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Membranes were incubated in horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA) and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents (Cell Signaling, Boston, MA). Membranes were imaged with Bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS system and analyzed using Quantity One\n\u00ae\nsoftware.\nRaw subunit density signal was controlled to total protein from the same lane on the same blot. Protein-controlled subunit values from each individual sample were normalized to the average of the Sham-Sal group. Protein levels are presented as mean percent change from Sham-Sal (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean [SEM]).\n\nNOR task\nThe NOR task has been previously shown to measure hippocampal-, NMDA-mediated working memory.\n35\u201338\nThe testing chamber was a white, Plexiglas arena (32\u2009\u00d7\u200952\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u2009cm) that approximated the size of the home cage, which was optimal for weanling rats.\n40\nTesting objects were similar in form and color, yet discernibly different. The arena and objects were wiped down with 70% ethanol between subjects. The NOR task consisted of a familiarization phase followed by a testing phase.\nFamiliarization phase\nAnimals were allowed to freely explore the testing chamber without objects for 5\u2009min per session. One session per day was administered on PID2 and PID3.\nTesting phase\nThe testing phase took place on PID4 and consisted of a 1) habituation trial, followed by a 2) test trial 1\u2009h later. During the habituation trial, the animal was placed in the testing chamber for 5\u2009min with two identical objects. A digital tracking system (SMART, San Diego Instruments) was used to measure the animal's locomotion and interaction with the objects. Interaction was defined as direct object contact with at least the nose or whiskers. The test trial was administered the same way as the habituation trial, but used one object from the habituation trial and one novel object. Positions of the novel and familiar objects were counterbalanced in the chamber.\n\nMWM training\nAcquisition training\nExperiment 3 animals began the MWM acquisition training 30 days after surgery. Animals were trained for 10 consecutive days. The MWM was a blue circular tank (1.5\u2009m in diameter, 0.6\u2009m in height) filled with water maintained between 18\u00b0 and 20\u00b0C. Each animal underwent two blocks of training per day (28\u2009min between blocks). Each block consisted of four trials wherein the animal was released from the four cardinal directions (north-N, south-S, east-E, and west-W) in random order. For each trial, the animal was given 45\u2009sec to locate the hidden platform, and was guided to the platform if the time elapsed. A 15\u2009\u00d7\u200915\u2009cm platform submerged 2\u2009cm below water level was placed in the SW quadrant of the tank. The animal remained on the platform for 60\u2009sec in between trials. The time it took the animal to reach the platform (latency) was recorded. The swim paths and velocity were also recorded using a digital tracking system (SMART, San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA).\nThe goal was to discover whether EE rearing, injury, or drug treatment were important predictors for reduced latency in MWM acquisition. Additionally, a \u201ctrials to criterion\u201d and the slope of learning were also determined to measure learning of the MWM task. The trials to criterion, the mastery of learning the MWM task, was the number of trials achieved to reach the hidden platform in \u22645\u2009sec in one block (four consecutive trials). The learning curve was determined from the slope of the linear regression of the mean latencies between the first block and the block when the animal reached the trials to criterion.\nProbe trial\nRetention of the hidden platform location was tested 7 days later. The hidden platform was removed and each animal was released at the center of the tank facing N for a single 60\u2009sec trial. Animals that were able to recall the learned location of the platform were expected to spend a greater amount of time swimming in the quadrant that had contained the platform. Swim path and velocity were also quantified. The first 15\u2009sec of the probe trial were used for analysis of recall. It has been shown that the animal has peak activity within the first 15\u2009sec in the MWM probe trial.\n41\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data are expressed as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed on the injury characteristic parameters (apnea and LOC) with the PID0 weight as a covariate within and across experiments. Post-hoc comparisons were Bonferroni adjusted. For all analyses,\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered significant.\nImmunoblotting analysis\nAll statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 16. Multivariate analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were implemented, with injury and drug as independent variables and hippocampal Western blot signal and general open field behavior as dependent variables. Post-hoc tests were Bonferroni adjusted comparisons.\nNOR performance analysis\nData from the first 3\u2009min were analyzed for percent object interaction with the novel object (time spent with novel object divided by total object interaction time\u2009\u00d7\u2009100%). Subject speed and total distance traveled in the chamber were also measured. The subject speed was computed only when the animal was in motion. Object recognition was defined as an interaction rate with the familiar object that was significantly greater than chance performance. An animal that did not recognize the object from the habituation trial was expected to split its object interaction time 50:50 between the novel and familiar object at testing. Therefore the percentage of total object interaction time spent with the novel object was tested against chance performance (50%) for each group using one sample\nt\ntests. Remembrance occurs when the percent time spent with the novel object is significantly higher (\np\n<\u20090.05) than chance performance.\nMWM test analysis\nLatencies to reach the platform were analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model fit by restricted maximum likelihood in R.\n42\nMWM acquisition (trials to criterion and slope of learning) and probe trial parameters (number of target zone entries) were analyzed using multivariate ANOVA with injury (Sham or FPI), housing (STD or EE), and drug (Sal or DCS) as between-subject factors. Post-hoc comparisons were Bonferroni adjusted. For all analyses,\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nAdult male Sprague-Dawley rats (100\u2013120 days old) were obtained from Envigo (Houston, TX) and acclimated to handling and the open enclosures used for locomotor assessment for at least 7 days prior to experimentation. Prior to contusion, subjects were pair housed with water and food\nad libitum\nand maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle. Behavioral testing and surgeries were performed during the light portion of the cycle. All experiments were carried out in accordance with National Institutes of Health (NIH) standards for the care and use of laboratory animals (NIH publication No. 80-23), and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Texas A&M University. Every effort was made to minimize suffering and limit the number of animals used to that which was scientifically necessary.\n\nSurgery\nAll subjects received a moderate contusion injury at the T10-11 vertebral level using the MASCIS device.\n13\nAnesthesia was induced using a mixture of 5% isoflurane in medical oxygen and maintained at a concentration of 2\u20133% during surgery. Two longitudinal incisions were made on either side of the vertebral column extending approximately 2\u2009cm rostral and caudal to the injury site. The T10-11 vertebrae were located by palpation and exposed, and a laminectomy was performed. The dura remained intact. The MASCIS device was then secured around the vertebral column and the 10-g impactor was centered on the lesion site. The drop height was set at 12.5\u2009mm. After surgery, the wound was closed using Michel clips. To prevent urinary tract infection and to compensate for fluid loss, subjects received 100,000 units/kg of penicillin and 3\u2009mL of saline after surgery.\nAfter surgery, subjects were singly housed and allowed to recover overnight (18\u201324\u2009h) in a temperature-controlled room (25\u00b0C) with water and food\nad libitum.\nSubjects were transferred back to standard single housing on the first day after injury.\n\nNociceptive stimulation\nSubjects were loosely restrained in opaque Plexiglas tubes and placed in an acoustic isolation chamber. An electrode was applied to the tail with electrode gel. Shocks were administered on a variable spaced schedule (0.2\u20133.8\u2009sec interstimulus interval [ISI]). Shock intensity was set to 1.5\u2009mA and shock duration was 100\u2009msec. Subjects in groups treated with electrical stimulation received 180 shocks administered over approximately 6\u2009min. This shock schedule and mode of application has been shown to impact spinal cord plasticity, behavioral recovery, and tissue sparing.\n1\n,\n2\n,\n4\n,\n5\n,\n7\nControls were loosely restrained in the Plexiglas tubes for an equivalent duration, but no shocks were administered.\n\nDrug treatment\nMorphine was administered using a dose and injection protocol that has been previously shown to induce a robust anti-nociception that blocks spinal and brain-dependent responses to noxious stimulation.\n7\nMorphine sulfate was dissolved in sterile normal saline and administered by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection at a dose of 20\u2009mg/kg. Drug was administered 30\u2009min prior to shock treatment.\nBecause systemic lidocaine treatment would be toxic at a dose that would impact spinal neurons and because we sought to impact spinal function using a clinically approved procedure, lidocaine was administered by means of a lumbar puncture. To minimize movement and stress during drug infusion, subjects were anesthetized with isoflurane at a concentration of 2\u20133% in medical oxygen. While in a flaccid state, the rat was supported on the edge of a surgical table so that the hindquarters hung freely, which increased the separation between the vertebrae along the dorsal surface. After palpation of the fifth lumbar (L5) vertebrae, a 1-inch, 25-gauge needle was inserted just caudal to the vertebra until the injection flowed with no resistance. Twenty-five \u03bcL of 15% lidocaine in normal saline was slowly infused into the space between the L5 and L6 vertebrae.\n14\nComplete spinal block was verified by lack of behavioral response to tail pinch.\n\nBehavioral verification of drug effectiveness\nContused rats (\nN\n=\u200918) that had exhibited some locomotor function prior to lidocaine treatment appeared totally paralyzed after drug administration. As with morphine, none (0 out of 9) of the subjects treated with lidocaine exhibited a spinal (e.g., tail withdrawal) or brain-dependent (e.g., vocalization) response to noxious stimulation. In contrast, all of the vehicle-treated rats exhibited a behavioral response (9/9). As expected, subjects did not exhibit a tail-withdrawal or vocalization in the absence of stimulation (0/18). A chi-square test revealed a statistically significant increase in motor and vocal reactivity thresholds in subjects that received electrical stimulation and vehicle treatment (\u03c7\n2\n=\u200927.00,\np\n<\u20090.05).\n\nAssessment of recovery\nHealth checks were performed daily throughout the recovery period. Subjects were examined for signs of self-mutilation, stress, and infection. Weight was assessed daily as a measure of general health. Bladders were expressed manually twice per day until voluntary control was established (six consecutive expressions with no urine).\nLocomotor function was assessed every day following injury for the first week and again on Day 10. From Day 14 to 42, behavioral function was assessed weekly. A blinded observer used the commonly used Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) scoring system to examine locomotor function.\n15\nBBB scores were converted as recommended by Ferguson and colleagues, yielding scores that are more amenable to parametric analyses.\n16\nIn subjects that had regained stepping behavior (raw BBB score \u22659), the beam and ladder tests were used to better characterize locomotor function. Beam width at first misstep, number of ladder missteps, and number of ladder slips were recorded for each subject.\n7\nTactile and thermal reactivity were assessed using von Frey filament testing and tail flick, respectively. A blinded observer examined mechanical threshold using the up-down method with von Frey filaments.\n17\nThe tail flick test was conducted using the IITC tail flick device (Envigo) as a measure of thermal pain sensitivity. Heat exposure was limited to 8\u2009sec to prevent tissue damage.\n7\nAt-level pain was assessed using a 26-g von Frey filament applied on a 4\u2009\u00d7\u200911 grid across the girdle region of each subject.\n8\nVocalization to the stimulus was recorded as a positive response and the total number of responses was calculated for each subject.\n\nTissue collection and immunoblotting\nSubjects used to assess the impact of our experimental treatments on cellular indices of cell death, cytokine expression, and hemorrhage were euthanized with 100\u2009mg/kg of pentobarbital 3\u2009h following electrical stimulation. One centimeter of spinal tissue centered at the lesion was dissected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Protein was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini kit according to Qiagen manufacturer instructions. A Bradford assay was performed to determine the concentration of protein extracts. Protein samples were diluted in 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009Laemmli buffer to a final concentration of 3\u2009mg/mL. Spectral analysis was performed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).\nThirty \u03bcL of protein was loaded into each well of a 15% Tris-HCl Criterion precast gel and run according to Bio-Rad manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and blocked with 5% milk for 1\u2009h at room temperature prior to incubation with primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C (interleukin [IL]-1\u03b2: Santa Cruz Biotechnologies sc-7884; IL-18: Santa Cruz Biotechnologies sc-7954; Caspase 3: Novus NB100-56113; Caspase 8: Novus NB100-56116; Lamin B: Abcam ab16048; hemoglobin \u03b1: Abcam ab92492).\n\nLesion reconstruction\nRats used to assess the impact of lidocaine treatment on recovery after a contusion injury were euthanized with 100\u2009mg/kg of pentobarbital at the completion of behavioral testing on Day 42. Subjects were flushed transcardially with phosphate-buffered saline prior to perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde. One centimeter of spinal tissue centered at the lesion was dissected and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. After a rinse with phosphate-buffered saline, spinal cords were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose for at least 1 week prior to sectioning.\nTwenty-micron sections of tissue were collected and every 10th section was mounted on a slide. Sections were stained with cresyl violet/luxol fast blue and traced by blinded observers to reconstruct the lesion.\n1\n\nExperimental designs\nSubjects received a moderate spinal cord injury and 24\u2009h later, locomotor function was assessed using the BBB locomotor scale. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of four groups (lidocaine or vehicle crossed with shocked or unshocked). The lidocaine dose used was based on prior work.\n18\n,\n19\nConverted BBB scores (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean [SEM) prior to drug treatment ranged from 3.2 (\u00b1 0.7) to 3.7 (\u00b1 1.3) and did not differ (all Fs <1.00;\np\n>\u20090.05). All subjects were then lightly anesthetized with isoflurane and an acute injection of lidocaine or vehicle was administered. Thirty minutes later, all subjects were restrained for 6\u2009min in an opaque Plexiglas tube and had an electrode fastened to the tail. Subjects in shocked groups received 6\u2009min of intermittent uncontrollable electrical stimulation while the subjects in unshocked groups received identical treatment without electrical stimulation. After treatment, all subjects were removed from the Plexiglas tube and kept in a temperature-controlled room until sacrifice. Three hours after stimulation, subjects were sacrificed and tissue was processed for immunoblotting as described above.\nThe impact of systemic morphine on cellular indices was examined using an analogous experimental design. Prior to drug treatment, BBB scores ranged from 3.7 (\u00b1 0.3) to 4.2 (\u00b1 1.2) and did not differ across groups (all Fs <1.00;\np\n>\u20090.05). Subjects then received morphine (20\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) or its vehicle, followed 30\u2009min later by shock or an equivalent period of restraint (Unshocked). The dosage used was based on past work demonstrating that it induces a robust anti-nociception and blocks reactivity to shock stimulation.\n7\nThree hours later, tissue was collected as described above.\nTo assess the impact of lidocaine treatment on the recovery of locomotor function, contused rats were evaluated and randomly assigned to one of four conditions a day after injury. Baseline BBB scores ranged from 2.8 (\u00b1 0.5) to 3.4 (\u00b1 0.6) and did not differ (all Fs <1.00;\np\n>\u20090.05). Subjects were lightly anesthetized and received lidocaine or its vehicle by means of a lumbar puncture as described above. Thirty minutes later, subjects received shock or remained unshocked. All subjects were then returned to the colony room and behavioral recovery was monitored over the next 6 weeks. Finally, after additional behavioral tests were conducted on Day 42, subjects were sacrificed and injury site was collected to assess tissue loss. One lidocaine-treated shocked subject exhibited autophagia and was sacrificed at Day 24. Because we were able to score this subject through Day 21 (10 of 13 scores), and because behavioral recovery asymptotes approximately 3 weeks after injury, we used this subject's BBB score from Day 21 to fill in the three missing values.\n20\nThis represents a conservative approach because BBB performance exhibited some improvement from Day 21 to 42. Further, to assure our assessment of tissue loss was not biased, we excluded this subject from those analyses.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data were analyzed using chi-square tests, analysis of variance (ANOVA), or analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). When necessary,\npost hoc\ncomparisons of the group means were performed using Duncan's New Multiple Range test. In all cases, a criterion of\np\n<\u20090.05 was set as the threshold for statistical significance."

    "Methods": "Anesthetic regimen, closed cranial window technique, and fluid percussion brain injury\nAll animal protocols were approved by the University of Pennsylvania Animal Care and Use Committee. Newborn and juvenile pigs (1\u20135 days old, 1.0\u20131.4\u2009kg, and 4 weeks old, 6.0\u20137.0\u2009kg) of either sex were studied. The anesthetic regimen consisted of: pre-medication with dexmedetomidine (20\u2009\u03bcg/kg im), induction with isoflurane (2\u20133%), isoflurane taper to 0% after start of total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with fentanyl (200\u2009ug/kg/h in newborns but 100\u2009ug/kg/h in juveniles), midazolam (1\u2009mg/kg/h), dexmedetomidine (2\u2009\u03bcg/kg/h), propofol (2\u201310\u2009mg/kg/h), and saline (2ml/kg/h in newborns and 12ml/kg/h in juveniles), and maintenance of TIVA for the balance of the surgical and experimental portions of the pig preparation. A catheter was inserted into a femoral artery to monitor blood pressure and femoral veins for drug administration. The trachea was cannulated, the animals ventilated with room air, and temperature maintained in the normothermic range (37\u201339\u00b0C), monitored rectally.\nA cranial window was placed in the parietal skull of these anesthetized animals. This window consisted of three parts: a stainless steel ring, a circular glass cover-slip, and three ports consisting of 17 gauge hypodermic needles attached to three pre-cut holes in the stainless steel ring. For placement, the dura was cut and retracted over the cut bone edge. The cranial window was placed in the opening and cemented in place with dental acrylic. The volume under the window was filled with a solution, similar to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), of the following composition (in mM): 3.0 KCl, 1.5 MgCl\n2\n, 1.5 CaCl\n2\n, 132 NaCl, 6.6 urea, 3.7 dextrose, and 24.6 NaHCO\n3\n. This artificial CSF was warmed to 37\n0\nC and had the following chemistry: pH 7.33, pCO2 46\u2009mm Hg, and pO2 43\u2009mm Hg, which was similar to that of endogenous CSF. Pial arterial vessel diameter was measured with a microscope, a camera, a video output screen, and a video microscaler.\nThe closed cranial window technique was also used for collection of CSF for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis.\n15\nFor sample collection, 300\u2009\u03bcL of the total cranial window volume of 500\u2009\u03bcL was collected by slowly infusing artificial CSF into one side of the window and allowing the CSF to drip freely into a collection tube on the opposite side. An Integra Camino monitor (San Diego, CA) was used to measure ICP. A laser Doppler (Perimed, Ardmore, PA) probe was placed near the cranial window. CBF was measured in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus using radioactively labeled microspheres.\n15\nA device designed by the Medical College of Virginia was used to produce FPI. A small opening was made in the parietal skull contralateral to the cranial window. A metal shaft was sealed into the opening on top of intact dura. This shaft was connected to the transducer housing, which was in turn connected to the fluid percussion device. The device itself consisted of an acrylic plastic cylindrical reservoir 60\u2009cm long, 4.5\u2009cm in diameter, and 0.5\u2009cm thick. One end of the device was connected to the transducer housing, whereas the other end had an acrylic plastic piston mounted on O-rings. The exposed end of the piston was covered with a rubber pad. The entire system was filled with 0.9% saline. The percussion device was supported by two brackets mounted on a platform. FPI was induced by striking the piston with a 4.8\u2009kg pendulum. The intensity of the injury (usually 1.9\u20132.3 atm. with a constant duration of 19\u201323\u2009ms) was controlled by varying the height from which the pendulum was allowed to fall. The pressure pulse of the injury was recorded on a storage oscilloscope triggered photoelectrically by the fall of the pendulum. The amplitude of the pressure pulse was used to determine the intensity of the injury.\n\nProtocol\nPial small arteries (resting diameter, 120\u2013160\u2009\u03bcm) were examined, and similar sized pial arteries were used in male and female pigs. For sample collection, 300\u2009\u03bcL of the total cranial window volume of 500\u2009\u03bcL was collected by slowly infusing artificial CSF into one side of the window and allowing the CSF to drip freely into a collection tube on the opposite side.\nOne hundred and twenty pigs were randomized to one of each experimental intervention group (all\nn\n=\u20095): 1) sham control, 2) FPI, 3) FPI post-treated with EPI. CPP was targeted (55\u201360 and 65\u201370\u2009mm Hg for newborns and juveniles, respectively, per 2012 Pediatric Guidelines) to determine the dose of the iv infusion (in \u03bcg/kg/min) of EPI and EPI treatment was started when CPP decreased <45\u2009mm Hg. Because experiments designed to determine CBF via microspheres and histopathology use mutually exclusive techniques, different animals were used to determine these two indices of outcome. However, animals in which pial artery reactivity and histopathology were determined were the same, allowing for within-animal comparison of outcome. Calculations of the total\nn\ntherefore are: three groups with\nn\n=\u20095 each or 15\u2009\u00d7\u2009two sexes\u2009=\u200930\u2009\u00d7\u2009two ages\u2009=\u200960\u2009\u00d7\u2009two indices of outcome\u2009=\u2009120 total. The MAP of a 1\u20135-day-old pig is typically 60\u201370\u2009mm Hg, whereas that of a 4-week-old pig is typically 65\u201380\u2009mm Hg under sham conditions. After brain injury, MAP progressively decreased in newborns but increased transiently and then progressively decreased in juveniles and was allowed to reach \u224855\u2009mm Hg within 30\u2009min after injury. ICP was allowed to increase to \u224810\u201316\u2009mm Hg. From the equation CPP\u2009=\u2009MAP \u2013 ICP, when CPP decreased <45\u2009mm Hg, the EPI infusion (0.8\u20131.4\u2009ug/kg/min iv) was then started and the dose was increased until the target CPP was reached; this approach is typically used in the clinical setting. The FPI alone group did not receive either fluids or vasoactive agents to normalize CPP.\n15\n,\n16\nThese animals were already being given an infusion of saline (to accommodate for loss during ventilation) and in prior studies an infusion of saline elevated above the latter did not make a significant difference in support of CPP over the prolonged time period of the protocol (4\u2009h post FPI).\n15\n,\n16\nCerebral autoregulation was tested via two techniques. The\nfirst method\ndetermined the transient hyperemic response ratio (THRR), a technique often used clinically,\n17\nthereby making these studies conducted with a basic science animal model of TBI more translatable. The THRR is calculated by observing the change in mean laser Doppler flow velocity after the release of 10\u2009sec compression of the common carotid artery, as described previously.\n17\nTHRR is calculated using the formula: THRR\u2009=\u2009F3/F1 where F1 and F3 are the flow immediately before compression and after the release of compression, respectively. Compression ratio (CR) is defined as the magnitude of decrease in flow during carotid compression and was calculated as: CR (%)\u2009=\u2009(F1-F2)\u2009\u00d7\u2009100 / F1 where F2 is the flow immediately after compression. THRR was tested twice in each animal with an interval of 5\u2009min between the tests. The mathematical averages of THRR and CR derived from the two tests were used for statistical analysis. The\nsecond method\nfor testing cerebral autoregulation was the traditional one used by this laboratory, and was included both for comparison with the newer THRR technique and also for comparison with studies which used Phe, DA, and NE as vasoactive agent treatments following FPI in newborn pigs. Hypotension was induced by the rapid withdrawal of either 5\u20138 or 10\u201315\u2009mL blood/kg to induce moderate or severe hypotension (decreases in MAP of 25% and 45%, respectively). Such decreases in blood pressure were maintained constant for 10\u2009min by titration of additional blood withdrawal or blood reinfusion. The vehicle for all agents was 0.9% saline. In sham control animals, responses to THRR, hypotension (moderate, severe) and papaverine (10\n\u22128\n, 10\n\u22126\nM) were obtained initially and then again 1\u2009h later. In drug post-treated animals, drugs were administered after FPI and responses to THRR, hypotension, and papaverine, as well as CSF samples collected at 1\u2009h post-insult. The order of agonist administration was randomized within animal groups. A wait period of 20\u2009min occurred between each set of stimuli to allow CBF, pial artery diameter, and biochemical indices of outcome (JNK MAPK) to return to control value.\n\nCBF\nCBF was measured in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus using radioactively labeled microspheres.\n15\n,\n16\nA catheter was placed in the left ventricle via the right carotid artery to inject the microspheres. In the present study, 15\u2009\u03bcm microspheres (300,000\u2013800,000 spheres) containing a known amount of radioactivity were injected into the left ventricle. Reference blood was withdrawn from the femoral artery. After each experiment, the pig was euthanized and the brain removed and weighed. CBF was determined by counting cerebral cortex brain tissue samples in a gamma counter. Brain tissue sample size varied from 100 to 500\u2009mg; there were at least 400 spheres/1\u2009g of tissue. There was an adequate number of spheres to accurately determine CBF during hypotension, as shown previously.\n15\nThe energy from each nuclide was separated by differential spectroscopy. Up to five different isotope CBF determinations were made in each piglet. Aliquots of the microsphere solutions injected were used for overlap calculations. The count in each milliliter per minute of blood flow was determined by dividing the counts in the reference withdrawal by the rate of reference withdrawal. Thus blood flow can be calculated as Q\u2009=\u2009C\u2009\u00d7\u2009R\u2009\u00d7\u2009CR\n\u22121\n, where Q is brain blood flow (in mL/min), C is counts per minute (cpm) in the tissue sample, R is the rate of withdrawal of reference blood sample (in mL/min), and CR is the total counts in the reference blood sample. CBF so determined reflects flow to the cerebral cortex and hippocampus both ipsilateral and contralateral to the injury site.\n\nELISA\nCommercially available ELISA kits were used to quantify CSF phosphorylated JNK-MAPK (Assay Designs, Farmingdale, NY) concentration.\n\nHistologic preparation\nThe brains were prepared for histopathology at 4\u2009h post-FPI. The brains were perfused with heparinized saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. For histopathology, staining was performed on paraffin-embedded slides, and serial sections were cut at 30\u2009\u03bcm intervals from the front face of each block and mounted on microscope slides. The sections (6\u2009\u03bcm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). Mean number of necrotic neurons (\u00b1 SEM) in CA1 and CA3 hippocampus in vehicle control-, FPI-, and FPI + NE-treated animals were determined, with data displayed for the side of the brain contralateral to the site of injury (the side where pial artery reactivity was investigated). Morphologic criteria for a necrotic neuron are: 1) pyknosis, 2) granulation of the cytoplasm, and 3) the emergence of an area between the nucleus and the cytoplasm that is unstained. The investigator was blinded to treatment group.\n\nStatistical analysis\nSample size was determined by using power analysis to calculate the size necessary to achieve a reliable measurement of the effect. Power analysis from prior studies shows that a sample size of five for hemodynamic data sets will yield statistical significance at the\np\n<\u20090.05 level with power of 0.84. Similar analysis for histopathology and biochemical indices (JNK MAPK) have powers of 0.82 and 0.85, respectively. This number was not altered during the course of the study. Data collection was stopped, however, if the animal's health was deemed to be not within physiological norms; for example, normocapnia or normoxia. Albeit lack of latter from occurring, all data were included in analysis. Mortality was not a factor; all animals reached study end-point. End-points chosen reflect those typically used for cerebral hemodynamic assessment under physiologic and pathologic conditions; for example CBF, CPP, and autoregulation. The research objective was to determine the role of sex and age in determining outcome after TBI when vasoactive agent administration was the intervention chosen for treatment (per clinical guidelines). The order of drug administration was randomized.\nA two tailed approach was used to test the hypothesis. Pial artery diameter, CBF, CSF JNK MAPK, and histopathologic values were analyzed using a two way repeated measures ANOVA which examined groups over time. If the value was significant, the data were then analyzed by a Tukey post-hoc test. An \u03b1 level of\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered significant in all statistical tests. Values are represented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM of the absolute value or as percentage changes from the control value."

    "Methods": "All mice were male wild type C57BL/6J (Jackson Laboratories) male mice 10 weeks old at the time of injury. Forty-eight mice were divided into groups of 24 mice receiving repetitive injury (five hits with an inter-mTBI injury interval of 48\u2009h), 24 receiving repetitive sham injury (anesthesia alone), and 12 mice from each group assigned to anatabine treatment, 12 to placebo. The injury protocol was performed as previously described.12Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 1.5\u2009L/min O2and 3% isoflurane delivered continuously by a nose cone. The animal was mounted in a stereotactic frame in a prone position secured by ear and incisor bars. Anesthesia controls were matched for the time spent under anesthesia by the r-mTBI mice. An electromagnetic impactor (Impact One\u2122Stereotaxic Impactor; Leica, Richmond, IL) generated a midline mTBI on the mouse scalp with a 5.0\u2009mm diameter flat face tip, at a 5\u2009m/sec strike velocity, with a 1.0\u2009mm strike depth, and a 200\u2009msec dwell time. Sham injured animals underwent the same procedures and anesthesia duration as the r-mTBI mice on each occasion, to control for the effects of repeated anesthesia.\n\nThirty min after each injury or sham procedure, mice received an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of either phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or anatabine (2mg/kg) (provided by Rock Creek Pharmaceuticals). This dose was administered via IP to control the timing and dose of the first administration after injury as the mice do not immediately return to drinking from their water bottles after surgery. After the first dose, for the anatabine treatment group, normal water was substituted with anatabine-treated water, and was continuously re-filled for continuous treatment over 9 months (without the need for further IP injections) at an estimated dose of 20mg/kg/day (placebo mice received regular water). Water intake was estimated given previous research showing that C57BL/6J mice consume water at a rate of approximately 7.4\u2009mL/30\u2009g of weight.23At 9 months post-TBI, the treated and untreated groups were switched. Previously untreated mice began receiving anatabine in their water at an estimated dose of 20mg/kg/day, whereas mice previously treated with anatabine began receiving regular water alone.\n\nExperimenters were blinded to group assignments during all neurobehavioral testing. Rotarod testing was performed as previously described with modifications.12Briefly, baseline testing preceded the administration of r-mTBI or r-sham procedures, but only one day of baseline testing was performed. One day prior to the start of the injury or sham procedure, mice were pre-trained and baseline tested for rotarod performance. All mice were given three trials to acclimatize to the rotarod at a constant speed of 5 revolutions per min (RPM). For all subsequent tests, the rotarod was set to an accelerating speed of 5 to 50 RPM over a period of 5\u2009min. Three trials were given with a 3\u2009min rest period between trials. Latency to fall was recorded and averaged over each day. Baseline testing occurred one day prior to the start of the r-mTBI or r-sham procedure, and one day after the administration of the last r-mTBI or r-sham procedure rotarod testing was resumed. Mice were then tested every other day after surgery starting on day 1 and ending on day 7. This testing was repeated again 6 months after TBI. Post-surgery testing occurred at an accelerating speed of 5 to 50 RPM over a period of 5\u2009min. Three trials were given with a 3\u2009min rest period between trials. Latency to fall and the speed of the rotarod at the moment of the fall were recorded.\n\nFollowing rotarod, Barnes maze testing was administered as previously described immediately after the first rotarod test and again at 6 months after TBI.12The Barnes maze was 1.2\u2009m in diameter and had 18 holes around the perimeter. Each mouse was given 1.5\u2009min to explore the maze and enter the goal box. Each mouse received 30\u2009sec in the goal box at the end of the trial period. Each mouse received four trials starting in front of each of four randomly selected cardinal holes for a period of 6 days. On the 7th day the goal box was removed and the mouse was given a 60\u2009sec probe trial starting in the center of the table. Each mouse's orientation and movement was recorded by Noldus Ethovision XT software. Rotarod testing was performed acutely in the first week after the final injury. Barnes maze testing was performed on days 8 to 15 after the final injury, then at 6 months after TBI the Barnes maze protocol was repeated (both acquisition and probe trials) as described above. Following the crossover of treatment, Barnes maze acquisition and probe testing was again repeated at 12 and 18 months post-TBI (3 and 9 months after treatment crossover).\n\nPathology was assessed at 9 and 18 months post-TBI. Four mice per group were euthanatized for neuropathological analyses 9 months after TBI/sham procedures. All remaining mice were euthanized 18 months after TBI, with four per group processed for neuropathological analyses at this final time-point. All animals were deeply anesthetized with isofluorane before being intracardially perfused by gravity drip with a heparinized PBS solution pH 7.4 for 3\u2009min, followed by an overnight fixation of brain samples in 4% paraformaldehyde and paraffin embedding. Separate series of 5- to 6-\u03bcm-thick sections were cut throughout the extent of the cortex and hippocampus and associated areas using a microtome (2030 Biocut, Reichert/Leica) and mounted on positively charged glass slides (Superfrost Plus, Fisher). Sections were stained in entire batches with antibodies (cell markers) raised against: glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) (rabbit anti-GFAP, 1:10,000, Dako) for astrocytosis, ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA1) for microglia, APP for axonal injury, phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) (rabbit anti-pSTAT3, 1:500), or Luxol\u00a9fast blue (LFB) for myelin.\n\nSections were deparaffinized in Histo-Clear (National Diagnostics) and rehydrated in 95% and 80% ethanol before the immunohistochemical procedure. Sections were then rinsed in water and treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 5\u2009min to block endogenous peroxidase. After rinsing, sections were heat treated in target retrieval solution for 8\u2009min using a pressure cooker for antigen retrieval. Sections were incubated overnight with primary antibodies, followed by rinsing with PBS, and were then stained with a complementary secondary antibody (from the Vectastain Elite ABC Kit or Vector Mouse on Mouse [M.O.M.\u2122] Kit) for 1\u2009h, and finally they were incubated with avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase solution (Vectastain Elite ABC Kit, Vector Laboratories) for 1 further h\n\nA solution of 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen and hydrogen peroxide was used to develop the sections. Chromogen development was kept at a constant 5\u2009min to limit variability for quantification. The reaction was terminated by rinsing sections in distilled water. Finally, sections were dehydrated using 80% and 95% ethanol followed by Histo-Clear and were then coverslipped. Immunoreacted sections were viewed using an Olympus (BX63) light microscope and photos were taken using an Olympus DP72 camera.\n\nFor GFAP and IBA1 staining, immunoreactivity for cell markers was measured quantitatively using optical segmentation. Three non-overlapping 100\u2009\u03bcm2regions were selected for each section (n=\u20094). Quantification was performed by blind assessment using ImageJ (with each slide analyzed blind with respect to marker or animal group). Images were separated into individual color channels using the color deconvolution plug-in (hematoxylin counter stain and DAB chromogen). Each stain was quantified within the cortex, hippocampus, and corpus callosum. The area of positive immunoreactivity was calculated for each section and expressed as a percentage of the total area. For APP and p-STAT3 staining, the total number of positive profiles were quantified throughout the corpus callosum on each section. For LFB thickness was measured along the center of the body of the corpus callosum.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using JMP 12.0 (SAS; Cary, NC). Normality tests were conducted using the Shapiro-Wilk W test and the data were transformed using square root or natural log transformation when not normally distributed. If the distribution was still not normal after transformation, non-parametric methods were used. Normally distributed data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA; with repeated measures where appropriate) and\nt\ntests.\nP\nvalues of\np\n<\u20090.05 were considered as statistically significant and marked with an asterisk in the figures."

    "Methods": "Contusion model of spinal cord injury and stretch assay\nAll animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the University of Alabama, Birmingham (UAB) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in compliance with the National Research Council Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Female C57/Bl6 mice at 8\u201312 weeks of age were anesthetized under isoflurane and the lamina was removed at thoracic level 10. Using a 0.8-mm diameter tip, a centrally located contusion injury was induced by application of 75 kilodynes of force to the exposed spinal cord using the Infinite Horizon spinal cord injury device (Precision Systems & Instrumentation, Lexington, KY). Mice used as sham controls were subjected to laminectomy only. For stretch injury, astrocytes were first isolated from pups as previously described.\n14\nCells were plated on Bioflex plates (Flexcell, Burlington, NC) with elastic bottoms that are deformable with air pressure. Using the 94A Cell Injury Controller (Bioengineering Facility, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA), a 50\u2009msec pulse of air was applied to cause a deformation of 6.3\u2009mm (moderate injury) to the wells of the plate, causing a stretch injury to the astrocytes as previously described.\n15\n\nImmunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry\nAt 24\u2009h post-injury, mice were euthanized by isoflurane and pentobarbital, then perfused with ice cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 2\u2009min, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 5\u2009min. The spinal column was then extracted and post-fixed in PFA for 24\u2009h before overnight decalcification in 8% hydrochloric acid and 10% ethanol in PBS. The spinal column was cryoprotected in a 10% sucrose in PBS solution for 2\u2009h, followed by 30% sucrose in PBS for 48\u2009h. Three millimeter samples at the epicenter of injury and adjacent rostral and caudal tissue were cryomolded in Tissue-Tek OCT (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) and cut transversely into 30-\u03bcm serial sections using a cryostat (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL). Spinal cord sections were washed with PBS and blocked with 10% goat serum for 1\u2009h before overnight incubation using the following antibodies: HuR (3A2, mouse monoclonal; Santa-Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA) at 1:1000 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; Z0334, rabbit polyclonal; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 1:2000. Nuclear labeling was performed using 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.\nQualitative assessment of HuR localization was performed in a group of four injured and four sham-injured mice. For quantitative assessment of HuR localization, photomicrographs of eight random high-powered fields of epicenter, rostral, and caudal sections (3\u2009mm relative to the epicenter) were taken from one injured mouse at 24\u2009h using an Olympus BX41 microscope. A sham-injured mouse was similarly assessed. HuR/GFAP colocalization was then performed on each photomicrograph using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and the Green and Red Puncta colocalization Macro for ImageJ (Daniel J. Shiwarski, Ruben K. Dagda, and Charleen T. Chu). Immunocytochemistry of HuR and GFAP also was performed in stretch-injured astrocytes. Twenty-four hours after injury, astrocytes were washed with PBS and fixed with PFA for 10\u2009min. The fixed astrocytes were washed, blocked in 10% goat serum, and incubated with anti-HuR and anti-GFAP antibodies at the same concentrations and time intervals used for immunohistochemistry. After staining, silastic membranes from Flexcell plates were cut out and inverted onto six-well plates for imaging using an Olympus IX73 inverted microscope.\n\nHuR knockdown and MS-444 treatment\nHuR knockdown in primary astrocytes were performed by transfection of a small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific to HuR, siHuR (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO), 72\u2009h prior to stretch injury. Astrocytes were electroporated using the Neon transfection kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. siHuR or control siRNA targeting green fluorescent protein was transfected into astrocytes at a concentration of 300 pmol per 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n6\ncells. MS-444 was generously provided by Dr. Meisner-Kober (Novartis, Basel, Switzerland). MS-444 was reconstituted in pure dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and was added to the cell-culture media at concentrations of 25 and 50\u2009\u03bcM, with a final DMSO concentration of 0.5% (% v/v). The control consisted of DMSO in cell culture media at the same concentration. Astrocytes were treated with MS-444 or vehicle for 8\u2009h prior to injury or stimulation to ensure HuR inhibition.\n\nRNA isolation, kinetics, and protein analysis\nRNA was extracted and isolated using the illustra RNAspin kit (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) and concentrations were measured by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was reverse-transcribed from RNA using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed using the ViiA7 Real-Time PCR System and commercially available primer and probes (Applied Biosystems). RNA half-lives were determined as previously described.\n16\nFor protein analysis, extracts were collected in M-Per lysis buffer and quantitated using the BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Forty micrograms of protein were analyzed by Western blot and probed with antibodies for the following: HuR (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA) at 1:1000 and actin at 1:2,000 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA). Astrocyte conditioned media from stretch injured astrocytes were pooled from three wells and concentrated 6-fold using Amicon Ultra 3NMWL centrifugal filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Cytokine expression was analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the following cytokines: TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL-1), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2; R&D Biosystems, Minneapolis, MN), and IL-1\u03b2 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK).\n\nLuciferase promoter assay\nLuciferase reporter plasmids were generously provided by Dr. Dong, University of Pittsburgh (IL-1\u03b2 promoter) and Dr. Nagaoka, Juntendo University, Japan (TREM-1 promoter). The TNF-\u03b1 promoter was provided by Dr. Economou (University of California, Los Angeles) and modified as previously described.\n16\nThe Hel-N1 promoter is described elsewhere.\n17\nThe PGL2 control plasmid (E1611) was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Astrocytes were transfected by electroporation with siRNA, 2\u2009\u03bcg of luciferase reporter plasmids, and 1\u2009\u03bcg of pCMV \u03b2-galactosidase plasmid as an internal control. Twenty-four hours after stretch-injury, astrocytes were lysed and luciferase/\u03b2-galactosidase activities were assayed as previously described.\n17\n,\n18\nLuciferase values were adjusted to \u03b2-galactosidase activity.\n\nTranswell migration assays\nConditioned medium from stretch-injured astrocytes was used as a chemoattractant for primary neutrophils and microglia-like BV2 cells (generously provided by Dr. Tika Benveniste). Primary murine neutrophils were isolated from tibia and femur bone marrow by differential centrifugation through a Percoll gradient (52%, 65%, 78%). Neutrophils (1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n5\n) were plated onto a transwell insert with a pore size of 3\u2009\u03bcm, then placed into conditioned medium from stretch-injured astrocytes for 1\u2009h. Neutrophils that migrated into the astrocyte conditioned media (ACM) below were labeled with a fluorescein isothyocyanate\u2013conjugated Ly6G antibody (RB6-8C5, rat monoclonal; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and counted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). To investigate chemoattraction of microglia/macrophages, 2.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n4\nBV2 cells or primary mouse microglia were seeded into the upper well of an 8\u2009\u03bcm pore transwell insert and placed into ACM for 24\u2009h.\nPrimary microglial cells (PMG) were isolated from 1- to 3-day-old pups as described previously.\n19\nThe purity of PMG was assessed by IBA1 staining. Migrated cells on the lower side of the transwell membrane were stained using the Hema 3 Stat Pack staining kit (Fisher, Kalamazoo, MI). Ten random high-powered fields were taken for each membrane and cells were counted using an Olympus BX41 microscope.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll RNA, protein, and luciferase measurements were assessed using a Student's\nt\n-test comparing control versus treated samples. For\nin vivo\nHuR localization, a one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni multiple comparisons test was used for comparisons of merged signal between different spinal cord locations and the sham-injured control."

    "Methods": "The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University Of Pittsburgh School of Medicine approved the experiments used in this study. C57/BL6 mice (n=\u200932; Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME), 12\u201315 weeks of age were allowedad libitumfood and water and were housed in controlled environmental conditions until the study began.\n\nMice underwent a controlled cortical impact (CCI) and HS paradigm (Fig. 1) that has been used successfully in our laboratory for prior investigations, and its methods have been described in prior publications.17,19,20Our model is designed to mimic a clinically relevant scenario of a moderate-severe TBI sustained in the field followed by HS and subsequent resuscitation in both the pre-hospital and hospital phase.\n\nCCI and monitoring\nAnesthesia was induced with 4% isoflurane in 2:1\u2009N\n2\nO/oxygen delivered via nose cone and was then maintained with 1.5% isoflurane in a 2:1\u2009N\n2\nO/oxygen mixture for surgical preparation. Under sterile conditions, an inguinal cut-down was performed and femoral venous and arterial catheters (modified PE-50 tubing) were placed. Mice were then placed in a stereotactic frame (Kopf, Tujunga, CA) and an incision was made over the left scalp. Using a dental drill, a 5\u2009mm craniotomy was performed over the left parietal cortex and the bone flap was removed. A temperature probe (Physitemp, Clifton, NJ) was inserted into the left temporalis muscle to approximate brain temperature. Body temperature was monitored via rectal probe. Temperature was controlled throughout the study via heating lamp to maintain brain temperature at 37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u00b0C. PbtO\n2\nwas monitored and recorded using a microelectrode (Unisense, 50\u2009\u03bcm; Arhus, Denmark) stereotactically inserted via a burr hole through the cortex into the left dorsal hippocampus (ipsilateral to the CCI; bregma \u22122.5\u2009AP, \u22122.0\u2009ML; depth, 2.0\u2009mm). After craniotomy, the isoflurane was decreased to 1% in room air for 10\u2009min before introduction of CCI. A CCI was performed with a pneumatic impactor (Bimba, Monee, IL), using a flat 3-mm tip impounder on the left parietal cortex at 5\u2009m/sec and to a depth of 1.0\u2009mm.\n\nCCI, pressure controlled HS mode: Comparison of resuscitation with PNPH, LR, and whole blood\nAfter CCI, mice underwent a pressure-controlled HS model comprised of three phases: \u201cShock,\u201d \u201cPre-hospital,\u201d and \u201cHospital.\u201d Shock was initiated 5\u2009min after CCI by removal of 12\u2009mL of blood per kg of body weight over 5\u2009min via the venous canula. Blood was drawn into a syringe containing 0.07\u2009mL of citrate anticoagulant (Cardian BCT, Lakewood, CO). An additional 12\u2009mL of blood per kg of body weight was removed over the next 5 to 15\u2009min for a total of \u223c30% of the blood volume in a mouse.\n21\nUsing this approach, a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 25\u201327\u2009mm Hg was achieved and this level was maintained by continued removal or re-infusion of autologous citrated blood from the venous catheter in 0.05\u2009mL aliquots using the same syringe. The mice were maintained at this MAP for the duration of the 35\u2009min Shock phase initiated at the time of blood removal. During the Shock phase, anesthesia was reduced from 1% isoflurane in room air to 0.5% isoflurane in room air. After the Shock phase, the mice entered the Pre-hospital phase and were resuscitated using one of three approaches: i) 4% PNPH solution in normal saline (SynZyme Technologies, Irvine, CA), 20\u2009mL/kg (\nn\n=\u200910); ii) autologous whole blood, 20\u2009mL/kg (\nn\n=\u200912); or iii) LR, 60\u2009mL/kg (\nn\n=\u200910). A 3:1 ratio of crystalloid to blood/PNPH dosing was chosen based on a common clinical standard of crystalloid being equivalent to 1/3 the volume of whole blood infused. In this model, the amount of shed blood removed to achieve the desired MAPs of 25\u201327\u2009mm Hg typically totals \u223c25\u2009mL/kg (\u223c30% total blood volume). Thus, administration of 20\u2009mL/kg of autologous whole blood (a conventional clinical resuscitation volume) resulted in re-infusion of most of the shed blood after 35\u2009min of HS in each case. All mice were resuscitated at the beginning of the Pre-Hospital phase with 20\u2009mL/kg of their respective resuscitation fluid. Mice in the LR group then received additional 20\u2009mL/kg boluses\u2009\u00d7\u20092 every 5\u2009min to achieve a total of 60\u2009mL/kg of total fluid resuscitation (once again to mimic clinical care, where a 3:1 ratio of crystalloid to blood is routinely administered). Unlike prior studies in our model, mice received no additional fluids for the duration of this experiment after their initial resuscitation. During the Pre-hospital phase, room air was used to mimic field resuscitation in combat casualty care, where oxygen is not readily available. During the model, standard physiologic outcomes were obtained at baseline and post-injury, including MAP, heart rate (HR), and blood chemistries/gases and brain tissue oxygen tension (PbtO\n2\n). After the 90-min Pre-Hospital phase, mice entered the 15-min Hospital phase. In the Hospital phase, in this study, mice received no additional blood or fluids. During that phase, 1% isoflurane in pure oxygen was administered, again mimicking clinical care in a combat support hospital or civilian emergency department, where 100% oxygen would be available. At the completion of the model, mice were sacrificed with an intravenous potassium chloride bolus.\n\nResuscitation of CCI+HS with PNPH: Assessment of dose response\nTo determine the relative effectiveness of PNPH resuscitation across a wide dosage range, as well as to determine its safety in higher doses, a 50-fold range was selected encompassing both the extreme low and high range of potential PNPH dosing. Thus, a total of six PNPH doses were chosen for investigation (2, 5, 10, 20, 50, or 100\u2009mL/kg) and were compared with standard resuscitation with LR. Mice (\nn\n=\u200921, 3/group\u2009\u00d7\u20097 groups) underwent our standard CCI+HS model, as detailed above, although in this experiment PbtO\n2\nwas not measured. Instead, ICP was monitored continuously by an ICP transducer (1 Tr MIKRO-TIP) inserted through a burr hole into the right frontal lobe, contralateral to injury. After the normal 35-min HS period, mice were resuscitated with either LR or PNPH in one of the previously mentioned doses. Resuscitation was begun in all mice with 20\u2009mL/kg total fluid, regardless of group to mimic the clinical standard of trauma care. Thus, mice in the 2, 5, or 10\u2009mL/kg PNPH groups received additional LR (18, 15, and 10\u2009mL/kg respectively) to achieve this goal. Given the high oncotic potential of PNPH, in an effort to prevent mortality or morbidity from acute volume overload, mice in the 50 and 100\u2009mL/kg group started resuscitation with the same initial bolus volume of 20\u2009mL/kg, but then received the remainder of their allocated fluid volume (30 and 80\u2009mL/kg respectively) over the subsequent 60\u2009min. This was felt to be a logical approach given that a 50 or 100\u2009mL/kg bolus of PNPH would be substantially in excess of its projected standard of care use in clinical practice. After initiation of resuscitation in the Pre-Hospital phase, mice received ongoing fluid resuscitation with LR (10\u2009mL/kg) for MAP <70\u2009mm Hg. There are a total of 17 time-points in the Pre-Hospital phase in which mice could receive additional fluid, thus making the maximum total fluid resuscitation volume, including the initial 20\u2009mL/kg bolus, to be 190\u2009mL/kg. After 90-min of Pre-Hospital resuscitation, mice entered a Hospital phase, during which they had re-infusion of their previously shed blood and were placed on 100% oxygen. The primary outcomes of this study were similar to the previous experiment and included acute physiologic measures, including MAP, HR, and blood gas/chemistry analysis, and ICP. At completion of the model, mice were sacrificed via isoflurane overdose followed by decapitation, and their brains immediately removed for determination of brain edema by %-brain water via wet-weight/dry-weight method as previously described.\n17\n\nStatistical analysis\nPhysiologic parameters were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures; between-group comparisons for other outcomes were made using Student's\nt\n-test.\nPost hoc\ntesting was corrected for multiple comparisons. All results are provided as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean. Significance was determined by a\np\nvalue \u22640.05."

Participants gave written and oral informed consent according to the protocol of a study approved by Human Studies Research Office, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami.\n\nInterventions\nAccording to the protocol of the primary study, participants were randomized into one of four intervention groups: 1) treadmill-based training with manual assistance for stepping provided by trainer(s) (TM), 2) treadmill-based training with electrical stimulation of the common peroneal nerve to elicit a flexion withdrawal response at the onset of swing phase (TS), 3) OG training with functional electrical stimulation to assist with dorsiflexion during swing phase (OG), and 4) treadmill-based training with a robotic gait orthosis (using 100% guidance force) (LR). Techniques applied to interventions requiring assistance have been previously published.\n27\nTraining was performed 5 days per week for 12 weeks with a target of 60 sessions completed. Allotted time for each training session was 60\u2009min.\n\nOutcomes\nMeasurements of walking distance (traversed in 2\u2009min) and walking speed (over 10\u2009m) were acquired prior to and following training. A training log was maintained for each subject; for each session the distance walked and the time walked was recorded. For subjects trained using a treadmill-based approach, the treadmill speed during training was also recorded.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data analyses were performed in Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) and SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institue Inc., Cary, NC). For each participant, distance-dose was calculated by summing distance walked for all sessions; time-dose was calculated by summing time walked for all sessions (time spent resting between walking bouts was not included in the time-dose calculation).\nWithin each group, Pearson correlations were calculated to examine 1) the relationships between distance-dose and training-related improvements in walking distance and walking speed, 2) the relationships between time-dose and training-related improvements in walking distance and speed, and 3) the relationship between distance-dose and time-dose."

    "Methods": "Twenty-three traumatically injured patients and nine controls were recruited from the Emergency Department and Neurological Surgery service at Parkland Hospital, Dallas Texas between February 2011 and January 2014. All the injured patients were 18\u201350 years old with a Glasgow Coma Score \u226513 (Table 1).\n\nPatients with mTBI were given a peripheral visual reaction test within 24\u2009h after injury, and controls were given the test upon giving consent (Fig. 1A and B). The PVRT was administered to subjects using a laptop computer running tachistoscopic software. This software measures the time elapsed between exposure to a plus sign 31.6 degrees on the left or the right from the central point, and the striking of a computer space bar with the subject's dominant hand. The stimulus remained on the screen until the key press. The test consisted of 50 trials that were randomized to side and inter-trial interval. This test yielded three outcomes, the CRT in which the stimulus was ipsilateral to the patient's dominant hand, the URT in which the stimulus was contralateral to the dominant hand, and the CUD that was the difference between the CRT and the URT. Both the mTBI and control subjects showed a similar decrease in the URT or CRT throughout the 50 trials (in msec/trial): URT, control: \u22122.90\u2009\u00b1\u20091.27; injured: \u22124.92\u2009\u00b1\u20092.86, t29=\u2009\u22120.45,p>\u20090.5; CRT, control: \u22120.38\u2009\u00b1\u20090.95; injured, \u22122.15\u2009\u00b1\u20092.56, t29=\u2009\u22120.43,p>\u20090.5. These data suggest that injured and control patients had a similar ability to improve performance on the task regardless of the size of their CRT or URT impairment. As a result, the CRT and URT were computed from the average of the final five trials on each side. Within 7 days after injury, the same cohort of mTBI patients received MRI scans including a DTI sequence using a 3 tesla magnet MRI at the Advanced Imaging Research Center at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Controls also received MRI scans.\n\nMRI scan acquisition and preprocessing\nDTI data were acquired with an acquisition matrix of 128\u2009\u00d7\u2009128, field of view of 224\u2009\u00d7\u2009224\u2009mm, slice thickness of 2\u2009mm, and an inter-slice gap of 1\u2009mm. The DTI protocol employed 30 gradient directions with a b-value of 1000\u2009sec/mm\n2\nalong with one b0 image and was processed using FSL 5.0.8 (\nwww.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/\n). First, the data underwent correction for motion and eddy current distortions, followed by skull stripping.\n11\n,\n12\nTensors were estimated using the DTIFIT module and fractional anisotropy (FA) data were processed using the tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) pipeline that co-registers scans into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space and creates a skeletonized representation of central regions of white matter from the FA map. FA values were projected onto the skeleton after thresholding the mean FA map at 0.2. This processing was also applied to mean diffusivity (MD) maps.\n13\nRegion of interest (ROI) masks for tracks of interest were from an in-house atlas compiled from 28 healthy, normal, young adults who underwent DTI imaging as part of a study on normal aging. Deterministic DTI tractography was performed in native space using MedINRIA, and the occupied voxels were exported for each tract. These tract representations were transformed into MNI space, combined across subjects, and thresholded to retain only voxels present in a majority of subjects.\n\nProcedures\nTwenty-three civilian patients with mTBI were recruited from Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, TX after a review of the injury and their first post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale. Consent was obtained according to the local institutional review board (IRB) regulations from the patient or, in one case, from a legally authorized representative. Included patients were alert, oriented, and able to follow commands by a nurse. The experimenter performing the computer testing further confirmed the patient's level of awareness and orientation. Healthy controls were age- and gender-matched family members of the TBI patients or other healthy volunteers who agreed to participate in the study.\nPatients were included if they were 18\u201350 years of age with an injury compatible with TBI and a post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Score \u226513 within 24\u2009h of consent. They were excluded if they had a history of pre-existing neurological disease, including a previous hospitalization for TBI >1 day, were pregnant, or were contraindicated for MRI. Controls were included if they were in good health, had normal brain anatomy on MRI, were not cognitively impaired, and could provide written consent. Controls were excluded if they had a neurological disease, including head trauma with loss of consciousness, or were contraindicated for MRI. All patients received the PVRT test within 24\u2009h after injury. Of the 23 patients consenting, 14 injured patients received MRI scans within 1 week of injury. Of the remainder, six of these patients left the hospital after consenting and receiving the peripheral vision reaction time test, but did not return for their scheduled appointment for scanning and could not be contacted. One patient voluntarily left the study and one could not be scanned because the MRI scanner was not working properly. All nine controls received the PVRT test and then received a MRI scan that included a DTI sequence.\nCranial CT scans were performed on admission to the emergency department on all patients. CT scans were read by a neuroradiologist, and clinical reports were generated. Findings noted in the reports were abstracted to identify trauma-related abnormalities.\nPatients received the following neuropsychological tests on the day of MRI scanning in an outpatient setting within 7 days of injury: Digit Symbol, Symbol Search, Digit Span, Controlled Oral Word Test, Trails A and B, Brief Symptom Inventory, and California Verbal Learning Test. Controls received the same testing. This study was formally reviewed and approved by the IRBs of the State University of New York-Downstate Medical Center and the University of Texas-Southwestern\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe primary hypothesis of this study was that aberrant FA or MD in selected white matter regions correlated with CUD deficits. TBSS-derived skeletonized DTI data were analyzed using two methods. 1) Tract level analyses were obtained by isolating regions of the skeletonized data with ROI masks representing 1 of 20 white matter tracts. The voxels within each ROI were then averaged for each tract. The 20 tracts consisted of 4 midline tracts (forceps minor, anterior corpus callosum, posterior corpus callosum, and the forceps major) and the left and right representations of 8 lateralized tracts (corticospinal tract, frontal aslant tract, frontal occipital fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum bundle, perforant pathway, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and uncinate fasciculus). Mean tract values were used for between-group comparisons and correlations.\n14\n,\n15\n2) Voxelwise between-group comparisons and correlations were run using the Randomise tool in FSL, which is a permutation-based Monte Carlo technique.\n16\nWe used 5000 permutations, threshold-free cluster enhancement, and correction for multiple comparisons using a familywise error rate of\np\n<\u20090.05.\nAnalyses of variance were analyzed for groups of three or more. Subsequent pairwise comparisons were made using the Student\u2013Neumann\u2013Keuls post-hoc test. Groups of two were analyzed by Student's\nt\ntest. Chi-square analysis analyzed the percent of left-handed subjects in the control and experimental groups. Nonparametric Spearman correlation analyses were initially performed with Prism Version 6.0f (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). The Benjamini\u2013Hochberg procedure was applied to the Spearman correlations to control for the false discovery rate of multiple comparison testing.\n17\nIn\nFigure 2\n, a log transformation of negative z-scores of FA and MD was avoided by converting z-scores into t-scores. In all tests, statistical significance was set at 0.05.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nCorrelations between the crossed\u2013uncrossed difference (CUD) and white matter abnormalities.

    "Methods": "Repetitive mild traumatic brain injury model\nAll animals were treated in accord with guidelines of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences and the National Institutes of Health\nGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\n. Seven-week-old male C57BL/6 mice or Thy1-YFP-16 mice, both from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), were housed in standard cages in a 12-h/12-h light-dark cycle with food and water\nad libitum\nbefore sham or TBI procedures at 8 weeks of age. As a positive control for tau pathology, P301S mice expressing a mutant form of human tau were obtained from Tony Wyss-Coray (Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA) and used at 5 months of age when tau pathology develops in cortical regions.\n29\nThe parameters of the r-mTBI model were based on pilot testing of multiple protocols (data not shown). An Impact One Stereotaxic Impactor (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) was used to produce r-mTBI concussive impacts. A series of five impacts separated by 24-h intervals was chosen to target the period of decreased glucose uptake observed 24\u2009h after a single mTBI in rats.\n30\nMice were anesthetized with 2.0% isoflurane in O\n2\nand then the hair was shaved and depilated with Nair. Mice were positioned in a stereotaxic frame with rubber stoppers inserted between the external ear canal and ear bar. Impacts were made onto the skin approximately over bregma using a 3-mm-diameter tip (velocity set at 4.0\u2009m/sec; depth of 1.0\u2009mm; dwell time of 200\u2009ms). Sham mice underwent identical procedures to the r-mTBI mice without receiving impacts. Body temperature was maintained with a warming pad. After each procedure, the duration of apnea and the righting reflex were recorded (\nFig. 1\n). The repetitive injury study included 30 r-mTBI mice and 30 r-sham mice. A single impact (s-mTBI) model has been previously characterized\n31\nand is included as\nsupplementary data\n(\nSupplementary Fig. 1\n) (see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n) for direct comparison of assessment techniques with the novel r-mTBI model through 6 weeks post-injury.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nCharacterization of the progression of pathology in the corpus callosum in a repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (r-mTBI) model. (\nA\nand\nB\n) Post-surgical data for r-mTBI. Apnea was not detected (nd) in r-sham mice (A), but was significantly increased after the first and the second impact in r-mTBI mice (A). The righting time is significantly delayed in r-mTBI versus r-sham mice (B). (\nC\u2013E\n) Immunohistochemistry for \u03b2-APP is present mainly in neuronal cell bodies in r-sham mice (C). \u03b2-APP accumulations are readily detected in damaged axons (arrows) in r-mTBI mice acutely (D), but less marked by 7 days post-injury (E). (\nF\n\u2013\nH\n) Immunohistochemistry for CD11b identifies microglia, which exhibit a resting phenotype in r-sham mice (F) with progressive activation evident at 24\u2009h (G) and 7 days (H).

(\nL\u2013O\n) Quantification of immunohistochemistry in the corpus callosum. Axonal profiles with \u03b2-APP accumulations were increased very early after r-mTBI mice (L). Astrogliosis increases over the first week after r-mTBI (M). Microglial activation also increases significantly over the first week based on area of CD11b immunoreactivity (N) and an earlier reaction is detected by counting activated cells, which have intense CD11b and shorter, thicker processes (O).

Longitudinal scanning was used to evaluate changes in both the corpus callosum and the overlying cortical gray matter. All mice underwent pre-injury diffusion- and T\n2\n- weighted MR imaging and follow-up imaging at 3 days, 6 days, and 6 weeks post-injury. Mice were scanned as yoked pairs consisting of an mTBI mouse with a sham mouse. Two independent cohorts of 3 r-mTBI mice and 3 repeptitive sham (r-sham) mice were run from surgery through analysis for a total of 6 r-mTBI mice and 6 r-sham mice scanned at all time points.\nAnimals were anaesthetized with 1% isoflurane and placed in an MR compatible mouse bed. Images were acquired with a four-channel phased array MR coil after volumetric radiofrequency excitation. A two-dimensional (2D) single-shot echo planar imaging sequence (repetition time/echo time [TR/TE]\u2009=\u20094500/30\u2009msec; four repetitions) was used to acquire four unweighted (b\u2009=\u20090\u2009s/mm\n2\n) images and seven diffusion-weighted images (b\u2009=\u2009400, 800, 1200, 1600, 2000, 2400, and 2800\u2009s/mm\n2\n) using a Stejskal-Tanner diffusion preparation\n32\nwith parameters of\n=\u200912\u2009msec, \u03b4\u2009=\u20095\u2009msec, field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u200914\u2009\u00d7\u200914\u2009mm\n2\n, matrix\u2009=\u200980\u2009\u00d7\u200980, slice thickness\u2009=\u20090.75\u2009mm, 18 slices, and 30 noncollinear diffusion gradient directions. A multiecho 2D rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) sequence\n33\nwas used to acquire T\n2\n-weighted images (TR\u2009=\u20094500\u2009msec, TE\u2009=\u200920, 60, 100, and 140\u2009msec, RARE factor 2, FOV\u2009=\u200914\u2009\u00d7\u200914\u2009mm\n2\n, matrix\u2009=\u2009140\u2009\u00d7\u2009140\u2009\u00d7\u200918 for s-mTBI and TE\u2009=\u200910, 30, 50, 70, 90, 110, and 130\u2009msec and matrix\u2009=\u2009100\u2009\u00d7\u2009100\u2009\u00d7\u200918 for r-mTBI, with slice thickness\u2009=\u20090.75\u2009mm). Body temperature was maintained at 36\u00b0C by circulating hot water. Respiration and heart rate were monitored throughout each 2-h imaging session.\n\nMagnetic resonance image analysis\nEach ROI for analysis was manually drawn on five consecutive coronal slices of the non-diffusion-weighted (b\u2009=\u20090\u2009s/mm\n2\n) images (one rostral to bregma, one at the coronal level of bregma, and three caudal to bregma). A single-voxel width was used for the corpus callosum ROI. ROIs in the medial cerebral cortex were drawn in both hemispheres superior to the corpus callosum, while keeping one voxel distance of separation from the corpus callosum and cortical surface to avoid partial volume effects. The peak of the cingulum was used to delineate the border of the medial cortical ROIs. Multiple ROIs were drawn on test scans for standardization before analysis of the study data sets. The individual drawing the ROI for the quantitative analysis was blinded to the animal condition.\nDiffusion data were analyzed using TORTOISE software.\n34\nAn average non-diffusion-weighted image (b\u2009=\u20090\u2009s/mm\n2\nimage) and all seven diffusion-weighted images were used in the analysis. Diffusion weighted imaging artifacts, including motion, eddy current, and concomitant field distortions, were calculated and combined to enable the image correction to be applied in a single step. This process was used to minimize interpolation errors in the corrected data. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean (MD), axial (AD), and radial (RD) diffusivity maps were calculated by the linear least squares method of tensor estimation. Diffusion direction-encoded color (DEC) maps output from the TOROTOISE software were used to demonstrate fiber orientation in the corpus callosum and cortical regions.\n35\nKurtosis data were pre-processed with TORTOISE, and each voxel was analyzed using in-house\u2013developed software in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA) according to a previously published method provided by University of Maryland. Essentially, this software routine fits the logarithm of the normalized signal intensity versus the b-values using linear least squares to a quadratic function.\n26\nThe signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the diffusion-weighted images was >10 for b\u2009=\u20092800 and >50 for b\u2009=\u20090\u2009s/mm\n2\nimages, respectively, where SNR was calculated as: [(0.655\u2009\u00d7\u2009signal)/standard deviation of an ROI in the background of the image)]. The average ROI (corpus callosum and cortex) signal was a factor of 3 greater than the average background signal for b\u2009=\u20092800\u2009s/mm\n2\nand 14 for b\u2009=\u20090\u2009s/mm\n2\n. Quadratic fits to the raw data were robust for the ROIs interrogated with adjusted\nR\n2\n>\u20090.99. The mean kurtosis (MK) was calculated by averaging the apparent kurtosis (K\napp\n) in 30 directions:\nAxial kurtosis (K\na\n) and radial kurtosis (K\nr\n) maps, which characterize the kurtosis along the axial and radial diffusion directions, respectively, were calculated from the three eigenvalues derived from the diffusion kurtosis tensor as described by Jensen and colleagues.\n36\nThe corpus callosum and medial cortical ROIs were overlaid onto DTI and DKI maps for further quantitative analysis.\n\nTissue analysis\nMice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were further post-fixed by immersion in the same fixative overnight, cryopreserved, and then cut as coronal sections (14\u2009\u03bcm). Prussian blue staining combined with pararosaniline nuclear stain (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was used to detect hemosiderin-laden macrophages indicative of previous microbleeds.\nImmunohistochemical analysis was used to assess axon damage based on \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (\u03b2-APP)\n37\n(polyclonal rabbit anti-\u03b2-APP antibody; 1:100; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Microglia/macrophages were detected based on CD11b (monoclonal rat anti-CD11b; 1:100; Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Astrocytes were evaluated by immunostaining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; polyclonal rabbit anti-GFAP; 1:1000; DAKO, Carpinteria, CA). Myelination was estimated by detection of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG; 1:20, monoclonal mouse anti-MOG immunoglobulin G [IgG]\n38\n). The oligodendrocyte progenitor response was evaluated by immunostaining for neural antigen 2 (NG2; polyclonal rabbit anti-NG2 ectodomain; 1:500; gift from William Stallcup, La Jolla, CA). Accumulation of phosphorylated tau was examined using antibodies against anti-phospho-Ser396Tau (mouse monoclonal IgG, 355300; 1:400; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and AT8 antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-PHF-tau pSer202+Thr205; 1:400; Thermo Fisher Scientific).\nAstrogliosis, microglia/macrophage activation, and myelination were estimated from the area of immunoreactivity for GFAP, CD11b, or MOG within the CC or medial cortex using Metamorph (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA) as previously detailed.\n20\n,\n38\nIn addition, microglia/macrophage cells were also quantified by manual counting of the morphological phenotype for resting, activated, or amoeboid stages.\n20\nAmong mice perfused for post-imaging analysis, 1 r-sham and 1 r-mTBI mouse were omitted because of technical concerns limiting quantification across the full set of regions in the double immunostain for CD11b and GFAP at the coronal levels matched to DTI-DKI slice at bregma. Damaged axons were quantified based on \u03b2-APP immunoreactivity, which was counted as a single damaged axon for accumulation as a large end bulb or as multiple swellings aligned along a longitudinal axonal profile.\nThy1-YFP-16 mice were used to visualize a high density of neurons in their entirety, including axons, cell bodies, and dendritic processes. Sections were prepared as above for immunohistochemistry. Nuclei were stained blue with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma-Aldrich) whereas rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm of the cell bodies was stained red with a fluorescent version of Nissl histological stain (NeuroTrace red; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Damaged axons were quantified based on YFP in axons with swellings using the same morphological characteristics as for \u03b2-APP above.\nBright-field images were captured using an Olympus Nanozoomer (Olympus, Center Valley, PA). Fluorescent wide-field images were acquired on an Olympus IX-70 microscope (Olympus). Optical image fluorescent image stacks were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 700 (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Thornwood, NY).\n\nSocial interaction assessment\nThe social interaction assessment was carried out using a three-chamber sociability test apparatus (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL) as previously described, with minor modification.\n39\n,\n40\nThe test mouse was first placed in the middle chamber and allowed 10\u2009min to explore all chambers for habituation to the apparatus. A small wire enclosure was introduced to each of the side chambers and the mouse was allowed to explore all chambers for 10\u2009min for habituation to the enclosures as novel objects. Social approach was then tested by placing an unfamiliar male C57BL/6J mouse (stranger) into one of the wire enclosures. The test mouse was again placed into the middle chamber and allowed to explore among the three chambers for 10\u2009min. The movement of the test mouse was video recorded to determine the time related to social approach (defined as movement toward, circling, or sniffing of the stranger mouse in the wire enclosure) using ANY-Maze software (Stoelting Co.) as analyzed by an observer blinded to the treatment condition. Mice were run in two independent cohorts of 12 mice that each had 6 mice assigned to each condition. The total assay included 24 mice, with 12 injured and 12 matched sham mice.\n\nComplex wheel-running assay\nMotor skill learning and bilateral sensorimotor coordination were assessed using a complex wheel-running assay.\n41\u201343\nRunning wheels were placed in home cages equipped with an optical sensor to detect wheel revolutions and determine the daily maximal running velocity using Activity Monitoring Software (Lafayette Instruments, Lafayette, IN) over a 3-week period. A regular \u201ctraining\u201d wheel with evenly spaced rungs was in the cages for 1 week to reduce variability in running behavior. Mice then underwent r-mTBI or r-sham procedures. Training wheels were then replaced with \u201ccomplex\u201d wheels, which have irregularly spaced rungs.\n41\n,\n42\nMice were run in two independent cohorts that each had 6 mice assigned to each condition. The total assay included 24 mice, with 12 injured and 12 matched sham mice. Social interaction cohorts were separate mice from those used on the wheel assay.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism software (version 6; GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc Bonferroni comparison was used to compare TBI with yoked shams across time points for longitudinal analyses. One-way ANOVA was used to compare data among multiple groups for a single condition or time point of tissue analysis, which included three tissue sections/mouse. Post-hoc comparisons were made among the relevant pairs (each TBI model vs. matched sham; single vs. repetitive TBI models). The Student's\nt\n-test was used to compare between two groups for a single condition or time point. Pearson's correlation was used for analysis of the relationship between radiological and pathological findings. Statistical significance was defined as\np\n<\u20090.05. MRI quantitative analysis was performed independent of post-imaging tissue analysis. All quantification was performed with blinding for the condition."

After endotracheal intubation, the rats were secured in a stereotaxic frame and ventilated mechanically. Core temperature was maintained at 37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u00b0C with a heating blanket. Using aseptic procedures, a midline scalp incision was made, the skin and fascia were reflected to expose the skull, and a craniectomy (6\u2009mm in diameter) was made in the right hemisphere with a trephine. The craniectomy was enlarged further with rongeurs to accommodate the 6-mm impact tip. Subsequently, the impacting rod was extended and the impact tip was centered and lowered through the craniectomy until it touched the dura mater, then the rod was retracted and the impact tip was advanced 2.8\u2009mm farther to produce a brain injury of moderate severity (2.8\u2009mm tissue deformation at 4\u2009m/sec). Immediately after the CCI, anesthesia was discontinued, the incision was sutured, and the rats were extubated and assessed for acute neurological outcome. Sham rats underwent similar surgical procedures, but did not receive the impact.\nPost-surgery\nAfter surgery, the rats were randomly assigned to four TBI groups, which are represented as TBI + STD + GAL (1\u2009mg/kg;\nn\n=\u20098), TBI + STD + GAL (2\u2009mg/kg;\nn\n=\u20098), TBI + STD + GAL (3\u2009mg/kg;\nn\n=\u20098), TBI + STD + vehicle (VEH; 1\u2009mL/kg;\nn\n=\u20098) and four sham control groups (\nn\n=\u20094 per group) that received the same doses of GAL and VEH as their TBI counterparts.\nAcute neurological evaluation\nHind limb reflexive ability was assessed immediately after the discontinuation of anesthesia by gently squeezing the rats' paw every 5\u2009sec and recording the latency to elicit a withdrawal response. Return of the righting reflex was determined by the time required to turn from the supine to prone position on three consecutive trials.\nDrug administration\nGAL (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was prepared daily by dissolving in sterile saline, which also served as the VEH. GAL (1, 2, or 3\u2009mg/kg) or a comparable volume of VEH (1\u2009mL/kg) was administered intraperitoneally beginning 24\u2009h after cortical impact or sham injury and once daily for 3 weeks. On the days of behavioral testing, the injections were administered 1\u2009h prior to testing. The doses were selected based on preliminary data from our laboratory showing a narrow therapeutic range. The route of administration is standard protocol in our laboratory.\n58\u201361\n,\n63\n,\n64\n,\n67\u201369\nMotor function\nMotor performance was assessed using well-established and well-documented beam-balance and beam-walk tasks.\n58\u201361\n,\n63\n,\n64\n,\n67\n,\n68\n,\n70\nBriefly, beam-balance consisted of placing the rat on an elevated narrow beam (1.5\u2009cm wide) and recording the time it remained on for a maximum of 60\u2009sec. Beam-walk consisted of recording the elapsed time to traverse the beam (2.5\u2009cm wide\u2009\u00d7\u2009100\u2009cm long). Pre-assessment was conducted prior to surgery (to establish a baseline measure), as well as on post-operative Days 1\u20135, and consisted of three trials (60\u2009sec allotted time) per day on each task. The average daily scores for each subject were used in the statistical analyses.\nCognitive function: spatial learning\nAcquisition of spatial learning was assessed using a Morris water maze (MWM) task.\n71\nThe maze consisted of a plastic pool (180\u2009cm diameter; 60\u2009cm high) filled with tap water (26\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C) to a depth of 28\u2009cm and was positioned in a room with salient visual cues. The platform was a clear Plexiglas stand (10\u2009cm diameter, 26\u2009cm high) that was positioned 26\u2009cm from the maze wall in the southwest quadrant and held constant for each rat. Spatial learning consisted of providing four blocks of daily trials (4\u2009min inter-trial interval) for 5 consecutive days (post-operative Days 14\u201318) in which the rat was given a maximum of 120\u2009sec to find the hidden platform (2\u2009cm below the water surface). On post-operative Day 19, the platform was raised 2\u2009cm above the water surface, making it visible to the rat; this manipulation served as a control to determine the contributions of non-spatial factors (e.g., sensorimotor performance, motivation, and visual acuity) on cognitive performance. Each trial lasted until the rat climbed onto the platform or the maximum allotted time had elapsed. If the rats did not find the platform within the given time, they were manually guided to it. All rats remained on the platform for 30\u2009sec, then were returned to a heated incubator between trials. The times of the four daily trials for each rat were averaged and used in the statistical analyses. A spontaneous motor activity recording and tracking system (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA) was used to record the data, which included time to locate the platform and percent time in the target quadrant.\nHistology: quantification of cortical lesion volume\nThree weeks after CCI or sham injury the rats were anesthetized with Fatal-Plus (0.3\u2009mL, intraperitoneally), then perfused transcardially with 200\u2009mL 0.1\u2009M phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) followed by 300\u2009mL 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were extracted, post-fixed in the perfusate for 1 week, dehydrated with alcohols, and embedded in paraffin. Coronal sections (7-\u03bcm thick) were cut at 1-mm intervals through the lesion on a rotary microtome and mounted on Superfrost/Plus glass microscope slides. After drying at room temperature, the sections were deparaffinized in xylenes, rehydrated, and stained with cresyl violet. Cortical lesion volumes (mm\n3\n) were determined by calculating the area of the lesion (mm\n2\n), which was done by outlining the inferred area of missing cortical tissue for each section (typically 5\u20137) taken at 1-mm intervals (MCID, Imaging Research, Ontario, Canada), then by summing the lesions obtained from each section as previously reported.\n50\n,\n68\n,\n69\n,\n72\n,\n73\n\nExperiment 2: combined therapeutic paradigm, GAL + EE\nSubjects and surgery\nAn additional 24 adult male rats were added to this experiment, which consisted of two TBI groups (\nn\n=\u20098 per group) and two sham control groups (\nn\n=\u20094 per group) denoted as TBI + EE + VEH (1\u2009mL/kg), TBI + EE + GAL (2\u2009mg/kg), Sham + EE + VEH (1\u2009mL/kg), and Sham + EE + GAL (2\u2009mg/kg). Initial housing, motor pre-training, surgery, and acute neurological evaluation were identical to that described for experiment 1. These groups were compared with the TBI + STD + VEH and TBI + STD + GAL (2.0\u2009mg/kg) groups and their respective sham controls from experiment 1. Given that experiment 1 and experiment 2 were conducted in close proximity (within a week) by the same personnel, we felt there were no confounds that could affect the outcomes and hence it was unnecessary to use more rats, which is in line with the University of Pittsburgh IACUC and National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines. Assessment of motor and cognitive function, as well as histological outcomes for experiment 2, were performed exactly as for experiment 1.\nDrug administration\nThe dose of GAL for comparison between the STD and EE groups was selected based on the finding from experiment 1 showing that 2\u2009mg/kg was most effective. Drug preparation and route and frequency of administration were identical to that described for experiment 1.\nHousing conditions: environmental manipulation\nFollowing surgery and after the effects of anesthesia abated (as evidenced by spontaneous movement in the holding cage), the rats were returned to the colony where those designated for enrichment were immediately placed in specifically designed steel-wire cages (91\u2009\u00d7\u200976\u2009\u00d7\u200950\u2009cm). The EE cages consisted of three levels with ladders to ambulate from one level to another and contained various toys (e.g., balls, blocks, and tubes), nesting materials (e.g., paper towels), and\nad libitum\nfood and water.\n50\n,\n53\n,\n54\n,\n74\nTo maintain novelty, the objects were rearranged every day and changed each time the cage was cleaned, which was twice per week. Ten to 12 rats, which included GAL and VEH-treated TBI and sham controls, were housed in the EE together to minimize variability among the groups. Rats in the STD conditions were placed in typical shoebox cages (37\u2009\u00d7\u200925\u2009\u00d7\u200918\u2009cm, two rats per cage) with only food and water.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll analyses were performed using StatView 5.0.1 software (Abacus Concepts, Inc.) on data collected by blinded experimenters. The motor and cognitive analyses were conducted using repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). The acute neurological data (i.e., hind limb withdrawal reflex and righting reflex), as well as the data for the visible platform, probe trial, swim speed, and cortical lesion volume, were analyzed using one-factor ANOVAs. When the overall ANOVA revealed significant effects, the Newman-Keuls\npost hoc\ntest was used to determine specific group differences. The results are expressed as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (standard error of the mean [SEM]) and were considered significant when\np\n\u2264\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Of the 33 different compounds reviewed, 17 have only been evaluated once, and half of these were administered as a pretreatment only. Although much can be learned from pre-injury treatment, post-trauma therapeutics are the aim of pharmacological intervention. Two variables that significantly complicate interpretation are the dose of the pharmaceutical and the duration of the therapy. Approximately half of the studies evaluating phytochemicals gave a single post-injury injection of a particular compound. Many studies gave multiple doses ranging from a few hours to a week post-injury. Of the 33 different natural compounds evaluated, only 12 were investigated using a dose-response paradigm that included at least three different levels of the compound.63,69,78,80,83,91,101,126,127,129,151,167,171,183Most studies simply used a dose taken from the literature, possibly unrelated to brain injury. Often doses are arbitrarily altered depending upon whether the subject is an adult rat or mouse.\n\nThe type of injury model is extremely important, because different models produce dramatically different histological outcomes. For example, there are fundamental differences in the histopathology associated with different weight-drop models of TBI, and very often researchers inappropriately equate injuries produced with the Marmarou, Feeney, and Shohami models.90,109,184,185There are multiple excellent reviews that have detailed not only the histopathology associated with each model but also the type of cognitive and behavioral changes associated with each.186\u2013191Injury severity is also extremely important in determining the potential therapeutic value of a compound. In most of the studies evaluated in this review, the injury severity is not clearly stated, and no reference is provided that the particular injury model can produce a range of severities. A pharmaceutical applied following a severe cortical contusion will most likely not produce the same beneficial effect compared with a mild or moderate injury. If a compound is reported to help with a mild TBI, one needs to know how that level of injury is actually evaluated. Unless the reader is aware of the magnitude of the histopathology, or representations of the injury are provided, it is difficult to evaluate the results. Subtle differences in the placement of an injury can dramatically alter the histopathology and behavioral outcome.192,193Post-injury evaluation of dependent variables is critical to proper assessment of therapeutic outcome.\n\nSome measures of SIC have time and methodological constraints to properly evaluate pharmacological effect. For example, edema needs to be assessed within 24\u201348\u2009h post-trauma. Neuronal degeneration as evaluated by FJB has a critical time-dependent assessment window of 24\u201348\u2009h.194Evaluation of many aspects of a neuroscore, which include measures of motor deficits such as beam balance, rotarod, and grip strength, is also time dependent, because many of these behaviors spontaneously recover over time. Cognitive tests such as the MWM must allow subjects to recover from the surgical procedures before they can be properly tested. Finally, assessment of overall neuronal loss and changes in injury volume should be performed in an unbiased fashion using routine stereological methods.195\u2013198"

    "Methods": "Subjects\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats obtained from Harlan (Houston, TX) were used as subjects. Animals were 90\u2013110 days old (300\u2013350\u2009g) and were individually housed in Plexiglas bins (45.7 [length]\u2009\u00d7\u200923.5 [width]\u2009\u00d7\u200920.3 [height] cm) with food and water available\nad libitum\n. Animals were maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle. Except where noted, all behavioral testing occurred during the light portion of the cycle.\nAll of the experiments were reviewed and approved by the institutional care committee at Texas A&M University and all National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines for the care and use of animal subjects were followed.\n\nSurgical procedure\nJugular catheterization\nTo allow for the administration of morphine, all subjects were implanted with a jugular catheter.\n8\n,\n30\nRats were anesthetized using a combination of ketamine 80\u2009mg/kg and xylazine 10\u2009mg/kg intraperitoneally (IP). While under anesthesia, a catheter consisting of a length of PE50 tubing was inserted into and tied to the jugular vein. Using an 11-gauge stainless steel tube as a guide, this catheter was passed subcutaneously through the body of the animal so that it exited in the back. A back mount cannula pedestal (model 313-00BM-10-SPC; Plastics One Inc., Roanoke, VA) was then implanted subcutaneously and connected to the catheter. The back mount exited the skin between the scapulae and was covered with a dust cap. All incisions were closed using VetBond.\nFor the first 24\u2009h after the surgical procedure, the rats were housed in a recovery room maintained at 26.6\u00b0C. The subjects were treated with penicillin G potassium 100,000\u2009U/kg (IP) immediately after the operation and again 2 days later. To help maintain hydration, the subjects were also given 3.0\u2009mL of saline (0.9%, IP) after the operation. During the 5-day recovery period after the operation and before any drug treatments, the catheters were flushed with heparinized saline (100\u2009U/mL, 0.25\u2009mL).\nContusion SCI\nFive days after the implantation of the jugular catheter, subjects were given a moderate contusion injury. Briefly, subjects were anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane (5% to induce anesthesia and 2\u20133% for maintenance). The subject's back was shaved and disinfected with iodine, and a 5.0\u2009cm incision was made over the spinal cord. Two incisions were made along the vertebral column, on each side of the dorsal spinous processes, extending about 2\u2009cm rostral and caudal to the T12 segment. Muscle and connective tissue were then dissected to expose the underlying vertebral segments. Musculature around the transverse processes was cleared to allow for clamping of the vertebral spinal column. Next, the dorsal spinous process at T12 was removed, and the spinal tissue exposed. The dura remained intact.\nThe vertebral column was fixed within the Infinite Horizons impactor (Precision Systems Instrumentation) using two pairs of Adson forceps. A moderate injury was produced using an impact force of 150 kdynes and a 1\u2009sec dwell time. The wound was closed with Michel clips. Sham subjects received a laminectomy only.\nFor the first 24\u2009h after the operation, the rats were housed in a recovery room as described previously. All subjects were treated with penicillin G potassium 100,000\u2009U/kg (IP) immediately after the operation and again two days later. To help maintain hydration, the subjects were also given 3.0\u2009mL of saline (0.9%, IP) after the operation. Subjects\u2019 bladders were expressed manually in the morning (8:00\u20139:30\nam\n) and evening (6:00\u20137:30\npm\n) until they regained bladder control, which was defined as three consecutive days with an empty bladder at the time of expression.\n\nDrug administration\nMorphine was administered intravenously (IV) beginning 24\u2009h after the contusion or sham injury. Half of the subjects (\nn\n=\u20099, for the contused and sham groups) were given 5\u2009mg morphine/infusions/h through the back mount attached to the jugular catheter for seven days on the following schedule: 10\u2009mg (days one and two), 20\u2009mg (days three and four), and 30\u2009mg (days five, six, and seven). Control animals (\nn\n=\u20099, for the contused and sham groups) received an equivalent number (and volume) of infusions of 0.9% saline.\nThe doses of morphine used in this study were derived from previous studies testing analgesia and self-administration.\n8\nWhile these doses are higher than those used clinically (up to 120\u2009mg per day), doses used in rodent studies cannot be equated to those applied in the clinical setting. The lethal dose (LD)\n50\nis more than 100-fold higher for rats than humans,\n31\nand although some studies suggest that the plasma half-life of morphine is very similar for rats and humans,\n32\nthe Kp,uu (ratio between brain and blood unbound drug concentrations) and active influx and efflux processes differ across species and conditions.\n33\u201335\nFor example, P-glycoproteins actively transport morphine out of the central nervous system in rats, but this efflux transporter appears to play little role in brain drug concentrations in humans.\n36\nNotably, P-glycoproteins are upregulated after a rodent spinal contusion injury.\n37\nFurther, in the clinical setting, supplemental analgesics, such as NSAIDS, will increase the elimination half-life of morphine. For example, Diclofenac (2-[(2,6-dichlorophenyl)amino]benzene acetate), an effective and frequently prescribed NSAID, is metabolized by the UGT2B7 (UDP-glucuronosyltransferases 2B7). UGT2B7 is the only known enzyme to catalyze the formation of the 6-O-glucuronides of opiates.\n38\nKing and coworkers\n39\ndemonstrated that diclofenac inhibited the glucuronidation of morphine. Drug interactions will alter the pharmacokinetics of opioids administered in the clinical setting.\nIn the current study, the escalating dose of morphine administration across days was based on the self-administration behavior previously described for this rodent model of SCI. While lower doses of morphine also undermine recovery of function after SCI, these doses were chosen because they produce robust effects on functional recovery with a small sample size (\nn\n=\u20094 per experimental condition\n8\n).\n\nAssessment of the analgesic efficacy of morphine\nSensory reactivity tests were conducted on days one, three, five, and seven before administration of drugs and approximately 30\u2009min after the last infusion of morphine, allowing for the assessment of opioid-induced hyperalgesia/allodynia and tolerance,\n40\n,\n41\nrespectively. Thermal (heat) reactivity was assessed using the tail-flick test. Subjects were placed in clear Plexiglas tubes with their tail positioned in a 0.5\u2009cm deep groove, cut into an aluminum block, and allowed to acclimate to the apparatus (IITC Inc., Life Science, CA) and testing room for 15\u2009min. The testing room was maintained at 26.5\u00b0C.\nThermal thresholds were then assessed, using a halogen light that was focused on the rat's tail. Before testing, the temperature of the light focused on the tail was set to elicit a baseline tail flick response in 3\u20134\u2009sec (average) in intact rats. This pre-set temperature was maintained across all subjects. In testing, the latency to flick the tail away from the radiant heat source (light) was recorded. If a subject failed to respond, the test trial was automatically terminated after 8\u2009sec of heat exposure, to avoid tissue damage. Two tests occurred at 2-min intervals; the tail flick latencies recorded on the second test were used as indices of nociceptive reactivity.\nMechanical reactivity was assessed using von Frey stimuli (Semmes-Weinstein Anesthesiometer; Stoelting Co., Chicago, IL) applied to the plantar surface of the hindpaws. Subjects were placed into the clear Plexiglas tubes with both hindlimbs outside the tube and hanging freely. After a 15-min acclimation period, the von Frey stimuli were applied sequentially at approximately 2-sec intervals until subjects withdrew the paw and vocalized. If no response was observed, testing was terminated at a force of 300\ng\n. Each subject was tested twice on each foot in a counterbalanced ABBA order. Test sequences were spaced 2\u2009min apart.\n\nAssessment of recovery\nLocomotor behavior was assessed using the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) rating scale\n42\nin an open enclosure (99\u2009cm diameter and 23\u2009cm deep) on the day after the contusion injury. The subjects were acclimated to the apparatus for 5\u2009min per day for three days before the surgical procedure. At 24\u2009h after the operation, each subject was placed in the open field and observed for 4\u2009min to assess locomotor function. All observers had high intra- and interobserver reliability (all r's >0.89) and were blind to the subjects\u2019 experimental treatment.\n\nHistology and immunohistochemistry\nTwenty-four hours after the final administration of morphine, on day eight post-injury, 12 subjects (Sham + Vehicle [\nn\n=\u20093], Sham + Morphine [\nn\n=\u20093], SCI + Vehicle [\nn\n=\u20093], SCI + Morphine [\nn\n=\u20093]) were anesthetized deeply with pentobarbital (50\u2009mg/kg) and perfused intracardially with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. A 1\u2009cm section of spinal cord surrounding the lesion center was removed and post-fixed in 4% PFA for 2\u2009h and then transferred to 30% sucrose for cryoprotection. After a minimum of 72\u2009h in sucrose, the section of cord was frozen in a cryomold with optimal cutting temperature compound. Twenty micron coronal sections were cut with a cryostat (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). Sections were then used for staining with cresyl violet for Nissl substance and Luxol\n\u00ae\nfast blue for myelin\n43\n,\n44\nor immunofluorescence labeling.\nLuxol fast blue and cresyl violet\nFor these sections, the total cross-sectional area of the cord and spared tissue was assessed across the rostral-caudal extent of the lesion using Neurolucida software (MicrobrightField, Williston, VT).\n7\nThree sections were traced and analyzed to derive tissue sparing at the center of the lesion (\u2212600, 0, + 600\u2009\u03bcm from lesion center), as well as rostral (\u22121200, 1800, 2400\u2009\u03bcm) and caudal (+1200, 1800, 2400\u2009\u03bcm) to the lesion center. To determine the area of lesion, an observer who was blinded to the experimental treatments traced around the boundaries of cystic formations and areas of dense gliosis.\n7\nNissl-stained areas that contained neurons and glia of approximately normal densities denoted residual gray matter. White matter was judged spared in myelin-stained areas lacking dense gliosis and swollen fibers. These analyses yielded three parameters for each section: white matter area, gray matter area, and lesion area.\nTo control for variability in section area across subjects, we applied a correction factor derived from our sham vehicle animals. This correction factor\n45\nwas based on section widths and was multiplied by all area measurements to standardize area across analyses. By standardizing areas across sections, we were able to estimate the degree to which tissue is \u201cmissing\u201d (i.e., tissue loss from atrophy, necrosis, or apoptosis). An accurate assessment of the degree to which a treatment has impacted, or lesioned, the cord includes both the remaining \u201cdamaged\u201d tissue as well as resolved lesioned areas. When we sum the amount of \u201cmissing\u201d tissue and the \u201cdamaged\u201d area, we derive an index of the relative lesion (% relative lesion) in each section that is comparable across sections. We can also compute the relative percent of gray and white matter remaining in each section, relative to sham controls.\nImmunohistochemistry\nImmunohistochemistry was used to determine the effect of SCI and morphine on the expression of neurons, microglia, and astrocytes. The spinal cord sections were washed (3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009min) with 1X PBS, then incubated in blocking solution (3% normal goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 60\u2009min at room temperature. Sections were then incubated with markers for neurons (NeuN, 1:400, Millipore, Bedford, MA; NF, 1:300, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP], 1:500, BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA; S-100, 1:300, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) or microglia (OX42/CD11b/c, 1:1000, BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA; IBA1, 1:300, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) overnight in blocking solution at room temperature or 4\n\u00b0\nC (depending on the primary antibody).\nThe following day, all slides were washed in cold PBS, and incubated in the appropriate Alexa fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse, 1:300; Invitrogen, Eugene) prepared in blocking solution for 2\u2009h at room temperature. After another series of washes in PBS (3\u2009\u00d7\u200915\u2009min), the slides were mounted with Prolong Gold anti-fading mounting medium with DAPI (Life Technologies, NY). To provide converging evidence for neurotoxicity, a subset of the slides were also stained with Fluoro-Jade C (ATT Bioquest, Sunnyvale, CA).\nAfter washing in PBS, as described above, the slides were transferred to a 0.06% potassium permanganate solution for 10\u2009min at room temperature. The sections were then rinsed in distilled water and immersed in a 0.001% Fluoro-Jade\n\u00ae\nC working solution for 10\u2009min. After rinsing the slides in distilled water (3\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009min), the slides were incubated with DAPI for 15\u2009min. The sections were air-dried overnight, immersed in xylene (3\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009min), and cover-slipped.\nDigital image analyses were performed using the basic densitometric thresholding features of a Virtual Tissue 2D program (Microbrightfield Biosciences, Williston, VT) and Image J (National Institutes of Health). Contiguous images of the spinal sections were captured using the Virtual Tissue 2D system at 4X magnification. The Virtual Tissue 2D program aligns, stitches, and blends the section together into a montage, providing a complete image of the total lesion area and spared tissue.\nUsing Image J software, the perimeter of each lesion was digitally outlined, and background labeling was subtracted from all images. For quantification of neurons, with Image J, the size and circularity of the target particles were defined, and the counts generated by the program were recorded. For quantification of astrocytes and Fluoro-Jade C expression, a threshold value was obtained for each image ensuring that all labeled cells were selected (i.e., target area). The magnitude of Alexa fluor expression was reported as the proportional area\u2014i.e., ratio of target to scan area.\nBecause the microglia in the contused sections were densely stacked, we used confocal microscopy (Olympus FV300 confocal microscope with a Plan Apo N 60 to acquire image stacks throughout the\nz\nplane of the section) coupled with unbiased stereology (StereoInvestigator, Microbrightfield Biosciences, Williston, VT) to quantify expression. For these analyses, a digital point grid was randomly overlaid on each image, and the number of cells falling within the tissue area were recorded. Separate counts of ramified (quiescent) or amoeboid (activated) microglia were derived.\nAn average number of 110-130 sites per section were counted for three sections across the center of the injury only. The following parameters were used: height of optical dissector, 15\u2009\u03bcm; average grid size, 225\u2009\u00d7\u2009225\u2009\u03bcm\n2\n; counting frame size, 60\u2009\u00d7\u200960\u2009\u03bcm\n2\n; and section thickness, 20\u2009\u03bcm. Z-series images were taken with an interstack interval of 1\u2009\u03bcm. Bandpass filter and laser settings were optimized on control tissue and then held constant for the duration of the experiment.\n\nStatistical analyses\nComparisons between the effects of morphine on recovery of function and immunohistochemical end-points were analyzed using mixed design analysis of variants (ANOVAs). Significant effects were analyzed further with pair-wise one way ANOVAs. In both the text and figures, all data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM).\nLocomotor scores were transformed to help assure that the data were amendable to parametric analyses.\n46\nThis transformation pools BBB scores 2\u20134, removing a discontinuity in the scale. The transformation also pools scores from a region of the scale (14\u201321) that is seldom used for a moderate contusion injury. By pooling these scores, we obtain an ordered scale that is relatively continuous with units that have approximately equivalent interval spacing. Meeting these criteria improves the justification for parametric statistical analyses and increases statistical power."

    "Methods": "Subjects and outline\nFourteen adult domestic shorthaired cats (Liberty Research Inc., Waverly, NY) were used for this study. All animal procedures were conducted under a protocol approved by the Drexel University College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and in accordance with the National Institute of Health\nGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\nas well as all United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulations governing the use of felines in research.\nCats were acclimated to handling for 1 week before any experimental or training procedures began. Once comfortable with handling, cats were trained to walk on a treadmill for 3\u20136 weeks until they were capable of uninterrupted, well-behaved walking for 20\u2009min at speeds ranging from 0.3 to 0.8\u2009m/sec. After treadmill training, cats were assigned to one of four groups: control (CONTROL,\nn\n=\u20092), acute autologous fibroblast graft (ACUTE,\nn\n=\u20092), sub-chronic autologous fibroblast graft (SUB-CHRONIC,\nn\n=\u20096), or chronic autologous fibroblast graft (CHRONIC,\nn\n=\u20094).\nFigure 1\noutlines the experimental protocol. Cell biopsy was performed for each cat in the neurotrophin-treated groups.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExperimental timeline. Following treadmill acclimation and acquisition of pre-transection walking data, neurotrophin-treated cats underwent surgery to obtain fibroblast samples. Those fibroblasts were transfected to express brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or neurotrophic factor 3 (NT-3) with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter. No fibroblasts were collected in CONTROL animals. All cats received a complete transection at the T11/T12 spinal level. ACUTE group cats received a graft of modified autologous fibroblasts at the time of surgery; other cats received this graft after a delay. CONTROL cats underwent a mock grafting surgery 2 weeks post-transection, when the injury site was debrided as for the neurotrophin- treated groups, but no cells were implanted into the cavity site. CHRONIC group cats had an extra treadmill recording session 5 weeks after injury (1 week before grafting) to assess any natural recovery. Kinematic recordings were made at 3 and 5 weeks post-grafting for all cats. Some animals survived to 12 weeks with extra recording sessions. Histological evaluation was performed after the last kinematic recording for all cats.\nBoth CONTROL cats underwent a T11-T12 spinal transection followed by a 2 week delay and a sham graft surgery. For sham grafts, the lesion site was debrided as for the other groups, but the cavity was left empty. ACUTE group cats received modified fibroblasts into the lesion site at the time of injury. SUB-CHRONIC cats received the graft 2 weeks after the transection, and CHRONIC cats received the graft 6 weeks after transection. Treadmill recording sessions occurred 3, 5, and in some cases 8 and 12 weeks after grafting.\nOne cat (SUB-CHRONIC-6) received a graft of cells but was euthanized after 1 week to evaluate graft survival. Biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) tracers were delivered to three cats in the CHRONIC group, as described subsequently.\n\nFibroblast collection and preparation\nAutologous fibroblasts were obtained for all graft cats via skin biopsy. Four 6\u2009mm skin punches were obtained from the lower abdomen of the anesthetized animal. The skin punch injuries were closed with 5-0 Prolene surgical sutures.\nAfter collection, skin biopsy samples were cultured in an incubator to allow for expansion and collection of fibroblasts. Cell culturing used a medium of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). When 1,500,000 fibroblasts had been collected, cells were split into two groups and infected via lentivirus with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or neurotrophic factor 3 (NT-3), following a procedure previously described by Blesch.\n20\nBriefly, cells were expanded until \u223c3,000,000 were available, at which point the cells were split into two plates. A lentiviral vector expressing BDNF or NT-3 was added to each set of cells, resulting in one cell line expressing BDNF, and one expressing NT-3. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) was included in the transgene as a reporter. Following infection, cells were expanded until \u223c5,000,000 each of BDNF-infected and NT-3-infected cells were available. To ensure that cells produced effective levels of neurotrophic factors, cells were observed under the microscope for activity of the GFP reporter gene. Before grafting, cell populations were confirmed to have a minimum of 30% of the cells expressing the reporter. Total preparation time for the graft from collection to the preferred cell count took \u223c6 weeks; cells were frozen at \u221280\u00b0C to maintain stocks if necessitated by scheduling. For grafting, cells were suspended in sterile DMEM with 30% FBS and placed on ice; the supernatant fluid was separated and removed immediately prior to grafting. Any cells remaining after grafting were maintained to acquire supernatant for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ELISA was performed with a Human BDNF or Human NT-3 ELISA kit (DuoSet ELISA Development System, Human BDNF Cat No. DY 267 or Human NT-3 Cat No. 248). In some cases (SUB-CHRONIC-6, CHRONIC-2, CHRONIC-4), no cells remained after grafting, and, therefore, no neurotrophin production data were available for those cats.\n\nSpinal transection and graft delivery\nCats were anesthetized and prepared for surgery in accordance with Drexel University Laboratory Animal Resources policy. A midline incision was made in the skin overlying T9 to L1. Blunt dissection was used to separate the muscle from the spinal vertebrae. Rongeurs were used to remove the dorsal process of the T11 vertebra; the T12 dorsal process was left minimally damaged and served as a landmark for subsequent procedures. Upon exposing the spinal cord, the dura mater overlaying the dorsal cord was carefully opened. Once the dura was opened, xylocaine (1%) was applied topically as well as injected (0.2\u20130.3\u2009mL total) into the spinal cord to reduce injury discharge by neurons/axons during transection. The spinal cord was completely severed using microscissors, creating a 3\u20135\u2009mm long \u201cpocket\u201d formed by the dura mater and bordered at the rostral and caudal edges by the cut spinal cord.\nAt the time of grafting, cells were spun down with a tabletop centrifuge for \u223c20\u2009sec. Excess medium was removed with a Hamilton syringe and the cells were again spun down, and excess medium removed. After the second spin, cells were drawn into the Hamilton syringe with 18G needle and delivered into the dura pocket until it was full, from 6,000,000 to 10,00,000 cells depending upon the animal. For SUB-CHRONIC and CHRONIC group cats, as well as untreated injured animals, the cavity was left empty. The dura was sutured closed with 7-0 Prolene in all cases. Following dura closure, muscle and tissue layers were sutured with resorbable 4-0 Vicryl sutures, and the skin closed with 5-0 Prolene.\nFor delayed graft surgery (SUB-CHRONIC, CHRONIC, and CONTROL groups), the same initial procedure was used. Once the dura was opened, the lesion area was debrided, removing scar tissue and taking care not to disturb the uninjured rostral and caudal ends. The lesion was cleared until a cavity 3\u20135\u2009mm in length was available, with no scar or nervous tissue visible within the dura. In SUB-CHRONIC and CHRONIC cats, cells were grafted into this cavity as described. CONTROL cats received no graft or injection at the site; the cavity remained empty. After grafting the dura, muscle, and skin layers were closed as described.\n\nTreadmill acclimation and locomotor recording\nPrior to spinalization, cats were acclimated to the treadmill. Once acclimated, treadmill training sessions lasted 20\u2009min, and were performed once a day, five times a week. The cat was placed inside a clear plexiglass box and given food rewards to maintain forward attention while walking. The treadmill was capable of operation at speeds from 0.2 to 0.8\u2009m/sec. All cats were trained to locomote at all speeds from 0.3 to 0.8\u2009m/sec in 0.1\u2009m/sec increments. Before transection, cats performed quadrupedal stepping; after transection the forepaws rested on a stationary platform suspended 1\u2009cm above the surface during treadmill sessions. Cats were not trained following spinalization, and only stepped on the treadmill during recording sessions. Previous work has indicated that treadmill stepping every 2 weeks is not sufficient to induce a training effect on locomotion.\n12\nData collection was handled by the Vicon Nexus (Vicon Industries, Inc. Hauppauge NY) recording software. Collected data included positions for each of 11 skeletal markers and a video recording (30 fps) of each session.\nFigure 2\nshows the locations of the kinematic markers. Each cat was evaluated on the ability to locomote at all speeds from 0.3 to 0.8\u2009m/sec; to be considered capable of stepping, a cat had to perform 10 consecutive plantar weight-bearing steps at each speed and the speeds below it.\n12\n,\n21\nMarker data were exported and broken into individual steps using custom MATLAB scripts (The MathWorks Inc., Natick MA) and then individually analyzed. Kinematic parameters were calculated for each step with Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Inc. Lake Oswego OR), and exported to SPSS (IBM Corp., Armonk NY) for statistical analyses.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nDiagram of the joint marker locations and kinematic parameters extracted. Reflective markers were temporarily attached to the skin over the\n(A)\nhumeral head,\n(B)\nelbow,\n(C)\nlateral malleolus,\n(D)\nmetacarpophalangeal joint,\n(E)\nsecond forelimb digit,\n(F)\npelvis,\n(G)\nfemoral head,\n(H)\nknee,\n(I)\nankle,\n(J)\nmetatarsophalangeal joint, and\n(K)\nsecond digit of the hindlimb. Stance length, swing height, D\na\n(horizontal displacement of the foot relative to hip at toe-down), D\np\n(horizontal displacement of the foot relative to hip at liftoff), hip height, and hip, knee and ankle angles are illustrated.\nBaseline treadmill kinematics were recorded for all cats before transection. Additionally, stepping ability in CHRONIC cats was evaluated 5 weeks after injury; that is, 1 week before grafting. Post-transection recording sessions occurred 3 and 5 weeks after grafting, and some animals in the CHRONIC graft group underwent additional recording 8 and 12 weeks after grafting. The experimenter held the cat at the base of the tail to provide balance support during recording sessions and perineal stimulation was delivered to maximize locomotor output in each of the animals, as in previous studies.\n12\n,\n21\nOnly perineal stimulation sufficient to initiate stepping was applied, as excessive stimulation can interrupt stepping or cause aberrant patterns. Actual treadmill recording time was \u223c1\u2009min at each speed and each 1\u2009min of recording constituted a trial that produced a minimum of 10 steps for analysis in all cases.\nFor one animal (CHRONIC-1), an instrumented treadmill was available to record ground reaction forces (GRFs). The instrumented treadmill consisted of two independent treadmills mounted side by side on independent force plates (Kistler Type 9257BA; Kistler Instrument Corp., Winterthur, Switzerland). The divider used to prevent scissoring of the legs in spinalized animals separated the two belts, and each treadmill sub-assembly could record fore-aft (anteroposterior), mediolateral, and vertical forces individually for each hindlimb. GRFs were normalized to the mass of the cat at the time of the recording for comparison with previous reports on GRFs during walking or stance in able-bodied and spinalized felines.\n\nKinematic and GRF analysis\nHorizontal and vertical positions for each of the 11 markers were exported from Vicon into a text file and imported into MATLAB. Depth data were discarded for all analyses. Custom MATLAB scripts separated the trials into component steps and exported marker positions for each step as text files for further analysis. Steps were imported into Igor Pro to obtain quantifications of stepping parameters. The mean lateral movement of the hip marker was calculated for all steps in the trial; steps with movement >3 standard deviations from the mean were automatically excluded from analysis. To determine the percentage of steps that were plantar, a 20\u2009sec video clip from each animal was observed at half speed. The number of plantar- and dorsi-steps were recorded and summed within each group to calculate the percentage of steps taken in which the paw was plantar.\nThe positions of the elbow and knee markers were triangulated based on anatomical measurements to correct for skin slippage.\n22\nMarker positions were used to obtain a number of kinematic parameters: stance length (mm), swing height (mm), D\na\n(mm, horizontal displacement of the foot relative to hip at toe-down), D\np\n(mm, horizontal displacement of the foot relative to hip at liftoff). Using the position of the toe marker, the duration of each step was calculated, as well as the length of each stance phase. Additional analysis also produced minimum, maximum, and range values for the hip, knee, and ankle joints. Visual depictions and descriptions of these measures are included in\nFigure 2\n. These output measures were the primary dependent variables for subsequent analysis.\nThe kinematic measures for each plantar step were averaged over a trial to produce a mean value. Analysis was then performed at the trial level, using these mean values from each trial. For post-transection kinematics recording sessions, we analyzed one trial per speed, per time point for each cat. Pre-transection data sometimes included multiple trials (two to four) at the same speed (all pre-transection recordings were grouped as one time point).\nSPSS was used for all statistical analyses. Values for stance length, swing height, hip height, D\na\n, and D\np\nwere normalized to pre-transection values; subsequent analyses involving these variables were performed on these indices. The average values of each variable per trial were used for analysis.\nMixed model analysis was used with kinematic measures (stance length index, swing height index, hip height index) as the dependent variables, and group, speed, and weeks post-grafting as fixed factors. Cat was included as a subject level factor whereas trial, speed, and time post-grafting (including the pre-transection/baseline time point) were modeled as repeated factors. When multiple factors were included in an analysis (e.g., speed and group), a full-factorial model including main effects (e.g., speed and groups) and all possible interaction terms (e.g., speed by group) was used.\nPost-hoc comparison of main effects was performed using the Bonferroni post-hoc analysis. All tests were performed at the 0.05 significance level. Unless otherwise stated, all reported values are the estimated marginal means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error.\nAll GRF data was analyzed using routines written in MATLAB or Python (Python Software Foundation,\nwww.python.org\n) language. Treadmill resonance frequencies were filtered out using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) SureShrink denoising method. Baseline correction was applied to the data by calculating the mean of force data points during the swing phase of the gait cycle, and subtracting it from the entire data set. The stance onset, offset, and peak vertical force points of each step in the data were then identified from the vertical ground reaction forces by manual user selection. Stance time was normalized from 0 (onset) to 100% (offset), and ground reaction force in all three axes during stance was normalized to the mass of the cat at the time of the recording session. The normalized forces were then averaged across all steps to produce a mean force profile across stance time for all three Cartesian directions (see\nFig. 3\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nNormalized ground reaction forces in one cat (CHRONIC-1) at a walking speed of 0.4m/sec 12 weeks after grafting. The left panel shows the right and left vertical ground reaction forces over \u223c10 steps. Normalized peak vertical force reached >4\u2009N/kg for both hindlimbs during each step over that period. Panels on the right show the means and 95% confidence intervals of the vertical, fore-aft (or anteroposterior), and mediolateral forces over the stance period (0\u2013100%). The average peak normalized vertical forces over 163 steps were 3.4\u2009N/kg for the left hindlimb and 4.2\u2009N/kg for the right hindlimb. Fore-aft forces were initially positive (indicating braking), until \u223c40% of the stance phase, when forces turned negative (indicating propulsion). Mediolateral forces did not show the lateral push seen in able-bodied cats,\n23\n,\n25\n,\n64\n,\n65\nindicative of the lack of balance control in spinal animals.\n\nTracer delivery\nThree cats in the CHRONIC group underwent tracer delivery. Vertebral bone rostral and caudal to the lesion was removed to provide sites for tracer injection. In one cat, tracer injection occurred only rostral to the lesion, whereas in two cats, different tracers were injected rostral and caudal to the graft site. The tracers used were fluorescent dextran-conjugated micro-ruby (3000MW; Life Technologies, Carlsbad CA) and micro-emerald (3000MW; Life Technologies). Tracer was diluted in sterile saline at a concentration of 100\u2009mg/mL. Hamilton syringes mounted to a stereotaxic frame were equipped with a 27G needle and used to deliver the tracers. The dura was pierced at the injection site with a 25G needle or microscissors, and the needle of the Hamilton syringe was guided down into the spinal cord. Approximately 15\u2009\u03bcL of tracer was injected per injection site, distributed at several depths from 1000\u2009\u03bcm to 3000\u2009\u03bcm, extending from the left to the right dorsal root entry zones. Injection at each location was performed over 20\u2009min to ensure that the tracer was injected slowly and completely. After tracer delivery, the dura was closed with 7-0 Prolene, the muscle and fascia layers were closed with resorbable 4-0 Vicryl sutures, and the skin was closed with 5-0 Prolene.\n\nTissue processing and histology\nAfter the final kinematic recording session, cats were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with 500\u2009mL chilled physiological saline followed by 1 L of 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (PB). The spinal cord was removed and postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Tissue was cryoprotected in 30% sucrose after post-fix. After cryoprotection, tissue was sectioned into 40\u2009\u03bcm slices in the horizontal or lateral planes for evaluation.\nFluorescent images of the graft site and lumbar spinal cord were taken to locate the grafted fibroblasts via the GFP reporter. To assist in locating the cells, some slices were used for immunohistochemical staining for GFP. Axonal sprouting and state of the lesion site were visualized by Nissl-myelin staining. Nissl-myelin stained sections were used to assess completeness of the injury. Sections with fluorescent tracer were not stained with Nissl-myelin but were dehydrated and cover-slipped with Fluorsave (EMD Millipore, Temecula CA) mounting medium. Nissl-myelin sections were imaged with a color camera, whereas fluorescent sections were obtained using a gray scale camera. Microsoft Image Composite (Microsoft, Redmond WA) editor was used to stich adjacent images and provide a more complete view of the tissue.\nTo determine the location and spread of the graft after delivery, anti-GFP antibodies were used to locate grafted fibroblasts. Tissue used for immunohistological evaluation was cut into 20\u2009\u03bcm thick sections in the horizontal or sagittal planes. Slices were mounted on slides and ringed with rubber cement to form pools to contain antibody solutions and reagents. Tissue was washed three times in 0.1\u2009M PB (pH 7.4), after which the tissue was permeabilized in 0.1\u2009M PB with a 0.3% solution of Triton-X then rinsed. Tissue was blocked for 1\u2009h in a 10% goat serum PB solution at room temperature. Tissue was then incubated overnight with the primary antibody diluted in a solution of 2% goat serum/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.2% Triton. The primary antibody used was against GFP (1:1500, Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA), to locate the grafted fibroblasts. The following day, sections were washed in PBS and incubated with the fluorescent secondary antibody (1:400, Jackson Immuno Research Labs, West Grove PA) in 2% goat serum for 2\u2009h at room temperature in the dark. Finally, the slides were rinsed in PBS and cover-slipped using an aqueous mounting medium, Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame CA)."

    "Methods": "CeONPs\nCeONPs were obtained as a 1.2% solution in water, pharmaceutical grade, from Nanophase, Inc. (Romeoville, IL). Stocks were probe sonicated and resuspended in saline-citrate buffer at the desired concentrations. This buffer maintains a uniform particle suspension and prevents agglomeration.\n22\n,\n31\nThe average particle size in suspension was 10\u2009nm as determined by transmission electron microscopy. Surface area (Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller [BET]) was 88.6\u2009m\n2\n/g with a BET diameter of 9.7. The amount of Ce3+ in the particles as delivered was 33.6%, and CeONPs were endotoxin-free.\nTo confirm nanoparticle distribution to the brain, we administered rats (\nn\n=\u20096) a single tail vein injection. As direct measurement of the nanoparticle is not possible, we measured tissue cerium as an indicator of nanoparticle accumulation, using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and inductively coupled optical emission spectroscopy (analyzed by Cerium Labs Inc., Austin, TX).\n\nIn vitro\nTBI\nMixed organotypic neuronal cultures were prepared from 1\u20132 day-old neonatal rats and grown in silastic-bottomed tissue culture wells (Flex Plate, Flex Cell, Hillsborough, NC) as previously described.\n32\u201335\nCells were injured using a model 94A Cell Injury Controller (Custom Design & Fabrication, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA).\n36\nBriefly, the injury controller delivers a 50\u2009msec pulse of compressed gas, which transiently displaces the silastic membrane, along with its adherent cells, to varying degrees controlled by the pulse pressure. We have arbitrarily defined a membrane displacement of 5.5\u2009mm as a mild stretch, 6.5\u2009mm as a moderate stretch, and 7.5\u2009mm as a severe stretch.\n33\n,\n34\nThese degrees of membrane displacement correspond to a biaxial strain (or stretch) of 0.31 (31%), 0.38 (38%), and 0.54 (54%), respectively. This range of strain has been shown to be relevant to what occurs in humans subject to rotational acceleration-deceleration injuries.\n37\nOn days 12\u201314\nin vitro\n, cultures were delivered a mild or moderate injury. CeONPs (1\u2009nM\u20131\u2009\u03bcM) were delivered to the cultures 1\u2009h later. Controls received either vehicle or CeONPs, at the same time points, without injury. Neuronal damage was assessed at 24\u2009h after injury by measuring uptake of propidium iodide (PrI). Cultures were stained with PrI as previously described\n33\nand injured cells were counted and expressed as injured cells/mg protein. Protein was determined by the method of Lowry.\n38\nTo assure that cell loss or detachment had not occurred during the 24\u2009h post-injury period, cells were permeabilized and total PrI stained nuclei were counted and were consistent with those of uninjured cultures. Total protein in the supernatant media was also measured, which remained unchanged between injured and control cultures.\nFor measurement of [Ca\n2+\n]\ni\n, neurons were loaded with Fura-2 and [Ca\n2+\n]i was determined with microspectrophotometric imaging, as previously described by our group.\n32\n,\n34\n,\n35\nResults represent \u223c50 neurons examined per culture field, in triplicate, in three separate experiments.\n\nIn vivo\nTBI\nThe University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Virginia Tech approved the experimental protocols described herein. Adult male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (Harlan Inc., Livermore, CA) weighing 300\u2013350\u2009g were acclimated for at least 3 days with food and water provided\nad libitum\n. After acclimation, animals were delivered a mild lateral fluid percussion brain injury (mLFPI) as previously described.\n39\nBriefly, rats were anesthetized with an induction of 4% isoflurane with oxygen and maintained at 2.5% isoflurane with oxygen during the procedure. A standard craniectomy was performed under aseptic conditions by trephining a 4.8\u2009mm hole between bregma and lambda above the right parietal cortex. A modified 20G needle hubcap (2.6\u2009mm inside diameter) was placed over the exposed dura and bonded in place with cyanoacrylate adhesive. Dental cement was poured around the hub for support during injury. mLFPI was delivered directly to the intact dura, using a fluid percussion device (Custom Design & Fabrication, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA), consisting of a Plexiglas cylindrical reservoir 60\u2009cm long and 4.5\u2009cm in diameter and filled with sterile distilled water. Fitted at the end of the metal housing is a 5\u2009mm tube that terminates with a male Luer-Loc fitting. This fitting was connected to the female fitting implanted in the rat. Injury was produced by the metal pendulum striking the piston of the injury device, creating a pressure pulse and injecting a volume of water into the closed cranial cavity, producing a brief displacement and deformation of brain tissue. Animals received an impact with an average peak pressure of 1.47\u2009atm, which is consistent with mild injury.\n40\n,\n41\nNo significant differences in peak pressures were observed between treatment groups.\nThe biological actions of CeONPs are known to have a bell-shaped dose-response curve and accumulate in brain.\n19\n,\n23\nTherefore, large, repetitive daily doses over lengthy time periods were not used initially. Dosing used in these studies was based on that determined from our prior studies in a Parkinson's disease model,\n28\nand from studies in which animals were pretreated with CeONPs prior to injury.\n42\nThe dosing paradigms were as follows: three injections over 3\u2009h post-injury (3\u2009\u00d7\u2009) or five injections over 48\u2009h post-injury (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009). The 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009groups received injections at 1\u2009min, 15\u2009min, and 3\u2009h following injury, whereas the 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009groups received additional injections at 24 and 48\u2009h. A low dose of 0.05\u2009\u03bcg/g (LD) and a high dose 0.5\u2009\u03bcg/g (HD) was used within each injection paradigm. Therefore, four CeONP treatment groups were included in this study: 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009LD, 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009HD, 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009LD, and 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009HD. The total cumulative dose for the 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009dosing regimen was 0.15\u2009\u03bcg/g (LD) and 1.5\u2009\u03bcg/g (HD). For the 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009dosing, the total cumulative LD and HD were 0.25\u2009\u03bcg/g and 2.5\u2009\u03bcg/g, respectively. Sham controls received the craniectomy surgery without any injury or drug administration. Injury-only animals received the craniectomy surgery and injury, but were not administered CeONPs.\n\nAssessment of oxidative stress in the brain\nFor biochemical assessment of oxidative stress, animals were euthanized 2h after the last injection of CeONPs. Brains were rapidly collected on ice in a cold room. Upon collection, brains were inspected for signs of bleeding or hematoma at the injury site, but none were found. Brains were placed into an ice-cold tissue slicing matrix (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and divided into three sections: a rostral section, a middle section containing the injury site, and a caudal section. Assays were conducted on the middle sections, containing the site of injury. Sections were then divided into ipsilateral and contralateral and placed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing butylated hydroxytoluene. Sections were lysed by sonication for 30\u2009sec (Fisher Model 100 Sonic Dismembrator), followed by storage at \u221280\u00b0C. Total protein for each section was measured using the method of Lowry.\n38\nOxidative stress was measured by two main parameters. The first was activity of endogenous antioxidants and the second was by measurement of oxidative damage to cellular components. For measurement of endogenous antioxidants, the activity of the enzymes SOD and catalase, and the amount of reduced and oxidized GSH were determined. Catalase activity was measured by the decomposition of H\n2\nO\n2\nin a methanol medium, producing formaldehyde. Formaldehyde was measured colorimetrically with 4-amino-3-hydrzino-5-mercapto-1,2,4-triazole.\n43\nResults are expressed as H\n2\nO\n2\nconsumed/min/mg protein. Total SOD (Cu/Zn, Mn, and Fe) was measured using the xanthine/xanthine oxidase and hypoxanthine system to generate superoxide radicals, which were then measured by conversion of a tetrazolium salt to formazan dye, using a kit from Cayman Chemical.\n44\nOne unit of SOD was defined as the amount of enzyme that produced 50% dismutation of the superoxide radical. GSH/GSH disulfide (GSSG) ratios were also measured with a kit from Cayman Biochemical, using GSH reductase for the quantification of GSH.\n45\nFor measurement of oxidative damage to cellular macromolecules, we assessed lipid peroxidation via formation of lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) and 3-nitrotyrosine (NT). LOOH are a widely acknowledged byproduct of lipid peroxidation and a marker for oxidative stress damage.\n46\nLOOH were measured using an assay kit from Cayman Chemical. First, LOOH were extracted into chloroform/methanol as per kit directions, using aliquots of brain homogenate containing 1.0\u2009mg of protein. LOOH were measured directly by virtue of the redox reaction of the LOOHs with ferrous ions, to form a stable chromogen with thiocyanate, allowing for measurement of absorption at 500\u2009nm. Each assay was performed in triplicate. Results were measured as the total amount of LOOH per sample, and are expressed at a percentage of control. NT was measured by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA).\n47\nNT is a product of NO-dependent damage to proteins, which marks the protein for subsequent degradation.\n48\nBriefly, NT standard or brain homogenate (50\u2009mL) was added to each well of a 96 well plate followed by addition of horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-NT antibody. Plates were incubated for 1\u2009h after which they were washed four times. Trimethylbenzidine was added and plates were incubated for 30\u2009min in the dark, producing a colored product that was read in an ELISA plate-reader at 450\u2009nm.\n\nBehavioral assessment following injury\nTo determine the effect of CeONPs on cognitive function after mTBI, we conducted a behavioral study to evaluate short-term memory deficits utilizing the standardized novel object recognition test (NOR).\n49\u201351\nAnimals were divided into eight groups: sham, injury-only, vehicle, 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009LD, 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009HD, 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009LD, and 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009HD. The same injury and treatment conditions were used as described previously. An additional vehicle group was included that received injury and isovolumetric injections of vehicle.\nNOR testing was conducted 14 days following injury as previously described by our group.\n52\nBriefly, animals were acclimated to the training environment 2 days prior to injury. The task then occurred in two phases 14 days following injury: T1 (familiarization phase) and T2 (testing phase). During T1, a rat was placed in the 80\u2009\u00d7\u200980\u2009cm testing arena with two identical objects and allowed to explore for 5\u2009min. Twenty minutes later, the rat was returned to the testing arena, where one of the objects had been swapped with a new object. Novel object location was randomly assigned to each T2 trial. Animals were allowed 5\u2009min to explore. All trials were recorded and tracked using EthoVision XT\u2122 (Noldus Information Technology, Leesburg, VA). Three-point tracking was performed during each trial and included tracking of the nose-point (blue arrows), center of the body (red squares), and base of the tail (purple squares) (\nFig. 6\n) . Exploration was measured when the nose-point of the animal entered a 4\u2009cm zone outside of the object. Independent assessors blind to treatments verified accurate tracking of the nose-point.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 6.\nMild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) alters object exploration in the Novel Object Recognition Test. This figure shows a representative EthoVision tracing of the Novel Object Recognition test quantified in\nFigure 7\n. The yellow arrows represent the novel object. Blue arrows in the tracking represent nose-point tracking, whereas red squares indicate body center tracking and purple squares indicate tail base tracking. The injured animal, treated with vehicle (left) spent similar time at both objects, hence an inability to discriminate between novel and familiar objects. The animal receiving a chronic high dose of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeONPs) showed preferential investigation of the novel object, indicative of improved memory.\nFor analysis, a discrimination index was calculated for each trial (time spent exploring the novel object divided by the total time at either object) at the 1\u2009min time point in the T1 phase.\n49\n,\n53\nA ratio of 0.5 indicates equal exploration of both objects during the trial. Consistent with our published protocols,\n52\nintact memory was interpreted as exploring the novel object significantly more than the familiar object (score >0.5). A memory deficit was interpreted as null object preference (\u22640.5); the animal did not discriminate the novel object. Poor discrimination of the novel objects and less time spent in exploration reflects damage to memory formation.\n49\n,\n51\n\nStatistical analysis\nFor molecular and cellular assessments following\nin vivo\nand\nin vitro\ninjury models, statistical comparisons were made among treatment groups using a two way ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc tests. For behavioral assessments, average NOR preference for each treatment group was compared with a NOR preference of 0.5 using a Students\nt\ntest.\nP\nvalues <0.05 were considered significant."

    "Methods": "Mouse spinal cord contusion and bromo-deoxyuridine injections\nC57BL/6J adult male mice (Taconic, Hudson, NY) weighing 20\u201325\u2009g were anesthetized with isoflurane and received T9 spinal contusions with 30 (mild injury), 60 (moderate injury), or 100 (severe injury) kDyne force using the Infinite Horizon Spinal Cord Impactor (Precision Systems and Instrumentation).\n18\n,\n42\nBladders were manually expressed twice a day until spontaneous voiding returned. Sham mice received a laminectomy but did not receive spinal cord injuries. Surgical procedures performed on all SCI animals were conducted by the same surgeon and at the same period of time. All surgical procedures and experiments were performed in accordance with the University of Maryland School of Medicine Animal Care and Use Committee.\nTo determine the impact of SCI on adult neurogenesis and gliogenesis in the brain, as well as to maximize the detection of proliferating cells that would have undergone neuronal/glial differentiation, cumulative\nin vivo\nlabeling of cell proliferation was performed by daily intraperitoneal injections of bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU; final concentration, 50\u2009mg/kg dissolved in sterile saline; Sigma) for 4 weeks starting 13 weeks post-injury and 4 days per week.\nA battery of behavioral tests was conducted by two independent experimenters blinded to injury severity group. The timeline of the experimental design is shown in\nFigure 1\n. There were two cohorts of animals that underwent SCI and behavioral testing. Randomization was performed in each study cohort and equal numbers of sham, mild-level, moderate-level, and severe-level injuries were performed on each day of surgery. All conditions were kept consistent throughout the two cohort experiments. The C57BL/6 mice were obtained from the same vendor and were the same age at time of injury. All of the procedures were performed by the same investigators using the same SCI device. In addition, all behavioral tests were performed by the same investigators using the same equipment and room. The number of mice in each group or subgroup is indicated in\nTable 1\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nA timeline of the\nin vivo\nexperimental design. A battery of behavioral tests were evaluated according to the schedule outlined and compared following sham, mild-level (30 kDyne), moderate-level (60 kDyne), or severe-level (100 kDyne) spinal cord injury (SCI). Assessment includes motor function (Basso Mouse Scale [BMS], open field spontaneous activity), cognition (Y-maze, novel object recognition, step-down passive avoidance), and depression (sucrose preference, tail suspension and forced swim tests). ip, intraperitoneal.\nTable\n1.\nDefinition of the Groups\nOutcome measures in subgroups/mice # (subgroups, randomly selected)\nSham\nMild SCI\nModerate SCI\nSevere SCI\nBMS\n15\n15\n15\n14\nOP/NOR/Y-maze\n15\n15\n15\n13\nTS/FS\n15\n15\n15\n12\nSP/SDPA\n15\n15\n13\n11\nIHC for BrdU/DCX/NeuN\n8\n9\n9\n9\nIHC for BrdU/Iba-1/GFAP\n6\n5\n5\n5\nIHC for GRP78/DCX\n6\n7\n6\n6\nIHC for CCL21/NeuN\n5\n6\n5\n6\nNeuN stereology\n5\n5\n6\n5\nIba-1 stereology\n5\n6\n6\n6\nOpen in a separate window\nSCI, spinal cord injury; BMS, Basso Mouse Scale; OP, open field; NOR, novel object recognition; TS, tail suspension; FS, forced swim; SP, sucrose preference; SDPA, step-down passive avoidance; BrdU, bromodeoxyuridine; DCX, doublecortin; NeuN, neuronal nuclei; IHC, immunohistochemistry; Iba-1, ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; GRP78, glucose-regulated protein 78; CCL21, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 21.\n\nMotor function evaluation\nHindlimb locomotor function was assessed on Day 1 post-injury and weekly thereafter for up to 8 weeks using the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS).\n43\nThe spontaneous locomotor activity was evaluated in the open field\n44\nand the traveled distance/speed, as well as % of inside zone distance, were recorded by computer-based Any-Maze automated video tracking system (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL).\n\nCognitive function\nSpatial working memory was assessed by Y-maze spontaneous alternation test as previously described.\n18\nThe percentage of alternation is calculated using the following equation: total alternations \u00d7100/(total arm entries - 2). If a mouse scored significantly above 50% alternations (the chance level for choosing the unfamiliar arm), this was indicative of functional working memory. Retention memory was evaluated by novel object recognition (NOR) test as previously reported.\n18\n,\n44\nTime spent with two identical objects was recorded; because mice inherently prefer to explore novel objects, a preference for the novel object (more time than chance [10\u2009sec] spent with the novel object) indicates intact memory for the familiar object. The Step-Down Passive Avoidance (SDPA), conducted as previously reported,\n18\nevaluated a fear-motivated learning task. Twenty-four hours after conditioning, the latency to step down from the platform was recorded (or when 5\u2009min have elapsed).\n\nDepressive-like behaviors\nThe sucrose preference (SP) test was used to evaluate interest in seeking a sweet rewarding drink relative to plain water. A diminished preference for the sweetened drink is a sign of anhedonia, indicating depression-like behavior.\n45\nThe SP test was conducted in the home cage as previously described\n18\nwith some modifications. Two inserts were placed in each cage\u2014one with plain water in the normal (back) position and the sweetened water (0.5% saccharine) positioned at the front. After 24\u2009h or 48\u2009h, the water pouches, food, and mice were weighed and recorded. The sucrose preference was calculated by dividing consumption of sweetened water by total consumption of water (sweetened water plus plain water). The food preference also was calculated as a control to demonstrate that mice did not show a place preference.\nThe tail-suspension (TS) test assesses depression-like behavior in mice and is based on the observation that mice develop an immobile posture when placed in an inescapable hemodynamic stress of being hung by their tail. The duration of immobility was recorded as described.\n18\n,\n44\nThe forced swim (FS) test was performed as previously described.\n46\n,\n47\nBriefly, mice were placed in a transparent plastic cylinder (25\u2009cm high \u00d720\u2009cm diameter) filled with water (22\u201323\u00b0C; 22\u2009cm in depth). The duration of immobility was recorded throughout the 6\u2009min test period. Immobility was characterized as a lack of any movement.\n\nImmunohistochemistry, image acquisition, and quantification\nAt 16 weeks after injury, mice were deeply anesthetized and perfused transcardially with 50\u2009mL cold saline, followed by 200\u2009mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brains were removed, post-fixed overnight in PFA, and cryoprotected by immersion in 30% sucrose for 72\u2009h. Serial 30-\u03bcm thick coronal sections were cut using a cryostat and stored at \u221220\u00b0C in cryoprotectant solution (25% glycerol, 25% ethylene glycol, and 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffer; pH, 7.4) until use. For BrdU immunohistochemistry, free-floating brain sections were treated with 0.6% H\n2\nO\n2\nfor 30\u2009min to quench endogenous peroxidases. After rinsing in phosphate-buffered saline, sections were incubated in HCl at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min, followed by washing twice with 0.1\u2009M borate (pH 8.5). Standard fluorescent immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously.\n18\nPrimary antibodies used in this study include rat anti-BrdU (1:200; AbD Serotec), goat anti-doublecortin (DCX, 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-NeuN (1:500; Millipore), rabbit anti-ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1, 1:1000; Wako), mouse anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, 1:1000; Dako), rabbit anti-glucose-regulated protein 78\u2009kDa (GRP78, 1:500; Abcam), rabbit anti-chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 21 (CCL21, 1:500; Chemicon). Secondary antibodies used are from Invitrogen: Cy5-conjugated anti-rat, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 633 goat anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor 546 donkey anti-goat. Counterstaining was performed with 4\u2032, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 1\u2009\u03bcg/mL; Sigma). All immunohistological staining experiments were carried out with appropriate positive control tissue, as well as primary/secondary-only negative controls. Immunofluorescently labeled sections were imaged either using a LEICA (TCS SP5 II, Leica Microsystems Inc., Bannockburn, IL) confocal microscope system (for BrdU/DCX/NeuN, BrdU/Iba-1, and BrdU/GFAP), or using a fluorescence Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope (for GRP78/DCX and CCL21/NeuN). The images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 software (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA).\nFor quantitative image analysis of GRP78/DCX and CCL21/NeuN, images were acquired using a fluorescent Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope, at 20\u00d7 (CFI Plan APO VC 20\u00d7 NA 0.75 WD 1\u2009mm) magnification. Exposure times were kept constant for all sections in each experiment. Background for all images was subtracted using Elements. All images were quantified using Elements: nuclei were identified using Spot Detection algorithm based on DAPI staining; cells positive for any of the immunofluorescence markers were identified using Detect Regional Maxima or Detect Peaks algorithms, followed by global thresholding. The number of positive cells was normalized to the total number of cells based on DAPI or NeuN staining. CCL21 intensity was normalized to the total area imaged. All quantifications were performed in the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus, with\nn\n=\u20092\u20134 images per location from three sections per mouse. The brain sections were chosen between bregma \u22121.46\u2009mm and bregma \u22123.16 where hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) occurs. For each experiment, data from all images from one region in each mouse were summed up and used for final statistical analysis.\n31\n,\n48\nAt least 1000\u20132000 cells were quantified per mouse per area per experiment.\nFor quantitative image analysis of BrdU/DCX/NeuN, BrdU/Iba-1, and BrdU/GFAP, digital images at 20\u00d7 magnification were captured from both sides of the DG sub-regions (granular layer [GL] + subgranular zone [SGZ] + hilus), hippocampus or cortex, based on atlas boundaries (from the Franklin and Paxinos mouse atlas, third edition, 2007) and using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (\nn\n=\u20092\u20134 images per location from three sections per mouse for 5\u20136 mice per group). The brain sections were chosen between bregma \u22121.46\u2009mm and bregma \u22123.16 where hippocampal DG occurs. For each experiment, data from all images from one region in each mouse were summed up and used for final statistical analysis.\n49\n,\n50\n\nUnbiased stereological quantification of microglial phenotypes and neuronal survival\nBrain coronal sections were stained with cresyl-violet and Stereo Investigator software (MBF Biosciences, VT) was used to count the total number of surviving neurons in the cortex, thalamus, as well as Cornu Ammonis (CA) 1, CA2/3, and DG sub-regions of the hippocampus using the optical fractionator method of unbiased stereology as described previously.\n18\nEvery fourth 60-\u03bcm section was analyzed beginning from a random start point. The estimated number of surviving neurons in each field was divided by the volume of the region of interest to obtain the cellular density expressed in cells/mm\n3\n.\nEvery fourth 60-\u03bcm section beginning from a random start point were stained for Iba-1 (1:1000) antibody and 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine. The number of the three microglial morphological phenotypes (namely surveillant microglia [ramified], activated microglia [hypertrophic and bushy]) in the cortex and hippocampus was quantified using the optical fractionator method of unbiased stereology with Stereo Investigator software as described previously.\n18\nMicroglial phenotypic classification was based on the length and thickness of the projections, the number of branches and the size of the cell body, as previously described.\n51\n,\n52\nThe estimated number of microglia in each phenotypic class was divided by the volume of the region of interest to obtain the cellular density expressed in cells/mm\n3\n. Neurolucida software (MBF Biosciences) was used to create reconstructions of microglia at different stages of activation after injury by tracing the cell bodies and dendrites.\n49\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented as means \u00b1 standard error of the mean. All statistical analyses were conducted by using the GraphPad Prism Program, Version 3.02 for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) or SigmaPlot, version 12 (Systat Software, San Jose, CA). BMS was analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures. For multiple comparisons, one-way ANOVA was performed followed by Student's Newman-Keuls\npost hoc\ntest for parametric (normality and equal variance passed) data. Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA based on ranks followed by Dunn's\npost hoc\ntest was used for nonparametric (normality and/or equal variance failed) data. For experiments with only two groups, two-tailed Mann-Whitney rank sum test (nonparametric) or two-tailed unpaired Student's\nt\n-test was performed. Statistical significance was set at\np\n\u2264\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Subjects with traumatic brain injuries\nThe subjects of this study participated in one of four prospective longitudinal investigations: Behavioral Outcome,\n16\nPatient Characteristics,\n17\nand studies of Dilantin\n18\n,\n19\nand Valproate\n20\n,\n21\nto prevent post-traumatic seizures. Subjects were enrolled from 1980 to 1994. The selection criteria varied across the studies but all subjects met the following minimum entrance criteria: positive evidence of TBI (e.g., any period of loss of consciousness, post-traumatic amnesia of at least 1\u2009h, or CT evidence of an acute brain lesion), injury serious enough to require hospitalization, and willingness to participate in the study. More detailed information about the selection criteria for these studies has been published.\n20\u201322\nSome aspects of outcome have been published on subsets of these cases, but only one small study concentrated on mild TBI.\n5\nThe present study included 463 participants with mild traumatic brain injury represented by an initial post-resuscitation GCS score of 13\u201315 in the emergency department (ED) who survived and agreed to participate in an assessment at 1 and 12 months after injury. Participants were excluded if they had penetrating brain injury (\nn\n=\u200918) or questionable CT abnormalities due to poor scan quality or abnormalities due to a neurologic condition such as stroke or tumor that predated the traumatic brain injury (\nn\n=\u200924), resulting in a group of 421 participants. Subjects were followed to 1 year post-injury with an 80% follow-up rate.\n\nGeneral trauma comparison subjects\nOne hundred twenty comparison subjects were enrolled from the Patient Characteristics Study. These subjects sustained traumatic injury to the body but not to the head. Seventy percent were hospitalized for their injury. They were carefully questioned about disturbance of consciousness or post-traumatic amnesia to exclude people whose TBI had been missed in the routine medical evaluation.\n23\n,\n24\nDemographically, these subjects were similar to the participants with traumatic brain injury. They were evaluated at 1 month and 1 year post-injury, with a 93% follow-up rate.\n\nMeasures\nDemographics\nDemographic variables examined were age at injury, education, and gender. Education was assessed as number of years completed at the time of the injury and as a grouped variable (did not graduate from high school, high school graduate or in high school at the time of the injury, and college graduate).\nOther potential confounders\nParticipants were asked about pre-injury alcohol treatment, and neurologic and psychiatric conditions. Information also was collected on past or current litigation related to the injury and in three studies on planned litigation.\nTBI severity\nTraumatic brain injury severity was evaluated with the post-resuscitation GCS in the ED.\n1\nThe GCS score measures depth of coma. In addition, all CT scans were reviewed and evaluated to determine if there were abnormal findings. Abnormal findings included any evidence of abnormality impacting the brain, including contusion, hematoma (e.g., subdural, epidural, intracerebral), hemorrhage (e.g., subarachnoid, intraventricular), edema, focal swelling, depressed skull fracture, or midline shift. CT findings of linear skull fracture, basilar skull fracture, or pneumocephalus only were considered normal. At least 60% of the participants with CT abnormalities were seen within 24\u2009h of injury. Fifty-one subjects did not receive a CT scan because medical personnel judged it unnecessary. These subjects were placed in the CT normal group.\nNeuropsychological measures\nSubjects were administered a comprehensive battery of measures at 1 and 12 months post-injury. The battery included the Trail Making Test Part A and B, Seashore Rhythm Test, and Digit Symbol Subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale to evaluate attention, inhibitory control, flexibility of thinking, and processing speed. The Selective Reminding Test sum of recall (SRCL) assessed episodic memory and learning involving verbal information. Motor performance was evaluated with the Finger Tapping Test for Dominant and Non-dominant hands. Verbal intellectual skills were assessed by the Verbal Intelligence Quotient and visual spatial manipulatory skills by the Performance Intelligence Quotient of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. A more complete description of these measures can be found in Reitan and Wolfson\n25\nand other publications.\n17\n,\n26\n,\n27\nFunctional status measure\nSubjects were administered the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS),\n28\na global measure of outcome that classifies individuals on a 5-point scale; death, persistent vegetative state, severe disability, moderate disability, and good recovery. The GOS is available for only 364 TBI subjects and 120 trauma comparison subjects at 1 month post-injury because the Behavioral Outcome Study did not collect this information at that time.\nPost-traumatic symptom checklist\nThe Symptom Checklist is a list of 12 symptoms that commonly occur following TBI.\n29\n,\n30\nSubjects endorse a symptom if it is new or worse, compared with pre-injury. Symptoms evaluated included problems with cognition (memory, concentration), physical symptoms (headaches, fatigue, dizziness, blurred vision, sensitivity to light, sensitivity to noise, trouble with sleep), and emotional symptoms (irritability, temper, and anxiety).\n\nStatistical analysis\nDemographics, neuropsychological functioning, and functional status measures were examined at 1 month and at 1 year post-injury across four groups of subjects. The groups consisted of trauma controls and traumatic brain injured subjects with an initial GCS score of 13- 15 without CT abnormalities (uncomplicated mild), and two groups of traumatic brain injured subjects with CT abnormalities\u2014one with initial GCS of 15 and abnormal CT and one with GCS 13\u201314 and abnormal CT. Demographics and potential confounders were analyzed using chi-squared tests or one-way analysis of variance. Outcome data were analyzed using linear models adjusting for demographics differing among groups with Dunnett's test to compare individual TBI groups with trauma controls. To limit the effect of skewness, Trail Making Test Part B scores greater than 175\u2009sec were recoded to 175\u2009sec. GOS was grouped into two categories, good recovery versus moderate/severe disability.\nComparisons between TBI groups were not examined because the focus was on whether there were deficits, compared with subjects without head injury. Subjects who were too impaired neurologically to be tested on neuropsychological variables were assigned a score equal to 1 worse than the worst observed (1 month:\nn\n=\u20094 in the GCS 15 CT abnormal group and\nn\n=\u200913 in the GCS 13\u201314 CT abnormal group; 1 year:\nn\n=\u20091 in the GCS 15 CT abnormal group and\nn\n=\u20094 in the GCS 13\u201314 CT abnormal group). A significance level of\np\n<\u20090.001 is used for the overall tests due to the large number of comparisons, although nominal significance levels at\np\n<\u20090.01 and\np\n<\u20090.05 also are presented. When the overall test was at least nominally significant, a significance level of 0.01 is used for Dunnett's test."

    "Methods": "We analyzed data accrued from participants enrolled between April 2014 and April 2016 in a prospective, observational cohort consisting of three arms: consecutive ED patients evaluated for TBI; ED patients evaluated for traumatic injuries without evidence of head injury (trauma control); and healthy control subjects (theHeadInjurySerumMarkers forAssessingResponse toTrauma; HeadSMART study). A detailed description of this cohort has been published previously.16The study was approved by the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Review Board (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). Participants were recruited from two academic EDs located in Baltimore, Maryland (one designated a level one trauma center and the other a level two trauma center).\n\nBriefly, eligible TBI participants were 18 years or older and presented to the ED within 24\u2009h of blunt head injury, met the ACEP/CDC criteria for evaluation with a cranial CT scan, and consented to research blood draws. We excluded subjects who received a cranial CT, but did not meet the ACEP/CDC criteria for receiving one, and subjects with brain tumor, severe dementia, previous history of intracranial hemorrhage or intracranial surgery, seizure-induced head injury, pregnancy, no working telephone number, inability to communicate in English, or blood transfusion before initial research blood draw was obtained. Age- and sex-matched trauma control participants were 18 years or older, presented to the ED within 24\u2009h of traumatic injury, but had no evidence of head injury, and consented to research blood draws. Exclusion criteria for trauma control participants were the same as those for TBI participants. Healthy control participants were 18 years or older, had no history of TBI, and consented to research blood draws. In addition to not meeting the exclusion criteria for TBI participants and trauma control participants, healthy control participants were excluded if they had a history of previous TBI, kidney failure, stroke, previous or active diagnosed psychiatric or neurological disease, smoking cigarettes, or recreational drug use within 2 weeks of blood draw, or blood pressure>140/80.\n\nDemographic and clinical data were collected by trained research coordinators using structured data collection tools recommended by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Common Data Elements.17Data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. Cranial CT images were read by one board-certified neuroradiologist. TBI patients were categorized into three groups: I) HIBRID (ACRM\u2013); II) patients with TBI based on the ACRM criteria who had no traumatic abnormality on cranial CT (ACRM+ CT\u2212); and III) patients with TBI who had a traumatic abnormality on cranial CT, including isolated skull fracture (CT+). Extracranial injuries are defined as noncranial fractures; or dislocations or thoracic injury (pneumothorax, hemothorax, and pulmonary contusion), abdominal injury (splenic or liver or intestinal or rectal injury), or injury to a major artery or vein.\n\nOutcome data from the TBI groups were collected at 1 month after enrollment (time of injury) either by telephone interview (62.0% [233 of 376]) or in-person assessment (38.0% [143 of 376]). Functional outcome was ascertained using the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE), which categorizes recovery on a scale of 1 (dead) to 8 (upper good recovery). Incomplete functional recovery at 1 month was defined as GOSE <8. As per the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) criteria,18subjects were deemed to have mild post-concussion syndrome (PCS) if they reported a mild/moderate/severe problem in two of the following ICD-10 symptoms categories as measured by the Rivermead Post-Concussion Questionnaire (RPQ)19: 1) headaches, dizziness, general malaise, excessive fatigue, or noise intolerance; 2) irritability, emotional labiality, depression, or anxiety; 3) subjective complaints of concentration or memory difficulty; 4) insomnia; 5) reduced tolerance to alcohol; and 6) preoccupation with these symptoms and fear of permanent brain damage. Similarly, TBI subjects were deemed to have at least moderate/severe PCS if they reported mild/moderate/severe problems in at least three of the ICD-10 symptom categories listed above.20Moderate/severe depressive symptoms was defined as a total score of 10 or more on the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ9).21\n\nStatistical analysis\nDifferences in demographic and clinical characteristics between TBI subgroups and control groups were summarized with descriptive statistics. To evaluate for attrition bias, we compared the demographic characteristics of TBI patients who completed follow-up at 1 month to enrolled TBI patients who were lost to follow-up at 1 month. The proportion of subjects with functional disability, PCS, and depressive symptoms were calculated for each TBI group and compared to the proportion in trauma controls and healthy controls. Differences between groups were evaluated with the \u03c7\n2\ntest for proportions and the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables that did not follow a normal distribution. The attributable risk percent was calculated to determine the relative contribution of head trauma to the incidence of TBI-related symptoms in the HIBRID group compared to trauma controls. A two-tailed\np\nvalue of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA/MP statistical software (version 11.2; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX)."

(a neurosurgeon with a special interest in concussion and PCS) from January 1997 to June 2013 at the Toronto Western Hospital (TWH), a specialty hospital located in Toronto with a major focus on neurological disorders. Clinical and demographic data were collected retrospectively from medical charts and were recently reported.\n11\nThis cohort was mailed a questionnaire and an informed consent form to be completed and returned via mail or by phone. Some longitudinal data collected from the retrospective study\n11\nwere combined with the follow-up data collected from the present study. Patient age was recorded as the age at the time of the concussion that led to the clinic appointment. This study was approved by the University Health Network (UHN) Research Ethics Board. UHN comprises four major teaching and research hospitals, including TWH and the Canadian Concussion Center.\n\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nAll participants diagnosed with PCS had at least one symptom (e.g., headache, irritability, difficulty concentrating) for more than 3 months in combination with a negative brain computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Specifically, patients with hemorrhage or contusion or other focal imaging abnormalities were excluded. Patients involved in litigation for their injuries were excluded (\nFig. 1\n). The criteria for concussion were based on the 2012 Zurich guidelines, a consensus statement of the 4th International Conference on Concussion in Sport.\n12\nIt is recognized that there are many definitions of PCS in the literature, as discussed in the article by Davis and colleagues.\n11\nThe requirement that the PCS symptom or symptoms last at least 3 months was selected to capture a population with definite persistence of PCS.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nFlow chart for case selection. The criteria used for case selection of the cohort beginning with 285 cases, of which 120 were ultimately selected.\n\nMeasures included in the questionnaire (\nAppendix A\n)\nData collected by the questionnaire (\nAppendix A\n) included: 1) persisting symptoms; 2) time to recovery or duration of PCS; 3) treatments tried and their perceived efficacy, including occupational therapy, medication, chiropractic manipulation, psychotherapy, physiotherapy, and vestibular repositioning exercises; 4) comorbidities including migraines, attention deficit disorder (ADD)/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), learning disability, mononucleosis, depression, anxiety, and suicide attempts before and after the concussion; 5) compliance with a do-not-return-to-play recommendation from C.H.T.; 6) impact of the concussion on their life (a 5-point Likert scale from \u201cNot at all\u201d to \u201cAn extreme amount\u201d); and 7) limitations on previous or current type or amount of schooling or work tolerated. If respondents found checkbox responses insufficient, they were asked to expand their answers in the \u201cother\u201d section.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation. Symptoms on the questionnaire were categorized into somatic, affective, and cognitive symptoms. The symptom list included in the questionnaire was based on the list used previously\n11\nand included 35 persisting symptoms (as shown in\nFig. 2\n). Results of analyses were considered significant at\np\n\u2264\u20090.05 and a statistical trend present when 0.05\u2009<\np\n\u2264\u20090.1. Analyses were performed using SPSS v. 17.0 (Chicago, IL), MATLAB Statistics, and Machine Learning Toolbox Release 2014b, The MathWorks, Inc. (Natick, MA).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nPersisting symptoms. The percentage of the not recovered group (NOT-REC;\nn\n=\u200980) suffering from continuing somatic, affective, and cognitive symptoms. Note that in those with persisting postconcussion syndrome, the persisting symptoms were quite evenly dispersed among somatic, affective and cognitive symptoms.\nt\n-Tests were run on continuous variables and chi-squares on categorical variables to compare those who recovered from their index concussion (the concussion that led to the clinical appointment with C.H.T.) with those who did not. When more than 20% of the cells in the chi-square had an expected frequency less than 5, the likelihood ratio was used. Due to the exploratory nature of the present study, sets of statistical hypothesis tests performed in a group were subjected to a reduced threshold for statistical significance\np\nin order to control the false discovery rate to a specified value\nq\n. By subjecting tests to a threshold reduced according to this procedure, the method promises that no more than a fraction\nq\nof results identified as significant will actually be insignificant (will be false positives).\n13\nFor each group of tests to which this procedure was applied, two adjusted significance thresholds were employed. The first was calculated with\nq\n=\u20090.05, and\np\nvalues below this threshold were considered significant. The second was computed with\nq\n=\u20090.10, and\np\nvalues below this threshold were considered to be trending toward significance. The reader should note here that\nq\nis not the threshold, but rather the false discovery rate (FDR) used to compute the reduced threshold.\nVariables for multi-variate analyses fell into three categories: 1) demographic; 2) symptoms reported at the index concussion, clinic appointment, and questionnaire; and 3) comorbidities and treatments. Vivid dreaming was excluded as a symptom because it was not reported at the time of the index concussion. The remaining symptoms were further subdivided into 20 somatic, eight affective, and six cognitive symptoms. One analysis explored associations among the variables, while a second examined associations between the variables and the time to recovery.\nA principal component analysis\n14\nwas performed with symptoms to identify their major patterns of covariation. Permutation testing was employed to assess the number of significant components. A clustergram analysis,\n15\u201319\nwas performed to visualize potential patterns of clustering between patients and symptoms. It consists of a heat map depicting both symptoms and patients together, and two hierarchical agglomerative clustering analyses producing dendrograms for symptoms and patients separately. The consensus across three different cluster evaluation methods\n20\u201322\nwas used to establish the number of significant clusters in each dendrogram.\nA Cox proportional hazards model\n23\nwas used to evaluate the association between time to recover from PCS and patients' demographics, pattern of symptoms, and comorbidities. Four separate Cox models were analyzed: 1) age and gender; 2) total somatic, affective, cognitive, and overall number of symptoms; 3) all symptoms as individual predictors; and 4) comorbidities and treatments together and individually."

    "Methods": "Animals and surgical procedure\nA total of 141 adult female Wistar rats were used for this study (Charles River; 8 weeks old, 250\u2013300\u2009g). All protocols for animal handling and treatments were applied in accordance with the standards of the Animal Use Committee of the University Health Network. All surgical procedures were performed under anesthesia using 2% isoflurane delivered in a 1:1 mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide. Sham animals underwent C7-T1 laminectomy, leaving the exposed spinal cord intact. The injured group received a clip compression injury for 60\u2009sec using a 35\u2009g modified aneurysm clip, which was applied extradurally at the C7-T1 level, as previously established (\nFig. 1A\n).\n16\nMuscles were sutured and the skin was closed with Michel wound clips. All animals were given a subcutaneous injection of 1\u2009mL buprenorphine (0.05\u2009mg/kg) and 5\u2009mL saline immediately post-surgery and twice a day for 2 days after surgery. After the injury or laminectomy, the animals were kept in the animal facility of the Krembil Research Institute where food and water were provided\nab libitum.\nManual bladder expression was performed three times a day. Animals that showed signs of infection were excluded from the study. Animals were sacrificed at 2 (subacute phase), 10 (early chronic phase), and 20 (later chronic phase) weeks post-injury.\n17\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSummary of experimental approach.\n(A)\nClip compression injury model at the C7-T1 level.

Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\n\nAnimal sacrifice and tissue collection\nAt the experimental end-points of the study, animals were deeply anesthetized using isoflurane, and blood was collected by cardiac puncture prior to transcardial perfusion. The animals were perfused with either phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) alone, or PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS, in order to collect fresh or fixed tissues, respectively. Prior to sacrifice, animal body weights were recorded.\nFigure 1B\nprovides an overview of the experiments conducted and the time-points assessed in the present study.\n\nWestern blot semi-quantification of IgG and IgM immunoglobulins in the spinal cord\nLevels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM immunoglobulins in spinal cord protein lysates were assessed at 2, 10, and 20 weeks post-SCI by Western blotting. Five (5) mm long spinal cord segments centered at the injury epicenter were isolated from PBS only\u2013perfused animals, snap frozen, and stored in \u221280\u00b0C until all samples were collected for the study. Then, spinal cords were crushed manually and further homogenized in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Scientific), using a small motorized homogenizer. Total protein concentration of the clear supernatant was determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay, based on a bovine serum albumin (BSA) standard curve, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Scientific). Samples were aliquoted for each experiment to avoid repetitive freeze-thawing and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Protein extracts (10\u2009\u03bcg/sample, four samples/group), purified rat IgG (0.05\u2009\u03bcg; Sigma) and purified rat IgM (0.02\u2009\u03bcg; Invitrogen) were resolved in a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-acrylamide gel and subsequently transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane for 2\u2009h at 100\u2009V without SDS. Membranes were blocked for 1\u2009h at room temperature with 5% nonfat milk in 0.1% Tween 20-Tris-buffered saline (TBS). Next, the membranes were blotted with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rat IgG (1:10,000; Thermo Scientific) or anti-rat IgM (1:5000; Thermo Scientific) antibodies for 2\u2009h at room temperature. Membranes were exposed to film, then washed and re-blotted with anti-mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibody (1:20,000; Abcam) for 30\u2009min at room temperature and next with goat anti-mouse HRP antibody (1:20,000; Sigma) for another 30\u2009min at room temperature, followed by another exposure to film. ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) was used to quantify the protein bands using the appropriate plugin.\n\nAssessment of endogenous antibody deposition in the spinal cord at 2 weeks post-cSCI by immunofluorescence microscopy\nSpinal cords from rats perfused with 4% PFA were post-fixed overnight in 10% sucrose (in 4% PFA-PBS) and cryo-protected in 20% sucrose in PBS, also overnight. A 2-cm long segment of spinal cord centered at the injury epicenter was embedded in OCT Tek embedding matrix in dry ice and transverse sections of 30\u2009\u03bcm were taken on glass slides and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until used for staining. Sections were dried at room temperature (20\u2009min), rehydrated once with PBS (10\u2009min) and subsequently blocked with 5% donkey serum (DS) +\u20091% BSA +\u20090.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Primary goat anti-rat IgM antibody (1:100, Invitrogen) was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by fluorescent-tagged secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488, 1:200; Life Technologies) and 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 1:400), also overnight at 4\u00b0C. Next, sections were blocked with 5% goat serum (GS) +\u20091% BSA +\u20090.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1\u2009h and stained with fluorescent-conjugated anti-rat IgG antibody (Alexa Fluor 568, 1:150; Life Technologies) for 2\u2009h at room temperature. Sections were washed four times with PBS between staining steps. Slides were cover-slipped with Mowiol mounting medium (Sigma). To avoid staining variability, all samples were stained at the same time.\nSamples were selected randomly for imaging and images were acquired as close together as possible. For this assessment, a Nikon Eclipse E800 epifluorescence microscope at 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification was used. For the detection of IgM deposits, the threshold of the image acquisition equipment was set up such that the signal from the control staining (secondary antibody alone) was zero; for IgG (for which a directly fluorescent-tagged antibody was used), the threshold was set such that the brightest sections (injury epicenter) were not overexposed yet signal from the least bright sections could still be detected. As a result, we determined 2000\u2009msec to be the optimum exposure time for imaging of IgG and IgM\u2014a time short enough to avoid over-saturation and over-quenching of the samples. All settings were kept constant during imaging. The intensity of the detected fluorescence, excluding the signal from the dura, was measured with the appropriate plugin in ImageJ software and assessed under identical conditions. As a positive control for IgG and IgM immunoglobulin staining, 30-\u03bcm thick rat spleen sections were stained using the same protocol as for the spinal cord.\n\nCompetition assay\nTo exclude the possibility of non-specific IgM staining in injured spinal cord sections, we stained adjacent sections with the secondary fluorescent-tagged antibody only. Because we used a directly conjugated anti-rat IgG antibody for the detection of rat IgG in the spinal cord, we could not perform a secondary-only control experiment. Thus, to confirm specificity of the fluorescent-tagged anti-rat IgG antibody in spinal cord sections, we performed a competition assay with purified polyclonal rat IgG and protein lysate from injured or sham spinal cord at 2 weeks after injury. A random injured spinal cord sample at 2 weeks post-SCI containing the injury epicenter was selected for this assay. Sections were blocked with 5% DS +1% BSA +\u20090.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Nuclear staining with DAPI (1:400) was done overnight at 4\u00b0C, after which sections were washed four times with PBS. Sections were then blocked with 5% GS +1% BSA +\u20090.3% Triton X-100 for 1\u2009h at room temperature.\nFor the competition assay, the anti-rat IgG detection antibody (Alexa Fluor 568, 1:150; Life Technologies) was pre-incubated with 53.3 times molar excess of either purified rat IgG (Sigma) or spinal cord protein lysate prior to staining the spinal cord sections. The pre-incubation was done for 1\u2009h at room temperature using low-binding tubes to minimize binding of antibodies on the tube. The 53.3 times molar ratio excess was selected because this was the highest possible concentration we could use, given the total protein concentration of our spinal cord protein samples. To calculate the molarity of the spinal cord protein lysate, we used 50\u2009kDa as the protein's average molecular weight. This was determined by multiplying the average length of eukaryotic proteins (449\u2009\u00b1\u200925 amino acids)\n18\nby the average amino acid weight (110\u2009Da). Binding of the fluorescent anti-rat IgG-detecting antibody to the spinal cord sections was done at room temperature for 2\u2009h, after which the slides were washed, mounted, and cover-slipped. Images were taken with a Leica epifluorescence microscope at 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification and fluorescence intensity was determined with ImageJ, as described above.\n\nImmunofluorescence staining for GFAP, CSPG, NF200, IgG, and IgM in the spinal cord at 2 weeks post-cSCI\nTo detect binding of endogenous immunoglobulins to astrocytes and neurons at 2 weeks post-cSCI, we stained spinal cord sections for rat glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPG), or neurofilament-200 (NF200), and co-labeled for rat IgG and IgM.\nFor co-labeling with IgG + GFAP, sections were blocked with 5% DS +1% BSA +\u20090.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1\u2009h at room temperature, and incubated with anti-GFAP antibody (1:500; Millipore), overnight at 4\u00b0C. After washing, sections were blocked with 5% GS +1% BSA +\u20090.3% Triton X-100 for 1\u2009h at room temperature and incubated with fluorescent-tagged secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488, 1:200; Life Technologies) and DAPI (1:400) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Lastly, fluorescent-tagged anti-rat IgG antibody (Alexa Fluor 568, 1:150; Life Technologies) was applied for 2\u2009h at room temperature.\nFor co-labeling with IgM + GFAP, sections were blocked with 5% DS +1% BSA +0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1\u2009h at room temperature, and incubated with anti-rat IgM (1:100; Invitrogen) overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by fluorescent-tagged secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488, 1:200; Life Technologies) and DAPI (1:400), also overnight at 4\u00b0C. Next, sections were incubated with anti-GFAP antibody (1:500; Millipore) overnight at 4\u00b0C, re-blocked with 5% GS +1% BSA +\u20090.3% Triton X-100 for 1\u2009h at room temperature, and incubated with fluorescent-tagged secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 568, 1:200; Life Technologies), washed, and cover-slipped.\nFor co-labeling with IgG + IgM + GFAP or IgG + IgM + CSPG, sections were blocked with 5% DS +1% BSA +\u20090.3% Triton X-100 in PBS and incubated with anti-rat IgM (1:100, Invitrogen) overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by fluorescent-tagged secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488, 1:200; Life Technologies) as described above. Then, anti-GFAP or anti-CSPG antibody (mouse anti-CSPG, 1:200; Sigma) was applied overnight, followed by re-blocking with 5% GS +\u20091% BSA +\u20090.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 647, 1:200; Life Technologies) and DAPI (1:400) were applied overnight at 4\u00b0C. Lastly, fluorescent anti-rat IgG antibody was incubated for 2\u2009h at room temperature as described above, and sections were cover-slipped and stored in \u221220\u00b0C until imaged.\nFor co-labeling with IgG + NF200, sections were blocked with 5% DS +1% BSA +\u20090.3% Triton X-100 in PBS and incubated with anti-rat NF200 antibody (1:200; Sigma) overnight at 4\u00b0C. After washing, tissue sections were blocked with 5% GS +\u20091% BSA +\u20090.3% Triton X-100 for 1\u2009h at room temperature and incubated with fluorescent-tagged secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488, 1:200; Life Technologies) and DAPI (1:400) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Lastly, fluorescent-tagged anti-rat IgG antibody (Alexa Fluor 568, 1:150; Life Technologies) was applied for 2\u2009h at room temperature.\nFor co-labeling with IgG + CD45RA + GFAP, spinal cord sections containing the injury epicenter were blocked with 5% DS +1% BSA +\u20090.3% Triton X-100 in PBS and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with anti-rat CD45RA (1:200; BD Biosciences), blocked with 5% GS +\u20091% BSA +\u20090.3% Triton X-100 in PBS and incubated with secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488, 1:400; Life Technologies) for 2\u2009h at room temperature. Following washes, sections were incubated with anti-GFAP primary antibody (1:500; Millipore) overnight at 4\u00b0C followed by a re-blocking step with 5% GS +1% BSA +\u20090.3% Triton X-100 in PBS and incubation with a secondary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C as mentioned above. Last, anti-rat IgG antibody and DAPI were added for 2\u2009h at room temperature. Spleen sections were used as a positive control for the IgG + CD45RA staining.\nImaging settings were set based on sections where the primary antibody for IgM, NF200, GFAP, or CSPG was omitted, such that the signal from the secondary-only stained sections was zero. Low-power images (10\u2009\u00d7\u2009) were taken with a Nikon Eclipse E800 epifluorescence microscope, whereas high-power confocal images were taken with a LSM 510 Meta microscope.\n\nAssessment of binding of serum IgG and IgM antibodies to fixed astrocytes in vitro\nTo confirm that binding of immunoglobulins to astrocytes in the lesioned spinal cord is specific rather than a result of sequestration,\n19\nrat astrocytes were fixed in culture and incubated with serum from rats with cSCI or laminectomy only (sham) at 2 weeks post-injury, and binding of IgG and IgM was determined microscopically. Rat primary cortical astrocytes (Gibco) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium F12 (DMEM-F12; Gibco) containing 100\u2009U/mL penicillin, 100\u2009\u03bcg/mL streptomycin (Gibco) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in 10\u2009cm\n2\ndishes at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO\n2\nuntil they were 80% confluent. The cells were then split and seeded at 25,000 cells/well in a 24-well plate on top of 12\u2009mm glass cover-slips. The astrocytes were then grown in serum-free DMEM for 5 days, fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 10\u2009min at room temperature, and washed twice with PBS. Fixed astrocytes were blocked with 5% DS +1% BSA +\u20090.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Next, 10% of rat serum from animals with cSCI or sham injury was incubated in duplicate with astrocytes for 2\u2009h at room temperature. The same protocol described above for IgG + IgM + GFAP staining was applied. Images from three random fields were taken at 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification, and intensity of detected fluorescence was quantified with ImageJ. The obtained values were averaged for each serum sample and then averaged between the samples of the same group (\nn\n=\u20095/group).\n\nImmunohistochemical detection of splenic IgG+ and IgM+ ASCs\nFrequencies of splenic antibody secreting cells (ASCs) increase with age.\n20\nThus, to determine changes of IgG and IgM ASCs in the spleen in the course of 20 weeks, we included age-matched control groups (na\u00efve) for all time-points of this assessment.\nFour (4) \u03bcm thick formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections were de-waxed in five changes of xylene and treated with a graded series of alcohols. Heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) method with Tris-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) buffer at pH 9.0 was applied. Endogenous peroxidase and biotin activities were blocked using 3% hydrogen peroxide and avidin/biotin blocking kit (Vector Laboratories), respectively. For detection of IgM+ ASCs, sections were blocked for 10\u2009min with 10% normal GS. Subsequently, they were incubated with the primary antibody (1:500; Rockland) for 1\u2009h at room temperature. This was followed by a biotin-labeled secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) for 30\u2009min and HRP-conjugated ultra-streptavidin labeling reagent (ID Labs. Inc., Canada) for 30\u2009min. After washing well in TBS, color development was completed with freshly prepared 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) solution (Dako). For detection of IgG+ ASCs, sections were blocked as above, then incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-rat IgG antibody (1:50; Thermo Scientific) overnight at 4\u00b0C, and followed by color development using freshly prepared DAB solution. Finally, IgG and IgM stained sections were counterstained lightly with Mayer's Hematoxylin, dehydrated in alcohols, cleared in xylene and mounted in Permount mounting medium (Fisher).\nTo quantify the number of IgG+ and IgM+ ASCs, we counted IgG+ or IgM+ positive cells with typical ASC characteristics (small, round cells with very intense IgG or IgM cytoplasmic staining) in 10 randomly selected consecutive fields (0.785\u2009mm\n2\n). Technically suboptimal fields were skipped. All positive cells in each appropriate field were counted. These assessments were conducted by an experienced pathologist (author E.E.T.) who was blinded to the groups of the study.\n\nDetection of immunoglobulins in CSF\nTo examine whether parenchymal immunoglobulins derive from intrathecal synthesis, we measured levels of immunoglobulins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of rats with SCI or sham injury at 2 weeks by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Aliquots of 50\u2009\u03bcL CSF were collected through lumbar puncture at the L3-L4 level as previously described.\n21\nELISA kits (Abcam) were used for the quantification of IgG and IgM immunoglobulins following manufacturer's instructions. Prism (Graph Pad) was used to interpolate the unknown concentrations from the standard curves.\n\nFlow cytometric analysis of the frequency of splenic T- and B-lymphocytes\nImmediately after PBS perfusion, spleens (\nn\n=\u20096/group) were dissected, transferred in 2% FBS in PBS and mechanically dissociated through a 70-\u03bcm nylon mesh strainer. Red blood cells were lysed (0.1\u2009mM EDTA, 10\u2009mM KHCO\n3\n, 150\u2009mM NH\n4\nCl) for 5\u2009min at room temperature, and samples were centrifuged at 2000\u2009rpm for 5\u2009min. The pelleted cells were washed with 2% FBS in PBS. The number of viable cells was quantified with trypan blue and 106 viable cells/ tube were incubated with the Fc\u03b3R blocker (Innovex) for 20\u2009min on ice. Next, the samples were stained with fixable viability dye eFluor 780 (1:1000; Life Technologies) for 20\u2009min at 4\u00b0C and subsequently with CD45-FITC (leukocytes; BD Biosciences), CD3-PE (T- lymphocytes; BD Biosciences) and CD45RA-V450 (B-lymphocytes; BD Biosciences). An LSR II flow cytometer was used for data acquisition, where at least 10,000 events of viable cells were collected. FlowJo V10 (Trestar) was used for data analysis and gating of positive populations was performed based on appropriate isotype-matched antibody controls (all from BD Biosciences).\n\nPreparation of injured spinal cord homogenates for in vitro stimulation of splenocytes\nFive (5) mm long spinal cord segments centered at the injury epicenter were aseptically isolated from PBS-only perfused animals, snap frozen, and stored in \u221280\u00b0C until all spinal cord samples were collected for this assay. Spinal cords were fully thawed at room temperature and snap frozen again to allow for one freeze-thaw cycle and to facilitate cell lysis. Subsequently, samples were crushed manually and further homogenized in ddH\n2\nO without protease inhibitors by using a Dounce homogenizer (VWR International). The samples were spun down at 12,200\u2009rpm for 20\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. All the above steps were performed under aseptic conditions and great effort was made to process samples on ice in order to maintain protein integrity, given that a protease inhibitor was not used. The clear supernatant was collected and its total protein concentration was determined by BCA assay, based on a BSA standard curve, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Scientific). Samples were aliquoted for each experiment to avoid repetitive freeze-thawing and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until used.\nWith this protocol, we aimed for the total protein extraction with H\n2\nO to be as successful as the extraction with RIPA. To determine this, we extracted proteins from the spinal cord using the established RIPA (+inhibitors) extraction protocol as described above. Next, 40\u2009\u03bcg of total spinal cord protein (extracted with H\n2\nO or RIPA) were run in a 12% SDS-acrylamide gel under reducing conditions. The gel was then stained with Coomasie blue and similarity of stained bands between the two extraction methods was visually determined (data not shown). Thus, the H\n2\nO method was selected over RIPA to avoid any effects that RIPA (+inhibitors) may have for the\nin vitro\nstimulation protocol.\n\nDetection of immunoglobulins secreted by stimulated splenocytes in vitro\nSpleens (\nn\n=\u20094/group) from PBS-perfused rats were harvested under aseptic conditions and transferred in complete RPMI medium (10% heat inactivated FBS, 55\u2009mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 1M HEPES, 200\u2009mM L-glutamine, and 100\u2009U/mL penicillin-streptomycin solution in RPMI 1640 medium). Single cell suspensions were prepared by mechanical dissociation through a 70-\u03bcm nylon mesh cell strainer and red blood cells were lysed as described above. Next, 250,000 cells/well were allocated in a sterile round bottom 96-well plate and stimulated\nin vitro.\nPooled protein extract (\nn\n=\u20093/group) from the spinal cord of injured rats at 2, 10, and 20 weeks post-cSCI, respectively, was added (100\u2009\u03bcg/mL) into cultures of sham- or SCI-derived splenocytes from the matching time-point. All conditions were performed in duplicate. For each sample, two wells that did not receive any stimulation served as negative controls. After 3 days in culture, supernatants were collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\nTo determine levels of secreted IgG and IgM immunoglobulins by stimulated splenocytes\nin vitro,\na sandwich ELISA was developed in-house. ELISA plates were coated with 2\u2009\u03bcg/mL of rabbit anti-rat IgG or goat anti-rat IgM antibody (both from Abcam) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Plates were washed once with PBS and blocked with 4% GS in PBS for 2\u2009h at room temperature. Culture supernatants were diluted 1:10 and 1:5 for detection of IgG and IgM immunoglobulins, respectively. These dilutions were chosen because detection values of all samples fell within the linear range of the standard curve. For the standard curve, polyclonal rat IgG (Sigma) and monoclonal rat IgM (Invitrogen) antibodies of known concentrations were used in serial dilutions, covering the range of 1\u2009\u03bcg/mL-0.03\u2009ng/mL. Samples and standards were run in duplicate. The supernatants and the purified immunoglobulins were incubated for 4\u2009h at room temperature. Following washes with 0.05% Tween 20-PBS, HRP-tagged anti-rat IgG or anti-rat IgM detecting antibody (1:1000; Thermo Scientific) was added for 30\u2009min at room temperature. Plates were washed and developed with ultra-fast TMB substrate solution (Thermo Scientific) and neutralized with 2\u2009M Sulfuric Acid (Sigma). Lastly, absorbance at 450\u2009nm was measured with an ELISA plate reader. The concentrations of IgG and IgM in samples were interpolated from the standard curve to which a 4PL nonlinear curve fit was applied using the Prism (Graph Pad) software. For each sample, the concentration of immunoglobulins under stimulation was normalized to the concentration of immunoglobulins detected in cultures under no stimulation. SPSS Statistics (IBM) was used for statistical analysis.\n\nAssessment of splenic T-cell activation against injured spinal cord homogenate in vitro\nSplenic activation against homogenate from the injured spinal cord was assessed based on T-cell proliferation. Fresh spleens (\nn\n=\u20094/group) were harvested under aseptic conditions and transferred in complete RPMI medium (10% heat inactivated FBS, 55\u2009mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 1\u2009M HEPES, 200\u2009mM L-glutamine, and 100\u2009U/mL penicillin-streptomycin solution in RPMI 1640 medium). Single-cell suspensions were prepared by mechanical dissociation and red blood cells were lysed as described above. Cells were subsequently washed in 1% BSA in PBS and labeled with 10\u2009\u03bcM of carboxylfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) according to the manufacturer's instructions (eBioscience). Next, 250,000 cells/well were allocated into a sterile round bottom 96-well plate and stimulated\nin vitro:\nHomogenate (100\u2009\u03bcg/mL)\u2014pooled from the spinal cord of injured rats (\nn\n=\u20093/group) at 2, 10, and 20 weeks post-cSCI\u2014was added to cultures of sham- or SCI- derived splenocytes from the matching time-point. As a positive control for T-cell proliferation, samples were stimulated with the potent T-cell mitogen concanavalin A (ConA) (1\u03bcg/mL, Sigma). For each sample, a negative control was prepared where no antigen was added to the culture. All conditions were performed in duplicate. Cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C for 3 days. Next, they were washed in flow cytometry buffer (2% FBS in PBS) and incubated with Fc\u03b3R blocker (Innovex) for 20\u2009min on ice. The samples were then stained for 20\u2009min at 4\u00b0C with fixable viability dye eFluor 780 (1:1000; Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions and subsequently with CD3-PE (T- lymphocytes; BD Biosciences) for 30\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. An LSR II flow cytometer was used for data acquisition, where at least 10,000 events of viable cells were collected. T-cell proliferation was assessed with the FlowJo V7 plugin for cell proliferation. Division index, which refers to the number of divisions each cell in the culture has undergone, was the parameter used to evaluate T-cell proliferation (\nwww.flowjo.com/v6/html/proliferation.html\n). For this analysis, the signal from matched non-stimulated samples was used as a baseline.\n\nDetection of spleen germinal centers\nFour (4) \u03bcm thick formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections were de-waxed in five changes of xylene and treated with a graded series of alcohols. HIER method with Tris-EDTA buffer at pH 9.0 was applied. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked using 3% hydrogen peroxide. Rabbit anti- B-cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl-6) antibody (1:1000; Santa Cruz) was applied overnight at 4\u00b0C. An anti-rabbit IgG ImmPRESS polymer system (Vector Laboratories) was used for detection, following manufacturer's instructions. Color development was completed with freshly prepared DAB solution (Dako). Last, sections were counterstained lightly with Mayer's Hematoxylin, dehydrated in alcohols, cleared in xylene and mounted in Permount mounting medium (Fisher).\n\nQuantification of serum IgG and IgM antibodies against spinal cord lysate\nBlood was collected by cardiac puncture in deeply anaesthetized animals and allowed to clot for 30\u2009min at room temperature. Samples were centrifuged at 2000\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min and serum was collected and stored in \u221280\u00b0C until used for ELISA. ELISA plates were coated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 10\u2009\u03bcg/mL of pooled (\nn\n=\u20093) na\u00efve spinal cord lysate in PBS. Plates were then washed once with PBS and blocked with 1% BSA-PBS for 2\u2009h at room temperature. Serum was diluted at 1:50 and incubated for 4\u2009h at room temperature. Binding of IgG and IgM antibodies was determined by HRP conjugated anti-rat IgG and IgM antibodies and quantification was done based on respective standard curves as described above.\n\nDetection of IgG and IgM antibody levels in serum\nTo determine total levels of IgG and IgM immunoglobulins, we used our in-house ELISA protocol as described above, with the difference that here serum samples were diluted 1: 50,000 and 1:1,000,000 for the detection of IgM and IgG immunoglobulins, respectively. Each sample was assessed in duplicate. Concentration of IgG and IgM was determined based on the respective standard curves as described.\n\nStatistical analysis\nSPSS Statistics (IBM) was used for statistical analysis of all results. Data that met the criteria for parametric statistical analysis were subjected to means tests (independent\nt\n-test for two groups or analysis of variance [ANOVA] for more than two groups of samples, with Bonferroni\npost hoc\ntest where appropriate). Non-parametric statistical analysis was performed for non-parametric data (Mann-Whitney for two groups and Kruskal Wallis for more than two groups). Where necessary, variance-stabilizing transformations were used to meet the requirements for parametric statistical analysis. The significance level of all analyses was set to\np\n<\u20090.05. Data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM)."

    "Methods": "Study design and population\nThis study was conducted at the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMASS), the only level-1 trauma center in central Massachusetts with a 65-mile catchment area.\nAll consecutive adult moderate to severe TBI patients (GCS \u226412) admitted between November 2009 and May 2015 were prospectively enrolled in the observational Outcome Prognostication in Traumatic Brain Injury (OPTIMISM) study.\n18\nData were recorded in the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) platform at UMASS.\n19\nThe local Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved this study with written informed consent obtained from the patient or surrogate decision maker. For non-survivors, the IRB granted a waiver for documentation of written consent.\nOf all 393 consecutive OPTIMISM patients enrolled during the study period, five patients were excluded due to \u201changing\u201d as their trauma mechanism, resulting in hypoxic ischemic brain injury, which is distinctly different than TBI. We excluded all non-intubated patients on admission (\nn\n=\u2009128). We further excluded nine patients who had been enrolled in the early part of OPTIMISM prior to having IRB approval to consent and obtain post-discharge follow-up assessments. Our final cohort comprised 251 intubated moderate to severe TBI patients (\nFig. 1\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nFlow diagram of the final study cohort. We show the flow diagram of the final cohort of 251 intubated TBI patients from the OPTIMISM study. Of 393 consecutive OPTIMISM patients, 5 were excluded due to \u201changing\u201d as the trauma mechanism, 128 were excluded as they lacked intubation, and 9 were excluded as they were enrolled in the study early on before we had IRB approval to perform long-term follow-up. We had 199 patients with complete 3-month, and 185 with complete 12-month follow-up GOS available for the primary analysis. Multiple imputation methods were employed to impute the missing GOS for the sensitivity analysis. GOS, Glasgow Outcome Scale; IRB, Institutional Review Board; TBI, traumatic brain injury.\n\nClinical management\nThe clinical management has previously been described in detail.\n18\nBriefly, after initial resuscitation in the emergency department (ED) trauma bay, all TBI patients are admitted to a single, closed neurotrauma intensive care unit (NTICU) and managed in standardized fashion according to Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines\n20\nby the NTICU and trauma teams. All patients with a GCS \u22648 with evidence of brain swelling or high-risk lesions receive an intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor. Since 2012, additional brain tissue oxygen (PbtO\n2\n) monitoring is performed (Licox\n\u00a9\nBrain Tissue Oxygen Monitoring System; Integra, Plainsboro, NJ). Both ICP and PbtO\n2\nare treated using an institutional protocol that mimics the BOOST II treatment protocol.\n21\nEmergency neurosurgery is performed based on clinical indications and the discretion of the treating neurosurgeon. Intracranial hypertension is treated with repeated intravenous 20% mannitol or 23.5% hypertonic saline boluses and a stepwise sedation protocol. Coagulopathies are rapidly corrected by a trauma protocol using blood products, tranaxemic acid, and activated factor VII (before 2015) or concentrated 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (starting 2015) for patients on warfarin.\n\nMeasurements\nBaseline demographic variables, trauma mechanism, initial GCS score, pupillary reactivity, and vital signs including presence of hypoxia (oxygen saturation levels \u226489%) or hypotension (systolic blood pressure \u226489\u2009mm Hg) were collected. For hypotension, hypoxia, and pupillary reactivity, the worst findings either in the field, outside the hospital, or at UMASS ED were used for data analysis. Out-of-hospital and UMASS ED data were obtained from written ED reports. The trauma attending physician calculated the Injury Severity Score (ISS). The Marshall CT classification was assessed on the first available head computed tomography (CT) by weekly group adjudication between three attending neurointensivists (authors R.C., W.H., S.M.). Patients with non-evacuated mass lesions >25cc were coded as such, even if they were subsequently surgically evacuated.\n\nGCS variables\nFor this study, we utilized three different GCS variants: mGCS, GCS\ntotal\n, and teGCS. Per OPTIMISM study protocol, GCS was recorded as the lowest post-resuscitation GCS in the first 24\u2009h of hospital admission after sedation or intoxication subsided with all subscores recorded separately (eye, motor, and \u201cT\u201d for verbal in intubated patients). The enrollment mGCS was utilized in our current study. The GCS\ntotal\nfor intubated patients set the verbal component as \u201c1.\u201d Of all three Rutledge formulas developed,\n13\nwe chose the one with the highest C-statistic yet simplest formula to calculate an estimated verbal GCS subscore using the observed mGCS and eye GCS:\nThe teGCS was the sum of the calculated estimated verbal GCS subscore, and the observed motor and eye GCS subscores.\n\nOutcome assessments\nFunctional outcomes using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) were prospectively assessed over the telephone by one of three trained members of the study team at 3 and 12 months after trauma. Interviewers underwent prior training and utilized a published interview guide for the GOS.\n22\nThe study principal investigator (PI) conducted data review on randomly selected patients and supervised phone interviews in person at least quarterly to ensure data quality.\n\nStatistical analysis\nBaseline characteristics were described by proportions, or medians (interquartile range [IQR]) for the non-normally distributed continuous variables, as appropriate. We employed the \u201cCore+CT\u201d IMPACT logistic regression model\n11\nutilizing the observed data from the OPTIMISM cohort and the GOS assessed at 3 and 12 months. Although the OPTIMISM study also assesses outcomes at the 6-month time-point, this was only added later in the study period, providing a smaller number of patients with outcome data available at this time-point. For the purpose of the current study, we felt that employing the IMPACT model for 3- and 12-month outcomes was adequate, while leveraging the power of the much larger cohort with outcome assessments available at these time-points.\nIn our primary analysis we performed a complete case analysis using the 3- and 12-month outcomes with mGCS in the logistic regression model (as done in the original IMPACT model). We measured model discrimination using the C-statistic (area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve) and model calibration using the Hosmer-Lemeshaw \u201cgoodness-of-fit\u201d test.\n23\u201325\nThe C-statistic is routinely used to quantify the ability of a prediction model to accurately distinguish subjects who will develop a certain outcome from those who will not.\n24\nValues closer to 1 represent models with better discrimination. The Hosmer-Lemeshaw test evaluates whether predicted risk matches observed risk within a pre-specified number of subgroups,\n24\nand\np\nvalues closer to 1 mean better model calibration. Next, we substituted mGCS with GCS\ntotal\n, and teGCS, comparing the resulting model discrimination and calibration for both outcome time-points. Using the ROC CONTRAST statement of the SAS command PROC LOGISTIC, we tested for statistically significant differences between the C-statistics, using\np\n<\u20090.05 as the significance level. To determine the relative contribution of the different GCS variants to the outcome, we calculated theNagelkerke R\n2\nfor each model and its reduction after removal of the GCS variable (\u0394R\n2\n). Unlike the R\n2\nin linear regression where it represents the proportion of how well the model explains the variability of outcome, in logistic regression the Nagelkerke R\n2\n(\u201cpseudo R\n2\n\u201d) cannot be interpreted as easily and is thought to represent an approximation of R\n226\n. Our cohort had an 80% complete follow-up rate at 3 months and 74% at 12 months, including non-survivors. As a pre hoc determined sensitivity analysis, we re-analyzed the complete cohort including imputed outcomes for missing outcome data. We performed multiple imputations of five random data sets to obtain the missing 3- and 12-month GOS using the variables age, trauma cause, mGCS, Marshall CT-score, pupillary reactivity, hypotension and hypoxia in the field or ED, discharge destination, and discharge GOS.\nAll analyses were conducted in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC)."

    "Methods": "Animal groups\nMetabolomics/microarrays\nEighty-eight male Sprague Dawley rats (200\u2013250\u2009g) were used for metabolomic and 69 were used for gene expression microarray studies. The difference between these studies is that eight na\u00efve rats were used for the acute time-points in the metabolomics experiments and 16 in the messenger RNA (mRNA) experiments. They were divided into groups as indicated in\nTable 1\n. Na\u00efve cohorts from the 24\u2009h and 72\u2009h groups were determined to be age-equivalent and were used as one group in the metabolomic studies.\nTable\n1.\nAnimal Groups for Metabolomics and Array Experiments\n24\u2009h\n72\u2009h\n28 Days\n90 Days\nSCI\n(N)\n8 (1\na\n)\n8\n8 (4\nc\n)\n8 (2\nd\n)\nSham\n(N)\n8\n8 (1\nb\n)\n8\n8\nNa\u00efve\n(N)\n8\n*\n8\n*\n8\n8\nOpen in a separate window\na\nOne animal was excluded due to a surgical error.\nb\nOne animal died during sham operation.\nc\nTwo animals in the same cage died post-operative day 4, two animals died post-operative day 7.\nd\nOne animal was excluded due a BBB score of 3 on day 2, and one animal died during surgery.\n*\nIn the metabolomics experiments, 4 na\u00efve animals at 24 hours and 4 na\u00efve animals at 72 hours were used and these data were comined for analysis.\nSCI, spinal cord injury.\nImmune cell infiltrate analysis\nAn additional 30 animals (\nn\n=\u20096/group) were used for immune cell identification and quantification via flow cytometry in three groups at 72\u2009h (na\u00efve, SCI, and sham) and in two groups at 1.5 years (na\u00efve, SCI) after SCI at Baylor College of Medicine.\nSpinal cord injury\nAll animals were handled in accordance with our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved protocol. SCI rats received a spinal cord contusion injury at thoracic level 10 (T10) using the Infinite Horizons Spinal Impactor Device (Precision Systems Instrumentation) with 150 kdynes of force delivered over a 1-sec dwell time period. Sham-injured (sham) subjects were anesthetized and received a spinal laminectomy at T10, but did not receive a spinal cord contusion injury. All SCI and sham subjects received the following treatment during the post-operative period: 1) antibiotic (2.5\u2009mg/kg Baytril) for a period of 10 days; 2) the opiate buprenorphine (0.025\u2009mg/kg, twice daily for a period of 5 days, then as needed); and 3) 1.5 cc of 0.9% saline, twice daily, for a period of 3 days to ensure hydration. SCI animals received twice-daily, manual bladder evacuations using the method of Crede as modified for rats for an anticipated period of 10\u201314 days, or until neurogenic bladder evacuation was established. Beginning on Day 1 post-surgery, SCI, and sham subjects were examined using the non-invasive, Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan open field locomotor test.\n29\nSubjects that scored more than 2 on either Day 1 or 2 of the study were excluded as such a score indicates an insufficient level of spinal damage. All animals were fed\nad libitum.\nNa\u00efve animals received no other manipulations.\nEnd-stage tissue collection\nAt each of the time-points described above, animals were euthanized with 75\u2009mg/kg of Beuthanasia (390\u2009mg/mL pentobarbital, 50\u2009mg/mL phenytoin). Subjects were quickly decapitated and the testes were collected, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. The epididymides were not collected. A different set of SCI animals were injured and euthanized using the same methods but were transcardially perfused with ice-cold saline prior to perfusion; blood was collected transcardially into BD Microtainer tubes, allowed to coagulate for 30\u2009min, spun at 14,000\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min to separate out the serum supernatant. Collected serum was used to determine serum levels of bile acids.\nFlow cytometry\nA single-cell suspension was prepared from rat testes using a 70-\u03bcm cell strainer (BD) as described.\n30\nIsolated cells were washed with ice-cold flow cytometry wash solution (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] + 2% goat serum +2% bovine serum albumin), stained with fluorophore-conjugated antibodies (\nTable 2\n) or with ShK-F6CA, a fluorophore-conjugated peptide selective for Kv1.3, a marker of activated effector-memory T cells.\nTable\n2.\nAntibodies Used for Flow Cytometry to Identify Immune Cell Populations\nMarkers\nConjugation\nVendor\nCatalog number\nCD3\nAPC\nBD Pharmingen\n557030\nCD3\nBrilliant Violet 605\nBD Pharmingen\n563949\nB220\nPE\neBioscience\n12-0460-82\nCD11b\nV450\nBD Pharmingen\n562108\nCD103\nAlexa Fluor 647\nBiolegend\n205509\nCD161a\nPE\nBD Pharmingen\n555009\nLy6G\nFITC\nAbcam\nab25024\nCD4\nV450\nBD Pharmingen\n561579\nCD8\nPE\nBD Pharmingen\n554857\nCD62L\nAPC\nBiolegend\n202916\nOpen in a separate window\n\nSelection of antibodies used for flow experiments\nCD3 is part of the T cell receptor complex, expressed at the surface of only T lymphocytes. B220 is a 220\u2009kDa isoform of CD45 expressed mainly at the surface of B cells in mouse and rat.\n31\nCD11b is a surface marker for monocytes, macrophages and granulocytes.\n32\nCD103 is expressed on the surface of most dendritic cells.\n33\nLy6G is a surface protein predominantly expressed on neutrophils.\n34\nCD161a (NK1.1) is a surface marker for natural killer lymphocytes.\n35\nCD4 and CD8 are surface markers of helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells, respectively.\n36\nKv1.3 is a voltage-gated potassium channel whose expression on the cell surface is upregulated in C-C chemokine receptor type 7 effector memory T cells upon activation.\n37\nCD62L (L-selectin) is expressed at the surface of na\u00efve but not memory T cells.\n36\nCD4, CD8, Kv1.3, and CD62L also are expressed by other cells; thus, the use of double staining with CD3 to ensure their expression was only studied on T cells.\n38\nCells were washed and fixed in cold PBS + 1% paraformaldehyde. FACSCanto II or LSRFortessa flow cytometers (Becton Dickinson) with the FACSDiva software Data were used to acquire sample data within the Cytometry and Cell Sorting facility at Baylor College of Medicine, and analyzed using FlowJo software (Treestar). For each sample, doublet discrimination was performed on 30,000 acquired events.\n39\nMetabolomic analysis\nAfter collection at each of the time-points listed above, the right testes were homogenized under liquid nitrogen. Samples from 88 animals were processed and metabolomics profiling was performed by Metabolon Inc. (Durham, NC). Briefly, an unbiased metabolomic profile of testis from SCI, sham, and age-matched control rats was performed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (gas chromatography [GC/mass spectrometry [MS, Thermo-Finnigan Trace DSQ fast-scanning single-quadrupole mass spectrometer using electron impact ionization) and ultra\u2013high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy (ultra-performance liquid chromatography [UPLC/MS, Waters ACQUITY ultra-performance liquid chromatography and a Thermo-Finnigan LTQ mass spectrometer, which consisted of an electrospray ionization (ESI) source and linear ion-trap (LIT) mass analyzer). At the time of this experiment, Metabolon's metabolomics platform was capable of detecting more than 3,500 substances. Compounds found in the sample were cross-referenced to their library of compounds for identification. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) contrasts were used to identify biochemicals that differed significantly between experimental groups following log transformation and imputation of missing values, if any, with the minimum observed value for each compound. Metabolite outliers of more than 2 standard deviations away from the group mean were similarly excluded from analysis. Metabolites were filtered out of the dataset if they were not detectable in >60% of animals in the majority of groups or where the entire difference between sham and SCI group means was due to changes in 25% of animals or less, and subsequently excluded from analysis. Values were converted to a ratio to the mean of the sham group for graphing purposes.\nSerum bile acid\nSerum bile acids were measured using a method adapted from Woolbright and colleagues.\n40\nRat serum samples were prepared using a methanol extraction procedure to facilitate the removal of serum proteins by centrifugation. This was done by mixing 30\u2009\u03bcL of serum with 80\u2009\u03bcL of methanol spiked with internal standards and briefly vortexing, then centrifuging at 15 000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 20\u2009min. The supernatant extracts were injected (5\u2009\u03bcL) into a HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Bile acid separation was achieved using a 1260 Infinity Binary LC System equipped with a 100\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20092.1\u2009mm (C-18 BEH, Waters) column. The column temperature was maintained at 45\n\u00b0\nC and the flow rate was 0.3\u2009mL/min with a gradient in a 25-min run. Gradients were run starting from 95% buffer A containing ammonia acetate (water/methanol, 80:20 v/v, pH\u2009=\u20098.4) and 5% buffer B containing ammonia acetate (acetonitrile/water 90:10 v/v, pH\u2009=\u20098.4) and to 75% A from 0\u20135.0\u2009min; 75% A to 60% A from 5.0\u201310.5\u2009min; 65% A to 5% A from 10.5 to 18\u2009min; 5% A to 0% A from 18\u201322\u2009min; 0% A was held for 1.0\u2009min; 0% A to 95% A from 23\u201323.5\u2009min; 95% A was held from 23.5\u201325\u2009min to re-equilibrate the column. The HPLC eluate was analyzed in negative mode with electrospray ionization on a 6490 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) using the multiple reaction monitoring method. The drying gas temperature was set up at 250\u00b0C for positive mode and 290\u00b0C for negative mode, correspondingly. Drying and sheath gas flow maintained at 14\u2009l/min and 12\u2009l/min for both modes, respectively. Capillary voltage was set at 3500\u2009V for positive mode and 3200\u2009V for negative mode. The relative abundance of bile acids was calculated based on the peak area.\nMicroarray analysis\nMicroarray studies were performed in the UTHealth Microarray Core Facility under the direction of Dr. David Loose. The Microarray Core Facility provided experimental handling and support for all aspects of the Agilent microarray platform used in this study. The specific arrays used were the Agilent SurePrint G3 Rat GE 8x60K Microarrays. These arrays have 60,000 probes and a number of control probes for quality control assessment. We performed a total of 96 arrays on 12 groups as indicated in\nTable 1\nwith\nn\n=\u20098 for all groups. Following treatment, total RNA was extracted from the testis (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and gene expression profiles examined by array. The arrays were pre-processed and captured image data for microarray features was accomplished with Agilent's SureScan and Feature Extraction software. Data were background corrected with the local background algorithms in the Feature Extractor software. The main software used for subsequent analysis was BRB Array tools (v 4.4). Data were normalized using quantile normalization, and transcripts that were differentially expressed identified by univariate analysis at\np\n<\u20090.01 corrected for multiple testing (Bonferroni).\nCaspase-3 assay\nCaspase activity was performed on testis protein extract using the EnzChek caspase-3 assay kit #1, following the manufacturers protocol (Molecular Probes). This assay measures the increase in fluorescence generated by the cleavage of the aminomethylcoumarin (AMC)-labelled caspase-3 substrate Z-DEVD-AMC. The production of fluorescent substrate was monitored continuously every 5\u2009min for approximately 2\u2009h in a 96-well dish using an automated fluorescent plate reader with data acquisition software (LS55 luminescence spectrometer, PerkinElmer Instruments, Shelton, CT). The slope of the linear regression drawn through each time-point was used to determine change in fluorescence over time for each sample. A standard curve using known amounts of AMC was used to convert fluorescent values to specific catalytic activity.\n41\nAll assays were run under blinded conditions and all samples were randomized prior to analysis."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nThe cohort included 100 persons (50 patients with mTBI and 50 controls). The DTI and resting state data from this cohort have been used before in which four subjects were excluded because of increased head motion.\n7\n,\n26\nThe current work represents a re-analysis of the published data. In the current instance, an additional pair of subjects was excluded based on the quality of the DTI data. The final mTBI cohort consisted of 47 (mean age 27.3\u2009\u00b1\u20099.0 years) patients with mTBI who had been recruited from local emergency departments.\nInclusion criteria were based on the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.\n26\nA total of 47 sex and age (up to three years) matched healthy controls (HC) were included. Subjects classified as mTBI had a Glasgow Coma Scale between 13 and 15 at first contact with medical staff, a maximum of 30\u2009min loss of consciousness (if present), and a maximum of 24\u2009h post-traumatic amnesia (if present).\nSubjects were excluded if there was a history of neurological disease, major psychiatric disturbance, and additional closed head injuries with more than 5\u2009min of lost consciousness, additional closed head injury within the past year, learning disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or a history of substance abuse/dependence including alcohol. All participants provided informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki and the institutional guidelines at the University of New Mexico.\n\nImaging protocol\nAll images were collected on a 3 Tesla Siemens Trio scanner. Two DTI scans (b\u2009=\u2009800\u2009sec/mm\n2\n) were acquired using a twice-re-focused spin echo sequence with 30 diffusion gradients and the b\u2009=\u20090 experiment repeated five times (72 interleaved slices; echo time (TE)\u2009=\u20098.4\u2009sec; repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u20099.0\u2009sec; 90\n\u25cb\nflip angle; NEX\u2009=\u20091; slice thickness\u2009=\u20092.0\u2009mm; field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256\u2009mm; matrix size\u2009=\u2009128\u2009\u00d7\u2009128; voxel resolution\u2009=\u20092\u2009mm\n3\n).\nEach participant completed a 5-min resting state run using a single-shot, gradient-echo echo planar pulse sequence (TR\u2009=\u20092000\u2009msec; TE\u2009=\u200929\u2009msec; flip angle\u2009=\u200975\u00b0; FOV\u2009=\u2009240\u2009mm; matrix size\u2009=\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200964). Foam padding and paper tape were used to restrict motion within the scanner. Thirty-three contiguous, axial 4.55-mm thick slices were selected to provide whole-brain coverage (voxel size: 3.75\u2009\u00d7\u20093.75\u2009\u00d7\u20094.55\u2009mm) during the resting state scan. The first five images were eliminated to account for T\n1\nequilibrium effects; 145 images were selected for further analysis. Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems) was used for stimulus presentation. Subjects were instructed to passively stare at a foveally presented fixation cross (visual angle\u2009=\u20091.02\u00b0) for approximately 5\u2009min and to keep head movement to a minimum.\n\ndMRI pre-processing\nFA images were generated and normalized to a 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm\n3\nFA template in the Montreal Neurological Institute space using FSL (\nwww.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/\n). Age and sex were regressed for each voxel and for all FA images across both cohorts based on a model calculated using HC images only. Subject-specific analyses were conducted on FA data using the Enhanced Z-score Microstructural Assessment for Pathology (EZ-MAP) method\n4\nand the Distribution Corrected Z-score (DisCo-Z) method.\n10\nIn the EZ-MAP method, a robust estimation of FA variance from a normative population of HCs is calculated via bootstrap. Bootstrapped variance is then used to produce an enhanced Z score for a particular testing subject based on data from the normative population. A threshold is applied to pinpoint abnormalities, and clustering is used to identify areas with contiguously abnormal voxels.\nFollowing the EZ-MAP method with 1000 bootstrap iterations, voxel-wise mean and enhanced standard deviation images were obtained from HCs and used to calculate a voxel-wise EZ-score image for each subject with mTBI. Abnormal voxels were detected from abnormal clusters of a minimum size of 100 voxels (100\u2009mL) with an EZ-score larger than two. These thresholds including cluster size, number of bootstrap iteration, and minimum EZ-score, were selected following recommendations presented in the EZ-MAP literature for a maximal discrimination of patients and controls.\n4\n,\n9\nIn the case of HC subjects, the nth HC subject was excluded from mean and enhanced standard deviation calculation. The EZ-score of each HC is a deviation against the other HCs.\nFor the DisCo-Z calculations, mean and variance were estimated from the HC group and used to transform voxels from both samples into Z-score images. Given the known bias that occurs after this conversion, extreme voxels were calculated using a distributionally corrected threshold of either|Z|> 1.98 for HC and |Z| > 2.04 for mTBI based on the 94 subjects. Similar to the EZ-MAP method, clusters were obtained using a minimum volume of 100\u2009mL. Clusters of smaller size were discarded to reduce possible false positives. The Z-score, characterized by the number of samples, and cluster size thresholds were selected following the method described in Mayer and colleagues.\n10\n\nfMRI pre-processing\nData were pre-processed using statistical parametric mapping\n34\n(\nhttp://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm\n) including slice-timing correction, realignment, co-registration, spatial normalization, and then transformed to the Montreal Neurological Institute standard space at a resolution of a 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm\n3\n. Despiking consisted of the orthogonalization with respect to spike regressors. Each spike is represented by an independent regressor valued one at the spike time point and zero everywhere else. The DVARS method\n35\nwas used to find spike regressors where the root mean square exceeded three standard deviations. Time courses were also orthogonalized with respect to the following: (1) linear, quadratic, and cubic trends; (2) the six realignment parameters; (3) realignment parameters derivatives; and (4) spike regressors.\nWe did not consider including global, white matter, and CSF regressors because gICA is able to separate these signals in a set of identifiable artifact components.\n36\nIn addition, these regressors are not part of the standard pre-processing procedure followed in gICA.\n26\n,\n27\n,\n31\nA full width half maximum Gaussian kernel of 6\u2009mm was then used for spatial smoothing.\nData from all subjects were subject to a gICA\n37\n,\n38\nusing the GIFT software (\nhttp://mialab.mrn.org/software/gift/\n) to obtain a set of functionally independent RSNs. The number of components was determined to be 70 using a modified version of ICASSO\n39\n,\n40\nsuch that the overall R-index is close to the minimum and the quality index of any given RSN is above 0.7. This setup was a good consistency trade-off between RSN quality and number of components considered. A fifth-order Butterworth band-pass filter (0.01 0.15) Hz was applied to the time courses of each RSN as has been recommended in the literature.\n36\nBecause of the spike orthogonalization, spike time points are zero valued. To apply filtering, spike time points were interpolated using a spline, then set again to zero after filtering.\n31\nArtifactual RSNs were detected and discarded based on their frequency content following a published method.\n28\nRSNs were also manually inspected and classified into broader categories or discarded if their main activation occurs in areas of white matter or cerebrospinal fluid. Only the subset of 43 non-artifactual RSNs shown in\nFigure 1\nwas selected after agreement between three subject matter experts who individually rated the RSNs. More information of each RSN is provided in\nSupplementary Table 1\n(see online supplementary material at\nftp.liebertpub.com\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nResting state networks (RSNs) and resting state functional network connectivity (rsFNC) matrices used in this study. Ten groups of RSNs were established: SBC (subcortical), AUD (auditory), SEN (sensorimotor), CER (cerebellum), VIS (visual), SAL (salience), ECN (executive control), DMN (default mode), PRE (precuneus), and LAN (language). Repeated RSN names include or use the main Brodmann Area to avoid ambiguity. The rsFNCs with group differences have been highlighted in the rsFNC matrices. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nThese RSNs were organized in 10 groups: subcortical, auditory, sensorimotor, cerebellum, visual, salience, executive control, default mode network, precuneus and language. The rsFNC matrix was determined by measuring the correlation coefficient between the time courses of each of the 903 possible RSN pairs. For all RSNs and all subjects, the time points at which spikes were detected were excluded from the calculation of correlation.\n\nDiagnosis performance\nData from the two modalities were used as features to feed a classification algorithm. In FA based features, age and sex effects were removed during dMRI pre-processing in a voxel-wise manner. The voxel-wise regression model can be described as FA\nx,y,z\n=\u2009FAV\nx,y,z\n\u2212 (b\n0\n+ b\n1\nAGE\u2009+\u2009b\n2\nSEX) where (x,y,z) are the coordinates of voxel position, FAV is the voxel's fractional anisotropy value and FA is the regression residual.\nAfter age and sex correction, three different sets of features were used in the dMRI data. In the first set, FA values from all white matter voxels were used as features. The second set used features from the EZ-MAP method consisting of positive EZ-score cluster count, positive EZ-score total volume (based on the number of voxels with abnormally high FA), negative EZ-score cluster count, and negative EZ-score total volume (based on the number of voxels with abnormally low FA). The last dMRI set were DisCo-Z features consisting of the positive Z-score cluster count, positive Z-score total volume, negative Z-score cluster count, and negative Z-score total volume. In the case of fMRI data, the features used consisted of the 903 time course correlations of the rsFNC matrices. The fMRI features were orthogonalized with respect to age and sex before classification.\nA linear support vector machine (SVM) was used to classify subjects into mTBIs and HCs. Classification accuracy was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) measure. Similar to the feature selection process, classification accuracy can change depending on the specifics of the SVM configuration indicating the need for parameter tuning. The process of tuning, however, can lead to over-fitting problems if not properly handled. Over-fitting was avoided by using a nested leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) to select the appropriate SVM configuration as it has been done before in the literature.\n41\n,\n42\nThe sequential minimal optimization (SMO) and least square (LS) methods for solving SVMs were considered. Six different values [0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0] of SVM's soft margin parameter were also considered. Feature selection for the EZ-MAP and Disco-Z methods was accomplished by extensive search given the small number of features. The numbers of features for the other datasets were too large for extensive search. In the case of FA voxels and rsFNC features, feature selection was performed based on t values obtained from HC versus mTBI group differences. Six thresholds (2.0 1.0 0.75 0.5 0.25 0.0) were considered to discard features based on their t value.\nThe different SVM implementations were subject to a nested LOOCV loop that delivered a different configuration model for each sample left out. The nested LOOCV optimization loop was implemented in the following way: After omitting one sample, the remaining 93 samples were subject to additional LOOCVs. A total of 72 inner LOOCV loops (2\u2009\u00d7\u20096\u2009\u00d7\u20096) were used in the case of t thresholds corresponding to the possible combinations of two methods (SMO or LS), six soft margin values and six t value thresholds. In the case of extensive search, EZ-MAP and DisCo-Z had 180 (2\u2009\u00d7\u20096\u2009\u00d7\u200915 different combination of four features) inner LOOCV loops. The configuration of the inner LOOCV with the highest AUC value was then used to classify the left out sample in the outer LOOCV loop.\nThis procedure may change the configuration used to classify each sample unless the inner LOOCV loop chooses the same configuration every time. In practice, we look for a stable SVM model with few changes from sample to sample. Stability is one important piece of information that nested cross-validation provides, which in our case was measured using selection frequency.\n\nStatistical analysis\nIn addition to classification accuracy, we analyzed group differences for the fMRI data. Group differences of rsFNC were evaluated using two-tailed\nt\ntests with 92 degrees of freedom for each RSN pair. A false discovery rate multi-comparison correction was applied to the\np\nvalues of the 903 rsFNCs\nt\ntests. The alpha level for significance was taken as 0.05."

    "Methods": "Study design and data sources\nThis study used data from the Substance Use and Psychological Injury Combat Study, a longitudinal, observational study of post-deployment substance use and mental health problems and outcomes. Rationale, methods, and a description of the main cohort are described elsewhere.\n13\nWe analyze data from a subsample of Army active duty members who completed both an initial and follow-up questionnaire as part of the DoD's post-deployment heath surveillance program.\n40\nInitial questionnaires, known as the Post-Deployment Health Assessment (PDHA; Form DD 2796), were completed within 60 days before or after the return from deployment, and follow-up questionnaires, referred to as the Post-Deployment Health Re-Assessment (Form DD 2900), were completed on average within 3\u20139 months post-deployment.\n41\nQuestionnaires include a section where a clinical provider reviews items, asks additional questions, and can refer members for care. Members\u2019 self-reported post-deployment behavioral health problems and deployment exposures, including TBI, were drawn from the initial questionnaire, and the dependent variable, frequent binge drinking, was assessed on the follow-up questionnaire. This study used the updated 2008 versions of the questionnaires. Additional data sources included deployment information from the Contingency Tracking System, DoD occupation specialty from the Defense Manpower Data Center, and demographic and military characteristics from the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System.\n13\nFrom the main cohort of Army active duty members with an index (first) deployment ending in FY 2008\u20132011 (\nN\n=\u2009434,986), we selected a subsample who had an initial questionnaire matched to a deployment (\nn\n=\u2009333,803) using an algorithm described elsewhere.\n13\nFrom this sample, we selected members who completed the follow-up questionnaire, resulting in analysis samples of 240,694 males and 26,406 females. We included follow-up questionnaires that were completed within 30\u2013300 days of the end date of deployment: more than 90% occurred within 3\u20139 months post-deployment (data not shown).\n\nMeasures\nBinge drinking was identified on the follow-up questionnaire when members were asked to report, \u201chow often do you have 6+ drinks on one occasion.\u201d This definition is non-gender specific and less conservative than the definition endorsed by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, which defines binge drinking as five or more drinks for males and four or more drinks for females.\n42\nThe dependent variable, frequent binge drinking, captured members who reported binge drinking at least monthly. We constructed a measure of any binge drinking, which included members with any report of binge drinking.\nA TBI positive screen was based on self-reported items of at least one injury event during the index deployment (blast or explosion; vehicular accident/crash; fragment wound or bullet wound above the shoulders; fall; other event), accompanied by either an alteration or loss of consciousness (lost consciousness or got knocked out; felt dazed, confused or saw stars; didn't remember the event). This is consistent with the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine's definition.\n43\nMental health problems\nWe constructed the variable any mental health positive screen as an indicator of a positive screen for PTSD, depression, and/or harmful thoughts. A positive screen for PTSD was assessed with the Primary Care-PTSD (PC-PTSD), a four-item screen that measures symptoms of re-experiencing, avoidance, hyperarousal, and numbing in the past 30 days. Endorsement of three or more symptoms was considered positive.\n44\u201346\nThe two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) screened for depression by assessing how emotional problems impacted members\u2019 functioning in the past month; a score of 3 or more was considered positive.\n47\nA positive screen for harmful thoughts was met when members reported \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cunsure\u201d to either of two items that providers directly administered: if they had been bothered by thoughts of being \u201cbetter off dead or hurting yourself in some way\u201d or \u201cthoughts or concerns that you might hurt or lose control with someone\u201d in the past month.\nFor analysis, we combined the TBI and any mental health problems variables to make four mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories: 1) neither, 2) TBI positive screen only, 3) mental health positive screen only (a positive screen to PTSD, depression and/or harmful thoughts), and 4) both TBI and mental health positive screens.\nDemographic variables, measured at the beginning of the index deployment, consisted of: rank (junior enlisted, senior enlisted, officer), gender, race/ethnicity (White, Black, Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Hispanic, and other/unknown), marital status (married, divorced, other, never married), if members had child dependent(s) eligible for Military Health System benefits (a proxy for being a parent), and DoD occupational specialties (combat specialist; healthcare; functional support, services and supply; mechanical, electrical, engineering; other). Deployment events were based on self-report about the index deployment and included being wounded, injured, assaulted, or hurt; and combat exposure score (0\u20133; encountered dead bodies or saw people/killed wounded, engaged in direct combat/discharged a weapon, felt in great danger of being killed). We included length of index deployment (1\u201311, 12, > 12 months), any prior deployment to the index deployment, and fiscal year end date of the index deployment.\n\nStatistical analysis\nChi-square tests of independence were used to test for associations between gender and member characteristics. Multivariable logistic regression was used to model the association between TBI, mental health, and binge drinking with adjustment for demographic and deployment characteristics, and the number of months between completion of the initial and follow-up questionnaires. Regression diagnostics including multi-collinearity diagnostics were performed. We report adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The\np\nvalues were two-sided.\nAnalyses were stratified by gender because the distributions of demographic and deployment characteristics varied by gender in this sample, and because we hypothesized that the factors associated with binge drinking may differ by gender. Finally, the threshold used to define binge drinking on the follow-up questionnaire (6+) was not gender-specific; thus, findings for males and females may not be exactly comparable. We conducted a sensitivity analysis in the female sample using the any binge drinking measure as the dependent variable to determine whether the association between TBI and binge drinking depended on how binge drinking was defined.\nAll calculations were performed using SAS/Base and SAS/STAT software (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Brandeis University's Committee for Protection of Human Subjects and the Human Research Protection Program at the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs/Defense Health Agency conducted the human subjects review. The Defense Health Agency's Privacy and Civil Liberties Office executed the data use agreements."

    "Methods": "This project is part of a larger study on mTBI supported by the Department of Defense (DoD). These studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and by the Human Research Protection Official Review of Research Protocols of the DoD. Patient data was acquired in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Civilian patients from an ethnically diverse population were recruited from two emergency departments in Southwestern metropolitan\u2013area hospitals.\n\nSubjects\nThe patients were categorized into either the mTBI or the orthopedic injury group based on the guidelines by the DoD\n12\nand the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.\n13\nPatients, irrespective of race, gender, and ethnicity, were recruited by healthcare professionals (registered nurses, physicians, and emergency medical technician-paramedics) who had prior clinical experience with brain injury patients and excellent interpersonal skills. The screening process comprised a review of electronic healthcare system data, consultation with emergency staff, and patient interviews. Under special provision from the IRB, the Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test (GOAT) was administered prior to informed consent. Subjects needed to score 75 or higher in the test in order to provide informed consent and if not, a legally authorized representative had to provide consent.\n14\nAll subjects in this study had a GOAT score above 75. The following criteria were used for inclusion in the mTBI group: presence of a head injury, Glasgow Coma Scale score in the range of 13\u201315, a negative computed tomography (CT) scan, post-traumatic amnesia under 24\u2009h, and loss of consciousness for under 30\u2009min. Subjects with pre-existing psychological disorders, PTSD, substance abuse, and alcohol dependence were excluded from the study. In addition, subjects with either previous head injuries or with dominant left-handedness were excluded. Subjects in the orthopedic injury control group confirmed that they had not hit their head during the injury to the best of their recollection. In addition, they neither had visible signs of head injury nor had undergone any loss of consciousness or memory.\n\nMRI acquisition\nAll MRI data was acquired on a 3T Philips scanner using an eight-channel receive-only head coil. Three-dimensional T1-weighted images were acquired using the magnetization prepared rapid acquisition of gradient echoes (MPRAGE) sequence, with a repetition time (TR) of 8.1\u2009msec and an echo time (TE) of 3.7\u2009msec. The images were acquired with an isotropic resolution of 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm\n3\n. An automatic image quality assessment algorithm previously implemented elsewhere\n15\n,\n16\nwas applied to all the datasets. Images with inadequate quality (poor signal-to-noise ratio, image ghosting, incomplete brain coverage, etc.) were discarded from the analysis (\nn\n=\u20092).\n\nEstimation of cortical thickness\nGlobal and regional cortical thicknesses were estimated using FreeSurfer version 5.3.0 (\nhttps://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki\n) on a Linux workstation. The FreeSurfer processing pipeline is described in numerous publications.\n17\u201320\nBriefly, the preprocessing steps involve intensity normalization, transformation to the Talairach space, and a hybrid skull stripping algorithm based on watershed and deformable template models.\n21\nThe resulting mask is then labeled using a probabilistic atlas. Following the preprocessing, white matter segmentation is performed followed by generation of white and pial surfaces. The average distance between the gray-white boundary and the surface at each vertex is defined as the cortical thickness. In this study, the Desikan-Killiany atlas\n22\nwas used for neuro-anatomical labeling. Using this pipeline, cortical thickness was measured for all subjects at both time-points. The entire FreeSurfer pipeline was automated and the images were visually inspected for errors in preprocessing or segmentation.\nIn order to investigate group differences at the cross-sectional level, multiple comparisons analysis using FreeSurfer's Monte-Carlo simulation was performed with 5000 iterations, with a false discovery rate of\np\n<\u20090.05. This analysis was repeated at both time-points.\n\nLongitudinal analysis\nThe FreeSurfer longitudinal pipeline was used to evaluate cortical thickness differences over time within each of the study groups.\n23\nUnbiased within-subject templates were created using data from both time-points with an inverse consistent registration algorithm.\n24\n,\n25\nWithin this template space, various processing steps, such as atlas registration and regional parcellation, were carried out. Because of the common information that is available in the within-subject template space, this pipeline increases reliability and statistical power. Following regeneration of surface maps based on the longitudinal pipeline, paired statistical analysis using FreeSurfer's generalized linear model analysis with a smoothing kernel of 10\u2009mm was performed to evaluate the longitudinal differences."

    "Methods": "The Dartmouth Head Injury Model\nAll brain strain responses were obtained using the Dartmouth Head Injury Model (DHIM;\nFig. 1\n). The DHIM is a subject-specific model created with high mesh quality and geometrical accuracy based on high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of an athlete. Details of the model description, material properties, and validation performances were reported previously.\n22\n,\n35\n,\n36\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nThe Dartmouth Head Injury Model (DHIM) showing the head exterior (\na\n) and the brain components (\nb\n). The model incorporates whole-brain tractography from the same individual used for the baseline DHIM creation. A subset of fractional anisotropy-encoded transcallosal fibers is shown (b). CSF, cerebrospinal fluid. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nBriefly, the DHIM is composed of solid hexahedral and surface quadrilateral elements with a total of 101.4 k nodes and 115.2 k elements and a combined mass of 4.562\u2009kg for the whole head. The brain has a total of 56.6 k nodes and 55.1 k elements, with a combined mass of 1.558\u2009kg. The average element sizes for the whole head and the brain are 3.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.94\u2009mm and 3.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.79\u2009mm, respectively.\nThe entire brain is modeled with the C3D8R type of hexahedral elements\n37\nusing a homogenous, second-order Ogden hyperelastic material model with rate effects incorporated through linear viscoelasticity. A layer of soft elements representing the cerebrospinal fluid between the brain and its neighboring structures (skull, falx, and tentorium) is incorporated by node sharing to enable brain interfacial sliding.\nThe DHIM has successfully passed the numerical convergence test and is of high mesh quality in terms of warpage, aspect ratio, skew, Jacobian, minimum length, and minimum/maximum angle.\n22\nIn addition, the model has been successfully validated against relative brain-skull displacement\n38\n,\n39\nand intracranial pressure responses\n40\n,\n41\nfrom cadaveric experiments, as well as full-field strain responses in a live human volunteer.\n42\nThe overall \u201cgood\u201d to \u201cexcellent\u201d validation at the low (\u223c250\u2013300\u2009rad/s\n2\nfor the volunteer), mid (\u223c1.9\u20132.3 krad/s\n2\nfor impact tests C755-T2 and C383-T1), and high (\u223c11.9 krad/s\n2\nfor test C393-T4) levels of\npeak magnitudes as well as pressure responses provided important confidence of the accuracy of DHIM-estimated brain responses. In this study, the high-resolution T1-weighted MRI and DTI of the same individual used to develop the baseline DHIM were used for image registration, tractography, and strain computation.\n\nNeuroimage acquisition\nT1-weighted MRI (Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo, MPRAGE; voxel resolution of 1.2\u2009mm \u00d71\u2009mm \u00d71\u2009mm) and DTI (isotropic resolution of 2\u2009mm) scans were acquired in the Dartmouth Advanced Imaging Center. DTIs had 46 diffusion directions (collected with b\u2009=\u20091000\u2009s/mm\n2\n, NEX\u2009=\u20091) plus an additional volume without diffusion gradients (b\u2009=\u20090) serving as a reference image. Diffusion tensors, eigenvectors, and scalar diffusion parameters were computed using a well-established tractography software package, ExploreDTI,\n43\nwith corrections for eddy currents and motion before fitting a tensor model.\nIn this study, we used the pre-season DTI scans of the selected person to generate whole-brain tractography via ExploreDTI using the default set of parameters for a deterministic streamline approach, which were selected for optimized performance.\n43\nTracts were propagated from all brain voxels as seed points following the direction of the principal diffusion orientation at each seed point and subsequent voxel with a 1\u2009mm step size and linear interpolation. Tracts were terminated if FA fell below a specified threshold (0.2) or if the tract angle changed by more than 30 degrees. All tracts with lengths of 50 to 500\u2009mm were retained, resulting in \u223c35 k fibers for the selected individual.\n\nVoxel- and anatomically constrained fiber tract clustering\nIntravoxel fibers traversing a given voxel were identified from the whole-brain tractography by testing whether any fiber sampling point fell inside the boundary of the corresponding hexahedral element converted from the voxel. Automatic clustering of fiber tracts/bundles based on anatomical ROIs is still an active, ongoing research topic. Here, we adopted an existing method\n44\nto identify transcallosal fibers using the ICBM DTI-81 WM atlas\n45\nas an anatomical constraint. This atlas is a stereotaxic probabilistic map averaged from 81 normal subjects with hand-segmented WM parcellation of 50 deep WM structures. The atlas is provided within a standard anatomical template (ICBM-152, isotropic image resolution of 1\u2009mm\n45\n), which allows for transformation of a given individual's MRI and WM atlas into the same coordinates via affine registration. The registration was performed between the MPRAGE MRI of the individual selected for DHIM creation and the ICBM-152 template, using the ITK Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (Version 4.7;\nFig. 2\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nCheckerboard images overlaying the individual's magnetic resonance image (appears lighter) with the coregistered ICBM-152 template (background; appears darker) on two axial planes (\na,b\n). The alignment (arrows) suggests a satisfactory registration. A 10% randomly selected subset of the individual's fractional anisotropy-encoded, whole-brain tractography is shown in the ICBM-152 space (\nc\n). Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nTranscallosal fibers from the whole-brain tractography were identified by testing whether they traversed the genu, splenium, or main body of the CC based on the ICBM DTI-81 WM atlas. This could be determined by first transforming the fiber sampling points into the WM atlas space and then rounding their coordinates to their closest voxels to perform a voxel-wise overlapping test.\n44\nAlternatively, we converted CC voxels into hexahedral elements instead and directly tested whether real-valued coordinates of fiber sampling points fell inside the outer boundary of the aggregated hexahedral mesh. This avoided rounding errors and reduced the number of spuriously intersecting fibers.\nTo further minimize \u201coutlier\u201d fibers spuriously intersecting the target region, thresholding was performed based on the number of intersection points.\n44\nAdditional filtering based on geometry and tract self-consistency was also performed (e.g., by fitting each fiber into a plane to test its orientation, or by assessing the average distance from fiber sampling point relative to the tract centroid). For each CC subregion, less than 3% of the total number of fibers were considered spurious and were thus removed. This led to 1740, 2866, and 2661 fibers retained for the genu, splenium, and main body of the CC, respectively. The clustering process is illustrated in\nFigure 3\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nIllustration of anatomically or region of interest (ROI) constrained fiber tract clustering.

The pcBRA employs triangulated\nimpulses applied to the head center of gravity (skull, scalp, and facial components were simplified as rigid bodies). The shape of the acceleration impulse is not important (e.g., triangular, sine, or haversine), as long as the peak rotational velocity and impulse duration remain identical.\n46\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 4.\nIllustration of the three idealized head rotations (\na\n) and the acceleration/velocity profile used for impact simulation (\nb\n).\nFor the selected brain responses, the\nimpulse had a peak magnitude of 4.5 krad/s\n2\n, which was the 95th percentile of all measured\npeak magnitudes observed in collegiate ice-hockey (concussed and nonconcussed\n47\n) and was slightly below the median or average\npeak magnitudes for concussive impacts measured in collegiate football.\n48\nThe impulse duration was 10 msec (average value for\nfound in high-school football\n49\n; report on typical duration for\nunavailable). The total simulation time was 28 msec with a temporal resolution of 1 msec, which was composed of a 10 msec acceleration impulse plus an additional 18\u2009ms \u201chold\u201d with zero\n(i.e., at a constant rotational velocity) to ensure peak responses were captured (\nFig. 4b\n).\nThe choice of this particular acceleration-only profile without deceleration was made to mimic actual on-field head impact data available, where a single largest acceleration peak dominates.\n50\n,\n51\nLinear acceleration,\n, was not used here because\n-induced brain strain responses are negligible because of the near incompressibility of the brain. This was confirmed in terms of both maximum principal strain,\n(using DHIM and an independently developed head model, SIMon\n36\n), and WM fiber strain,\n21\n\nInjury susceptibility index\nFor each WM DTI voxel, the accumulated peak\n, regardless of the time of occurrence,\n, was computed for all its enclosing sampling points based on the Lagrangian strain tensor.\n22\nEach sampling point was considered \u201cinjured\u201d when its\nexceeded a given threshold,\n. A voxel-wise injury susceptibility index,\n, was defined as the fraction of \u201cinjured\u201d sampling points within the voxel, or formally:\nThe value of\nin percentage ranges from 0% (no injury) to 100% (fully damaged).\nQuantifying WM structural integrity or the \u201clikelihood\u201d of injury locally at each voxel is important to correlate brain mechanical responses with neuroimaging at the voxel level. Nonetheless, it does not capture the degree of functional impairment of a neural pathway, which could be of interest for clinical symptomatic measures. Here, we considered an anatomically constrained fiber (i.e., a single streamline in tractography passing through a given ROI) as injured when at least one sampling point, regardless of the location \u2014 either within or outside the ROI boundary\u2014has\nexceeding\n. This is important, because global functional impairment of a fiber could occur regardless of the injury location. A tract-wise injury susceptibility index (\n) was therefore analogously defined as the fraction of injured fibers from the entire tract:\nThe injury susceptibility indices depend on a pre-defined injury threshold. For illustration purposes, here we selected two representative\nvalues (0.18 and 0.09, corresponding to the upper and lower bounds of a conservative threshold; the former is also an \u201coptimal\u201d threshold\n14\n) to create injury susceptibility maps based on the voxel-wise average\n. While these injury thresholds drawn from an\nin vivo\nanimal study do not apply directly to the human brain, the optimal value was comparable to thresholds established from other real-world injury analyses in human TBI studies (albeit, based on\n; e.g., 0.21 in the CC or 0.26 in the gray matter, or 0.19 in the gray matter\n52\n,\n53\n). The lower bound value was also selected here because it was likely relevant to subconcussive impacts to the brain (which most likely correspond to a lower threshold).\n\nStrategies to assess tract-wise injury susceptibility\nEffectively,\nincorporates the axonal structural information to evaluate injury susceptibilities of WM neural tracts. Current model-based studies, however, typically assess the degree of injury based on an aggregated volume fraction of the whole-brain or specific anatomical ROIs exceeding a threshold, regardless of the location or distribution of high strain exposures.\n3\n,\n4\n,\n31\n,\n54\nTherefore, we further compared\nwith injury susceptibility measures based on the number or \u201cfraction\u201d of all sampling points as well as all traversing WM voxels for a given tract, regardless of whether injury occurred along the same or different fibers. Two additional injury susceptibility measures are defined, analogously to the CSDM\n24\nbut applied to a neural tract:\nand\nThe different WM injury susceptibility indices are illustrated in\nFigure 5\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 5.\nIllustration the different injury susceptibility indices (see text for details). ROI, region of interest.\n\nData analysis\nVoxel-wise binary injury maps were created by considering voxels with\n> 50% as \u201cinjured\u201d (i.e., chosen as the mean value of\ncorresponding to no injury (0%) and full damage [100%]). Similarly, binary injury maps based on averaged fiber orientations were also produced using the previous voxel-based approach.\n22\nThe two injury maps were then compared in terms of predicted WM injury percentages and Dice coefficient (\n) to assess the extent of injury and consistency in injury distribution, respectively. The Dice coefficient was previously used to compare predicted injury distributions using\nand the corresponding accumulated peak\n,\n.\n22\nFor the three transcallosal fiber tracts, distributions of\nwere generated for comparison. The tract-wise injury susceptibility index,\n, and the resulting binary \u201cinjury\u201d prediction depend on\n(\nEqn. 1\n). A definitive\nfor the human brain has not been established, however. Therefore, we parametrically varied\nacross a range of values (range 0\u20130.25, with a step size of 0.0025) to create\n-dependent functions to gain insight into its significance for\n. Further, we compared\nwith\nand\n.\nThe computational time to obtain\nfor all WM voxels (N\u2009=\u200964.3 k) for a 28 msec impact simulation using the voxel- and tractography-based approach was \u223c12\u2009min and \u223c66\u2009min, respectively. The time to obtain\nalong the transcallosal fiber tracts (total of 7267 fibers with 813.2 k sampling points) was \u223c28\u2009min, which scaled approximately linearly when compared with running on a 10% subset. All data analyses were performed with in-house programs (not yet optimized) in MATLAB (R2014a; MathWorks, Natick, MA) on a 12-core Linux machine (Intel Xeon X5560, 2.80 GHz, 126 GB memory)."

    "Methods": "Mice\nA total of 64 adult female WT C57BL/6 mice and their homozygously deficient chi3l1 knockout (KO) littermates (9\u201312 weeks of age) were used in these studies.\n15\n,\n16\nThe knockout animals demonstrate a more severe neuroinflammatory lesion than do their WT littermates. However, because the ultrastructural character of the TBI lesions in both WT and KO animals was the same, they will be described together. All animal studies were approved by the University of Pittsburgh Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and conducted in our\nAmerican Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (\nAAALAC) accredited facilities.\n\nCCI\nMice were subjected to CCI as previously described, with important modifications.\n15\n,\n17\n,\n18\nIn brief, mice were anesthetized. A 5\u2009mm craniotomy was performed over the left parietal-temporal cortex, and the bone flap was removed. CCI injury was produced using a 3\u2009mm in diameter flat impactor tip (1.5\u2009mm deformation, 6\u2009m/sec velocity). The bone flap was replaced and sealed with dental cement, and the scalp was sutured closed. In craniotomy-only animals, surgery, anesthesia, and recovery were identical to injured mice except that CCI was not performed.\n\nMouse TBI tissues\nOn 1, 7, and 21 DPI, WT and chi3l1 KO animals were perfused transcardially with sodium cacodylate or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Electron Microscopy Sciences catalog # 1222SK, # 1219SK, Hatfield, PA) followed by 50\u2009cc of superior reagent grade sodium cacodylate paraformaldehyde perfusion fixative or reagent grade phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde perfusion fixative (Electron Microscopy Sciences catalog # 1223SK, # 1224SK). Brains were extracted, post-fixed an additional 24\u2009h, and then transferred to buffer at 4\u00b0C for shipping to NeuroScience Associates (NSA, Knoxville, TN). Brains were treated overnight with 20% glycerol and 2% dimethylsulfoxide to prevent freezing artifacts, then multiply embedded in a gelatin matrix using MultiBrain\u2122 Technology. After curing, the block was rapidly frozen by immersion in 2-methylbutane chilled to \u221270\u00b0C and mounted on a freezing stage of an American Optical 860 sliding microtome. The MultiBrain block was sectioned coronally at 35\u2009\u03bcm thicknesses. All sections cut were collected sequentially into a 4\u2009\u00d7\u20096 array of containers that were filled with Antigen Preserve solution (50% PBS pH 7.0, 50% ethylene glycol, 1% polyvinyl pyrrolidone). Sections not immediately stained were stored at \u221220\u00b0C. Staining methods and quantitation were as previously described.\n15\nIn addition to the 46 brains (described subsequently) embedded using the MultiBrain Technology, 16 brains (8 WT and 8 KO) with craniotomy alone were available for paraffin embedding.\n\nLight microscopy histochemistry\nSection preparation, staining, and mounting were as previously described.\n15\nAdditional antibodies and lectins were used at the following dilutions: unphosphorylated neurofilament (SMI-311; BioLegend, San Diego CA; 1:1,000); phosphorylated neurofilament (SMI-312; BioLegend, Dedham MA; 1:1,000); microtubule associated protein-2 (MAP-2) (BioLegend, San Diego CA; 1:2,000); NeuN (EMD-Millipore, Bellirca, MA; 1:2,000); and Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO; 1:2,000). Fluoro-Jade B and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), APP (Abcam, Cambridge, MA 02139 1:200), and GFAP (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA 93013 1:1,000) staining of paraffin- embedded sections were performed as previously described.\n19\n,\n20\nWhole slide images were acquired for each slide using the Zeiss AxioScan Z1 imaging platform (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Munich, Germany), using a 20\u00d7 Plan Apochromat objective coupled to a 3 Chip CCD Camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan). All focusing and field of view assembly was handled by the Carl Zeiss Zen software (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Munich, Germany), which is integrated with the AxioScan device. Images were acquired using an 8\u2009\u03bcm extended depth-of-field approach, with a stepping size of 2\u2009\u03bcm. Each of the resultant image layers were merged into a single plane image using a variance-based technique as provided in the Zen software.\nEach slide was quality checked for focus consistency, and any rescans performed. Rescanning rate was near 20% of the specimens; this is attributed to having multiple-tissue sections per slide, where a slight histology artifact such as a bubble would affect the focus of nearby section(s). Once scanning was complete, a grid overlay was used with a defined ROW, COLUMN labeling system to export each brain as a separate whole slide image. The resulting image resolution used for analysis was 0.88\u2009\u03bcm/pixel in both X and Y direction.\nThe analysis was performed using IAE-NearCYTE (NearCYTE, Pittsburgh, PA), an in-house quantitative analysis system for whole slide images developed at the Thomas Starzl Transplant Institute, University of Pittsburgh. To quantify the amount of silver staining per hemisphere, each brain image was first loaded into NearCYTE and a threshold-based tissue detection was applied to find the overall convex hull of the brain section. This hull, or region, was then split into a left and right hemisphere by the software's polygonal sectioning tools. The tissue detection method also outlined large ventricle areas, or holes, in the tissue to be excluded from analysis and total area calculations.\nQuantitative analysis was performed by creating a pixel-based color model that identified those pixels in the hemisphere regions matching the defined intensity characteristics. The staining characteristics were defined by first removing those pixels associated with non-specific staining (e.g., vascular structures). This was accomplished by transforming the color RGB image into an optical density image and masking those pixels that correspond to the darkest color(s) that were morphologically grouped either as a small circle or oblong structure. The remaining pixels were then thresholded to meet the specific hue, saturation, and value parameters corresponding to positive silver staining. Once the model was defined and visually qualified on various random fields, the model was applied to all pixels within each defined hemisphere region, and a total hemisphere area and \u201cpositive\u201d silver pixel area was generated. The output was loaded into Microsoft Excel, and the area(s) for each brain slice was summed.\n\nElectron microscopy\nFigure 1\nis a low-power scan of one 35\u2009\u03bcm thick section stained using the de Olmos amino-cupric-silver technique. Silver positive lesions are readily identified and these regions were delineated in the subsequent 35\u2009\u03bcm thick section. This section was tacked to the bottom of a plastic petri dish with a collagen/gelatin mixture and then secondarily fixed for 30\u2009min with 0.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer followed by 10\u2009min osmication with 1% osmium tetroxide. The section was dehydrated in graded alcohols before infiltration with epon araldite. A blank epon capsule was then placed above the region of silver positive lesion and the plate cured. When polymerized, the capsule with attached section was cut from the petri dish and a 0.5\u2009\u03bcm thick section was taken from the block face. This section was stained with toluidine blue. Subsequent 100\u2009A thin sections were retrieved on carbon coated copper grids, post-stained in uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and viewed on a JEOL electron microscope.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nWhole mount image of a 35\u2009\u03bcm thick MultiBrain\u2122 section stained with the amino-cupric-silver technique.

Every 24th section was stained using the amino-cupric-silver technique then mounted on a 5.08\u2009\u00d7\u20097.62 cm glass slide. Lesions vary in extent from minimal damage in craniotomy only (e.g., top row, second from left) to severe damage with herniation and tissue loss (e.g., top row third from left).

Paraffin was removed, and sections for histology were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E; Gill's Hematoxylin 3 and Eosin Y; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), dehydrated with a gradient of alcohols, and mounted for routine pathological analysis (\nn\n=\u20094 for each group).\nSeparate, adjacent sections were stained with an antibody for microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP-2; anti-MAP2 AB5622,\nn\n=\u20093, 1:100; Millipore) to visualize dendrites, antibodies for phosphorylated neurofilament heavy (NF-H; SMI-31,\nn\n=\u20093, 1:500; BioLegend, San Deigo, CA) and non-phosphorylated NF-H (SMI-32,\nn\n=\u20093, 1:500; BioLegend), an antibody for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) to visualize activated astrocytes (anti-GFAP Ab7260,\nn\n=\u20094, 1:2000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and an antibody for IBA1 to visualize activated microglia (anti-IBA1,\nn\n=\u20094, 1:400; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Richmond, VA). Paraffin was removed. Antigen retrieval was performed for samples stained for GFAP, IBA1, SMI-31, and MAP-2 by microwaving in citrate buffer (0.01\u2009M, pH 6.0; Fisher Scientific) for 20\u2009min and cooling to room temperature for 30\u2009min before being washed. Antigen retrieval was performed for samples stained for SMI-32 by warming for 25\u2009min in a low pH retrieval solution (DAKO; Carpinteria, CA) before cooling to room temperature for 20\u2009min. GFAP, IBA1, SMI-31, and MAP-2 samples were blocked with 10% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 25\u2009min and then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the primary antibody. SMI-32 samples were blocked with 5% horse serum for 25\u2009min and then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the primary antibody. GFAP, IBA1, SMI-31, SMI-32, and MAP-2 samples were incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G secondary antibody (1:200 for GFAP, IBA1, and MAP-2) or with horse anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200 for SMI-31 and SMI-32; Vector Laboratories) for 30\u2009min at room temperature. All samples were washed, incubated with ABC reagent (A 1:50, B 1:50) for 30\u2009min at room temperature, washed, added to 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzadine solution (DAKO) for 1\u2009min (with the exception of GFAP, 30\u2009sec), and counterstained with hematoxylin. Samples were dehydrated with a gradient of alcohols and mounted. As negative controls, additional sections received the same staining protocol without the primary antibodies.\nSamples were analyzed semi-quantitatively by an individual blinded to the identity of the sections. To evaluate H&E stained sections, a 4-point rating scale of 0-3 was devised to assess (0, none; 1, rare; 2, occasional; 3, frequent) pathological findings, such as shrunken neurons, vacuolization, neuronal loss, and dark neurons. For MAP-2 immunohistochemistry, a rating scale of 0-3 corresponded to intensity and consistency of dendritic staining (0, uniform staining; 1, patchy loss of staining; 2, extensive loss of staining; 3, complete loss of staining). Samples stained with SMI-31 for phosphorylated NF-H were visually inspected for loss of axons, axonal swellings and discontinuities, and graded on a 4-point scale of 0-3 (0, uniform staining; 1, patchy loss of staining; 2, extensive loss of staining; 3, complete loss of staining). Samples stained with SMI-32 for non-phosphorylated NF-H were visually inspected for presence of non-phosphorylated and injured axons and graded on a scale of 0-3 (0, uniform staining; 1, patchy loss of staining and beading; 2, extensive loss of staining and significant beading; 3, complete loss of staining). Relative presence of microglia and macrophages was evaluated and graded on a scale of 0-3 (0, no IBA1 expression; 1, minimal number of IBA1 positive cells; 2, moderate number of IBA1 positive cells with varying presence of activated microglia [amoeboid shape] and macrophages; 3, high number of IBA1 positive cells with large number of activated microglia and macrophages). Presence of activated astrocytes was evaluated with GFAP and graded on a scale of 0-3 (0, no GFAP expression; 1, minimal number of GFAP positive astrocytes; 2, moderate number of GFAP positive astrocytes; 3, large number of GFAP positive astrocytes).\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical significance among LTP responses for varying repetitive injuries (\nFig. 2\n) was first determined with a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a\npost hoc\nBonferroni analysis (SPSS v. 22; IBM, Armonk, NY). For statistical analysis of S-R parameters, a one-way ANOVA was used to determine significance among groups (sham, single, double) for a given parameter (I\n50\n, R\nmax\n, m) followed by a\npost hoc\nBonferroni analysis for each ROI separately (\nFig. 3\n). Statistical significance among cell death responses for varying repetitive injuries was determined with a one-way ANOVA followed by a\npost hoc\nBonferroni analysis for each ROI separately (\nFig. 4\n). A one-way ANOVA was used to determine significance among groups (sham, single, double) for semi-quantification of H&E, SMI-31, SMI-32, MAP-2, GFAP, and IBA1 separately (\nFig. 5\nand\nFig. 6\n), followed by a Dunnett\npost hoc\nanalysis with the sham-injured group as the control condition for comparisons. Statistical analysis of the extended interval LTP data (\nFig. 7\n) was performed with a one-way ANOVA to determine significance among groups and a Bonferroni\npost hoc\nanalysis to determine significance. Significance was set for all calculations as\np\n<\u20090.05.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nRepetitive primary blast altered long-term potentiation (LTP). The percent increase in potentiation of evoked response following induction of LTP was calculated for samples receiving 0 (Sham), 1 (Single), or 2 (Double) primary blasts of varying Levels (1, 2, or 4). LTP was significantly reduced for the single and double Level 4 blast groups, compared with sham. LTP was not significantly reduced for the single and repetitive Level 1 blast groups. LTP was not reduced significantly for a single Level 2 blast, but LTP was significantly reduced for two Level 2 blasts delivered 24\u2009h apart (\nn\n\u2265\u20095;\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean; *\np\n<\u20090.05).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nStimulus-response parameters after repetitive Level 2 primary blast with a 24\u2009h inter-injury interval.

Semi-quantification of the samples\n(J)\nsuggests there was a nearly significant increase in microglia response to a single primary blast (\np\n=\u20090.058) and a significant increase in microglia response to the double primary blast exposure as compared to sham (\nn\n=\u20094;\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean; *\np\n<\u20090.05).

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll experiments were performed with adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (Charles River Labs International, Portage, MI) weighing 300\u2013350\u2009g. Rats were provided food and water\nad libitum\n. All protocols associated with this study were approved by the University of Kentucky (Lexington, KY) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee consistent with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Animals.\n\nChemicals\nACR was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Supelco, Inc., Bellefonte, PA). 4-HNE was purchased from EMD Chemicals Inc. (Merck KGaA; Darmstadt, Germany). PZ sulfate salt was purchased from MP Biochemicals (Solon, OH). All other compounds were stored in accord with the manufacturer's recommendations. Working solutions for all compounds were prepared fresh each day of experimentation. All chemicals used for experimentation in this work were purchased as previously reported.\n5\n\nIsolation of Ficoll-purified brain mitochondria for\nin vitro\nstudies\nRat brain mitochondria were isolated as previously published.\n5\n,\n10\n,\n33\nCortical brain tissue dissected from brains extracted from decapitated rats after CO\n2\nexposure and homogenized using Potter-Elvejhem manual homogenizer in 3\u2009mL of ice-chilled isolation buffer (215\u2009mM of mannitol, 75\u2009mM of sucrose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 20\u2009mM of HEPES, and 1\u2009mM of ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid [EGTA], pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH). Differential centrifugation at 4\u00b0C was used to separate nuclei and cellular components from crude mitochondrial pellet. The pellet was subjected to nitrogen bomb disruption followed by resuspension, then layered onto a discontinuous 7.5% and 10% Ficoll gradient. The resuspension was centrifuged at 100,000\ng\nfor 30\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. The resultant pellet was again resuspended in 25\u201350\u2009\u03bcL of isolation buffer without EGTA to yield a concentration of \u223c10\u2009mg/mL. Final protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit measuring absorbance at 562\u2009nm with a BioTek Synergy HT plate reader (BioTek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT). For each experiment, fresh mitochondria and buffer solutions were prepared and were used immediately for\nex vivo\nrespiration assays.\n\nPreparation of sensor cartridge and substrates/inhibitors for mitochondrial bioenergetic analysis in\nin vitro\nstudies\nThe Seahorse Biosciences Extracellular Flux Analyzer (XFe24; Agilent Technologies) can be used to quantify cell culture or isolated mitochondrial bioenergetics.\n34\u201338\nIn the current study, the XFe24 analyzer was used to quantify respiratory function and bioenergetics of mitochondria in intact and well-coupled (respiratory control ratio [RCR] >5). Mitochondria were isolated using Ficoll-gradient centrifugation, as previously described.\n34\nThe XFe24 analyzer offers a 24-well (7\u2009\u03bcL/well) microplate format that is ideal for\nin vitro\nstudies of the effects of compounds that either reduce or preserve normal mitochondrial respiration (i.e., complex I\u2013 or complex II\u2013driven oxygen utilization) when added directly to isolated brain mitochondria.\n38\n,\n39\nThe 24 wells enable side-by-side inclusion of multiple replicates that is ideal for\nin vitro\ndose-response studies of compounds that either cause, or protect against, mitochondrial dysfunction. One day preceding experimentation, 1.3\u2009mL of XF Calibrant solution (Agilent Technologies) was added to each well of the 24-well dual-analyte sensor cartridge (Agilent Technologies). The sensor cartridge was stacked on top of a Hydro Booster plate, which was stacked on a Utility Plate (Agilent Technologies). The stacked plates were incubated overnight in a 37\u00b0C incubator without CO\n2\n. The sensor cartridge was removed from incubation and placed into the XFe24 on the day of experimentation, the loaded with mitochondrial substrates and inhibitors at 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009concentrations. For the initiation of state III respiration (e.g., activation of complex I and IV), Port A of the sensor cartridge received (50-mM) pyruvate/(25-mM) malate/(10-mM) ADP. Port B contained 10\u2009\u03bcM of Oligomycin-A solution for the generation of state IV respiration. Port C contained 40\u2009\u03bcM solution of carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) for uncoupled, adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-driven (complex I) state IV respiration. Port D contained 100\u2009nM of solution of rotenone/100\u2009mM of succinate for assessment of uncoupled, succinate-driven (complex II) state IV respiration. During the automated sensor calibration, 7.5\u2009\u03bcg of isolated mitochondria were suspended in in 50\u2009\u03bcL in mitochondrial isolation buffer and added to each well of the cell-culture plate (Agilent Technologies) excluding background wells, which contained respiration buffer alone. The plate was then centrifuged at 2000\u2009rpm for 4\u2009min at 4\u00b0C to attach mitochondria to the 24-well cell-culture plate. After centrifugation 450\u2009\u03bcL of warmed (37\u00b0C) respiration buffer (215\u2009mM of mannitol, 75\u2009mM of sucrose, 0.1% BSA, 20\u2009mM of HEPES, 2\u2009mM of MgCl, and 2.5\u2009mM of KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, adjusted to pH of 7.2 with KOH) was added gently to the corner of each well for a total volume of 500\u2009\u03bcL. Experiments investigating the pretreatments of PZ, pargyline (PG), 4-HNE, or ACR were conducted once the mitochondria were fixed to the Seahorse culture plate (Agilent Technologies) are described below.\n\nIn vitro\n4-hydroxynonenal and acrolein dose response to inhibit brain mitochondrial respiratory function\nExperiments were performed to determine the optimal concentration of 4-HNE and ACR to inhibit approximately 50% (suboptimal dose) of mitochondrial function. Isolated mitochondria affixed to a culture plate (as described above) were exposed to 4-HNE or ACR, ranging from 10 to 100\u2009\u03bcM and 1 to 10\u2009\u03bcM, respectively. Following 4-HNE or ACR treatment, mitochondria were assessed by the XFe24 for oxygen consumption rate (OCR; pmoles O\n2\n/min). The OCR was generated by Agilent Technologies algorithms designed to calculate area under the curve. Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) software was used to isolate time-specific points wherein the generated rate calculations reflected the OCR of complex I and complex II, for example, the specified time points following the autoinjection of pyruvate-malate and succinate, respectively. Because mitochondria possess the capability to eventually utilize all of the ADP substrates and there exists a delay before oligomycin can inhibit respiration, the highest time points for ADP rates and lowest time points for oligomycin rates are used in place of software-generated averages. This is in accord with previously published methods.\n34\nThe current studies indicate that optimal doses of 4-HNE and ACR were determined to be 30 and 3\u2009\u03bcM, respectively.\n\nIn vitro\nphenelzine dose response to protect against 4-hydroxynonenal- or ACR-induced mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction\nIncreasing concentrations of PZ (3, 10, or 30\u2009\u03bcM) were exposed to isolated mitochondria (7.5\u2009\u03bcg) in 24-well culture plates (Agilent Technologies) for 5\u2009min.\nImmediately following PZ pre-treatment, mitochondria were exposed to reactive aldehydes, such as 4-HNE and ACR (30 and 3\u2009\u03bcM, respectively) for 10\u2009min. Culture plates containing PZ-pre-treated mitochondria with subsequent reactive aldehyde exposure were assessed for their ability to respire oxygen with XFe24, by measurement of OCR (pmoles O\n2\n/min).\n\nIn vitro\nphenelzine or pargyline treatment against 4-hydroxynonenal or acrolein\nSimilar experiments were used to determine the efficacy of a PZ to prevent 4-HNE- or ACR-induced respiratory inhibition. In these experiments, isolated mitochondrial were exposed to a 5-min pre-treatment of PZ 30\u2009\u03bcM, followed by a 10-min exposure to reactive aldehyde 4-HNE or ACR. PZ pretreatment concentrations were chosen based on the\nPZ dose response to 4-HNE or ACR\nand in accord with previously published methods published in isolated cortical mouse brain mitochondria.\n5\n,\n9\nConcentrations of PG were based on molar equivalency with the most effective dose of PZ.\n\nMeasurement of 4-hydroxynonenal- or acrolein-induced mitochondrial oxidative damage for\nin vitro\nstudies\nThe ability of PZ to protect mitochondria from oxidative damage markers 4-HNE and ACR was measured using western blot analysis. Based upon the BCA protein assay results and normalization of protein concentration across samples, 50-\u03bcg cortical mitochondrial samples were exposed to a 5-min pre-treatment of increasing concentrations of PZ 3, 10, or 30\u2009\u03bcM followed by 15-min exposure to 4-HNE or ACR (30 and 3\u2009\u03bcM, respectively). Equal mitochondrial aliquots to those used for respiration analysis were carefully loaded onto a pre-cast gel (12% Bis-Tris [w/v] acrylamide; Criterion XT; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA) with XT-MOPS buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories) for subsequent analysis of 4-HNE content. Mitochondrial samples assayed for ACR adducts were separated on pre-cast gel (4\u201312% gradient tris-acetate gels) using MOPS buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Proteins assayed for 4-HNE and ACR were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes with a semidry electrotransfering unit (Bio-Rad Laboratories) at 15 volts for 45\u2009min at room temperature. TBS (5.0% milk/Tris-buffered solution) was used to incubate membranes for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in TBST (0.5\u2009mM of Tween-20) with respective dilution of 4-HNE or ACR primary antibody. 4-HNE mouse polyclonal primary antibody (Alpha Diagnostics International Inc., San Antonio, TX) was diluted 1:2000. ACR rabbit monoclonal antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) was diluted at 1:1000. 4-HNE and ACR primary antibodies were detected by 2-h incubation at room temperature with goat antimouse or antirabbit secondary antibody conjugated to infrared dye (1:5000; IRdye-800CW; Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA) in TBST. Membranes were analyzed with the LiCor Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). 4-HNE and ACR protein smears were assessed 150 to 50\u2009kD and compared to untreated lanes as percent control.\nIn addition to meticulous care in normalization of protein concentration between samples and in loading each gel lane, after transfer, gels were stained with Coomassie blue to enable a visual estimate of equal protein loading across lanes. Moreover, when individual analyses required multiple gels and blots, we normally include a loading control containing a known concentration of 4-HNE- or ACR-modified mitochondrial protein to enable quantitation across multiple blots.\n\nStatistical analysis for\nin vitro\nmitochondrial studies\nAll results were calculated using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA), and expressed as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation. For mitochondrial respiration studies, ACR and 4-HNE dose response and PZ or PG versus ACR or 4-HNE were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), which, if it was significant, was followed by Student-Newman-Keuls multiple comparisons testing. Oxidative damage markers 4-HNE and ACR measured by western blot were analyzed by two-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett's multiple comparisons post-hoc testing.\n\nControlled cortical impact traumatic brain injury model procedures\nYoung adult male SD rats (Harlan Labs, Indianapolis, IN), weighing 300\u2013350\u2009g, were used in experiments wherein CCI procedures were used to induce a TBI. All of the following mitochondrial isolation studies involving respiratory and oxidative damage measurements were carried out at 72\u2009h. This time point was chosen based upon our time-course studies, which have shown 72\u2009h to be the post-TBI time point at which mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage are at their peak (Hill and colleagues, submitted). Rats were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane (SurgiVet, 100 series; Smiths Medical ASD, Inc. St. Paul, MN) and oxygen (SurgiVet, O2 flow meter 0\u20134 liters per minute; Smiths Medical ASD). Heads were shaved and placed into a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA). Isoflurane was reduced to 2% for the remainder of the procedure. Lubrication was applied to the eyes to prevent drying, and a rectal probe was used to maintain body temperature at 37\u00b0C by an electronic heat pad under the animal. A midline surgical incision was made to retract skin and expose the skull for a 6-mm unilateral craniotomy. The craniotomy was performed with a Michelle trephine (Miltex, Bethpage, NY) centered between bregma and lambda sutures, lateral to the sagittal suture. The cortex was exposed by removing the skull cap carefully without damaging the dura. The exposed brain was injured with an electronic CCI device (TBI 0310; Precision Systems & Instrumentation, Fairfax Station, VA). The dura was injured by a 5-mm-diameter beveled tip that compressed the exposed cortex 2.2\u2009mm at a velocity of 3.5\u2009m/sec and a dwell time of 500\u2009ms. A thin veil of Surgicel (Johnson & Johnson, Arlington, TX) was placed over the injury. A pre-made plastic cap with an 8-mm diameter was attached directly to the skull over the injury site with commercial cyanoacrylate. The cyanoacrylate was allowed to dry before the wound was closed with staples. Rats were removed from the stereotaxic head holder and placed into an incubation cage, which provided heat through conduction by an electronic water pump. Rats were monitored until the righting reflex was regained.\nSham groups of rats were subjected to the craniotomy, but not CCI. Vehicle treatment groups were exposed to craniotomy, CCI, and received the vehicle solution (0.9% saline). PZ treatment groups received the craniotomy, CCI, and the drug solution in its respective vehicle. Rats were randomly assigned to designated groups.\n\nIsolation of rat brain mitochondria for\nin vivo\ntraumatic brain injury studies\nRats were exposed to CO\n2\nfor approximately 1\u2009min until flaccid. Brains were rapidly extracted after decapitation. Ipsilateral cortical tissue was dissected on ice from the rest of the brain and an 8-mm-diameter circular trephine was used to extract tissue corresponding to the site of impact including the penumbra. The cortical tissue was homogenized using a Potter-Elvejhem manual homogenizer in 3\u2009mL of ice-chilled isolation buffer (215\u2009mM of mannitol, 75\u2009mM of sucrose, 0.1% BSA, 20\u2009mM of HEPES, and 1\u2009mM of EGTA, pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH). Differential centrifugation at 4\u00b0C was used to separate nuclei and cellular components from crude mitochondrial pellet. Tissue was exposed to two rounds of centrifugation (1300\ng\nfor 3\u2009min) at 4\u00b0C. After each centrifugation, the supernatant was decanted and diluted in isolation buffer with EGTA. Supernatants were centrifuged at 13,000\ng\nfor 10\u2009min. The pellet was resuspended carefully in 400\u2009\u03bcL of isolation buffer with EGTA, which was placed inside a nitrogen bomb (Parr Instrument Co., Moline, IL) at 1200 pounds per square inch for 10\u2009min to disrupt synaptosomes. Samples were then added onto a discontinuous 7.5% and 10% Ficoll layered gradient. Samples layered on the Ficoll column were centrifuged at 100,000\ng\nfor 30\u2009min at 4\u00b0C within a Beckman SW 55ti rotor. The resultant pellet was resuspended in 25\u201350\u2009\u03bcL of isolation buffer without EGTA to yield a concentration of \u223c10\u2009mg/mL. Final protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit measuring absorbance at 562\u2009nm with a BioTek Synergy HT plate reader (BioTek Instruments).\n\nMitochondrial bioenergetic analysis for\nin vivo\ntraumatic brain injury studies\nFor the\nin vivo\nTBI studies in which the mitochondria were isolated at 72\u2009h post-injury from the injured cortex for\nex vivo\nanalysis of respiratory function, the Clark-type oxygen electrode (Oxytherm; Hansatech Instruments, Norfolk, UK) was used to enable a more-detailed analysis of complex I\u2013 and complex II\u2013driven oxygen utilization than is possible for the Agilent Technologies XFe24 analyzer we used for the above-described\nin vitro\nstudies. Approximately 180\u2013200\u2009\u03bcg was able to be isolated from injured and uninjured cortical punches. However, 100\u2009\u03bcg of isolated mitochondrial protein were used as previously described\n5\nto assess mitochondrial respiratory function. Mitochondria were suspended in respiration buffer (215\u2009mM of mannitol, 75\u2009mM of sucrose, 0.1% BSA, 20\u2009mM of HEPES, 2mM of MgCl, and 2.5mM of KH2PO4, pH adjusted to 7.2) in a volume of 250\u03bcL, which was continuously stirred in a sealed chamber at a constant 37\u00b0C. In accord with previously published articles, respiratory function was measured as the amount of oxygen consumed over time (nmoles/min). Substrates were added to the chamber in the order presented in\nTable 1\n.\nTable\n1.\nInducers of Various States of Respiration (at Final Concentrations) for Ex Vivo Mitochondrial Bioenergetic Analysis in the Oxytherm\nState\nSubstrates\nAmount\nProcedure\nI\nNo substrates\nn/a\nEquilibrate for 1\u2009min Contains only mitochondria and respiration buffer\nII\nPyruvate+malate\n2.5\u2009\u03bcL of 5\u2009mM of pyruvate +2.5\u2009mM of malate\nComplex I substrates allowed to mix with mitochondria and reach a steady rate\nIII\nADP\n1.25\u2009\u03bcL of 150\u2009\u03bcM\nAllowed to achieve maximal respiration with a second bolus of ADP\nIV\nOligomycin\n0.25\u2009\u03bcL of 1\u2009\u03bcM\nAllowed to reach maximum effect in approximately 2\u2009min\nVa\nFCCP\n0.5\u2009\u03bcL of 1\u2009\u03bcM\nAllowed to reach maximum effect in approximately 2\u2009min\nVb\nRotenone\n0.2\u2009\u03bcL of 1\u2009mM\nAllowed to inhibit complex I respiration\nSuccinate\n5\u2009\u03bcL of 10\u2009mM\nComplex II substrates allowed to drive respiration\nOpen in a separate window\nADP, adenosine diphosphate; FCCP, carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; n/a, not applicable.\n\nWestern blot analysis of mitochondrial oxidative damage markers for\nin vivo\ntraumatic brain injury studies\nIn order to measure markers of oxidative damage (4-HNE), the following western blot analysis was used, which is in accord with previously published methods.\n5\n,\n9\nMitochondrial samples assayed for 4-HNE adducts were separated on a precast gel (12% Bis-Tris [w/v] acrylamide; Criterion XT, Bio-Rad Laboratories) with XT-MOPS buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Mitochondrial samples assayed for ACR adducts were separated on pre-cast gel (4\u201312% gradient Tris-acetate gels) using MOPS buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Proteins separated on gel were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes with a semidry electrotransferring unit (Bio-Rad Laboratories) at 15 volts for 45\u2009min at room temperature. Following transfer, membranes were blocked in 5.0% milk in TBS (20\u2009mM of Tris HCl and 150\u2009mM of NaCl) for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight in primary 4-HNE antibody solution TBST (0.5\u2009mM of Tween-20). 4-HNE rabbit polyclonal primary antibody (Alpha Diagnostics International) was diluted 1:2000.\nThe 4-HNE primary antibody was detected by 2-h incubation at room temperature with goat-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) or antimouse IgG secondary antibody conjugated to infrared dye (1:5000, IRdye-800CW; Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc., Gilbertsville, PA) in TBST. Membranes were analyzed with the Li-Cor Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences). The 4-HNE protein smears were assessed from 150 to 50\u2009kD.\n\nCortical tissue sparing analysis for traumatic brain injury studies\nAfter 72\u2009h post-TBI, animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal overdose of pentobarbital (150\u2009mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with 0.01\u2009M of phosphate buffer solution (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution in 0.01\u2009M of PBS at pH 7.4. Brains were rapidly extracted and allowed to soak in 4% PFA. Brains were removed after 24\u2009h and allowed to soak in 20% sucrose+PFA solution for an additional 24 hours. Tissue was rapidly frozen on the microtome platform at \u221220\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. A freezing microtome was use to cut coronal slices 40-\u03bcm thickness at a blade angle of 7.5 degrees to the surface of the tissue. Sections were taken from the septal area (intra-aural level, 10.7) to the posterior hippocampus (intra-aural level, 0.3). Every tenth section was taken for mounting; a total of approximately 12 sections represented one brain. Mounted sections were soaked in CHCL\n3\n(100mL)+EtOH (400mL of 95% EtOH) for 30\u2009min and then transferred to increasing concentrations of EtOH for dehydration (95%, 70%, and 50%) for 3min each, then soaked in dH\n2\nO for 3min. Slides were then soaked in Nissl/cresyl violet solution (5.64\u2009mL of 1\u2009M of acetic acid, 0.816\u2009g of sodium acetate, 500\u2009mL of dH\n2\nO, and 0.2\u2009g of cresyl violet powder [Sigma C1791]) for 5\u201310\u2009min. Then, slides were dipped eight times in dH\n2\nO, 50% EtOH, 70% EtOH, and 95% EtOH+acetic acid (500mL of 95% EtOH +12 drops of acetic acid), then 3\u2009min in 95% EtOH, 5\u2009min in 100% EtOH, 5\u2009min in Citrisolv stock solution, then 5\u2009min in a second batch of Citrisolv stock solution. Tissue sections were lightly covered with Permount and cover-slipped.\nSlides were individually photographed with a bright-field microscope at 1.25\u2009\u00d7\u2009. Tissue sparing across groups was processed utilizing ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) software. Analysis of rat brains was blinded and used the Cavalieri stereological protocol\n5\n,\n10\n; the group for which each rat belonged (vehicle, PZ treatment single dose, or PZ treatment double dose) was unknown. Each section was separated by a known distance (\nd\n), where\nd\n=\u2009mean section thickness multiplied by the number of sections between the sampled sections. Total cortical area was measured by pixels and converted to mm\n2\nand is defined as the dorsal aspect of lamina I to the dorsal aspect of the corpus callosum, and was measured for each hemisphere. Each area was multiplied by\nd\nto calculate a subvolume that, when summed, provided the respective total volume. The volume of the ipsilateral (injured) cortex was compared to the contralateral (uninjured) cortex and expressed as percent of spared tissue (ipsilateral volume/contralateral volume,\u2009\u00d7\u2009100). Ipsi- to contralateral comparison provided effective means of measuring spared tissue without having to compensate for variability in tissue fixation or processing across different brains and eliminated the need to euthanize 8 sham animals. Measurements of cortical spared tissue volumes were conducted in a blinded fashion.\n\nStatistical analysis for traumatic brain injury studies\nAll experiments investigating the effects of TBI on cortical mitochondrial respiration and oxidative damage, cortical \u03b1-spectrin degradation, and cortical spared tissue volumes were analyzed by one-way ANOVA, which, if it showed significance, was followed by Dunnett's multiple comparisons post-hoc testing. In all cases, statistical significance was determined as\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nThe subjects were male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (\nn\n=\u2009100) obtained from Harlan (Houston, TX). They were \u223c90\u2013110 days old (300\u2013350\u2009g) and were individually housed in Plexiglas bins (45.7 [length]\u2009\u00d7\u200923.5 [width]\u2009\u00d7\u200920.3 [height] cm) with food and water continuously available. Following surgery, the rats were manually expressed in the morning (7:00\u20138:30 a.m.) and in the evening (4:30\u20136:00 p.m.) until they regained full bladder control (operationally defined as three consecutive days with an empty bladder at the time of expression). The rats were weighed daily, and checked for signs of autophagia and spastic hypertonia. A rat was classified as having spastic hypertonia if the limb was in an extended, fixed position and was resistant to movement. The rats were maintained on a 12\u2009h light/dark cycle, and all behavioral testing was conducted during the light cycle. All of the experiments reported here were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee at Texas A&M University and all National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines for the care and use of animal subjects were followed.\n\nSurgery\nRats received a moderate contusion injury using the Infinite Horizon (IH) spinal cord impactor (PSI, Fairfax Station, VA). Briefly, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (5%, gas), and after a stable level of anesthesia was reached, the concentration of isoflurane was lowered to 2\u20133%. The rat's back was shaved and disinfected with iodine, and a 5.0\u2009cm incision was made over the spinal cord. Two incisions were made along the vertebral column, on each side of the dorsal spinous processes, extending \u223c2\u2009cm rostral and caudal to the T12 segment. Muscle and connective tissue were then dissected to expose the underlying vertebral segments. Musculature around the transverse processes was cleared to allow for clamping of the vertebral spinal column. Next, the dorsal spinous process at T12 was removed (laminectomy), and the spinal tissue exposed (\u223cL1-L3). The dura remained intact. The vertebral column was fixed within the IH device using two pairs of Adson forceps. A moderate injury was produced using an impact force of 150\u2009kdyn and a 1\u2009sec dwell time. After injury, a 15\u2009cm long polyethylene (PE-10) cannula, fitted with a stainless steel guiding wire (P01008, Ernie Ball Inc., Coachella, CA), was threaded 2\u2009cm under the vertebrae immediately caudal to the injury site. The tubing was inserted into the subarachnoid space. To prevent cannula movement, the exposed end of the tubing was secured to the vertebrae rostral to the injury using tissue adhesive (3M Vetbond Tissue Adhesive, 3M Animal Care Products, St Paul, MN). The wire was then pulled from the tubing and the wound was closed using Michel clips. To help prevent infection, rats were treated with 100 000\u2009U/kg Pfizerpen (penicillin G potassium) immediately after surgery and again 2 days later. For the first 24\u2009h after surgery, rats were placed in a recovery room maintained at 26.6\n\u00b0\nC. To compensate for fluid loss, rats were given 3\u2009mL of saline after surgery. Michel clips were removed 14 days after surgery.\n\nDrug administration\nDrug administration took place on the day after surgery, following baseline tests of locomotion and thermal reactivity. Baseline Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scores were balanced across all groups. Drugs were administered via an intrathecal route. First, rats were given a single dose of norBNI (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK) dissolved in distilled water (doses ranged from 0 to 0.32\u2009\u03bcmol). Two hours following pretreatment with norBNI, rats were administered 0 or 0.32\u2009\u03bcmol of morphine (morphine sulfate was generously donated by the National Institute on Drug Abuse [NIDA] Drug Supply Program) also dissolved in distilled water. The 2\u2009h waiting period between norBNI and morphine administration was chosen to account for the slow-onset of norBNI antagonistic action at the KOR, which reaches a plateau at 2\u2009h\nin vivo.\n23\nFiltered saline (0.9%) was used as the vehicle control, and to flush catheters following the injection of a drug.\n\nAssessments of sensory reactivity\nTo assess morphine's efficacy, the tail-flick test\n24\u201326\nof thermal reactivity was used immediately before norBNI pretreatment, and 30\u2009min after morphine administration. Rats were placed in restraining tubes and allowed to acclimate to the tail-flick apparatus (IITC Life Science Inc., Woodland Hills, CA) and testing room (maintained at 26.5\u00b0C) for 15\u2009min. Prior to testing, the temperature of the light, focused on the tail, was set to elicit a baseline tail-flick response in approximately 4\u2009sec in an intact rat. This preset temperature was then maintained across all rats. During testing, the latency to flick the tail away from the radiant heat source (light) was recorded. If a rat failed to respond, the test trial was automatically terminated after 8\u2009sec of heat exposure. Two tests occurred at 2\u2009min intervals, and the last tail-flick latency was recorded.\nTo evaluate the long-term recovery of sensory function, reactivity thresholds were also assessed after day 21 post-injury. Thermal reactivity was evaluated using the tail-flick test, as described. Mechanical reactivity was tested by applying von Frey filaments (Semmes-Weinstein Anesthesiometer, Stoelting Co., Chicago, IL) to the plantar surface of the hindpaws, in a manner previously described by others.\n25\u201327\nBriefly, stimuli were presented every 2\u2009sec until rats exhibited a motor (hindpaw withdrawal) and vocal response. The intensity of the stimuli that produced a response was reported using the formula provided by Semmes-Weinstein: Intensity\u2009=\u2009log10 (10,000 \u00d7 g force). If one or both responses (motor and vocal) were not observed, testing was terminated at a force of 300\u2009g. Each rat was tested twice on each hindpaw in a counterbalanced ABBA order (A\u2009=\u2009left paw, B\u2009=\u2009right paw).\nTactile reactivity was also assessed at the level of injury using the girdle test.\n28\nFor this test, the girdle region was shaved and a grid map of the girdle zone for allodynic responding was made on the rats using an indelible marker (44 squares). To ensure that the rats remained calm for testing, they were handled for 5\u2009min immediately prior to beginning the girdle test. A von Frey filament with bending force of 204.14\u2009mN (26\u2009g force) was then applied to each point on the grid, and vocalization responses were recorded and mapped onto a grid map of that rat. Because rats do not normally vocalize to this stimulus, a vocalization response indicated that a noxious stimulus was experienced. In mapping the area of response, the number of vocalizations were recorded (Nv) and normalized by the following formula: (Nv\u2009\u00d7\u2009100)/total number of applications (44), indicating the percent vocalizations out of the total number of applications.\n\nLocomotor recovery\nLocomotor behavior was assessed for 21 days post-injury, using the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) scale\n26\n,\n29\nin an open enclosure (a blue children's wading pool, 99\u2009cm in diameter, 23\u2009cm deep). Baseline motor function was assessed on the day following injury and prior to drug treatment. Locomotor behavior was then scored once per day for 1 week (days 2\u20137). Rats were scored every other day from day 9 to day 15 and every 3rd day on days 18 and 21. Because rodents often remain motionless (freeze) when first introduced to a new apparatus, rats were acclimated to the observation fields for 5\u2009min per day for 3 days prior to surgery. Each rat was placed in the open field and observed for 4\u2009min. Care was taken to ensure that all investigators' scoring behavior had high intra- and interobserver reliability (all\nr\ns\u2009>\u20090.89) and that they were blind to experimental conditions.\nAdditional measures of motor recovery were obtained at the end of the 21 day recovery period using tapered beam and ladder walk tasks.\n26\nPrior to testing, rats were habituated to the experimental context for 3 days (8\u2009min per day). During this period of familiarization, they were trained to traverse a wide beam (48.3\u2009cm) and enter a black box positioned at the end of the beam runway. The beginning of the runway was brightly lit, motivating rats to move toward the dark box. They were left in the box for 2\u2009min after they had traversed the beam. Rats were then tested on the tapered beam and ladder. The beam walk test\n30\n,\n31\nprovides a comparative index of the postural stability of the rats, as well as a gross measure of paw placement abilities. The ledged, tapered beam was 17.15\u2009cm wide at the start, and 0.95\u2009cm wide at the end. We recorded the width at which each hindpaw failed to plantar place on the beam. The average width across the two legs was used as an index of beam walk performance. The ladder task\n26\n,\n32\nprovides a measure of the extent to which experimental manipulations affect the fine motor abilities of the hindpaws. The rats were required to cross a horizontal ladder (20\u2009cm wide; 37 rungs at 2.5\u2009cm spacing) in order to reach the black box. Using post-hoc frame-by-frame video analyses, we then recorded how many times the rats did not successfully place their hindpaws (their paws slipped between the rungs). Each hindpaw was scored according to the number of errors made, with lower scores indicating better ladder walk performance (a maximum of 11 errors was recorded if no plantar placement was observed per hindpaw).\n\nHistology\nAt the end of behavioral testing, rats were deeply anesthetized (100\u2009mg/kg of Beuthanasia, i.p.) and perfused intracardially with 4% paraformaldehyde. A 1\u2009cm long segment of the spinal cord, which included the lesion center, was taken and prepared for cryostat sectioning. The tissue was sectioned coronally (20\u2009\u03bcm) and every 10th slice was preserved for staining. All sections were stained with cresyl violet for Nissl substance and Luxol fast blue for myelin.\n33\n,\n34\nThe total cross-sectional area of the cord and spared tissue was assessed at the lesion center using Neurolucida software (MFB Bioscience, Williston, VT). Sections \u00b1600, 1200, 1800, and 2400\u2009\u03bcm from the lesion center (rostral and caudal) were also traced and analyzed. Four indices of lesion magnitude were derived: lesion, residual gray matter, residual white matter, and width. To determine the area of lesion, an observer who was blind to the experimental treatments traced around the boundaries of cystic formations and areas of dense gliosis.\n29\nNissl-stained areas that contained neurons and glia of approximately normal densities denoted residual gray matter. White matter was judged spared in myelin-stained areas lacking dense gliosis and swollen fibers. The total area of each cross-section was derived by summing the areas of damage, and gray and white matter. Width was determined from the most lateral points across the transverse plane. These analyses yielded six parameters for each section: white matter area, gray matter area, spared tissue (white + gray), damaged tissue area, net area (white + gray + damage), and section width.\nTo control for variability in section area across rats, we applied a correction factor derived from standard undamaged cord sections taken from age-matched controls. This correction factor is based on section widths and is multiplied by all area measurements to standardize area across analyses.\n35\nBy standardizing area across sections we were able to estimate the degree to which tissue is \u201cmissing\u201d (i.e., tissue loss from atrophy, necrosis, or apoptosis). An accurate assessment of the degree to which a treatment has impacted, or lesioned, the cord includes both the remaining \u2018\u2018damaged\u2019\u2019 tissue as well as resolved lesioned areas. When we sum the amount of \u2018\u2018missing\u2019\u2019 tissue and the measured \u2018\u2018damaged\u2019\u2019 area, we can derive an index of the relative lesion (% relative lesion) in each section that is comparable across sections. We can also compute the relative percent of gray and white matter remaining in each section, relative to intact controls. These measures are highly correlated with various measures of behavioral performance including BBB locomotor scores and recovery of bladder function.\n35\n\nStatistical analysis\nIn this experiment, four norBNI doses were tested (0, 0.02, 0.08, and 0.32\u2009\u03bcmol). For each dose, half of the rats were subsequently treated with morphine and the other half with vehicle. This 4\u2009\u00d7\u20092 experimental design (eight groups) used a total of 100 rats (\nn\n=\u200912 for doses 0.02, 0.08, 0.32\u2009\u03bcmol norBNI with or without morphine;\nn\n=\u200914 for dose 0\u2009\u03bcmol norBNI with or without morphine).\nThe results were analyzed using a two factor analysis of variance (ANOVA). When main effects were found to be significant, the Bonferroni test was used for post-hoc analyses. Planned comparisons were also included in our assessment of the data, as we anticipated dose-dependent effects of norBNI on morphine's efficacy, even in the absence of overall main effects. This allowed for independent comparisons between morphine and vehicle-treated groups at each dose of norBNI. Lastly, in experiments with a continuous independent variable (e.g., recovery of locomotor function across days and histology), mixed-design ANOVAs were used.\nLocomotor scores using the BBB scale were transformed, as described by Ferguson and coworkers,\n36\nto help assure that the data were amendable to parametric analyses. Briefly, this transformation removes a discontinuity in the scale, which justifies the use of parametric statistical analyses, and increases statistical power. Additional statistical power was also achieved by obtaining a measure of locomotor performance 24\u2009h after injury, prior to norBNI or morphine treatment. By using day 1 as a covariate in an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), we substantially reduced unexplained variance and thereby increased statistical power.\n\nStatement of ethics\nWe certify that all applicable institutional and governmental regulations concerning the ethical use of animals were followed during the course of this research."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAdult C57BL/6 female mice (13\u201314 weeks old; 17\u201321\u2009g) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), then were randomly placed into cages (4\u20135 mice/cage) to acclimate to the laboratory environment. Animals were kept on a 12:12 light/dark cycle and group-housed in a barrier facility. At the time of surgery, mice were randomly picked from cages, then were alternately assigned into either injury or sham-injury groups. All procedures were performed according to The Ohio State University's Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice received a high-thoracic complete spinal transection injury. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (120\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg), then were given prophylactic antibiotics (5\u2009mg/kg, s.c.; Gentocin\n\u00ae\n). Hair was removed using an electric shaver at the level of injury and at the site of CFA to minimize interference during fluorescence imaging. Using aseptic technique, a partial laminectomy was performed at vertebral level T3\u2013T4, after which the spinal cord was cut using spring scissors. Suction was used to confirm complete separation of the rostral/caudal ends of the transected spinal cord. After surgery, muscle and skin were sutured and mice were injected with saline (2\u2009mL, s.c.). Bladders were voided twice daily throughout the duration of the experiment and animals received daily injections of saline and antibiotic (5\u2009mg/kg, s.c.; Gentocin). Animals were housed on cage warmers at 32\u00b0C throughout the study to maintain body temperature.\n\nInduction of localized skin inflammation\nTo induce localized skin inflammation, emulsions of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA; BD Difco, Lawrence, KS) containing 0.5\u2009mg/mL\nMycobacterium tuberculosis\nwere prepared in a 1:1 mixture with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), then were injected (s.c.) on each flank (100\u2009\u03bcL total/mouse). Injections were made into anesthetized mice at 1-day post-spinal cord injury (dpi). Anesthesia was induced in a Plexiglas\n\u00ae\nanesthesia box using isofluorane (4%), then mice were maintained at 1.5% isofluorane until injections were completed. After CFA administration, mice were handled for 30\u2009sec, then returned to their home cages.\n\nContrast agent for inflammatory reaction\nV-Sense VS-1000H DM NIR (Celsense, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA), a dual probe for MRI (\n19\nF) and fluorescence imaging (excitation max 750\u2009nm, emission max 780\u2009nm), was used to label macrophages\nin situ\n. A single tail-vein injection of V-Sense (170\u2009\u03bcL) was made into SCI and control mice 18\u2009h after CFA injection.\n\nIVIS fluorescent imaging\nMice were anesthetized and imaged five times during this study starting at 3\u2009h post-V-Sense injection (or 21\u2009h post-adjuvant injection). Imaging was performed using an IVIS LUMINA II system (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA) with 745\u2009nm excitation and ICG emission filters to detect the fluorescently tagged V-Sense tracer. Images were collected for a 7.5\u2009\u00d7\u20097.5\u2009cm field of view, f/2 lens aperture, and medium pixel binning. A sequence of exposure times was selected for each animal, although the 2\u2009sec exposure time was selected for analysis across all animals and time-points for normalization and to avoid overexposure. Mice were anesthetized in a clear Plexiglas anesthesia box (2.5% isoflurane), and then placed on non-fluorescent black paper on the imaging platform of an IVIS station. The imaging chamber was continuously infused with 1.5% of isoflurane and the platform was heated at 37\u00b0C during the course of imaging. Animals were imaged at 21, 24, 48, 72, and 96\u2009h post-adjuvant injection. This time interval was chosen based on published data showing that monocytes infiltrate cutaneous wounds within 24\u2009h with peak accumulation of wound macrophages evident at 3 days.\n34\n,\n48\nData were analyzed with the Living Image\n\u00ae\nsoftware (v.4.3.1, Caliper Life Sciences). The adaptive fluorescence background correction was selected and the image threshold was manually chosen so that only the adjuvant injection site was highlighted. All selected images were mapped to the same color scale, and then regions of interest (ROIs) were selected using the contour ROI tool. Total radiant efficiency (photons/sec)/(\u03bcW/cm\n2\n) was determined by the Living Image software for the selected ROIs, with radiant efficiency defined as the ratio of emitted light (photons/sec/cm\n2\n/steradians) to excited light (\u03bcW/cm\n2\n). This measure uses calibrated units to compensate for non-uniform excitation light patterns. For this analysis, it was impossible to remain blind to group designation because SCI animals were obviously paralyzed. However, analysis of fluorescent signal in each animal was unbiased because ROIs were determined using a single color scale and generated automatically by Living Image software.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging\nImaging was performed at 48 and 96\u2009h after CFA injection using a Bruker BioSpin 94/30 magnet (Bruker BioSpin Co., Billerica, MA) equipped with a 72\u2009mm diameter volume coil tunable to both\n1\nH and\n19\nF nuclei. Animals were anesthetized using isofluorane (3% in air for induction, followed by 0.75\u20131.5% in a mixture of 95% oxygen and 5% CO\n2\n). Respiration and body temperature were monitored using SA Instruments products (Stony Brook, NY).\n19\nF scans were acquired using rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) sequence: repetition time [TR]/echo time [TE]\u2009=\u20091956/8\u2009msec, RARE factor\u2009=\u20098, 40*40\u2009mm field of view [FOV], 64\u2009\u00d7\u200964 matrix, 2\u2009mm slice thickness, 100 averages, scan time\u2009=\u200926\u2009min, 5\u2009sec.\n1\nH anatomical scans were acquired over the same geometry (RARE sequence, TR/TE\u2009=\u20091200/7.5\u2009msec, RARE factor\u2009=\u20094, 40*40\u2009mm, 2\u2009mm slice thickness, 256*256 matrix, 2 averages). Data were analyzed using the Voxel Tracker software (Celsense, Inc.) from manually defined ROIs.\n\nTissue processing and\nex vivo\nanalysis\nAt 5\u2009dpi, animals were anesthetized and then transcardially perfused with 0.1M PBS followed by ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Spinal cords, spleens, and lungs were post-fixed for 2\u2009h at 4\u00b0C, transferred to 0.2M PBS at 4\u00b0C overnight, then cryopreserved in 30% sucrose/PBS at 4\u00b0C until tissues sank. For\nex vivo\nanalysis, tissues were placed intact on slides and imaged in the IVIS system. Images were collected for a 7.5\u2009\u00d7\u20097.5\u2009cm field of view, f/2 lens aperture, small pixel binning. A sequence of exposure times was selected for each animal, although a 20\u2009sec exposure time was selected for analysis across all animals and time-points for normalization. Adaptive fluorescence background correction was selected, and all selected images were mapped to the same color scale. For spinal cords, an ROI was created with the software free draw tool and this same ROI was applied to all analyzed images. Total radiant efficiency (photons/sec)/(\u03bcW/cm\n2\n) was determined by the Living Image software for the defined ROI area.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll results are expressed as group mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). Presented data are pooled from samples obtained in two independent experiments. For experiment 1, group sizes were\nn\n=\u20094/group. For experiment 2, group sizes were\nn\n=\u20094 (laminectomy [Lam]) and\nn\n=\u20095 (SCI). For experiment 1, one animal in the Lam group was excluded from all image analyses because of abnormally low V-Sense signal. For experiment 2, one animal in each group died during imaging at the 48\u2009h time-point, likely due to anesthesia complications; however, all preceding data acquired from these animals were used in the final analysis. For logistical reasons (e.g., access to MRI or IVIS), not all mice were imaged at all time-points in experiment 1. This created unbalanced group sizes at each of the time-points and required that we pool data from individual experiments. We then analyzed using a mixed effect model, incorporating repeated measures across time for each mouse. The model included group (SCI or Lam) and time post-adjuvant as two fixed factors and mouse as a random factor, allowing the baseline of each mouse to serve as its own control.\n49\nIn this model, the interaction term, group\u2009\u00d7\u2009time, enabled us to compare the difference between two groups at each time-point. Holm's method was used to adjust the multiplicity to control the family-wise error rate at 0.05.\n50\nData analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 software (SAS, Inc., Cary, NC). Otherwise, group means were compared by two-sample\nt\ntests with significance set at\np\n<\u20090.05 using GraphPad Prism v.5 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). All bar and category graphs were created in GraphPad. All images were generated in Adobe Photoshop CS5 v.12 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA)."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nFifteen individuals who sustained a TBI at least 12 months prior to enrollment and were identified as having abnormal GH secretion by glucagon stimulation testing (maximum GH response less than 8\u2009ng/mL)\n36\n,\n37\nwere enrolled into a 1-year open-label rhGH replacement study. Exclusion criteria included: a) premorbid history of a neurological disorder (e.g., neurodegenerative disease); b) not fluent in English; c) aphasia syndrome; and/or d) inability to complete neuropsychological testing (secondary to physical limitations or low levels of cognitive functioning).\nThe subjects consisted of 10 males and five females with self-reported history of moderate-to-severe TBI. All subjects were community dwelling individuals and were not receiving formal rehabilitation services at the time of their participation. The racial breakdown of the sample was 13 Caucasian, one Hispanic, and one African-American. Other subject demographics are shown in\nTable 1\n. All participants experienced a closed-head TBI (9 motor vehicle accidents, 4 falls, 1 assault, and 1 gunshot wound) secondary to a motor vehicle accident or a fall and were not in litigation for purposes of remuneration for their injuries. Mean estimated pre-morbid full scale IQ, assessed using the North American Adult Reading Test\n38\nwas 107.6 (standard deviation\u2009=\u20098.9). A subset of these subjects (\nn\n=\u20099) were tested for peak muscle force production and muscle fatigue as described below. All procedures were approved by a university institutional review board.\nTable\n1.\nSubject Characteristics (n\u2009=\u200915)\nMean\nSD\nMedian\nRange\nAge at injury (year)\n34.3\n15.7\n38.6\n10\u201360\nAge at enrollment (year)\n45.5\n11.2\n46.2\n21\u201362\nTime since injury at enrollment (year)\n11.2\n11.4\n4.8\n1.1\u201339.8\n*\nBody mass index (kg/m\n2\n)\n29.4\n4.9\n27.2\n22.4\u201340.7\nOpen in a separate window\n*\nOnly one subject was 40 years post-injury. All other subjects were between 1 and 22 years post-injury.\nSD, standard deviation.\n\nProcedures: Recombinant GH administration\nThe GH dose was not dependent on age, sex, body mass, or body mass index. All subjects complied with the daily subcutaneous injection of rhGH daily for the 12 months of the study. At baseline, 6 months, and 12 months, subjects had blood drawn for complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, hepatic function, lipid panel, and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). No tumor factors were measured.\nThe dosing scheme of rhGH used in the study was: 1) 0.2\u2009mg/day for 2 months followed by IGF-1 check; then, 2) 0.4\u2009mg/day for 2 months followed by IGF-1 check; then, 3) 0.6\u2009mg/day for the remainder of the study unless IGF-1 went above 399\u2009ng/mL. This dosing scheme is the recommended dosing in adults with GHD so as to decrease the risks of type 2 diabetes mellitus and carpal tunnel syndrome. Two subjects were on doses of less than 0.6\u2009mg/day (0.5\u2009mg/day) due to symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. In both cases, symptoms resolved on the lower dose.\n\nProcedures: Cardiorespiratory testing\nSubjects were tested using a modified\n39\nBalke\n40\nprotocol during which electrocardiography was performed; expired gases were collected and analyzed by an automated metabolic cart. The modified Balke is a treadmill protocol and all subjects were able to ambulate independently without verbal or physical assistance. Speed was gradually increased in the first 2\u2009min at 1% incline to a speed that an investigator determined could be maintained for 6\u201312\u2009min. Incline was then increased 2% every min until the subject met two of three peak criteria (O\n2\nplateau, heart rate >85% age-predicted maximum, respiratory exchange ratio >1.15)\n41\nor ambulation became unsafe. This protocol has been shown to be reliable in individuals with TBI.\n42\n\nProcedures: Muscle force testing\nIn a subset of patients (\nn\n=\u20099, four females, five males), maximal torque production of the knee extensors was measured during isometric and concentric isokinetic contractions using a dynamometer. In addition, muscle fatigue was measured during repetitive isokinetic contractions. Subjects were tested in a seated position with straps across the ankle and thigh of the lower extremity being tested, as well as across the hips and chest to reduce movement. Isometric efforts were conducted with a knee angle of 90\u00b0; isokinetic efforts were initiated at this knee angle, as well, with a range of motion of 75\u00b0. The right leg was tested, unless it was the leg more affected by the TBI.\nThe sequence of testing began with determination of maximal torque production during five consecutive maximal efforts at angular velocities of 60\u00b0/sec, then 180\u00b0/sec, with each set of maximal efforts preceded by a warm-up set of five repetitions at the same angular velocity and 2\u2009min of rest between sets. The highest value from the five maximal efforts was taken as the maximum for each velocity. Two minutes after completion of the last 180\u00b0/sec set, subjects completed an additional warm-up practice set of 30 very low-resistance isokinetic contractions with the angular velocity set at 540\u00b0/sec (this velocity was chosen to provide minimal resistance during practice of prolonged repetitive efforts; subjects were not instructed to attempt to achieve this velocity). After a 2-min rest, maximal isometric force production was measured during three maximal efforts held for 5\u2009sec with maximal efforts occurring approximately once each minute. The highest torque achieved during the three efforts was considered the maximal isometric strength. Similarly, maximal isokinetic strength at a velocity of 90\u00b0/sec was determined during three maximal efforts occurring approximately once every 20\u2009sec. After a 5-min rest period, force production during fatiguing repetitive isokinetic contractions (90\u00b0/sec) was measured. Before muscle dynamometry testing and immediately after the final contraction of the muscle fatigue test, subjects were asked to rate their perceptual fatigue on a 0\u201310 scale (0\u2009=\u2009no fatigue).\n\nProcedures: Body composition\nWhole\u2013body lean mass and fat mass, leg lean mass, and whole\u2013body percentage body fat were determined using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry.\n\nProcedures: Neuropsychological testing\nThe neuropsychological test battery consisted of standardized behavioral/psychiatric inventories and cognitive measures and was administered to all participants in counterbalanced order at baseline and 12 months. The neuropsychological measures that were administered assessed learning and memory (verbal and nonverbal), verbal working memory, speed of information processing, and speeded word retrieval, and included: Digit Span from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III)\n43\n; California Verbal Learning Test-II\n44\n; Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-R\n45\n; Processing Speed Index from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale\n43\n; Letter and Category Fluency\n44\n; Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)\n46\n; and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS).\n47\n\nData analysis\nOxygen pulse was calculated by dividing VO\n2\nconsumed (mL/min) by heart rate (beats/min) yielding mL/beat.\n48\nThis provides an estimate of cardiac stroke volume. Data were analyzed using SPSS v. 11.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL.). Paired samples\nt\n-tests were performed on all pre-treatment and post-treatment measures with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Maximal isometric and isokinetic force production before and after treatment were compared using a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), with factors of time (pre-treatment vs. post-treatment) and sex (male vs. female). Torque- and power-velocity relationships were examined using regression techniques. Skeletal muscle fatigue was analyzed using a two-way repeated measure ANOVA. The exercise-induced change in perceptual fatigue before and after rhGH therapy was compared using a paired, two-tailed\nt\n-test. All analyses were performed at an alpha level of 0.05."

To focus on the effects of TBI without co-morbidity, participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were excluded from the current analysis.\nTable\n1.\nParticipant Demographics\nGroup\nN\nAge\nYears of education\nIQ\nRace\nHC\n19\nM\u2009=\u200959.6 (SD\u2009=\u200913.9)\nM\u2009=\u200916.2 (SD\u2009=\u20092.0)\nM\u2009=\u2009117.2\na\n(SD\u2009=\u20099.2)\n1/18 African American/Caucasian\nTBI\n19\nM\u2009=\u200950.0 (SD\u2009=\u200913.1)\nM\u2009=\u200916.4\na\n(SD\u2009=\u20091.0)\nM\u2009=\u2009109.8\na\n(SD\u2009=\u20099.1)\n7/12 African Americans/Caucasian\nOpen in a separate window\nIQ, intelligence quotient; HC, healthy control subjects; SD, standard deviation; TBI, traumatic brain injury.\na\nN, 18.\nTable\n2.\nParticipant Traumatic Brain Injury History\nMean\nSD\nRange\nTotal number of concussions\n8.3\n5.4\n1\u201320\nNumber of grade 3 concussions\n1.7\n1.7\n1\u20135\nYears since retired\na\n23.2\n14.4\n5\u201350\nOpen in a separate window\nSD, standard deviation\nN, 18\na\nN, 17\nAn independent sample\nt\ntest revealed a significant difference for age between the TBI group (M\u2009=\u200950.0, SD\u2009=\u200913.1) and HC group (M\u2009=\u200959.6, SD\u2009=\u200913.9);\nt\n(36)\u2009=\u20092.2,\np\n=\u20090.034. Thus, all analyses used age as a covariate to control for group differences. Informed consent was obtained from all participants in accordance with the protocols approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of Texas at Dallas and of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.\n\nGeneral procedure\nScalp EEG data were recorded while subjects performed the SORT task. Participants were seated approximately 46 inches away from a computer monitor. The participant was presented with two visual words representing object features. In some instances, the word pairs facilitated retrieval (i.e., \u201cdesert\u201d and \u201chumps\u201d should elicit \u201ccamel\u201d) and in other trials, word pairs did not (i.e., \u201cdesert\u201d and \u201cbarks\u201d). The stimuli consisted of 57 retrieval pairs of words and 55 non-retrieval pairs. The words were presented one above the other. Both words remained on the screen for 3\u2009sec. In between each pair of words, a fixation cross was displayed on the screen for 3\u2009sec. Subjects used a button box with their right hand and were instructed to press the button under their index finger for retrievals and the button under their middle finger for non-retrievals.\n\nERP acquisition and data analysis\nWe recorded EEG using a 64-electrode Neuroscan Quickcap, Neuroscan SynAmps2 amplifiers, and Scan 4.3.2 software. Continuous EEG was sampled at 1\u2009kHz. Electrode impedances were kept below 5\u2009kOhms. The data were high-pass filtered offline at 1\u2009Hz and low pass filtered at 30\u2009Hz. The reference electrode was at the vertex of the scalp.\nWe analyzed the data using functions from EEGLAB version 13-1-1b\n20\nrunning under Matlab 7.11.0 (MATLAB and EEGLAB Toolbox Release 2010b, The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA). Pre-processing consisted of down-sampling to 512\u2009Hz, excluding the data from electrodes that exhibited unacceptably high levels of electrical noise and correcting for artifacts using the \u201cRunica\u201d algorithm (with the \u201cextended,\u201d 1 option),\n20\n,\n21\nan implementation of the logistic infomax independent component analysis algorithm of Bell and Sejnowski.\n22\nWe identified stereotyped artifacts by visual inspection of the spatial and temporal representation of the independent components. Continuous data were then segmented into non-overlapping epochs spanning from 500\u2009msec before to 2000\u2009msec after the presentation of the visual stimuli. Epochs containing high amplitude, high frequency muscle noise and other irregular artifacts were removed. Only trials to which the subject responded correctly and those without artifacts were subjected to further analysis, rejecting on average 13% or less of all epochs. Data from missing electrodes were interpolated and re-referenced to the average reference.\n23\nFor each trial and electrode, the mean amplitude of the pre-stimulus interval (-100\u2009msec to 0\u2009msec) was subtracted from each time point in the post-stimulus interval (1\u2009msec to 1500\u2009msec). Baseline-correction single trials were averaged within condition to estimate the ERP in each subject and condition (retrieval, non-retrieval). Based on previous word retrieval findings, we focused on the left fronto-temporal area (electrode F7). The mean amplitude at F7 was averaged during the time window of 750\u2009msec to 1000\u2009msec.\n15\n,\n24\n\nStatistical analysis\nReaction time and accuracy were analyzed separately using a mixed effect two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with age as a covariate (between-subject factor: group [TBI vs. HC]; within-subject factor: condition [retrieval vs. non-retrieval]). A paired samples\nt\ntest was used to compare conditions (retrieval vs. non-retrieval). We ran an independent samples\nt\ntest to compare groups (TBI vs. HC) for both retrieval and non-retrieval conditions. All statistical analyses of behavioral data were performed using IBM Statistics 21 (IBM Corp. Released 2012. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.).\nWe tested for group difference and interaction by performing a mixed effect two-way ANOVA in IBM SPSS Statistics 21, with age as a covariate (between-subject factor: group [TBI vs. HC]; within-subject factor: condition [retrieval; vs. non-retrieval]) on mean amplitude. The differences between retrieval and non-retrieval trials were analyzed using paired\nt\ntests in the TBI versus HC groups. The differences between groups (TBI vs. HC) were analyzed using independent sample\nt\ntests for both retrieval and non-retrieval conditions."

    "Methods": "Participants\nDuring 2013 and 2014, 16 CF players, 15 HF players, 15 CL players, and 15 CS players (mean [SD] age: 20.1 [1.3)] years, 16.5 [1.2] years, 20.1 [1.1] years, and 20.2 [1.3] years, respectively) wore head impact sensors during official practices and games of their respective sport. College participants were volunteers from Division I teams, and HF players were from a small private high school. No athlete had a history of developmental or neurological disorder, or moderate to severe traumatic brain injury.\n\nStandard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents\nThe University of Virginia Institutional Review Board for Health Science Research approved the research protocol. All participants gave written informed consent; if a participant was <18 years old at the time of enrollment, a parent or legal guardian also gave written informed consent.\n\nBiomechanical measurements\nStudy participants wore the xPatch impact sensing skin patch (X2 Biosystems, Seattle, WA) on the skin covering their mastoid process (left or right side was decided by the athlete) (\nFig. 1A\n). Impact to the body or head can result in head acceleration; however, for simplicity we will henceforth refer to impacts that result in acceleration of the head as \u201chead impacts.\u201d The sensor was to be worn during all official team practices and games (soccer players only wore sensors for home games), although the athletes maintained the right to refuse at each event. The xPatch contains a triaxial high impact linear accelerometer and a triaxial gyroscope to capture six degrees of freedom for linear and rotational accelerations (1\u2009kHz sampling rate). If an accelerometer exceeded a predetermined 10\ng\nlinear acceleration threshold, 100\u2009ms of data (10\u2009ms pre-trigger and 90\u2009ms post-trigger) from each accelerometer and gyroscope were recorded to onboard memory. Raw accelerometer data were then transformed to calculate peak resultant linear acceleration (PRLA) and peak resultant rotational acceleration (PRRA) at the head center of gravity by X2 Biosystems' Injury Monitoring System using a rigid body transformation for PRLA and a five point stencil for PRRA. False impacts were removed by X2 Biosystems' proprietary algorithm, which compares the waveform of each impact to a reference waveform using cross-correlation. Impacts with peak resultant linear acceleration <10\ng\nwere removed. Impact data were then time filtered to include only impacts that occurred during a practice or game. Impact burden measures, PRLA sum, and PRRA sum were calculated per athletic exposure (a single practice or game event) by multiplying each impact by its linear or rotational severity and then summing them over each athletic event (e.g., impacts of 10\ng\n, 10\ng\n, 20\ng\n, and 30\ng\nresult in a PRLA sum of 70\ng\n), as in the study by Broglio and coworkers.\n61\nStudies investigating the biomechanical validity of the xPatch have found appreciable error in the measurement of PRLA and PRRA in individual impacts,\n60\n,\n62\nwhich is discussed further in the\nLimitations\nsection. However, comparing relative values between two conditions with large numbers of impacts per condition has been demonstrated to provide reliable composite results.\n60\nIndividual impact severity values reported by any head impact sensor should be considered approximate.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nPicture of an athlete wearing the xPatch\n(A)\n.

Geometric mean peak resultant linear acceleration (PRLA) (\ng\n)\n(C)\nand peak resultant rotational acceleration (PRRA) (rad/sec\n2\n/1000)\n(D)\nper individual impact. Black circles identify the mean impact rate or geometric mean peak resultant acceleration per impact, and vertical lines identify the 95% CI. Brackets with an asterisk indicate that the indicated sports differed at the\np\n\u2264\u20090.05 Bonferroni-corrected level of statistical significance for that measure.\n\nGame data\nAll players participated in practices but not all players participated in every game. To account for this issue, athletes needed to meet a minimum playing time threshold for a game to include that player's data in the game analysis. Because of differences in substitution patterns and the structure of the playing time for each sport, the thresholds are necessarily different. To be counted as a game player, a CF athlete needed to participate in at least one play, a college lacrosse (CL) player needed to play >33% of the game, and a soccer player needed to play >45\u2009min in the game for the event to be included in the analysis. Detailed records of playing time were not available for HF players, but on the small team under study, most players played at least some part of the game; therefore, all recorded HF games were analyzed. Additional supplementary analyses were performed that included all recorded game events, without any minimum playing time threshold for inclusion, to investigate whether the inclusion criteria substantially biased the results.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData summarization\nCategorical scaled data were summarized by frequencies and percentages, whereas continuous scale data were summarized either by the mean and standard deviation, or by the geometric mean, the median, and range of the empirical distribution.\nImpacts per practice event\nA negative binomial generalized estimate equation (GEE) model was utilized to compare the number of impacts per practice that the players experienced among CF, HF, CL, and CS. With regard to model specification, the GEE model only included a single indicator variable, which distinguished players from different teams. Because each player participated in several practices, each player's impact data were considered a cluster of potentially non-independent observations in the GEE analysis. The sandwich variance-covariance estimator of Huber and White\n63\n,\n64\nwas utilized to estimate the GEE model variance-covariance matrix. With respect to hypothesis testing, the GEE version of the Wald test was used to test the null hypothesis that the mean number of impacts per practice was the same for all teams, and a two sided\np\n\u2264\u20090.05 decision rule was used as the null hypothesis test rejection criterion.\nAnalysis of PRLA per impact\nAverage PRLA per impact per practice event was analyzed on the natural logarithmic scale via a Gaussian GEE model. The natural logarithmic transformation was applied in order to rescale the data to a scale in which the measurement distributions were more symmetric in shape (i.e., bell shaped). With regard to model specification, the GEE model included one indicator variable that distinguished players from different teams. Because each player participated in several practices, each player's PRLA data were considered a cluster of potentially non-independent observations in the GEE analysis. The sandwich variance-covariance estimator of Huber and White\n63\n,\n64\nwas utilized to estimate the GEE model variance-covariance matrix. With respect to team differences in geometric mean PRLA per impact per practice, we tested the null hypothesis that the geometric mean was the same for players from different teams. A two sided\np\n\u2264\u20090.05 rejection rule was used as the null hypothesis criterion.\nAnalysis of PRRA per impact\nAverage PRRA per impact per practice event was analyzed on the natural logarithmic scale in exactly the same way as the PRLA per impact data.\nAnalysis of PRLA threshold\nA negative binomial GEE model was utilized to analyze the number of impacts per practice in which a player experienced an impact with PRLA >10\ng\n, 20\ng\n, 30\ng\n, 40\ng\n, 50\ng\n, 60\ng\n, 70\ng\n, 80\ng\n, 90\ng\n, and 100\ng\n. With regard to the GEE model specification, two indicator variables were utilized, one to distinguish among players from different teams, and one to distinguish between the 10 different PRLA thresholds. A set of indicator variables for team by PRLA threshold interaction was also a component of the model specification. To account for\nintra-player\nmeasurement correlation, the GEE model variance covariance matrix was specified in the unstructured form; that is, a variance-covariance matrix form that placed no restriction of the variance-covariance structure. With regard to hypothesis testing, the GEE version of the Wald test was utilized to test the global hypothesis that for practice events, the number of impacts per PRLA threshold was uniformly (i.e., across all PRLA thresholds) the same for the players from different teams. Wald tests were additionally used to examine on a per-PRLA threshold basis, team differences in the mean number of impacts per practice event in which the PRLA was greater than the defined threshold. A Bonferroni correction was applied to all pairwise tests as a means to restrict the simultaneous type I error rate to be \u22640.05.\nAnalysis of PRRA threshold\nA negative binomial GEE model was utilized to analyze the number of impacts per practice event in which the athletes experienced a peak resultant rotational acceleration >0\u2009rad/sec\n2\n, 2000\u2009rad/sec\n2\n, 4000\u2009rad/sec\n2\n, 6000\u2009rad/sec\n2\n, 8000\u2009rad/sec\n2\n, 10,000\u2009rad/sec\n2\n, 12,000\u2009rad/sec\n2\n, and 14,000\u2009rad/sec\n2\n. The GEE analysis was conducted in exactly the same way as the PRLA threshold analysis.\nAnalysis of the cumulative impact burden per practice event\nImpact burden measures, PRLA sum and PRRA sum, were calculated per athletic exposure (a single practice or game event) by summing each impact linearly weighted by its severity as a measure of \u201ccumulative impact burden.\u201d\n61\nThere is currently no widely accepted metric specifically for the quantification of cumulative impact burden. Many studies that try to quantify impact burden use the summation of a metric that was developed for individual impacts.\n19\n,\n44\n,\n51\n,\n60\n,\n61\n,\n65\n,\n66\nstudy chooses to use PRLA sum and PRRA sum, for their ease of calculation, and to match similar studies with the same accelerometer.\n60\n,\n67\nThe GEE version of the Cox proportionate hazard model was used to compare the empirical cumulative distribution for PRLA sum per practice between players from different teams as well as to compare the empirical cumulative distribution of PRRA between players from different teams. This approach was utilized so that the\nintra-player\nmeasurement correlation would be accounted for in the null hypothesis test that the underlying PRLA sum per practice cumulative distribution is the same for players from different teams.\nAnalyses of team differences in game events\nTeam differences in the number of impacts experienced by the players during games, and team differences in the impact forces experienced by the players during games were analyzed in the same way as the practice impact frequency data and practice impact force practice data. The only major differences were that this set of analyses focused on game events as opposed to practice events, and that this set of analyses focused only on the athletes who had game data that met the aforementioned inclusion criteria. To account for differences that were possibly caused by different game inclusion criteria for the teams, additional analyses were performed with the same inclusion criteria used for all teams: the athlete wore the sensor during the game event. Hereafter, this analysis will be referred to as: \u201call games included\u201d analysis.\nTable S1\ncontains a detailed account the \u201call games included\u201d athletic exposures (see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n).\nSoftware package\nSAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used to conduct the statistical analyses. Graphic displays were created with the statistical software of Spotfire S plus (TIBCO Inc., Palo Alto, CA)."

    "Methods": "Participants\nFour individuals with chronic paraplegia, who met the following inclusion criteria, were recruited as participants of this study: 1) in stable medical condition without cardiopulmonary disease or dysautonomia that would contraindicate standing or stepping with body weight support training; 2) no painful musculoskeletal dysfunction, unhealed fracture, contracture, pressure sore, or urinary tract infection that might interfere with stand or step training; 3) no clinically significant depression or ongoing drug abuse; 4) no current antispasticity medication regimen; 5) nonprogressive spinal cord injury above T10; 6) AIS A or B; 7) no motor response present in leg muscles during transmagnetic stimulation; 8) sensory evoked potentials not present or present with bilateral delay; 9) no volitional control during voluntary movement attempts in leg muscles as measured by EMG activity; 10) segmental reflexes remainng functional below the lesion; 11) brain influence on spinal reflexes is not observed as measured by EMG activity; 12) not having received Botox injections in the previous 6 months; 13) unable to stand or step independently; 14) at least 1 year post-injury; and 15) \u226518 years of age. The research participants signed an informed consent for electrode implantation, stimulation, activity-based training, and physiological monitoring studies approved by the University of Louisville and the University of California, Los Angeles Institutional Review Boards.\nPrior to implantation, two clinicians independently performed a physical examination following the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury\n29\n,\n30\nin order to classify the injury using the AIS. Individuals A45 and A53 showed no sensory or motor function below the neurological level of the lesion, and were classified as AIS A. Individuals B07 and B13 showed impaired sensory and no motor function below the lesion, and were classified as AIS B (\nTable 1\n). In addition, as previously reported,\n10\nthese four individuals underwent different neurophysiological evaluations (upper and lower extremity somatosensory evoked potentials, transcranial magnetic stimulation [individuals B07, A45, and A53], and assessments of residual motor output). In summary, these evaluations, performed without epidural stimulation, showed that no functional motor connectivity between the supraspinal and spinal centers below the level of injury was detected in any of the four research participants. Moreover, prior to implantation, research participants underwent 80 sessions of locomotor training, which included stand and step training (with stepping comprising the majority of time\n31\n), with the intent to achieve the positive adaptations induced by activity-based rehabilitation alone before the beginning of training with epidural stimulation.\nTable\n1.\nClinical Characteristics of Individuals\nAIS score\nSensory (T10-S5, score out of 24)\nMotor (lower extremity)\nParticipant\nAge yr\nGender\nPost- injury yr\nNeuro level\nAIS grade\nL LT\nL PP\nR LT\nR PP\nL\nR\nAnal sensation\nB07\n24\nMale\n3.4\nT2\nB\n15\n11\n18\n10\n0\n0\nyes\nA45\n24\nMale\n2.2\nT4\nA\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nno\nB13\n33\nMale\n4.2\nC7\nB\n10\n10\n10\n8\n0\n0\nyes\nA53\n27\nMale\n2.3\nT4\nA\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nno\nOpen in a separate window\nSensory score was designated by light-touch (LT) and pinprick (PP) of the left (L) and right (R) lower limb, below the lesion.\nNeuro level, neurological level of the lesion; AIS, American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale.\n\nSurgical implantation of electrode array and stimulator\nThe epidural spinal cord stimulation unit (Restore ADVANCED, Medtronics) was used to electrically stimulate the lumbosacral enlargement. As previously described,\n9\na 16 electrode array (5-6-5 Specify, Medtronic) was implanted at the T11-L1 vertebral level over spinal cord segments L1-S1 in all individuals. The electrode lead was tunneled to a subcutaneous abdominal pouch where the pulse generator was implanted.\n\nExperimental procedures\nThe data reported in the present study were collected during three or four experimental sessions performed by each participant after implantation of the stimulation unit, and before any activity-based intervention (pre-training), after 81\u2009\u00b1\u20091 sessions of stand training (post-stand), and after subsequent 81\u2009\u00b1\u20092 sessions of step training (post-step) with epidural stimulation (\nFig. 1A and B\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExperimental protocol timeline.\n(A)\nWeeks devoted to complete training and experimental sessions (related and unrelated to the present study) performed before any training (pre-training), after stand training (post-stand), and after step training (post-step). Total number of stand and step training sessions performed by each participant is also reported.\n(B)\nAssessments performed during different experimental sessions at pre-training, post-stand, and post-step.\nA 10\u2009min full weight-bearing standing experimental session was devoted to the assessment of: 1) the ability to stand with the least amount of external assistance for hip and knee extension and 2) the motor pattern generated during such attempt. Standing was performed overground using a custom designed standing frame composed of horizontal bars anterior and lateral to the individual (see\nSupplementary Video 1\n) (see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n).\nThese bars were used for upper extremity support and balance assistance as needed. Stimulation began while the participant was seated. Then, the participant initiated the sit to stand transition by positioning his feet shoulder width apart and shifting his weight forward to begin loading the legs. The participant used the horizontal bars of the standing apparatus during the transition phase to balance and to partially pull himself into a standing position. Trainers positioned at the pelvis and knees manually assisted as needed during the sit to stand transition. When a steady standing position was achieved, the 10\u2009min session began; if the knees or hips flexed beyond the normal standing posture, external assistance at the knees distal to the patella was provided to promote knee extension, and at the hips below the iliac crest to promote hip extension and anterior tilt. Facilitation was provided either manually by a trainer or by elastic cords, which were attached between the two vertical bars of the standing apparatus.\nTo investigate whether stand and step training induced any neural adaptation sufficient to influence motor function for standing without epidural stimulation, EMG activity of different lower limb muscles was recorded during standing without stimulation and was also compared with that recorded during sitting without stimulation. The neural plasticity induced by stand and step training was also examined by comparing the evoked potentials to epidural spinal stimulation recorded during standing and sitting while using the same stimulation parameters. In particular, a wide-field electrode configuration with cathodes positioned caudally was selected to deliver at a frequency of 2\u2009Hz the lowest stimulation intensity that activated all the investigated muscles in sitting position during the pre-training assessment. This electrode configuration was selected because it evoked nonlocation-specific responses in both proximal and distal muscles,\n32\nand because cathodes positioned caudally were shown to possibly promote motor patterns characteristic of standing behavior in subjects with clinically motor complete SCI while lying supine and standing.\n28\n,\n33\nIn these two sets of experiment (standing without epidural stimulation and with 2\u2009Hz stimulation), a body weight support system (Innoventor, St. Louis, MO) with a harness was used to provide body weight support (40% of body weight load) during standing in participants A45 and B13, whereas individuals A53 and B07 performed overground standing using the custom designed standing frame. External assistance for hip and knee extension was provided during both standing overground and with body weight support if the knees or hips flexed beyond the normal standing posture.\nFinally, in order to investigate whether stand and step training with epidural stimulation induced any neural adaptation in the spinal circuitry that could be detected when no motor tasks were performed, muscle activation threshold and amplitude of evoked potentials were examined in several lower limb muscles with the individuals relaxed in a supine position. Epidural stimulation was delivered at 2\u2009Hz with the wide-field electrode configuration with cathodes positioned caudally; stimulation intensity was increased by 0.1\u2009V until all investigated muscles were active, and then by 0.5\u2009V. Stimulation intensities ranging from 0.1\u2009V to 5\u2009V, which were tolerated from all participants at all three time points, were considered for further analysis.\n\nStimulation parameters applied for the assessment of standing ability\nStimulation parameters applied during the 10\u2009min standing session performed prior to the beginning of stand training were selected during an experimental session following the guidelines reported by Rejc and coworkers.\n28\nBriefly, the initial stimulation parameters were selected during sitting, and consisted of a wide-field electrode configuration with cathodes positioned caudally, and a stimulation frequency of 25\u2009Hz at near-motor threshold stimulation intensity that did not directly elicit lower limb movements. If the initial stimulation parameters did not promote EMG patterns sufficient to enable the subject to stand bearing full body weight without external assistance for hip and knee extension, electrode configuration adjustments were defined to seek improvements of different aspects of motor output. For example, the electrode field was more focused on the caudal portion of the electrode array to increase the excitability of distal muscles' motoneuron pools, or was extended toward the rostral portion of the array to increase the excitability of proximal muscles' motoneuron pools.\n32\nAlso, active electrodes were unbalanced between the lateral columns of the electrode array with the intent of compensating activation differences between left and right lower limbs, as the lateral placement of the epidural stimulation electrodes with respect to the spinal cord midline was shown to promote motor responses in muscles ipsilateral to the stimulation in rats.\n26\nIn addition, we considered the data recorded from previous experiments performed on the same research participants in the supine position with different bipolar and wide-field electrode configurations (as partially reported by Sayenko and colleagues\n32\n), which provided individualized maps of motor pools activation, to adjust cathode position to target primarily extensors muscle groups. Also, stimulation frequency and amplitude were modulated synergistically to find the higher stimulation frequency that elicited a continuous (non-rhythmic) EMG pattern effective to bare body weight.\nStimulation parameters for standing were also adjusted throughout stand training following the abovementioned guidelines to improve standing. In particular, experimental sessions were performed to monitor standing behavior and EMG from lower limb muscles while using different stimulation parameters to contribute to their selection. Hence, after stand training, the 10\u2009min standing session was performed with the improved stimulation parameters, to achieve standing with the least amount of external assistance. In addition, at the same time point, the 10\u2009min standing session was also performed with the initial stimulation parameters, in some cases at adjusted stimulation intensity. Finally, standing ability after step training was assessed with the optimized stimulation parameters for standing used at the end of stand training.\n\nStand training\nAfter the stimulator implantation and the completion of a series of pre-training experiments, research participants underwent on average 81 sessions (range: 80\u201382 sessions) of full weight-bearing stand training (1\u2009h, five sessions per week). Stand training was always performed with lumbosacral spinal cord epidural stimulation, using the custom designed standing frame described previously. Participants were encouraged to stand for as long as possible throughout the training session, with the goal of standing for 60\u2009min with the least amount of assistance. Seated resting periods occurred when requested by the individuals. If, during standing, the participant's knees or hips flexed beyond the normal standing posture, external assistance to facilitate hip and knee extension was provided either manually by a trainer or by elastic cords, which were attached between the two vertical bars of the standing frame. A research staff member activated a chronometer at the beginning of stand training, and noted the time associated with every onset and offset of the assistance for knee extension.\n\nStep training\nFollowing the completion of stand training and respective experimental sessions, the research participants performed on average 81 sessions (range: 80 to 84 sessions) of step training with body weight support (Innoventor, St. Louis, MO) on a treadmill (1\u2009h, five sessions per week). Step training was always performed with lumbosacral spinal cord epidural stimulation. Research participants stepped at body weight load and speed adapted to achieve appropriate stepping kinematics.\n31\nStepping bout duration was dependent on the participant's endurance and stepping behavior. Following a stepping bout, participants were encourage to remain standing; body weight support and length of standing break varied. All trainers were careful to provide manual assistance only when needed following standard locomotor training principles.\n34\n\nData acquisition\nEMG and ground reaction forces data were recorded at 2000\u2009Hz using a custom-written acquisition software (National Instruments, Austin, TX). EMG activity of right (R) and left (L) gluteus maximus (GL), medial hamstring (MH), rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL), tibialis anterior (TA), medial gastrocnemius (MG) and soleus (SOL) was recorded by means of bipolar surface electrodes with a fixed inter-electrode distance.\n9\nBilateral EMG from the iliopsoas (IL) was recorded with fine-wire electrodes. Two surface electrodes were placed symmetrically lateral to the electrode array incision site over the paraspinal muscles in order to record the stimulation artefacts, which were used as indicators of the stimulation onset (time points when the stimulus pulses were applied). Ground reaction forces were collected using a high-resolution pressure sensing mat (HR mat system, TEKSCAN, Boston, MA).\n\nData analysis\nThe variability of ground reaction forces and EMG activity was assessed by calculating their coefficient of variation (CV) (standard deviation[SD]/mean) over one representative minute of standing. In particular, the CV for EMG activity was calculated from the linear envelope EMG, which was obtained by filtering through a low-pass digital filter at a cutoff frequency of 4\u2009Hz the rectified EMG signal.\nThe amplitude of EMG activity recorded without epidural stimulation was quantified by root mean square (RMS) and calculated over 10 representative seconds of steady sitting and standing. The amplitude of evoked potentials to epidural stimulation delivered at 2\u2009Hz was quantified by peak to peak amplitude. To investigate the evoked potentials amplitude when subjects were in the supine position, five stimuli were delivered at each stimulation intensity applied, which ranged between 0.1 and 5\u2009V; the average peak to peak amplitude for each stimulation intensity was calculated, and the largest value recorded from each investigated muscle was considered for the comparison across interventions. The average stimulation intensity that induced the largest EMG peak to peak amplitude values corresponded to 3.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2\u2009V. The fact that the largest peak\u2013peak amplitudes were predominantly recorded at submaximal stimulation intensities supports the view that any eventual variability associated with the the relationship of the epidural electrode array with the spinal cord, for example caused by different pressure on the array toward the cord while the subject was lying supine or by the hydration status of the participant,\n35\nplayed a negligible role in determining the largest peak to peak amplitude values considered for further analysis.\nMuscle activation threshold coincided with the lowest stimulation intensity that induced reproducible evoked potentials with amplitude higher than the mean baseline EMG plus three times its SD.\n32\nTo examine the adaptations brought about by stand and step training, muscle activation thresholds were expressed as percentage of the lowest threshold value at pre-training. If more than one muscle showed the same lowest activation threshold at pre-training, the muscle with the lowest threshold detected at post-stand, and eventually at post-step, was selected. This relative comparison of activation threshold among muscles provides information on muscle recruitment order and also overcomes any eventual variability associated with the the relationship of the epidural electrode array with the spinal cord. In addition, we compared over time the average absolute difference of activation threshold among the investigated muscles, which was calculated as follows:\nwhere\nMr\nindicates the muscle with the lowest activation threshold at pre-stand used as the reference (100%), and\nM2\nto\nMn\nindicate all the other analyzed muscles. This parameter was calculated taking into account\nn\n=\u200914 muscles for participants A45, A53, and B13; and\nn\n=\u200912 muscles for participant B07.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are reported as means \u00b1 SD. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (version 5.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). A\np\nvalue <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The distribution of quantitative variables was tested for normality using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. Because the assumption of normality distribution for the investigated variables was not met, the effect of stand and step training on: 1) the ratio between peak\u2013peak EMG amplitude of evoked potentials recorded during standing and sitting, 2) the activation thresholds difference, and 3) the peak\u2013peak EMG amplitude of evoked potentials recorded with the subject in the supine position were evaluated for each participant by the nonparametric Friedman test, and following multiple comparisons by Dunn's post-hoc test."

    "Methods": "Animals\nYoung adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (\nn\n=\u200920, Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) weighing 300 to 350\u2009g were used for all studies. Animals were allowed food and water\nad libitum\nand were housed in the Division of Laboratory Animal Resources of the University of Kentucky Medical Center. All animal and husbandry were conducted in accordance with the University of Kentucky Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were randomly assigned to experimental groups: sham (\nn\n=\u20096), CCI + vehicle (\nn\n=\u20096), CCI + CsA (\nn\n=\u20098).\n\nCCI TBI\nAnimals were initially anesthetized with 4% isoflurane and placed in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf, Tujunga, CA), where they were maintained at 3% isoflurane for the duration of the procedure. A midline incision was made to expose the skull, and a 6\u2009mm craniotomy was made lateral to the sagittal suture midway between lambda and bregma. The exposed brain with intact dura was injured using a computer controlled pneumatic impactor (TBI 03010; Precision Systems and Instrumentation, Fairfax Station, VA) fitted with a 5\u2009mm beveled tip set to impact at \u223c3.5\u2009m/sec, 2.2\u2009mm depth, and 500\u2009msec dwell time, as described previously.\n19\nAfter injury, Surgicel was placed onto the dura, and an 8\u2009mm plastic disk was affixed with tissue adhesive to close the craniotomy site. Body temperature was monitored and maintained at 37\u00b0C with a thermo-regulating heating pad. Sham animals underwent all procedures but did not receive an impact injury.\n\nCsA administration\nThe CsA concentration chosen was based on previously optimized concentrations for CCI.\n33\n,\n72\nThe CCI + CsA group was administered CsA obtained from the University of Kentucky Medical Center Hospital Pharmacy (Perrigo; Minneapolis, MN; 50\u2009mg/mL) 15\u2009min after injury as a single intraperitoneal dose of 20\u2009mg/kg in saline/650\u2009mg cremophor/33.2% (v/v) ethanol diluted in saline to a final concentration of 10\u2009mg/mL. The injection volume was 0.2\u2009mL/100\u2009g of body weight. CCI + vehicle-treated animals received an equivalent volume of saline/cremophor/ethanol 15\u2009min after injury.\n\nTissue extraction\nAnimals were euthanized at 24\u2009h using CO\n2\nanesthetization followed by decapitation, and an 8\u2009mm cortical punch centered over the injury site was collected for analysis of mitochondrial respiration.\n\nMitochondrial isolation\nMitochondria were isolated as described previously\n7\n,\n19\nwith modifications to isolate synaptic and non-synaptic populations.\n10\n,\n70\nCortical tissue was homogenized in ice-cold isolation buffer (215\u2009mmol/L mannitol, 75\u2009mmol/L sucrose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20\u2009mmol/L HEPES, 1\u2009mmol/L EGTA, pH 7.2) using Potter-Elvejhem homogenizers. Samples were then centrifuged twice at 1400\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 3\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. Supernatants were collected and spun at 13,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C.\nThe crude mitochondrial pellet was resuspended and layered onto a discontinuous 7.5% and 10% Ficoll gradient and centrifuged at 100,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 30\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. The non-synaptic mitochondria pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer without EGTA and centrifuged at 10,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C to remove Ficoll and then resuspended to a final concentration of approximately 10\u2009mg/mL in isolation buffer without EGTA.\nThe synaptosomal layer was removed from the 7.5\u201310% Ficoll interface, resuspended in isolation buffer and spun at 13,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C to remove Ficoll. The synaptosome pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer, placed into a nitrogen bomb at 1200\u2009psi for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C to release synaptic mitochondria,\n73\n,\n74\nlayered onto a second discontinuous 7.5% and 10% Ficoll gradient, and centrifuged at 100,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 30\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. The synaptic mitochondria pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer without EGTA and centrifuged at 10,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C to remove Ficoll and resuspended in isolation buffer without EGTA. Protein concentrations were determined with a BCA protein assay kit and measured at absorbance 562\u2009nm with a BioTek Synergy HT plate reader (Winooski, VT). Mitochondria were immediately used for respiratory analysis.\n\nMeasurement of mitochondrial respiratory function\nMitochondria respiratory rates were measured using a Clark-type electrode in a continuously stirred, sealed, thermostatically controlled chamber (Oxytherm System, Hansatech Instruments, Norfolk, UK) that was maintained at 37\u00b0C. Mitochondria (>30\u2009\u03bcg) were placed into a chamber containing 250\u2009\u03bcL of KCl respiration buffer (125\u2009mmol/L, 2\u2009mmol/L MgCl\n2\n, 2.5\u2009mmol/L KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20\u2009mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.2). Mitochondria equilibrated for 1\u2009min before complex-I initiation.\nComplex-I respiration was initiated with 5\u2009mmol/L pyruvate and 2.5\u2009mmol/L malate, and state II respiration was monitored. Two boluses of 150\u2009\u03bcmol/L adenosine diphosphate (ADP) were added to initiate state III respiration. State IV respiration was monitored after 2\u2009\u03bcmol/L addition of the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin. Maximal state V(I) respiration was initiated by addition of 2\u2009\u03bcmol/L of the protonophore FCCP. Complex I was inhibited by addition of 100\u2009nmol/L rotenone. Complex II driven respiration was initiated by addition of 10\u2009mmol/L succinate, and state V(II) was monitored. Respiratory control ratio (RCR) was calculated by dividing the state III respiration rate (second bolus ADP rate) by the state IV respiration rate.\n7\n,\n50\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was conducted using Prism version 6.0 (Graph Pad, San Diego, CA). Results are reported as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Initial statistical analysis was performed using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by a Tukey\npost hoc\nanalysis when appropriate."

    "Methods": "Population\nThis study was reviewed and approved by the appropriate human patient protection authorities at the National Institutes of Health, Uniform Services University of the Health Sciences, Johns Hopkins Suburban Hospital, and MedStar Washington Hospital Center. All patients or surrogates provided informed consent before any study procedure. Patients were enrolled in the Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine (CNRM) Traumatic Head Injury Neuroimaging Classification protocol (NCT01132937) if they sustained a head injury and presented within 48\u2009h of the event to the emergency department of MedStar Washington Hospital Center (WHC; Washington, DC) or Johns Hopkins Suburban Hospital (SH; Bethesda, MD), level 1 and level 2 trauma centers, respectively. A computed tomography (CT) scan was obtained as clinically indicated. After consent, patients were imaged with MRI and blood was collected. Clinical history, presentation, symptoms, and disposition were captured prospectively on standardized case-report forms.\nFor this analysis, patients were selected who 1) were below the age of 70 (group matched), 2) received contrast agent, 3) aside from TMI, were absent of trauma-related findings on both clinical CT and research MRI, and 4) had blood collection performed at time of MRI. mild TBI is defined by the published guidelines of the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine, which include:\n\u2022\u2002Loss of consciousness of approximately 30\u2009min or less\n\u2022\u2002An initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 13\u201315\n\u2022\u2002Post-traumatic amnesia not greater than 24\u2009h\nBased on these guidelines, all of the patients included in this study qualify as having sustained an mTBI.\nImages were reviewed prospectively for trauma-related findings; TMI was determined as abnormal enhancement of the meninges with a positive post-contrast fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and no other imaging findings, and the TMI\n\u2013\ngroup consisted of a negative MRI and a negative CT.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging\nResearch MRI was obtained as soon as possible after presentation and as performed on a 1.5 Tesla (T; GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) and a 3T (Philips, Cleveland, OH) at SH and WHC, respectively. The imaging protocol was standardized and took approximately 25\u2009min to execute. It consisted of a diffusion tensor imaging sequence with derived isotropic diffusion weighted imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient map, two T2*-weighted sequences, FLAIR, three-dimensional/T1 weighted with 1-mm isotropic voxels, dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion imaging, post-contrast T1, and post-contrast FLAIR (FLAIR-post). Sequence parameters were adjusted as best possible to produce similar appearing contrasts across field strength.\nPatients were administered a single dose of a gadolinium-based contrast agent; 0.1\u2009mmol/kg of gadopentetate dimeglumine (Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Whippany, NJ) or gadobenate dimeglumine (Braco Diagnostics, Monroe Township, NJ), depending on site policy. Contrast was administered using a power injector at 5\u2009mL/sec through a 22-18-gauge needle placed in the antecubital vein. The post-contrast FLAIR was obtained approximately 5\u2009min after contrast agent administration and took approximately 2\u2009min to acquire.\n\nSample collection\nSample was collected as close to the time of research MRI as possible. Approximately 2.5\u2009mL of blood were collected into an RNA PAXgene tube. After collection, the PAXgene tubes were inverted eight times and then placed at room temperature for approximately 1\u2009h, and then at \u221220\n0\nC for 2\u2009h before placement into an \u221280\n0\nC freezer until assayed.\n\nMessenger RNA acquisition, quantitation, and hybridization\nPAXgene blood RNA tubes were processed with PAXgene\u2122 Blood RNA Kits (PreAnalytiX; Qiagen, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland) for RNA extraction. The NanoDrop DN-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE) and the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 eukaryotic total RNA Nano assay (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) were used to evaluate the quality and quantity of extracted RNA. The 260/280 ratio ranged from 2.03 to 2.34, and the RNA integrity numbers (RINs) were greater than 7.0 in all samples. According to standards,\n7\nan RIN of 6.0 or greater is indicative of admissible quality, and no samples were excluded based on this criterion. Using the GeneChip (GC) 3' IVT Express kit, each RNA (100\u2009ng) sample was reverse transcribed, converted to biotinylated complementary RNA, and hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), which contain 54,675 probe sets representing more than 38,500 coding genes. All assays were undertaken based on standard Affymetrix protocols.\n\nClinical measures\nThe GCS was obtained during the clinical assessment, and the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI) was administered to all patients by trained research staff. The GCS is a 15-point clinical evaluation performed by a clinician and is the most commonly used TBI assessment used in emergency room settings.\n8\nThis measure consists of three subcomponents, which include ocular, verbal, and motor function. The GCS helps assess for loss of consciousness and other behavioral differences post-injury and has been measured for validity and reliability in previous research.\n9\n,\n10\nThe NSI is a 22-item self-report questionnaire to assess for post-concussive symptoms. This measure has both a high internal consistency (total alpha\u2009=\u20090.95; subscale alpha\u2009=\u20090.88\u20130.92) and reliability (\nr\n=\u20090.88\u20130.93).\n11\nEach question asks for the participant to rate the severity of each symptom, such as nausea, headache, and balance, based on a 5-point scale (none, mild, moderate, severe, and very severe). Severity of symptoms for the patient is assessed by adding up all the responses, providing a range of 0\u201388 to determine their NSI score.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll analytical procedures performed on microarray data were conducted with Partek Genomics Suite software (version 6.6; Partek Inc., St. Louis, MO). Interrogating probes were imported, and corrections for background signal were applied using the robust multi-array average method, with additional corrections applied for the GC content of probes. Probe sets were standardized using quantile normalization, and expression levels of each probe underwent log-2 transformation to yield distributions of data that more closely approximated normality.\nParameters for identifying differentially expressed genes between groups were then identified using analysis of variance of each probe set's expression level as a function of grouping variable: TMI\n+\ncompared to TMI\n\u2013\nwhile adjusting for batch effect. A repeated-measures comparison was made in each group. Parameters for significant differential gene expression between the two groups consisted of a\np\nvalue corrected for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate <0.05 and a fold change (increase or decrease) of 1.5.\nTwo-tailed chi-square tests and independent\nt\n-tests were used to test group differences that might affect the main analysis using SPSS software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). The analysis investigated the relationship between TMI\n+\nand TMI\n\u2013\npatients' gene expression. Independent\nt\n-tests were used to examine between-group differences on outcome variables. Mann-Whitney's U test was used to calculate statistical significance between groups for nonparametric measures, as indicated in\nTable 1\n. The confidence level was set at\np\n=\u20090.05 for all analyses.

IPA runs the complete list of differentially expressed genes between the TMI\n+\nand TMI\n\u2013\ngroups and identifies focus genes that are known to interact with other genes based on ingenuity data. A Fisher's exact test identifies highly inter-related genes within the pathway. To quantify the significance, the amount of connections used by a focus gene within a pathway is compared to other significant genes within the database. Each network is assigned a score based on the probability of the gene interaction occurring within the pathway. This score is calculated using the following equation:\nIn this equation,\nN\nis the number of genes in the network,\nC\n(\nn,k\n) is the binomial coefficient, and\nG\nare the focus genes in\ns\n, which represents the pathway with\nf\nfocus genes.\n12\nLast, hierarchical clustering was used to investigate whether expression levels of significant genes could be used to correctly predict whether the patients had sustained a TMI. To calculate this, the top 15 genes were clustered using Partek Genomics Suite. With no classification provided (TMI\n+\nvs. TMI\n\u2013\n), patients were clustered based on gene expression. A chi-squared test was used to measure how well the resulting patient clusters fit the original TBI classifications."

    "Methods": "This prospective controlled cohort study was performed as part of the Play Game Trial, which is a randomized controlled trial of melatonin for the treatment of PCS following mTBI (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01874847).20This is a randomized controlled treatment trial of post-concussion symptoms in children using melatonin for 4 weeks and involved comprehensive assessments before and after treatment including imaging and cognitive assessments. Here, we report pre-treatment assessments. Ethical clearance was granted by the University of Calgary Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board (REB13-0372).\n\nParticipants\nPotential participants were identified from children with an mTBI presenting to the emergency room (ER) or the concussion clinic at the Alberta Children's Hospital (ACH) within 2 weeks of injury. mTBI was defined as an impact to the head or body resulting in at least one of the following: an observed loss of consciousness (<30\u2009min), a Glasgow Coma Score of 13\u201315, or at least one acute symptom suggesting neurological dysfunction attributable to the injury (e.g., headache, confusion, vomiting, amnesia, balance problems).\n3\n,\n21\n,\n22\nConcussion is considered to be part of the spectrum of mTBI.\n23\nConsent to contact was obtained in 231 potential participants at 3 to 4 weeks post-injury (see\nFig. 1\n). Clinical and neuroimaging assessments were performed at approximately 40 days post-injury.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nConsort diagram depicting enrollment through to analysis: Children with mTBI were identified in the ED (\nn\n=\u2009244) and enrolled at 3 to 4 weeks post-injury (\nn\n=\u200984). ED, emergency department; mTBI, mild traumatic brain injury.\nInclusion criteria\nIncluded children (8 to 18 years) with mTBI who consented to telephone follow-up at 4 weeks post-injury.\nExclusion criteria\nIncluded suspected child abuse, alcohol or drug use at the time of injury, significant past medical/psychiatric history, English as a second language, a previous TBI within the last 3 months, failure to recover from a previous mTBI, contraindications/inability to have an MRI scan, and/or the use of psychoactive medications.\nChildren with a history of mild learning difficulties or attentional problems were not excluded. One-hundred sixteen children were contacted. Consent was obtained in 53 participants. Healthy controls satisfying the exclusion criteria and without a history of TBI were recruited (\nn\n=\u200921). These children were identified by mTBI participants, that is, siblings or friends. As perfusion is known to vary during childhood and adolescence, healthy controls were selected to be similar in age and sex.\n24\nPost-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI)\nThis is an age-appropriate, standardized questionnaire that was used to assess PCS symptoms. This validated questionnaire provides ratings for 26 symptoms and an overall rating of PCS symptoms following mTBI.\n4\n,\n25\u201327\nIndividual scores for each symptom (0\u20136), a total symptom score (0\u2013156), and a \u201cdegree of difference from pre-injury\u201d score (0\u20134) were obtained. The participants completed the questionnaire for their pre-injury status at enrollment, and their post-injury PCSI score was performed on the day of the MRI scan.\nRecovery status\nChildren were considered to be\nsymptomatic\nif they reported a 2-point increase in two or more symptoms compared with baseline and a score \u22651 to the PCSI question: In general, to what degree do you feel \u201cdifferently\u201d than before the injury (rated from \u201c0\u201d [no difference] to \u201c4\u201d [major difference])? or\nasymptomatic\nif there was no increase in symptoms and a score of zero to the \u201cfeeling different\u201d question.\n4\n\nOutcome measures\nCNS vital signs\nAll participants were administered the CNS Vital Signs computerized cognitive battery. This test provides a rapid assessment of cognitive abilities. It has been normed for use in children and adults between 7 and 90 years and has adequate test-retest reliability in children and adolescents (Pearson's\nr\n=\u20090.63\u20130.82), and concurrent validity with traditional neuropsychological measures.\n28\n,\n29\nIt is a valid measure of cognitive skills in children with neurological disorders,\n30\nincluding TBI.\n31\n,\n32\nThe Neurocognition Index (NCI) is a summary score that is the average of five domain scores: Composite Memory, Psychomotor Speed, Reaction Time, Complex Attention, and Cognitive Flexibility. All domain scores on the CNS Vital Signs are normalized to a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15. The NCI was used to provide an overall estimate of cognitive function. Complex attention, cognitive flexibility and executive function domains are sensitive to change in mTBI.\n28\n\nImage acquisition and pre-processing\nAll participants received 3.0T MRI scans on a GE MR750w Discovery scanner using a 32-channel head coil (MRI Instruments). The imaging protocol included a 5-min 30-sec anatomical 3D T\n1\nBRAVO with 0.8\u2009mm\n3\nisotropic resolution over the whole brain. The vendor-supplied 3D pseudo-continuous ASL sequence was performed with post-labeling delay of 2.0\u2009sec. In-plane spatial resolution was 3.2\u2009mm\n2\n. Thirty-four 3.5-mm thick slices were acquired in a total scan time of 5\u2009min. The 3D ASL scan was automatically processed into quantitative CBF maps using the scanner-integrated pipeline with default settings (partition coefficient of 0.9; blood T\n1\nof 1.6\u2009sec). Anatomical BRAVO was segmented into five tissue probability maps (gray matter, white matter, cerebral spinal fluid, skull, skin) using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) 12 (\nwww.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12\n). The raw perfusion-weighted ASL image and CBF maps were co-registered to the gray matter probability density map to account for motion between the T\n1\nand ASL scans. The CBF maps were then normalized to Montreal Neurological Institute space.\n\nStatistical analysis\nNormality tests (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) for all measures were conducted using IBM SPSS version 22.0. Skewed data (PCSI) were analyzed with non-parametric tests. Between-group effect sizes were calculated using Cohen's\nf\n2\nB\neffect sizes, and 0.02, 0.15, and 0.35 are termed\nsmall\n,\nmedium\n, and\nlarge\n, respectively.\n33\nCorrelations between CBF and age, group, family income (as a marker of socioeconomic status [SES]), and the NCI were performed. SPM 12 was used to analyze the processed CBF maps. A gray-matter mask was created using a tissue probability map where gray matter probability was >40% to constrain the statistical comparisons to gray matter only. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the symptomatic, asymptomatic, and healthy control groups. Post hoc independent samples\nt\ntests were subsequently used to detect differences between patient groups. Only regions that were\np\n<\u20090.05 and voxels clusters >100 were considered. General linear models with main effects for sex, group/mTBI, PCSI score, NCI, and global CBFwere fitted to the data and pre-injury PCSI was included as a covariate."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nTwo cohorts of subjects were enrolled in this study: a group with incomplete SCI and a group of healthy nonimpaired, age-matched, sex-matched controls. The subjects were recruited from local hospitals and rehabilitation centers. Each subject provided informed consent in accord with institutional review boards at the University of California, Irvine (Irvine, CA) and the University of Cincinnati (Cincinnati, OH).\nTable 1\ndescribes entry and exclusion criteria for individuals with SCI. Study criteria for nonimpaired individuals were age >18 years and no major neurological disease. Before magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, all subjects underwent a screening process and behavioral assessment, and then reviewed the functional MRI (fMRI) protocol.\nTable\n1.\nInclusion and Exclusion Criteria for Individuals with SCI\nInclusion criteria:\n1) Age \u226518 years\n2) Incomplete SCI (ASIA grade C or D), experienced >1 month before enrollment\n3) Motor grade 1\u20133 in the quads, hamstrings, and hip flexors and ability to ambulate with at least maximal assist\n4) Normal range of motion (within functional limits for ambulation) in the lower extremities\n5) As defined by the International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI: Motor Incomplete. Motor function is preserved below the neurological level, and more than half of key muscle functions below the single neurological level of injury have a muscle grade less than 3 (grades 0\u20132) or at least half (half or more) of key muscle functions below the neurological level of injury have a muscle grade \u22653.\n6) Able to ambulate at least 10\u2009m with one-person assistance or assistive device or both\n7) Medically stable\n8) Stable dosage of any antispasticity medications expected for duration of study\n9) English speaking\nExclusion criteria:\n1) Excessive spasticity in the lower limbs (score \u22653 on modified Ashworth spasticity scale)\n2) Excessive pain in lower limbs (score \u22658 during active exercise on Visual Analog Scale)\n3) History of moderate-to-severe osteoporosis, heterotopic ossification, or recent lower-extremity fracture\n4) Abnormalities of attention or cognitive function sufficient to interfere with study procedures\n5) Enrolled in a current rehabilitation program\n6) Contraindication to MRI\n7) Current major depression\nOpen in a separate window\nTable 1\nprovides a list of inclusion and exclusion criteria for subjects with spinal cord injury who were enrolled into this study.\nSCI, spinal cord injury; ASIA, American Spinal Injury Association; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging.\n\nScreening process\nScreening focused on entry criteria and included review of medical history, completion of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition test for depression,\n25\nreview of MRI exclusion/inclusion criteria, assessment of lower extremity range of motion, evaluation with the Visual Analog Scale for pain,\n26\nevaluation with the modified Ashworth spasticity scale, and evaluation with the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale.\n27\n\nBehavioral assessments\nSubjects with SCI underwent motor, sensory, and functional testing before the fMRI. All assessments were administered by trained investigators during a single visit (day 1) approximately 1 week before the fMRI session, were standardized across the two study sites, and included medical history, handedness, footedness,\n28\nand degree of independence using the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM).\n29\nIn addition, the following assessments were obtained.\nInternational Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury exam\nNeurological assessment was performed consistent with the recommendation of the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI),\n27\nwhich assesses bilateral upper and lower extremities. Injury characteristics were classified according to neurological level of injury, ASIA motor score, ASIA sensory score, and overall ASIA Impairment Scale grade (A\u2013D). All study team assessors were fully trained in accord with the ISNCSCI guidelines and had extensive clinical experience using the tool.\nPerformance Oriented Mobility Assessment\nThe Tinetti Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA) scoring scale is broken down into two parts: a gait portion (maximum score 12) consisting of initiation of gait, step length, step height, step symmetry, step continuity, path, trunk stability, and walking stance; and a balance portion (maximum score 16) consisting of sitting balance, rising, attempting to rise, immediate standing balance, nudging response, eyes closed balance, and turning 360 degrees while sitting down.\n30\n,\n31\nHigher POMA scores correspond to better motor function.\n\nGAITRite analysis\nSpatial and temporal parameters of gait were measured with the GAITRite mat (CIR Systems, Inc., Clifton, NJ) and used to determine self-selected gait velocity and cadence. The GAITRite mat is 460\u2009cm long with an active sensor area 366\u2009cm in length and 61\u2009cm in width and samples at 80\u2009Hz.\n32\nEach subject was instructed to walk at a self-selected gait for a total of two trials, after which data from these two trials were averaged. Individuals were allowed use durable medical equipment, if needed, to ambulate safely.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging acquisition\nMRI data were acquired using a 3.0 Tesla (T) Phillips scanner at the University of California, Irvine, and a 4.0-T Varian Unity INOVA whole-body scanner at University of Cincinnati. During scanning, each subject wore bilateral padded MRI-compatible frictionless ankle splints\n24\nthat restricted movement to 10 degrees of ankle dorsiflexion/plantarflexion, and that had a pedestal lifting foot/calf above the scanner bed, thereby preventing lateral leg rotation or postural compensation. Velcro straps were placed across the dorsal surface of each splint to hold the heel and forefoot in place. Pillows were used to keep knees flexed at 15 degrees bilaterally. An observer confirmed that each subject correctly performed the task during each fMRI session.\nAcquisition included a whole-brain, high-resolution T1-weighted volumetric scan (150 slices of 1-mm thickness with no gaps; repetition time [TR], 8.4\u2009ms; echo time [TE], 3.9\u2009ms; matrix, 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009200; and field of view [FOV], 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009204\u2009mm) as well as three functional scans collected using a T2*-weighted gradient-echo sequence for blood-oxygenation-level\u2013dependent contrast (TR\u2009= 2000\u2009ms; TE\u2009=\u200930\u2009ms; 26 slices with thickness 4\u2009mm plus 1-mm interslice gap; FOV\u2009=\u2009240\u2009\u00d7\u2009240\u2009mm; and matrix, 96\u2009\u00d7\u200995). Each of the three fMRI runs was 96\u2009sec (48 brain volumes), during which subjects viewed a video that guided ankle movements. The video cued subjects to begin movement when the guide turned green and cued subjects to rest when the guide turned red. Each run consisted of 24-sec epochs that alternated rest with 0.3-Hz right ankle dorsiflexion. During the fMRI, a study team member observed the subject to assess compliance.\n\nStatistical analysis\nBehavioral assessments were compared between the two groups using Student's\nt\n-test and Fisher's exact test. Parametric statistical methods were used for measures for which the normality assumption was valid, using raw or transformed values; otherwise, nonparametric methods were used.\nFunctional MRI data were analyzed using SPM 8 (\nwww.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/\n) at one single site. The first two volumes from each run were discarded from all scans to allow for tissue equilibration. Pre-processing steps included realignment to the first image, coregistration to the mean echo echoplanar imaging (EPI) image, normalization to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) EPI template, and spatial smoothing (full width at half maximum\u2009=\u20098\u2009mm). Data were visually inspected for head movement after the realignment step. Images at rest were contrasted with images during right foot movement for each subject. For each subject, any fMRI run with excessive head motion in any of the three planes was excluded. We performed whole-brain analysis, examining voxels with threshold\np\n<\u20090.001 without correction for multiple comparisons, assessing those clusters with significance of\np\n<\u20090.05, uncorrected for multiple comparisons; if no activation was found using a threshold of\np\n<\u20090.001 for these voxel-wise analyses, analysis was repeated using the exploratory threshold of\np\n<\u20090.01. First, a one-sample\nt\n-test was used to characterize activation in each of the two subject groups. Next, a two-sample\nt\n-test examined differences between the two groups. Finally, correlations were calculated to delineate relationships between cortical activity and target assessments related to gait and ASIA scores. To understand whether having two sites affected results, fMRI analyses were repeated adding site as a covariate. In order to derive a between-group effect size, percent signal change was extracted from the left foot area of primary motor cortex (M1), at a threshold of\np\n<\u20090.001."

    "Methods": "Sample and procedure\nBefore the start of the 2013 fall football season, athletic trainers and/or head football coaches at NCAA Division I Football Championship Series (FCS) schools were approached using publicly available contact information and asked whether members of their team could participate in a questionnaire-based research study examining the perception of concussion among United States collegiate football players. After review by members of the target population for content and clarity, questionnaires were administered using pen and paper, in person, at the athletes' home institutions. A convenience sample of athletes from 10 football teams completed the questionnaires during the 2013 football season. Athletic trainers from these 10 teams were re-contacted before the 2014 fall football season regarding continued participation; nine of the 10 teams that participated in 2013 agreed to participate in 2014.\nAll athletes provided informed consent before participation, and all research activities were approved by Boston University Medical Center and Boston Children's Hospital Institutional Review Boards. All data were coded into a database from the original paper questionnaires. Ten percent of questionnaires were chosen, at random, each year and were entered by a second coder to ensure inter-coder reliability and consistency. Error rates were <0.1% both years.\n\nMeasures\nParticipants completed seven statements related to their perceived likelihood of sustaining a concussion in the future and of experiencing negative concussion-related health consequences. All future risk statements included the item stem \u201cIn the future, there is a strong possibility that\u2026\u201d and were assessed using a seven-point Likert scale with responses ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Where reported, percent agreement represents responses of slightly agree (5), agree (6), and strongly agree (7) combined. All future risk questions are provided in\nAppendix 1\nand described briefly below.\nPerceived risk of sustaining a concussion\nIn both 2013 and 2014, athletes were first asked how strongly they agreed with the item \u201cIn the future, there is a strong possibility that I will get a concussion.\u201d\nPerceived health consequences of a single concussion\nAthletes were queried at both time points about how strongly they agreed with statements related to their risk of sustaining concussion-related health consequences in the future, including missing a few games or ending their season early because of a concussion.\nPerceived health consequences of multiple concussions\nAthletes were also asked about the cumulative effects of multiple concussions, specifically whether they agreed that there was a strong possibility of their career ending early, having short-term or long-term personal life problems, and dementia, CTE, or Alzheimer's disease developing.\nHistory of diagnosed concussion\nAthletes were asked to write in their response to the following question about the number of diagnosed concussions they had sustained: \u201cIn your football career, how many times were you diagnosed with a concussion by a medical professional (doctor, athletic trainer, nurse)?\u201d\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics are provided to illustrate athletes' agreement with the risk-related statements across the two years of data collection. Paired sample\nt\ntests were used to examine the difference in mean response to future risk questions between 2013 and 2014. A Bonferroni correction was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. For items with significant between year changes, a change score was created by subtracting the response (1\u20137) from 2014 from the same response in 2013. This change score was then examined using a multiple linear regression analysis including the predictor variables: year in school (as a categorical variable), number of diagnosed concussions (as a continuous variable), and the initial score on the variable in question during the 2013 survey (as a continuous variable). Likert-scale responses were reduced to binary variables with responses of slightly agree (5), agree (6), and strongly agree (7) collapsed into an \u201cAgree\u201d category.\nBivariate logistic regressions were used to examine whether year in school was a significant predictor of whether or not an athlete agreed with each of the seven concussion-related risk statements. Logistic regression was also used to examine differences in the odds that athletes agreed with a given future risk question as the number of self-reported diagnosed concussions the athlete had sustained in his football career (examined as a continuous variable) increased, while controlling for the athlete's team and year in school. Statistical analysis was performed in R v. 3.2.3 using an alpha of <0.05 to indicate statistical significance."

    "Methods": "Army STARRS cohort\nThe subjects investigated were selected from U.S. Army soldiers who participated in the Army STARRS Initiative. All participants gave written informed consent to participate. These procedures were approved by the Human Subjects Committees of all collaborating organizations. We considered U.S. soldiers from three brigade combat teams deployed in Afghanistan during the first quarter of 2012. These subjects were assessed through the Pre/Post Deployment Survey (PPDS) that is a multi-wave panel survey based on self-administered questionnaires (SAQs) that collected prospective data at four time points: T0 (within approximately 6 weeks of their deployment), T1 (within one month of their return), T2 (approximately 3 months from their return), and T3 (approximately 9 months from their return). The T0 SAQ was an extensive survey focused on socio-demographic characteristics, lifetime and past-30-day mental disorders, and other potential risk and resilience factors. The T1 follow-up SAQ included an assessment of deployment experiences including deployment stressors and TBI. The T2 and T3 SAQs included questions about PCS. In the present investigation, we included 845 subjects with European ancestry that met criteria for mild-to-moderate TBI at the T1 follow-up SAQ. Further details regarding the Army STARRS initiative, U.S. Army cohorts, PPDS, and deployment-acquired TBI criteria are available in previous publications.\n4\n,\n22\n\nPost-concussive symptom measures\nConsistent with the National Institute of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative,\n23\nwe conducted our PRS analysis considering dimensional measures of PCS derived from symptom scales based on self-reported information. Further details concerning the methods for PCS severity calculation and categorization are available in our previous publication.\n4\nLongitudinal analysis of persistent PCS was conducted at the T2 and T3 follow-up assessments. Both T2 and T3 SAQs included eight items that reflect the array of PCS: 1) balance problems or dizziness; 2) sensitivity to noise; 3) sensitivity to light; 4) memory problems; 5) headaches; 6) difficulty concentrating; 7) irritability; and 8) feeling tired out or being easily fatigued. Respondents rated each symptom on a 5-point frequency scale that ranged from \u201cNone of the time (0)\u201d through \u201cAll or almost all of the time (4).\u201d Further details regarding PCS assessments are available in our previous publication.\n4\nSumming these ratings yielded a global PCS score (PCS-8) ranging from 0 to 32. Because persistent PCS affect multiple neurobehavioral domains (i.e., vestibular, somatic/sensory, cognitive, and emotional),\n2\nwe also calculated two alternative PCS measures: a \u201cphysical\u201d PCS score and a \u201ccognitive/emotional\u201d PCS score. The physical PCS score (PCS-5; range\u2009=\u20090\u201320) included vestibular and somatic/sensory PCS items: balance problems or dizziness, sensitivity to noise, sensitivity to light, memory problems, and headaches. The cognitive/emotional PCS score (PCS-3; range\u2009=\u20090\u201312) included cognitive and emotional PCS items: irritability, difficulty concentrating, and feeling tired or easily fatigued. For all PCS scores (i.e., PCS-8, PCS-5, and PCS-3), we considered the highest PCS score at either T2 or T3 (PCS Max) to reflect persistent PCS and the PCS change between T3 and T2 (PCS \u0394) to evaluate the course of persistent PCS after the deployment-acquired TBI.\n\nGWAS summary statistics\nWe derived PRS from previous large GWAS conducted on multiple brain-related phenotypic traits: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), years of schooling, college completion, childhood intelligence, infant head circumference (IHC), and adult intracranial volume. For Alzheimer's disease, we used stage 1 summary statistics from the GWAS conducted by the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project on 17,008 Alzheimer's disease case patients and 37,154 controls.\n24\nFor Parkinson's disease, we used summary statistics from the GWAS conducted on 13,708 case patients and 95,282 controls available at the PDGene database.\n25\n,\n26\nParkinson's disease PRS analysis was conducted considering only two association\np\n-value thresholds (\np\n-value\u2009=\u20090.001, 0.05) for SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) inclusion because the GWAS summary statistics included only detailed information regarding the top 10,000 variants. For psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and MDD), we used summary statistics from GWAS conducted by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium.\n27\u201329\nFor years of schooling and college completion, we used summary statistics from GWAS performed by the Social Science Genetic Association Consortium.\n30\nFor childhood intelligence, we used summary statistics from the GWAS performed by the Childhood Intelligence Consortium.\n31\nFor IHC, we used summary statistics from the GWAS conducted by the Early Growth Genetics Consortium.\n32\nFor adult intracranial volume, we used summary statistics from the GWAS conducted by the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis Consortium.\n33\n\nStatistical analysis\nWe conducted cross-phenotype PRS analyses using PRSice software.\n34\nPPDS subjects were genotyped using the Illumina OmniExpress + Exome array with additional custom content (967,000 genetic markers). After pre-imputation quality control, a total of 664,457 SNPs entered the subsequent analysis. The genotype imputation was conducted using SHAPEIT\n35\nfor pre-phasing, IMPUTE2\n36\nfor imputation, and 1000 Genomes Project Phase 1\n37\nas the reference panel. Further details regarding genotyping and imputation procedures are available in our previous publication.\n38\nWe used imputed genotypes to maximize a consistent SNP panel between the training and testing sets and performed linkage disequilibrium (LD) clumping by excluding SNPs that had R\n2\n\u22650.3 with another SNP with a lower association\np\n-value in a 500\u2009kb window. We used four association\np\n-value thresholds (\np\n-value\u2009=\u20090.001, 0.05, 0.3, 0.5) for SNP inclusion in the high-resolution PRS except as noted above. Because the GWAS used were conducted on subjects with European ancestry, we restricted our analysis to Army STARRS participants with European ancestry. To confirm subjects\u2019 ancestry, we performed a principal component (PC) analysis combining the Army STARRS samples with the HapMap3\n39\nreference subjects. Then, a PC analysis was conducted within each ancestry group using only the study samples to obtain the top 10 PCs for population stratification adjustment. Further details regarding the methods of PC analysis are available in our previous publication.\n38\nWe used summary statistics from the large GWAS selected as the training dataset and fitted in regression models with adjustments for age, sex, and the top 10 PCs to calculate Nagelkerke's R\n2\nas the figure of merit for prediction ability. Before being entered in the regression model, PCS score (Max and \u0394) were normalized using appropriate Box-Cox power transformations. Because we performed multiple tests, we considered a PRS-wise significant threshold (\np\n<\u20090.005; Bonferroni correction for the 10 PRS) in accordance with what was recently proposed for phenome analysis of previously identified alleles.\n40\nTo estimate the statistical power of the PRS analysis conducted in our sample, we performed a power analysis in R (\nwww.r-project.org/\n) using the \u201cpwr\u201d package (available at\nhttp://cran.r-project.org/package=pwr\n) considering different significance thresholds (nominal and PRS-wise).\nFinally, we conducted an enrichment analysis for the significant PRS, analyzing the association of the SNPs included in the PRS with the PCS phenotype. SNPs with nominal concordant direction with PRS-PCS association were mapped to the corresponding genes using DEPICT v1\n41\nand then the loci were entered in Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis conducted using DAVID v6.7.\n42"

    "Methods": "Participants\nWe enrolled active duty service members from the TBI clinics of two military medical centers; all participants were allowed to continue with TAU during the trial. Inclusion criteria involved clinically confirmed mTBI sustained during deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan during Operations Iraqi Freedom, New Dawn, or Enduring Freedom within the previous 2 years. Subjects who screened positive for possible TBI on return to one of two domestic military bases after completion of deployment were referred to the military hospitals\u2019 TBI clinics. They were then evaluated by the clinic team, which included experienced neuropsychologists and physicians who confirmed mTBI using standard self-report clinical criteria. This included assessment for period of confusion as well as presence and length of retrograde and/or post-traumatic amnesia. In-theater evaluation of concussion was not standard procedure for part of this cohort, and combat medical records were not available to TBI clinic or study personnel at any time during the study. Enrollment in the study was based on diagnosis of mTBI by the military hospital's TBI clinic. Subjects were excluded for moderate-to-severe TBI requiring hospitalization, psychosis, active suicidal ideation at the time of screening, or participation in a formal TBI treatment program on base.\n\nMeasures\nAt baseline, we conducted a structured interview in person to obtain demographic information, injury history, and medical history. We administered all other measures by telephone at baseline and at 6 and 12 months post-enrollment. The two primary outcomes were psychological distress and PCS, evaluated by the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18) and the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ), respectively. The BSI-18 yields a Global Severity Index (GSI), which is converted to a T-score (adjusted for age and sex), with higher scores indicating more-severe symptoms; it has excellent validity and reliability in TBI patients.\n17\nThe RPQ examines the presence and severity of 16 common PCS with scores from 0 to 64, with higher being worse.\n18\nAdditional measures included: 1) EuroQol,\n19\na measure of quality of life; 2) PTSD Checklist-Military Version (PCL-M),\n20\na measure for PTSD symptom severity anchored to events that occurred during service; 3) Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI),\n21\na measure of sleep disorders and sleep quality; 4) Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9),\n22\na measure of depression based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria; 5) Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10 (CD-RISC)\n23\n; 6) Brief Inventory for Functioning Evaluation (B-IFE),\n24\na measure of social functioning designed for military populations; 7) Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)\n25\n; 8) Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS),\n26\na measure of functional impairment in the work, social life, and family life domains; 9) 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12),\n27\na commonly used measure of functional health status; and 10) the Client Satisfaction Scale.\n28\n\nProcedure\nThe study utilized a two-group parallel design. After enrollment and baseline assessment, study participants were randomly assigned to either the PST group or the EO group, with a 1:1 ratio, using blocked randomization stratified on active duty versus National Guard or Reserve status, level of psychological distress (BSI-18 GSI >60 vs. <\u2009=\u200960), and enrollment site. Outcomes were assessed by examiners blinded to participant assignment, and participants were instructed to not reveal their treatment condition while speaking with examiners.\n\nInterventions\nThe PST and EO interventions are described in detail elsewhere.\n29\nAfter baseline assessment, all participants received a study binder, which included group assignment, a list of resources, and the contact information for the study coordinator. The binder also included 12 educational brochures addressing problems common to mTBI and military readjustment after return from deployment (stress, substance abuse, pain and headache, sleep disorders, anger, depression, cognitive problems, relationships, money and finances, post-traumatic stress, physical recovery, and returning to work). The EO group also received a second copy of the brochures, one mailed every other week throughout the study. The PST group received 12 scheduled biweekly calls. Master's-level counselors conducted the phone treatment after extensive training and practice and were supervised in a weekly group led by study investigators (J.A.B., J.R.F., and K.R.B.). All intervention calls were placed from the University of Washington (Seattle, WA) site. PST participants self-selected problems to work on from a list generated during the first or second call and were emailed a call summary after each call. The problem-solving steps for participant-selected problems (\nTable 1\n) were frequently reviewed, with participants gradually taking on more independence in following the steps.\nTable\n1.\nCONTACT Problem-Solving Steps\nA.

The study was conducted in accord with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. Informed consent was obtained from all participants before entering the study. The investigators were responsible for the design and oversight of the study, development of the protocol, data collection, and the analysis. The study was funded as part of a Department of Defense\u2013funded consortium, called INTRuST (Injury and Traumatic Stress: Posttraumatic Stress and Traumatic Brain Injury Clinical Consortium). The INTRuST data safety monitoring board reviewed all study data quarterly. All statistical analyses were conducted by the consortium biostatisticians (R.R., S.J., and K.E.), separate from the clinical or supervising sites.\n\nStatistical analysis\nWe conducted all statistical analyses using statistical software R (version 3.1.1;\nhttp://www.r-project.org\n). Our analyses followed the intent-to-treat principle. Summary statistics and comparisons between intervention groups were provided for demographics and injury-related variables. We used a mixed-effects regression model separately on each of the primary outcome measures to determine whether the PST group had improved BSI-18 or RPQ scores, compared to the EO group, at treatment end (i.e., 6 months after enrollment) and at follow-up (12 months after enrollment). This model included the outcome score as the dependent variable, and time, treatment, and time-by-treatment interaction terms as independent effects, and a random intercept and slope using an unstructured variance-covariance structure. We treated time (0, 6, and 12 months) as a categorical variable, and we included stratification factors in the model, as well as observed confounders defined as any baseline covariate simultaneously unbalanced at baseline (univariate,\np\n<\u20090.10) and associated with the outcome (univariate,\np\n<\u20090.15). We considered a significant treatment effect if the\np\nvalue for the 6-month time-by-treatment interaction contrast in either of the two primary analyses was \u22640.025. Size of the treatment effect was estimated from the coefficients for the 6-month time-by-treatment interaction.\nWe conducted a sensitivity analysis to examine any imbalance between those followed and those with a missed assessment. We used a mixed-effects regression model analogous to the primary analysis, additionally including any baseline variables found to be imbalanced between those followed and those missed. We applied mixed-effects regression models analogous to the primary analysis methodology for secondary and exploratory analyses. Another sensitivity analysis we conducted for the primary outcomes was to compare the original model with the time-variable model including only months 0 and 6. We made no adjustments for multiple comparisons for secondary analyses, and we defined\np\n<\u20090.05 as our minimum threshold for statistical significance.\nWe used the Reliable Change Index (RCI) for the GSI to estimate whether the change observed was greater than that which is attributable to the reliability of the instrument. The test-retest reliability of GSI score is set as 0.9.\n30\n,\n31\nSubjects were categorized based on the RCI as the following: Improvement: RCI < \u20131.96; Worsening: RCI >1.96; and No Change: otherwise.\nFinally, we conducted regression analyses to examine the potential factors that might influence the response to the CONTACT intervention. We used the BSI score at 6 months as the dependent variable, and race, ethnicity, number of concussions, time since return from last deployment, baseline PCL-M, baseline PHQ-9, and baseline CD-RISC scores as independent variables."

Former NFL players were recruited through e-mails to and presentations for members of the NFL Players Association and/or NFL Alumni Association, as well as through Boston University Alzheimer's Disease and CTE Center social media postings and word of mouth. Inclusion criteria included: ages 40\u201369 years and a minimum of 2 years of active playing time in the NFL. To further increase the possibility of having CTE, former NFL players were also required to have 12 or more total years of participation in organized tackle football and to have self-reported complaints of cognitive, behavioral, and mood symptoms for at least 6 months before study entry. Former NFL players must also not have had a history of concussion within 1 year of entry into DETECT.\nThe control subjects were recruited through social media postings, flyers, and word of mouth. Control subjects were also between ages 40 and 69. In addition, in order to investigate the long-term consequences of RHI exposure in the former NFL players, the control subjects were required to have no history of organized contact sport involvement (e.g., football, hockey, soccer, lacrosse, and wrestling) and no history of TBI. Three of the controls had a history of soccer play and 1 a history of amateur wrestling, but this was not considered meaningful participation given the brief length of play and/or lack of significant exposure to RHI. For all subjects, exclusion criteria included English as a second language, MRI, and/or lumbar puncture contraindications, and history of any other central nervous system diagnosis. Test effort was also assessed through embedded and nonembedded performance validity measures, and evaluation of neuropsychological test scores by two neuropsychologists for any peculiar score profiles. The sample of former NFL players was reduced from 96 to 95 after exclusion of 1 subject because of poor effort, as evidenced by: failure on multiple performance validity tests (embedded and nonembedded measures); several neuropsychological scores at floor; and external evidence that supported intentional poor effort.\nTable 1\npresents sample characteristics.\nTable\n1.\nSample Demographic, Athletic, and Medical Characteristics\nCharacteristic\nNFL (\nn\n=\u200995)\nControl (\nn\n=\u200928)\np\nvalue\nAge, mean (SD) years\n55.29 (7.88)\n57.14 (6.94)\n0.265\nEducation, mean (SD) years\n16.41 (0.97)\n17.46 (2.19)\n0.019\nAfrican American\na\n,\nn\n(%) (\nN\n=\u200994 for NFL)\n41 (43.6)\n1 (3.6)\n<0.001\nAFE to football\na\n, mean (SD) years (\nN\n=\u200994)\n11.93 (2.56)\n0.0 (0.0)\n\u2014\nDuration of football play, mean (SD) years\n18.22 (3.50)\n0.0 (0.0)\n\u2014\nDuration of play in the NFL, mean (SD) years\n8.10 (2.80)\n0.0 (0.0)\n\u2014\nPrimary position group,\nn\n(%)\n\u2014\n\u2014\nOffensive line\n28 (29.5)\n\u2014\n\u2014\nRunning back\n8 (8.4)\n\u2014\n\u2014\nTight end\n5 (5.3)\n\u2014\n\u2014\nOffensive skill\n1 (1.1)\n\u2014\n\u2014\nDefensive line\n15 (15.8)\n\u2014\n\u2014\nLinebacker\n20 (21.1)\n\u2014\n\u2014\nDefensive back\n18 (18.9)\n\u2014\n\u2014\nBody mass index, mean (SD) kg/m\n2\n33.42 (5.09)\n27.84 (3.84)\n<0.001\nPlayed other contact sports,\nn\n(%)\n24 (25.3)\n4 (14.3)\n0.223\nHypertension\na\n,\nn\n(%) (\nN\n=\u200992 for NFL and 27 for controls)\n47 (51.1)\n5 (18.5)\n0.003\nHigh cholesterol\na\n,\nn\n(%) (\nN\n=\u200989 for NFL)\n47 (52.8)\n7 (25.0)\n0.010\nDiabetes\na\n,\nn\n(%) (\nN\n=\u200991 for NFL)\n8 (8.8)\n1 (3.6)\n0.361\nHeart disease\na\n,\nn\n(%) (\nN\n=\u200990 for NFL)\n8 (8.9)\n0 (0.0)\n0.102\nUse of excessive alcohol,\nn\n(%)\n49 (51.6)\n8 (28.6)\n0.032\nUse of illicit drugs,\nn\n(%)\n60 (63.2)\n15 (53.6)\n0.361\nUse of performance enhancing drugs\na\n,\nn\n(%) (\nN\n=\u200987)\n13 (14.9)\n0 (0.0)\n0.030\nOpen in a separate window\na\nSample size reduced because of missing data.\nSD, standard deviation; AFE, age of first exposure; NFL, National Football League.\nAs part of DETECT, all subjects underwent comprehensive examinations during a single 2- to 3-day visit that included a neurological evaluation, neuropsychological testing, a structured psychiatric interview, extensive self-report measures of mood and behavior, neuroimaging, blood and cerebrospinal fluid collection, and genetic testing. Only neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric (i.e., mood and behavior) data relevant to the current study objectives were examined. At the time of this study, not all neuroimaging and fluid biomarker measures were available for analysis. All protocols were approved by the Boston University Medical Center Institutional Review Board. Subjects provided their written informed consent before participation and were given a copy of all signed consent forms.\n\nMeasures\nOlfactory function\nThe B-SIT\n56\nis a standardized 5- to 10-minute, 12-item odorant test that was used to measure olfactory function. Six items are food related (lemon, banana, pineapple, chocolate, cinnamon, and onion) and six are nonfood related (rose, gasoline, smoke, turpentine, soap, and paint thinner). The scent is microencapsulated then released by scratching the strip with a pencil tip. Subjects then sniff and select one of four possible multiple-choice answers, with scores ranging from 0 to 12 (higher score reflects better performance). Raw scores are converted to age-adjusted percentiles from the administration manual to determine abnormal performance compared to normative data (for a detailed description of the development of normative data for the B-SIT, see Doty\n56\n). Because abnormal performance is age dependent, the cutoff for determining abnormal olfactory function is different across age groups. Briefly, the normative data for the B-SIT were developed to be analogous to the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), and there is a percentile rank for each 5-year age category that is used to identify abnormal olfactory function. As an example, a 45- to 49-year-old male subject with a B-SIT raw score of 8 has an age percentile rank of 4, which is classified as abnormal. In contrast, a 55- to 59-year-old with a B-SIT score of 6 is deemed to be abnormal (age percentile rank of 3).\nTable 2\nprovides the age groups of the current sample and corresponding cut-off scores for determining abnormal olfaction. The B-SIT has adequate test-retest reliability (\nr\n=\u20090.71)\n57\n,\n58\nand strong clinical utility in TBI,\n16\naging,\n51\nand neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., AD).\n40\nTable\n2.\nB-SIT Cut-Off Scores for Abnormal Olfactory Function by Age Group (Based on Doty\n56\n)\nAge group\na\nB-SIT raw cutoff score for abnormal function\nAge percentile rank\n40\u201344\n8\n5\n45\u201349\n8\n4\n50\u201354\n8\n4\n55\u201359\n6\n3\n60\u201364\n5\n3\n65\u201369\n4\n4\nOpen in a separate window\na\nOnly age groups relevant to the current sample are presented.\nB-SIT, Brief Smell Identification Test.\nNeuropsychological measures\nAll subjects completed a neuropsychological test battery as part of DETECT to assess cognitive function in the major domains, including attention, executive function, psychomotor speed, visual and verbal episodic memory, language, motor, and visuospatial functions. All tests are widely used in clinical research settings. The tests demonstrate excellent psychometric properties, including reliability and validity. Raw scores were converted to standardized scores that account for age, sex, and/or educational attainment. The tests included: Trail Making Test (TMT) Parts A and B\n59\n; Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) Digit Span and Digit Symbol Tests\n60\n; Wisconsin Card Sorting Test\n61\n; Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT)\n62\n; Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System Color-Word Interference Test (DKEFS)\n63\n; Boston Qualitative Scoring System for the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF)\n64\n; Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB) Story Learning Test, List Learning Test, Map Reading Test, and Naming Test\n65\n; and Animal Fluency.\n62\nBehavioral/mood\nParticipants completed a range of standardized self-report and semistructured interviews to assess behavior and mood symptoms, including depression, suicidality, hopelessness, apathy, aggression, impulsivity, and hostility. The tests included: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS)\n66\n; Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)\n67\n; Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)\n68\n; Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS)\n69\n; Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES)\n70\n; Modified Scale for Suicidal Ideation\n71\n; Brown-Goodwin Lifetime History of Aggression\n72\n; Buss-Durkee Inventory\n73\n; Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning\u2014Adult Version\n74\n; and the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11).\n75\n\nStatistical analysis\nIndependent-samples\nt\n-tests determined differences in B-SIT scores between the former NFL and control groups. Because there was significant difference in the between-group variance, the Satterthwaite approximation was used for the\nt\n-test group comparison. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were then conducted to identify the optimal B-SIT cut-off score using the area under the ROC curve and the highest c-statistic value for distinguishing the former NFL group from controls. To examine the association between the B-SIT and behavioral/mood and neuropsychological function in the former NFL players, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to generate factor composite scores using the above-listed measures\u2014excluding the B-SIT\u2014in order to limit the number of analyses and reduce risk for type 1 error. An iterative method was applied to generate a factor structure that was the most parsimonious and theoretically consistent with\na priori\nclinical domains. The following approach was used to determine item retention: 1) Only factors with an eigenvalue >1 were retained; and 2) following a VARIMAX rotation, items with a loading of <0.5 were removed and the PCA was repeated until both criteria were satisfied. Partial correlations adjusting for age and education were performed to investigate the relationship between the B-SIT and each of the factor scores. For all analyses, the significance level was set at an alpha of 0.05."

    "Methods": "Nineteen subjects met the following inclusion and exclusion criteria and were enrolled in this study. Selected measures were collected on all enrolled subjects; however, data from 8 subjects are not included in the analysis secondary to an inability to obtain blood samples (procedures described below) from these subjects. Inclusion criteria for participation were a history of motor incomplete SCI (>6 months) with spinal lesion above neurological level T10, between 18 and 75 years old, and an ability to independently complete at least three speeds during the graded-intensity treadmill test (described below). Exclusion criteria consisted of concurrent illness that could limit safety or walking performance, including: anemia (defined as hemoglobin levels of <13\u2009g/dL for men and <12\u2009g/dL for women); clotting disorders; unhealed decubiti; uncontrolled cardiopulmonary disease, including orthostatic hypotension and recurrent autonomic dysreflexia; active heterotopic ossification; and other peripheral or central neurological injury. Use of antispastic agents, antidepressants, or other serotonergic agents within the past 2 weeks also excluded patients from participation secondary to the known effects of these medications on motor output,44locomotor function,45and BDNF expression.46All subjects obtained medical clearance and provided written informed consent before participation. All study procedures were conducted in accord with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the local institutional review board.\n\nData collection and analysis\nBefore exercise testing, clinical measures of spastic motor activity, strength, and overground gait speed were assessed by a licensed physical therapist. Spastic motor activity was evaluated using the modified Ashworth (mAsh) scores\n47\nfor bilateral knee flexors and extensors and the Spinal Cord Assessment Tool for Spastic Reflexes (SCATS).\n48\nRaw scores for the mAsh were converted to an ordinal scale to allow for the calculation of a composite score. Scores for both measures of spastic motor activity were summed within and between legs to obtain a composite score\n44\n,\n49\n(mAsh range, 0\u201320; SCATS range, 0\u201318). Strength was assessed with the International Standards for the Neurological Classification of SCI Lower Extremity Motor Scores (LEMS)\n50\nfor specific lower-extremity muscles. Raw scores for strength were summed within and between limbs to generate a composite score (range, 0\u201350). Overground gait speeds were collected over a 3.85-m instrumented walkway (GaitMat II; Equitest, Chalfont, PA) with 1.8\u2009m on each end to allow for acceleration and deceleration. For collection of self-selected speed (SSS), subjects were instructed to walk at their normal, comfortable pace. Two trials were collected and averaged to determine overground walking speeds.\nSubjects subsequently participated in a graded-intensity locomotor exercise paradigm on a treadmill. For this test, subjects were fitted with a harness for safety without body-weight support and instructed to walk on a motorized, instrumented treadmill (Bertec Corp, Colombus, OH) starting at 0.1\u2009m/s for 2\u2009min, with 0.1-m/s increases in speed every 2\u2009min until the subject required support from the safety harness or voluntarily stopped the test. All subjects enrolled had performed graded exercise testing previously and were familiar with the testing conditions. To evaluate the effect of manipulating locomotor exercise intensity and to normalize across subjects, measures of interest were evaluated at three levels of intensity defined as a percentage of peak gait speed; low intensity was defined as 33%, moderate intensity as 66%, and high intensity as 100% of peak gait speed achieved during the exercise paradigm.\nIndirect measures of exercise intensity were also determined at each speed during testing. Specifically, cardiorespiratory measures were collected continuously, and the subject's rating of perceived exertion (RPE)\n51\nwas collected during the last 30\u2009sec of each speed increment. In cases where RPE was not successfully collected at the time point of interest (\nn\n=\u20095), the RPE reported during the preceding speed was utilized for analysis. Heart rate (HR; beats/min) and rate of oxygen consumption (VO\n2\n; mL/kg/min) were determined using a portable metabolic system (CosMed USA, Inc., Chicago, IL) calibrated before each testing with room air and a reference gas mixture (16% O\n2\nand 5% CO\n2\n). Cardiorespiratory data were collected on a breath-by-breath basis and stored for subsequent analysis. HR and VO\n2\nvalues collected in the last 30\u2009sec of each speed increment were averaged. NetVO\n2\nwas calculated as the difference between the average VO\n2\nat a particular speed and the average VO\n2\nmeasured during 2\u2009min of quiet sitting before exercise testing. VO\n2\nPeak was defined as the maximum NetVO\n2\ncollected during the exercise paradigm. To normalize measures across subjects, percentages of age predicted heart rate maximum (%PredHRmax) was determined using the formula: 208-0.7*age,\n52\nand percentages of VO\n2\nPeak (%VO\n2\nPeak) were also calculated.\nSerial venous blood draws were also collected before, during, and after exercise testing. Before testing, an intravenous (i.v.) catheter was placed in the subject's upper extremity by a registered nurse. Upon insertion, the i.v. was flushed with 10\u2009mL of 0.9% normal saline (0.9%NS) to ensure patency. After initial placement, at least 30\u2009min passed before blood samples were collected. Immediately before exercise testing, three blood samples were collected at 2-min intervals while the subject was sitting at rest. During testing, blood samples were collected during the last 30\u2009sec of each speed increment. Finally, three blood samples were taken immediately after testing and at 15 and 30\u2009min post-exercise. All samples were collected using an IV Leur Lock Collection set into a 10-mL serum separator vacutainer tube (BD; Franklin Lakes, NJ). When a 0.9%NS flush was used, an equivalent volume was drawn to waste before collection of the blood sample used for analysis to prevent dilution. Blood samples were kept at room temperature for 30\u2009min to allow for clotting and then placed on ice. After clotting, all samples were centrifuged at 1000\ng\nfor 15\u2009min at 4\n\u00b0\nC (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA). Separated serum was divided into several aliquots in microcentrifuge tubes and stored at \u221280\n\u00b0\nC until analysis (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\nSerum samples were analyzed for peripheral levels of BDNF, IGF-1, and lactate using commercially available kits. Concentrations of BDNF and IGF-1 were determined using Multiplex Assays (intra-assay precision of <10%; MILLIPLEX MAP Human Pituitary Magnetic Bead Panel 2\u2009Kit and Human IGF-I, II Magnetic Bead Panel Kit; EMD Millipore; Darmstadt, Germany). Lactate concentrations were assessed using colormetric assays (Lactate Colormetric Assay Kit II; Biovision Incorporated, Milpitas, CA). All samples were analyzed in duplicate and mean concentrations were calculated; only duplicates with a coefficient of variation of less than 10% were accepted for analysis. Resting concentrations were determined as an average of the concentration found in the three serum samples taken before exercise. Changes in BDNF, IGF-1, and blood lactate concentration from resting levels at time points of interest were calculated as the absolute difference between the concentration at that time point and the average resting concentration as well as the percent change from average resting levels. In cases where a sample was not successfully obtained during exercise (\nn\n=\u20094), the group mean change for that level was imputed. Further, when timing of testing termination did not allow for sample collection at the subject's peak speed (\nn\n=\u20098), the sample collected immediately post-exercise was used for analysis. In instances when a sample was successfully collected both at peak speed and immediately post-exercise, an average at these time points was calculated and considered as high intensity.\nEach subject also provided a 2-mL saliva sample in a DNA Self-Collection Kit (DNA Genotek, Kanata, Ontario, Canada) for processing and analysis. Samples were then sent to Rutgers Biomedical and Health Science for processing and analysis. Primers were created to amplify the region surrounding the SNP (Val66Met: rs6265) of the BDNF gene, and then each sample was examined for the presence or absence of the Val66Met SNP using a TaqMan genotyping assay. Subjects without the SNP are indicated as Val/Val, and subjects who were hetero- or homozygous for the SNP are indicated as Val/Met or Met/Met, respectively.\n\nStatistical analysis\nTo determine the effect of exercise intensity on serum concentrations of BDNF and IGF-1 (s[BDNF] and s[IGF-1]) a repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with five levels based on level of intensity or time post-exercise (low, moderate, high intensity, 15\u2009min post-exercise, and 30 minutes post-exercise) was used. When significant differences were observed, planned comparisons with Bonferroni-corrected paired\nt\n-tests were performed. Values at high intensity were compared to those at low, moderate, and post-exercise time points, with \u03b1 adjusted to 0.0125 for multiple comparisons. Similarly, a one-factor, repeated-measures ANOVA with three levels (low, moderate, and high intensity) was utilized to assess differences in indirect indicators of exercise intensity. When significant differences were observed, post-hoc paired\nt\n-tests were performed with \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.017 for the three comparisons. Correlations between changes in s[BDNF] during exercise and indirect measures of exercise intensity (Pearson's correlation coefficient) were also tested. Finally, group data were separated into two groups based on subject's BDNF genotype (Val/Val or Val/Met). A Freidman test was utilized to assess intensity-dependent changes in s[BDNF] in each group with \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05. Relationships between changes in BDNF and indirect measures of exercise intensity in Val/Val subjects were also explored with Pearson's correlation coefficient. All data presented in text and tables are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation, and data presented in figures are presented as means \u00b1 standard error. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software (version 21; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL)."

    "Methods": "Patient selection\nThe criteria for inclusion were: age more than 15 years, severe head injury with post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score <9 or Glasgow Motor Score (GMS) <6, no mass lesion over 25 cc, no ischemic/vascular lesion explaining the depressed level of consciousness, and DAI-associated lesions confirmed on MRI performed within 1 week after trauma. During the study period between January 2006 and February 2014, a total of 59 patients older than 15 years were admitted to the neurointensive care (NIC) unit with suspected DAI on the initial CT.\nIn 20 patients, MRI was not performed to confirm the DAI diagnosis, and 9 patients were investigated with MRI in the subacute phase beyond 1 week post-injury. The main reasons for not performing MRI acutely were externally fixated extremity fractures incompatible with MRI followed by intracranial pressure (ICP) instability, which made transfer from the NIC unit unsafe. The remaining 30 patients with severe TBI included in the study had clinical and CT indications of DAI, and this diagnosis was confirmed with MRI within 1 week of the injury.\nWith the exception of one patient with grade II thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 50 \u2013 75\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n9\n/L), no patient had a coagulopathy or was receiving anticoagulant therapy before the trauma. Low-dose antithrombotic therapy with low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH; Dalteparin 2500\u20135000 units) was administered to 16/30 patients at mean 6 days (standard deviation [SD] \u00b14 days) post-trauma. The LMWH was administered after acquisition of MRI images in all but two patients, in whom LMWH was administered 1 day before the MRI.\n\nNeurointensive care\nAll patients in the presented study were treated at the NIC unit at the Uppsala University Hospital. The patients were ventilated endotracheally and sedated using a combination of intermittent intravenous (IV) morphine analgesia (Morfin Meda 1\u20133\u2009mg, Meda, Sollentuna, Sweden) and continuous IV propofol infusion (Propofol-Lipuro 1\u20134\u2009mg/kg/h, B. Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany). All patients had ICP monitoring (Codman ICP express intraparenchymal monitor in 22 patients, external ventricular drain in 8 patients) for continuous measurements of ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP).\nPatients with TBI were treated using an ICP- and CPP-guided standard protocol including mild hyperventilation initially (PaCO\n2\n30\u201335\u2009mm Hg; 4.0\u20134.5\u2009kPa), 30-degree elevated head of bed, and volume expansion to normovolemia and a central venous pressure of 0\u20135\u2009mm Hg.\n19\nTo minimize secondary brain injury, the aim of treatment was to keep ICP at <20\u2009mm Hg and CPP at >60\u2009mm Hg according to an organized secondary insult program.\n19\nICP elevations not controlled by standard therapy or CSF drainage were treated with pharmacologically induced coma using first continuous propofol infusions without neurological wake-up tests\n20\nand as second-tier therapy, continuous sodium pentobarbital infusion therapy and/or a decompressive craniotomy.\n\nImaging and image analysis\nAn initial CT was performed on admission and scored according to the Marshall classification by the first author (SAH).\n8\nMRI was performed as soon as the patients were medically stable. MRI was performed with a 1.5T scanner (Siemens Avanto, Siemens Medical, Erlangen, Germany). Imaging included a gradient echo T2*GRE sequence (repetition time [TR]: 500\u2009msec, echo time [TE]: 14\u2009msec, flip angle [FA]: 30 degrees, acquisition voxel: 0.9\u2009\u00d7\u20090.9\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm); a diffusion-weighted (DW) sequence (SE-EPI, b-value 1000\u2009s/mm\n2\n, TR: 4700\u2009msec, TE: 89\u2009msec, acquisition voxel: 1.2\u2009\u00d7\u20091.2\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009mm); and a SWI sequence (TR: 49\u2009msec, TE: 40\u2009msec, FA: 15 degrees, acquisition voxel: 0.9\u2009\u00d7\u20090.9\u2009\u00d7\u20091.5\u2009mm).\nThe images were assessed independently by two of the authors (SAH and JW). DAI-associated lesions were defined as hypointense/decreased signals for T2*GRE and SWI sequences, and/or restricted diffusion for DW sequence in white matter structures not extending to the cortex. No size limit was used. Present small cortical lesions were excluded. Mimicking lesions such as vascular structures were excluded based on tubular shape.\nThe Adams anatomical histopathological grading system was applied.\n7\nThe grading was performed both for each sequence separately and for all MRI sequences combined, where patients were classified according to the sequence giving the highest grade. The number of DAI-associated lesions was counted on each side of the midline in different anatomical localizations of the brain as presented in\nTable 1\n.\nTable\n1.\nProtocol Used for Counting Lesions in Different Anatomical Localizations Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Patients with Diffuse Axonal Injury\nGrade 1 (hemispheric)\nT2\n*\nGRE\nRight\nLeft\nDW\nRight\nLeft\nSWI\nRight\nLeft\nFrontal\nTemporal\nParietal\nOccipital\nInsular\nCerebellar\nOpen in a separate window\nGrade 2 (corpus callosum)\nT2\n*\nGRE\nDW\nSWI\nGenu\nBody\nSplenium\nOpen in a separate window\nGrade 3 (brainstem)\nT2\n*\nGRE\nCrus cerebri\nSN and tegmental\nTectal\nDW\nCrus cerebri\nSN and tegmental\nTectal\nSWI\nCrus cerebri\nSN and tegmental\nTectal\nMesencephalon\nOpen in a separate window\nT2\n*\nGRE\nVentral\nDorsal\nDW\nVentral\nDorsal\nSWI\nVentral\nDorsal\nPons\nMedulla oblongata\nOpen in a separate window\nDeep hemispheric lesions\nT2\n*\nGRE\nRight\nLeft\nDW\nRight\nLeft\nSWI\nRight\nLeft\nThalamus\nBasal ganglia\nInternal capsule\nOpen in a separate window\nT2\n*\nGRE, T2\n*\n-weighted gradient echo; DW, diffusion-weighted sequence; SWI, susceptibility-weighted imaging;\nThe mesencephalon was anatomically divided into three regions; (1) crus cerebri, (2) substantia nigra and mesencephalic tegmentum, and (3) tectum including the superior and inferior colliculi (\nFig. 1\n).

Physiological data collection was interrupted when the patient was taken to the operating room or for radiologic evaluation as well as when network or software failures occurred.\nThe remaining monitoring data, after removal of invalid data and without the gaps from interruption of monitoring, gave the good monitoring time (GMT), which was assessed for ICP, CPP, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate, and core body temperature. GMT for the first 96\u2009h after start of monitoring was used for analysis, and a minimum of 24\u2009h of GMT was required for inclusion.\nThresholds for secondary insults were defined based on the treatment goals for ICP, CPP, MAP, heart rate, and core body temperature and included ICP >20\u2009mm Hg, CPP <60\u2009mm Hg, MAP <70\u2009mm Hg, heart rate >120 bpm, and core body temperature >38\u00b0C. The amounts of secondary insults were calculated as the proportion of GMT at the insult level and are presented as percent of GMT. Mean pressure reactivity index (PRx), the moving correlation coefficient between fluctuations in ICP and arterial blood pressure (ABP) was calculated as a measure of the status of cerebral pressure autoregulation during the same period.\n22\nWe also calculated mean ICP amplitude to evaluate intracranial compliance.\n23\n\nOutcome\nLong-term outcome was assessed at >6 months after injury according to the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE). The GOSE score was assessed by an intensive care specialist nurse who was trained to perform the structured interview and blinded to all clinical data. Evaluation was performed via a standardized questionnaire based on the structured interviews proposed by Wilson and colleagues,\n24\nto be filled out by patients or the closest relative. Patients or relatives were contacted by telephone when supplementary information was needed.\n\nStatistical methods\nThe inter-rater agreement was calculated for agreement of DAI grading between the two independent evaluators for all sequences and for substantia nigra or tegmental/tectal brainstem lesion on SWI. Inter-rater agreement for total number of DAI-associated lesions was also calculated for all three sequences. Disagreement was settled with a mutual evaluation of images by SAH and JW, and the agreed consensus was used for data analysis.\nThe inter-rater agreement was analyzed using linear weighted Cohen \u03ba statistics for categorical values, and the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated with two-way random single measures (consistency/absolute agreement) for continuous values. Values of <0.2 were considered as poor, 0.21\u20130.4 as fair, 0.41\u20130.6 as moderate, 0.61\u20130.8 as good, and >0.81 as very good agreement for both \u03ba and ICC values.\nStatistica 12.0 (Stat Soft, Inc. Tulsa, OK) was used for descriptive and analytical statistics. The Student\nt\ntest was used for normal distributed data and the Fisher exact test for comparison of proportions. The Mann-Whitney\nU\ntest was used for skewed distributions. The association between potential prognostic factors and long-term outcome was analyzed with ordinal logistic regression with GOSE category as the dependent variable. Factors found significantly associated with outcome on univariate analysis were further analyzed in multivariate analysis with ordinal logistic regression. A\np\nvalue of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nEthics\nThe Uppsala University Regional Ethical Review Board for clinical research granted permission for the study."

    "Methods": "All experiments were approved by the Boston Children's Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and complied with the National Institutes of Health (NIH)Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Adult (age 16 weeks) and adolescent (age 5 weeks) male C57BL/6 mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were housed in a temperature- and humidity- controlled room with a 12\u2009h light/dark cycle, and fedat libitum.\n\nrmTBI\nMice were randomized to either rmTBI or sham injury. The rmTBI was performed as previously described.\n14\n,\n17\nBriefly, mice were anesthetized for 45\u2009sec using 4% isoflurane in a 70:30 mixture of oxygen. Anesthetized mice were placed on a delicate task wiper (Kimwipe, Kimberly-Clark, Irving, TX) and the head was placed directly under a hollow guide tube. Mice were held by the tail as an impact was delivered to the dorsal aspect of the skull. The impact was delivered by dropping a 54\u2009g metal bolt from a height of 71\u2009cm via a guide pipe, resulting in rotational acceleration of the head through the delicate task wiper. Sham injured mice underwent anesthesia but without injury. Mice were randomized to the following groups: seven injuries in 9 days (\nn\n=\u200912 adult mice,\nn\n=\u200917 adolescent mice), four injuries in 4 days (\nn\n=\u200910 adult mice,\nn\n=\u200910 adolescent mice), seven sham exposures in 9 days (\nn\n=\u200911 adult mice,\nn\n=\u200916 adolescent mice), and four sham exposures in 4 days (\nn\n=\u200910 adult mice,\nn\n=\u200910 adolescent mice) (\nFig. 1\n). For the seven injuries in 9 days protocol, mice were injured daily for 5 days, followed by 2 days without injury, and then by two additional daily injuries. All mice recovered in room air after injury or sham injury. Following injury or sham injury, all behavioral testing and histological and biochemical assays were conducted by investigators blinded to injury status, using color coding stored in a password-protected computer.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nStudy flow diagram.\n\nAssessments of loss of consciousness, (LOC), motor function, spatial memory and impulsivity-like phenotypes\nLOC, defined as the time from removal of anesthesia to spontaneous righting, was evaluated after each injury or sham injury.\nMotor ability and function was assessed on days 1\u20133 and again at 3 months after the last injury or sham injury using a rotorod as we previously reported.\n14\nIn brief, the rotorod consists of a 4\u2009cm diameter rotating drum, on which mice were placed. The time (sec) between placement on the rotorod and falling off of the rotorod was recorded as a measure of motor function. Rotorod testing was conducted over 3 days with 1 day of habituation followed by 2 days of testing. On testing days, mice were placed on the rod at 4\u2009rpm for 10\u2009sec, to acclimate to the rod speed, after which the rod was accelerated at 0.1\u2009rpm/sec. Each mouse completed four trials on the testing days, with a minimum of 15\u2009min rest between trials.\nSpatial learning and memory were assessed using the Morris water maze (MWM) on days 6\u20139 following injury and again at 3 months after injury. MWM testing was conducted as previously described.\n14\n,\n18\nBriefly, a white pool (83\u2009cm diameter, 60\u2009cm deep) was filled with water to 29\u2009cm depth. Water temperature was maintained at \u223c24\u00b0C, and a target platform (a round, clear, plastic platform 10\u2009cm in diameter) was positioned 1\u2009cm below the surface of the water. Several highly visible intra- and extra-maze cues were located in and around the pool. During hidden and visible platform trials, mice were randomized to one of four starting quadrants. Mice were placed in the tank facing the wall and given 90\u2009sec to find the platform, mount the platform, and remain on it for 5\u2009sec. Mice were then placed under a heat lamp to dry before their next run. Time until the mouse mounted the platform (escape latency) was measured and recorded. Mice that failed to mount the platform within the allotted time (90\u2009sec) were guided to the platform by the experimenter and allowed 10\u2009sec to become acquainted with its location. Each mouse was subjected to a maximum of two trials per day, each consisting of four runs, with a 45\u2009min break between trials. For visible platform trials, a red reflector was used to mark the top of the target platform. For probe trials, mice were placed in the tank with the platform removed, and given 60\u2009sec to explore the tank. Noldus Ethovision 9 software tracked swim speed, total distance moved, and time spent in the target quadrant where the platform had been previously located.\nImpulsivity behaviors were assessed in the elevated plus maze on day 21 and again at 3 months after injury as we previously described.\n14\nThe elevated plus maze apparatus (Lafayette Instruments, Lafayette, IN) consisted of two open and two closed arms (30\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009cm) extended out opposite from each other from a central platform (decision zone). Mice were placed on the center platform of the maze, facing a closed arm, and allowed to explore the apparatus for 5\u2009min. A computer-assisted video-tracking system (Noldus Ethovision) recorded the total time spent in the open center (decision zone) and the open and closed compartments. The percent of time spent in the open arms is used as a surrogate measure of impulsivity behaviors; mice with greater impulsivity spend more time in the open arms. The maze was cleaned between tests with a weak ethanol solution and dried. Data were expressed as percentage of (time in open arms)/(time in open + closed arms).\n\nSynaptosome preparation and immunoblot for NMDA receptors (NMDARs)\nThe separation of synaptic fractions was defined as previously described with slight modifications.\n19\nBriefly, the hippocampi and cortices from injured (\nn\n=\u20096) and sham (\nn\n=\u20096) mice from adolescent and adult mice 3 months post-injury were homogenized with a tissue grinder (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA) in buffer I (320\u2009mM of sucrose, 10\u2009mM of Tris, pH 7.4, 1\u2009mM of sodium orthovanadate [Na3VO4], 5\u2009mM of NaF, 1\u2009mM EDTA, 1\u2009mM of EGTA, 0.1\u2009mM of phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride [PMSF], and protease inhibitor cocktail [Roch Life Science, IN]). The homogenates were centrifuged for 10\u2009min at 800\ng\nat 4\u00b0C to remove uncompletely homogenized tissures and nuclei (p1). The supernatants were further spun at 10,000\ng\nfor 10\u2009min. The pellets (p2) were separated from the supernatant (s1). The p2 pellets were washed once in buffer I and resuspended in 70\u2009\u03bcL (for hippocampus) or 140\u2009\u03bcL (for cortex) of buffer II (10\u2009mM of Tris, pH 7.4, 1\u2009mM of Na3VO4, 5\u2009mM of NaF, 1\u2009mM EDTA, 1\u2009mM of EGTA, 0.1\u2009mM of PMSF and 0.5% of triton-X100). The suspensions were incubated on ice for additional 20\u2009min with pipetting every 5\u2009min, and then the suspensions were spun at 100,000\ng\nfor an additional 1\u2009h at 4\u00b0C. The supernants (s2, containing synaptic vesicle fraction) were transferred to new tubes. The pellets (p3, containing synaptosome fraction) were then resuspended in 50\u2009\u03bcL (for hippocampus) or 100\u2009\u03bcL (for cortex) of buffer I with 1% of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad, CA). The p3 fractions were boiled in sample buffer. Twenty \u03bcg of protein was then loaded into 4\u201315% TGX\n\u2122\ngradient gel (Bio-rad, Hercules, CA) for electrophoresis, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes, and blocked with 5% of milk. Subsequently, anti-NR2B antibodies (Millipore) were applied at a 1:500 dilution and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. The following day, membranes were incubated with species-appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies and washed, and electrochemiluminescent substrate was applied (SuperSignal\n\u2122\nWest Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate, Life Technologies). An LAS 4000 Imager (GE) was used to detect signal. Actin was used to confirm equal loading between lanes. Blots were quantified using NIH ImageJ software (\nhttp://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij\n). The expression levels were normalized to actin and compared with the sham group.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nMice (both ages) were perfused 3 months after injury, and brains were collected for histopathological analysis. Serial 20\u2009\u03bcm coronal frozen sections from sham and injured adolescent (\nn\n=\u20095/group) and adult (\nn\n=\u20097/group) brains were cut on a cryostat (Leica) from the anterior frontal lobes through the posterior extent of the dorsal hippocampus. Every 10th section was collected sequentially and mounted on slides consistent with stereological techniques. After hydrogen peroxide treatment and incubation in a blocking solution containing 10% normal goat serum, sections were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in anti-ionized calcium binding adaptor 1 (IbA1) for microglia (WAKO, 1:250) antibodies. The following day, sections were washed and incubated sequentially with appropriate secondary antibodies, Vectastain ABC kit, and diaminobenzadine (DAB) (Vector), and mounted with Permount (Thermo-Fisher Scientific).\n\nStereological estimates\nAs described previously, Stereologer software (Stereology Resource Center) was used for analyzing the microglia cell immunolabeling after TBI.\n14\nBriefly, estimates of the number of microglia were obtained in the CA1 of sham and injured mice using a thin section modification of the optical fractionator method to determine cell immunolabeling using object area fraction and region point counting.\n20\nAn investigator blinded to age and injury status quantified the total volume of the CA1, using the Calvalieri-point counting method, and the total volume of Iba1 immunolabelling. The CA1 was defined as the most dorsal peak of the hippocampus. The medial border of the CA1 was congruent with the dorsal peak of the cingulum, the lateral border was the lateral border of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, and the anterior margin was concomitant with the first appearance of a closed loop between the pyramidal cell layer and the dentate granule cell layer in the hippocampal midline and the posterior margin with the anterior margin of the fasciola cinereum in the mesial hippocampus. On every 10th section, the software superimposed a lattice of regularly spaced plus signs over the region of interest (ROI), and the ROI was outlined. Then, under high magnification, the number of cells within each systematically spaced unbiased sampling frame was counted. At the completion of the stereological analyses, the samples were decoded, and mean and SEM of the CA1 volumes and immunolabeling were calculated. All coefficients of error (CE) values for the stereological estimates were <10%.\n\nWhite matter quanitification\nAn investigator blinded to age and injury status quantified white matter area using ImageJ software (Bethesda, MD) for adolescent (\nn\n=\u20097/group) and adult (\nn\n=\u20098/group) brains. After stereological estimates, sectioned brains were scanned into the computer with a ruler for scale calibration. The color and brightness of the pictures were adjusted to obtain the best visibility of the white matter through all the sections. White matter was measured on two sections from each animal: the first section closest to bregma 0.38\u2009mm and the second section 400\u2009\u03bcm following the first. Visible white matter from these sections was traced, and the number of pixels was calculated by the software, then converted to area. At the completion of measuring two sections per slide, the samples were decoded, and the average and SEM were calculated from each group.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM. Continuous variables were inspected for normality using the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test and compared between injured and sham-injured mice, and between adolescent and adult mice at single time points using a Student's\nt\ntest or Wilcoxon rank sum test, as approporiate. Sample size calculations were based on the\nt\ntest, a moderate effect size of 0.5, power of 0.8, and an \u03b1 of 0.05, estimating 10 mice/group needed for these studies. MWM and rotorod latencies were analyzed by linear regression, using clustered standard errors to account for repeated measures and time as a covariate when appropriate. The regression models were inspected with residual versus predictor plots to ensure that the residuals were normally distributed. Finally, to evaluate whether or not the effect of injury was modified by age, we created an interaction term for age and injury status, and re-ran the linear regression models with the interaction term. Statistical significance was considered\np\n<\u20090.05. All analyses were performed using Stata 11.2 (StataCorp, College Station, TX)."

    "Methods": "All procedures were approved by the Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University and were consistent with the Laboratory Animal Regulations for the care and use of animals.\n\nAnimals\nAdult (8\u201312 weeks) C57BL/6J male mice (Laboratory Animal Center of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China) weighing 18\u201325\u2009g were used. The mice were divided in four groups: the control group, the sham-operated group, the vehicle group, and the COG1410-treated group. The control group comprised native mice.\n\nExperimental TBI: CCI\nThe method for creating the experimental CCI used in this study has been described previously.\n4\nBriefly, the mice were anesthetized with 3.5% chloral hydrate (500\u2009mg/kg), shaved, and placed in a stereotaxic frame. Using sterile techniques, a midline incision was made, and the scalp was reflected to expose the skull. A 3\u2009mm right lateral craniotomy was performed with a motorized drill that was centered at 2.7\u2009mm lateral from the midline and 3\u2009mm anterior to lambda to allow the removal of bone without disrupting the dura. An impactor with a 2.0\u2009mm diameter rod tip was driven at a velocity of 3\u2009m/sec with a dwell time of 100\u2009ms and an impact depth of 1.0\u2009mm, which produced a moderate contusion in the right cortex causing pronounced behavioral deficits, but no mortality. After injury, a polyvinylidene fluoride skull cap was secured over the craniotomy, and the skin incision was sutured. The anesthetized mice were wrapped in a blanket (37\u00b0C) until they recovered, and were able to freely ambulate.\n\nAdministration of COG1410\nCOG1410 was provided by Cognosci (Research Triangle Park, NC) at a purity of 95% and was dissolved in a sterile 0.9% saline solution at a concentration of 0.1\u2009mg/mL before administration. The mice were randomly divided into two groups: the COG1410-treated group received COG1410 (1\u2009mg/kg), and the control group received 0.9% saline vehicle. COG1410 or vehicle was administered within 30\u2009min of injury and then every 24\u2009h via tail vein infusion.\n\nRotarod test\nMotor function, particularly vestibulomotor function, was evaluated by a rotarod test (TME, Chengdu, China) according to Hamm and coworkers.\n19\n,\n20\nBriefly, the day before injury, the mice underwent two consecutive conditioning trials at a constant rotational speed of 16\u2009rpm for 1\u2009min (interval\u2009=\u20095\u2009min), followed by three additional trials with an accelerating rotational speed (starting at 0\u2009rpm and accelerating by 3\u2009rpm every 10\u2009sec until the rotating speed reached 30\u2009rpm). The average time to fall from the rotating cylinder in the latter three trials was recorded as the baseline of latency. At 1, 3, and 7 days after injury, the mice underwent three consecutive accelerating tests as described (interval\u2009=\u200915\u2009min). The average time to fall from the rotating cylinder was recorded as the result of the rotarod test.\n\nBBB permeability\nEvans blue (EB) dye was used to measure the permeability of the BBB according to Kaya.\n21\nBriefly, the mice were euthanized at 1, 3, or 7 days after injury. The cerebellum and olfactory brain were removed, and the injured right hemisphere was mechanically homogenized using formamide at a ratio of 1\u2009g tissue to 2\u2009mL formamide. The solution was warmed to 50\u00b0C for 72\u2009h. The extract was ultracentrifuged (Thermo, USA) at a speed of 60,000\u2009rpm for 45\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. Absorbance of the EB in the high speed supernatant and in the homogenates was measured at 620\u2009nm. The concentration of dye in the samples was calculated from a standard curve of EB in formamide. The ratio of EB absorbance in brain tissue in the high speed supernatant was calculated as a measure of BBB permeability.\n\nBrain water content\nThe dry-wet method was used to determine brain water content.\n22\nThe mice were euthanized at 1, 3, or 7 days after injury. The cerebellum and olfactory brain were removed, and the injured right hemisphere was weighed to assess its wet weight. The injured right hemisphere was then dried for 24\u2009h at 100\u00b0C to determine its dry weight. The brain water content was used to evaluate brain edema, which was obtained by the following calculation:\n\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\nELISA was used to measure the expression of VEGF. The mice were anesthetized with an overdose of 3.5% chloral hydrate (1000\u2009mg/kg) and then killed by decapitation. Cerebellum and olfactory brain were removed and the injured right hemisphere was weighed, then homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (1:9 weight/volume dilution in PBS, pH\u2009=\u20097.4), and centrifuged (4\u00b0C, 3,000\u2009rpm for 20\u2009min). Supernatant was diluted 10 times with sample diluent for ELISA assays. The protein content of each homogenate sample was measured with a BCA kit (Beyotime, Haimen, China). The results were normalized to total protein levels per sample.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nThe mice were deeply anesthetized with an overdose of 3.5% chloral hydrate (1000\u2009mg/kg) and perfused intracardially with ice-cold PBS (pH\u2009=\u20097.4). After the mice were killed, the brains were carefully removed, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24\u2009h, dehydrated, and embedded. Coronal sections (4\u2009\u03bc) were cut with a vibratome. The sections were dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated in a descending ethanol series. The sections were subsequently incubated in 7.5% H\n2\nO\n2\nfollowed by incubation in normal goat serum for 20\u2009min. The sections were incubated with rabbit anti-vWF (1:100, Bioss, Beijing, China) and detected with a Rat IgG ABC Kit (1:500, Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). Additional sections were incubated with rabbit anti-degraded myelin basic protein (1:1000, Millipore, Billerica, USA) primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight. Antibody binding was detected using a biotinylated secondary antibody and peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. Visualization was performed with diaminobenzidine (DAB). After being counterstained with hematoxylin for 3\u2009min, the sections were dehydrated in an ascending ethanol series and cover-slipped for microscopic viewing and quantification.\nImmunohistochemical reactions for vWF were interpreted independently by two authors using the same microscope (E200, Nikon, Japan).\n23\nThe average microvessel number of five high-power fields (\u2009\u00d7\u2009200) was recorded as the microvessel density (MVD). National Institutes of Health (NIH) ImageJ software was used to determine the ipsilateral hemisphere immunoglobulin G (IgG) staining density and the total area of IgG staining.\n24\nFor some experiments, the mice were killed and the brains were carefully removed, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24\u2009h, and equilibrated in 30% sucrose. Serial 50\u2009\u03bc thick coronal slices were cut on a freezing microtome. Silver staining was performed on a third set of sections to visualize the degenerating neuronal elements in the brain. Sections were processed with the FD NeuroSilverKit II (FD Neuro Technologies, Ellicott City, MD).\n4\nNIH ImageJ software was used to measure the optical density of silver staining.\n\nMicro-PET/CT Scan\nAn Inveon pre-clinical PET/CT scanner (Inveon MM gantry, Siemens, Germany) was used to detect cerebral glucose uptake at 1 day before injury and 1, 3, and 7 days after injury. The mice were deprived of food for 24\u2009h prior to the PET scans to ensure stable plasma glucose levels. After being anesthetized with 3.5% chloral hydrate (500\u2009mg/kg), they were injected with Fluorodeoxyglucose (\n18\nF) ([\n18\nF]FDG) through the tail vein and returned to their cages for a 30\u2009min uptake period in a dark and quiet environment (T\u2009=\u200920\u00b0C). They were then positioned in the scanning bed. Imaging started with a CT scan for attenuation correction and localization of the lesion, which was immediately followed by a PET scan.\n25\nThe cerebral glucose uptake ratio was evaluated by standardized uptake value (SUV):\nWhere C\nt\n(MBq/cc) is the decay-corrected activity concentration in the region of interest, ID (mCi) is the injected dose (the difference between prior to injection and after injection), and W\nt\n(kg) is the weight of the mice.\n26\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data were analyzed using SPSS 13.0 (Statistical Product and Service Solutions, New York, NY). The results are presented as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM) of five animals. A two way ANOVA was used to analyze the EB, brain water content, IgG staining, VEGF, MVD, silver staining and SUV-glucose data. A repeated measure was used to analyze the rotarod test data. Pearson correlation analysis was used to analyze the relationship between vestibulomotor function and glucose uptake. A\np\nvalue of <0.05 was considered to be a statistically significant difference when comparing parameters."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAdult male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (348\u2009\u00b1\u200940\u2009g, age 8\u20139 weeks, at time of surgery; Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.) were housed two per cage on a 12\u2009h light/dark cycle in a temperature- (22\u00b0C) and humidity-controlled facility and allowed standard rat chow and water\nad libitum\n. All animal care and experimental procedure complied with National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. For generation of tissue, animals were divided into two groups. Uninjured control animals received trepanation only (Sham,\nn\n=\u20095), whereas the injured animals received TBI using an LFPI model as described subsequently (TBI,\nn\n=\u20095). For selected experimental procedures, tissue was also taken from uninjured, non-surgery rats (Na\u00efve,\nn\n=\u20095). Five animals from each condition were humanely euthanized at 24\u2009h post-treatment, and tissue was processed for isolation of membrane vesicles, electron microscopy (EM), Western blot analysis, and kinome array analysis.\n\nSurgical procedure\nSurgical procedure was performed as previously described.\n22\n,\n23\nBriefly, animals were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane gas in an O\n2\ncarrier for 4\u2009min, followed by intraperitoneal injection of 100/10\u2009mg/kg mixture of ketamine/xylazine; anesthesia was maintained via ventilation with 1.5\u20133% isoflurane gas for the duration of surgery. Normothermia was maintained throughout surgery by keeping the animals on a water-jacketed heating pad. After securing the animal in a stereotaxic frame, a midline scalp incision was made and the skin and fascia reflected to expose the bregma, lambda, and sagittal sutures, as well as the lateral ridge. A 4.8\u2009mm craniectomy was trepanned over the right parietal cortex, midway between bregma and lambda, tangential to the sagittal suture. A rigid plastic injury tube (modified female Luer-lock 20G needle hub) was bonded to the skull with cyanoacrylate adhesive over the open craniectomy with the dura intact, and a stabilizing screw was placed in a burr hole drilled rostral to bregma on the ipsilateral side. The injury tube and stabilizing screw were secured with dental acrylic. The scalp was then sutured and the animal was placed in a warmed recovery cage.\n\nInduction of LFPI\nExperimental TBI was performed using a fluid percussive device (VCU Biomedical Engineering, Richmond, VA) as previously described.\n22\n,\n23\nThe device consists of a Plexiglas cylinder (60\u2009cm in length and 4.5\u2009cm in diameter) filled with sterile water. A piston is mounted on O-rings at one end and an extracranial pressure transducer (Entran Devices, Inc.) 5\u2009mm tube (internal diameter 2.6\u2009mm) ending in a male Luer-lock is fitted at the other end. The animal was anesthetized with 4% isoflurane gas for 4\u2009min, and TBI (2\u2009atm) was induced by rapidly injecting a small volume of sterile saline into the closed cranial cavity over the right ipsilateral hemisphere with the fluid percussion device. Immediately after the impact, the animal was removed from the device, monitored for duration of apnea and unconsciousness, and re-sutured while receiving supplemental oxygen ventilation. The magnitude of the pressure pulse was measured by a pressure transducer, stored on an oscilloscope, and later converted to atmospheres (atm). The pressure pulse was monitored and controlled in order to deliver an equivalent impact of 2.0\u2009atm to each animal.\nBrains were extracted and dissected as previously described, with gross anatomical markers used to divide tissue into 20 separate areas of interest, and immediately flash frozen on dry ice.\n24\nTissue was kept at \u221280\u00b0C until needed.\n\nIsolation of membrane vesicles\nThe membrane vesicle isolation protocol was adapted from previous studies utilizing human cortical tissue and optimized to yield both neuronal and glial membrane elements.\n25\nFrozen cortical tissue (150\u2013200\u2009mg) from the area of injury or the ipsilateral hippocampus (HPC) was transferred to 5\u2009mL of ice-cold HEPES-buffered sucrose solution (HBSS) at pH 7.4 in a glass homogenizer (Kontes Glass Co, #21, Vineland, NJ) and dounced (15 strokes). The homogenate was transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and spun at 800\ng\n(3000\u2009rpm) for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was transferred to new microcentrifuge tubes and spun at 10,000\ng\nfor 15\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 2\u2009mL of HBSS and layered onto 3\u2009mL of 1.2\u2009M sucrose in a swinging bucket rotor (Beckman Coulter, SW60Ti, Pasadena, CA) and spun at 230,000\ng\n, 45\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. The band above the sucrose gradient (supernatant) was collected and placed in 1.5\u2009mL of either standard glutamate uptake buffer (NaCl, 144\u2009mM; KCl, 2.5\u2009mM; CaCl2, 1.2\u2009mM; MgCl2, 1.2\u2009mM; K2HPO4, 1.3\u2009mM; glucose, 10mM; HEPES, 10\u2009mM; and Tris, 5\u2009mM), or a sodium-free glutamate uptake buffer with choline chloride (144\u2009mM) substituted for sodium chloride. The supernatant was then pipetted onto a 2.5\u2009mL column of 0.8\u2009M sucrose and spun at 230,\n000g\n, 45\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. The pellet was collected and suspended in 100\u2009\u03bcL of glutamate uptake buffer with or without sodium. Total protein concentration was determined for each sample with a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay.\n\n[\n3\nH]-glutamate uptake\nSample tubes were prepared with 20\u2009\u03bcg of re-suspended synaptosomes, and placed into tubes containing either standard glutamate uptake buffer at 37\u00b0C (37\u00b0,\nn\n=\u20095), standard glutamate uptake buffer at 0\u00b0C (0\u00b0,\nn\n=\u20095), Na\n+\n-free glutamate uptake buffer at 37\u00b0C (Na\n+\n,\nn\n=\u20095), or standard glutamate uptake buffer with added 5\u2009M L-\ntrans\n-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid at 37\u00b0C (PDC) (\nn\n=\u20095). The tubes were then pre-incubated for 30\u2009min at their respective temperatures. Following incubation, 10\u03bcM of unlabeled glutamic acid and 2\u2009\u03bcCi of [H\n3\n]-glutamate (Perkin Elmer Inc., Walther, MA) were then added to the samples for 10\u2009min, with a final volume of each tube reaching 500\u2009\u03bcL. The synaptosomal solution was then filtered through a cell harvester (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD) with 0.9% cold saline solution and trapped on Whatman GF/C filters (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). The filters were then collected into scintillation vials, suspended in 5\u2009mL of Ultima-Gold\n\u2122\nscintillation fluid (Perkin Elmer Inc., Waltham, MA) and counted on a scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter, LS 6500, Pasadena, CA).\n\nWestern blot analysis\nTen micrograms of total protein in 17\u2009uL sample buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were loaded into a pre-cast sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel with a 4\u201315% gradient (Mini-PROTEAN\n\u00ae\nTGX\u2122 Bio-rad, Hercules, CA) and run at 180\u2009V for 1\u2009h, then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Bio-rad) at 16\u2009V for 30\u2009min. Membranes were blocked overnight in blocking buffer (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE) and then incubated in primary antibodies (Abs; guinea-pig anti-GLT-1, AB1783 Millipore, Billerica, MA, dilution 1:5000; mouse anti-valosin-containing protein, AB11433 Abcam, Cambridge, MA, dilution 1:2500; rabbit anti-synaptophysin, AB23745 Abcam, dilution 1:50000) overnight at 4\u00b0C and then washed three times with tris-buffered saline (TBS). Near-infrared secondary antibodies were used at 1:5000, and blots were imaged on a Li-Cor Odyssey Imager as previously described.\n26\nWe tested our Western blot assays using varying concentrations of total protein of rat brain tissue homogenate. These control studies demonstrated that our assays were linear for the protein concentrations used in our Western blot studies.\n\nEM\nSynaptosomal fragments were fixed in 1/2 Karnovsky fixative (2.5% paraformaldehyde and 2.0% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M Cacodylate buffer) and then post- fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1M Caco buffer. Samples were then dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, and infiltrated and embedded in Embed 812 resin. Following embedding, ultrathin sections were collected on copper mesh grids, post-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined using an FEI Tecnai T-12 electron microscope. All imaging was performed at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Electron Microscopy Core (Birmingham, AL).\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical tests were done with Prism version 6 (GraphPad Software Inc.). Data were tested for normality of distribution, and differences between conditions were assessed using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or\nt\ntest, as appropriate. Post-hoc analysis was performed with Tukey's multiple comparison test when necessary. For all tests \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05. All data are reported as mean value \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM).\n\nKinome array profiling\nProfiling of serine-threonine kinome (STK) activity was performed using the PamStation12 microarray (PamGene International) and STK PamChips containing 144 consensus phosphopeptide sequences per well (4 of which are internal controls), immobilized on porous ceramic membranes. Each PamChip well was blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) before 2\u2009\u03bcg of protein in the manufacturer's kinase buffer (PamGene), 157\u2009\u03bcM adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and FITC-labeled anti-phospho Ser/Thr antibodies (PamGene) were added in each well. The homogenized samples containing the active kinases and assay mix were pumped through the wells to facilitate interaction between kinases in the sample and specific peptide substrates immobilized on the chip. The degree of phosphorylation per well was measured in real time using Evolve (PamGene) kinetic image capture software. The software captures FITC-labeled anti-phospho antibodies binding to each phosphorylated peptide substrate every 6\u2009sec for 90\u2009min.\n27\nPrimary analyses were performed from integrated exposure times for each spot (10\u2009ms, 20\u2009ms, 50\u2009ms, 100\u2009ms, and 200\u2009ms) using steady state as quality control. Integrated spot intensities with the 99th percentile were used to calculate a minimal positive shift, and data were log2 transformed. These log-transformed spot intensities are the \u201csignal\u201d for each peptide. The signal intensities for each peptide were analyzed using BioNavigator 5.2 Software (PamGene).\n27\nRodent brain samples evaluated here using the array are comparable to previous data acquired by us in human samples.\n28\nA control array was run without the addition of ATP to identify nonspecific binding of labeled antibody to the array substrate (data not shown). Peptides with significant background signal in the -ATP condition (higher than the +ATP condition) were excluded from further analysis. Four peptide probes were excluded based on these criteria. Peptide probes for which signal was not detected in the +ATP condition were also excluded from analyses. Three additional peptides were excluded under this criterion, leaving a total of 133 peptide substrates.\nSignal intensity data for each peptide (excluding the four control peptide substrates, three peptide substrates for whom kinase activity could not be detected, and four peptides with nonspecific activity) for all rodent samples was tested for outliers (\u00b1 2.5 SD from the mean), which were eliminated from our analyses. Comparisons for each peptide substrate were made using the mean values for each substrate for LFPI (\nn\n=\u20095) and Sham (\nn\n=\u20095) animals. The ratio of the means was used to calculate fold change for each peptide. Peptides with a fold change \u00b11.15 were considered significant for further analysis.\n\nIdentification of upstream kinases\nUsing Kinexus Phosphonet (Kinexus Bioinformatics) and GPS 2.1 prediction algorithms, we identified protein kinases acting on phosphorylation sites within the array peptide sequences.\n29\n,\n30\nThese programs provide ranked predictions for serine-threonine kinases targeting putative phosphorylation sites in the peptide sequence. The top three kinases predicted by Kinexus and kinases with scores more than twice the prediction threshold for each phosphorylation site were included as predicted kinase \u201chits\u201d for TBI-altered substrates. We then calculated the frequency of each kinase for the cortical and hippocampal data sets.\n\nRandom sampling analyses\nTo determine which upstream kinases are most likely to be important in the signaling network in acute TBI based on our kinome array data, we performed a random sampling analysis.\n31\n,\n32\nWe generated data sets (\nn\n=\u20092000) where each data point includes randomly selected reporter peptide substrates from the kinome array. Each data point in the analyses of frontal cortex included 25 substrates, matching the number of substrates with LFP-induced changes in kinase activity in the cortex. Each data point in the analysis of the HPC included 19 substrates, matching the number of substrates with LFP-induced changes in kinase activity in HPC. Using Kinexus PhosphoNet and GPS 2.1 prediction algorithms, we identified kinases predicted to target each phosphorylation site on every array substrate, and then calculated the frequency of each kinase for all 2000 data points in cortical and hippocampal data sets. From these data we generated an \u201cexpected\u201d distribution for each protein kinase. Means and standard deviations were calculated for each expected distribution. Kinases in the LFP data points with observed frequencies falling outside two standard deviations from the expected mean (derived from randomly generated data points) were carried forward into our network analyses.\n\nSignaling network modeling\nKinases implicated by the random sampling analyses were used to create a model TBI signaling network. We generated a network model that 1) represents the number of direct interactions between protein kinase \u201chits\u201d identified from our random sampling analyses, and 2) also represents other protein kinases in the Ingenuity Pathway database that have direct interactions with the these protein kinase \u201chits.\u201d\n33\nFor the second group, we restricted the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) grow tool to \u201ckinases\u201d and \u201cdirect interactions\u201d and used the connect tool to create a kinase network.\n33\nThe resulting output was refined by removing kinases with fewer than two connections to the emerging network. Because signaling networks may be amplified or muted based on the number of interactions between kinases, we weighted our model based on the number of interactions found for each kinase in the network.\n\nIPA\nThe resulting TBI kinase network was further analyzed using IPA, as previously described, for associated upstream regulating factors and physiological functions.\n28\n\nExploratory kinome array studies.\nFor the inhibitor studies, 10\u2009ug protein from each of the LFPI (\nn\n=\u20095) and Sham (\nn\n=\u20095) rodents were pooled to make a single pooled TBI sample and a single pooled Sham sample. Each sample was evaluated with the kinome array as previously described in the presence and absence of specific inhibitors for protein kinase B (Akt; Calbiochem 124005), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK; SP600125, Calbiochem), and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK; D-erythro-sphingosine N-hexanoyl, Calbiochem) plus protein kinase C (PKC; Bisindoylmaleimide Hydrochloride, Cell Signaling) at a final concentration of 150\u2009uM.\n28\nPKC and MEK were combined because of limited space on the array plate (and we chose to prioritize Akt and JNK in this study for theoretical reasons). The ratio of kinase activity in the inhibitor/no inhibitor samples for each peptide substrate was used to calculate fold change data. Difference in fold change was calculated as follows: [(LFPI with inhibitor)/ (LFPI without inhibitor)] \u2013[(Sham with inhibitor)/(Sham without inhibitor)]. Only protein substrates from the kinome array with detectable signal in Sham and LFPI samples were included in the inhibitor study analyses."

A grid was laid over each image to sample myelinated axons and to measure their minimum and maximum diameters. Mean myelinated axon diameter was calculated. To estimate the total number of myelinated axons in each root, the number of axons in the sampled areas was scaled according to the total root area. The percentage of large diameter myelinated axons (\u2265 7\u2009\u03bcm) measured from each root also was scaled to the total root area to give an estimate of the motoneuron count (\nFig. 1B\n), since these large diameter axons typically arise from spinal motoneurons and innervate skeletal muscle.\n29\n,\n30\nSince the injury level differed across cases (\nTable 1\n), data were compared relative to the lesion epicenter (E). Levels above and below the epicenter were given positive and negative numbers, respectively (e.g. E1, one level above the epicenter; E-1, one level below the epicenter).\nThe accuracy of the motoneuron estimates was verified in two ways. First, the indirect estimates were compared with direct counts of all of the myelinated axons in one C7 and one C8 ventral root. Initially, the indirect method gave a low estimate of the actual number of myelinated axons in the C7 root (81% of the direct count after one sample;\nFig. 1C\n). However, with additional sampling, the indirect counts approached the direct counts and were within 5% of each other after 9% and 10% of the myelinated axons had been sampled in the respective roots (C7: 9038\u2009\u00b1\u2009247 vs. 9160 and C8: 7154\u2009\u00b1\u200996 vs. 7537, respectively). Our values also were close to the data reported by Ingbert\n31\nand Coggeshall and colleagues\n32\n(C7: 8913 and 8317 fibers and C8: 8435 and 7687 fibers, respectively;\nFig. 1D\n), and show how many axons had to be measured per root to provide representative counts. Here, 30\u2009\u00b1\u20092% of the myelinated axons were measured per root, almost three times the number required. Second, motoneurons were counted bilaterally in six spinal cord segments (C7, C8, T1, T4, L2, L3; two to five sections per segment) from five uninjured spinal cords (cases 1\u20135;\nTable 1\n). Motoneuron counts were comparable for each side of the cord (\np\n=\u20090.46, paired\nt\n-test) so data were pooled to calculate a mean count per section. The mean count per segment was calculated then normalized to the data from the segment with the highest mean motoneuron count. The ventral root counts for the corresponding spinal segments were normalized similarly, and the two datasets compared to examine whether both approaches showed high counts for cervical and lumbar spinal cord segments and reduced counts for thoracic segments.\nVentral root sections from seven cases were viewed for myelin abnormalities. To quantify the thin myelin associated with some large diameter axons, the g ratio (axon diameter/fiber diameter, a measure of myelin thickness) was calculated from axon and fiber (axon and myelin) diameter measurements made for all of the axons sampled from eight ventral roots from cases 10 and 11 (three roots at the lesion epicenter, E; one root three levels above the lesion, E3; two roots four levels above the lesion, E4; and two roots five levels above the lesion, E5).\n\nStatistics\nMean (\u00b1 standard error [SE]) are given unless stated. A two-way repeated measures analysis of variance was used to assess whether the number of motoneurons differed by group (SCI, Uninjured) and spinal level relative to the epicenter, and if the g ratio differed by location relative to the injury (above lesion, epicenter) and axon diameter (1\u03bcm bins). Motoneuron and ventral root counts in uninjured cords were compared using a paired\nt\n-test. Statistical significance was\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "A cohort of 5597 high school student athletes from Maine completed baseline preseason testing on two occasions between 2009\u20132013. Baseline computerized neurocognitive testing was performed using the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT\u00ae) instrument as part of a statewide concussion initiative sponsored at the time by the Maine Concussion Management Initiative at Colby College. Students between the ages of 13 and 18 who completed a second baseline between 90 days and 3 years were included in the analyses. A total of 4992 students met this criterion. Of the sample, 200 had missing data regarding the number of concussion at either the first or second baseline (i.e., 4% of the data), resulting in a final sample of 4792. The average duration between the two baselines was 20.7 months (median\u2009=\u200923.9; standard deviation [SD]\u2009=\u20097.0; interquartile range\u2009=\u200912.6\u201324.5).\n\nAs part of ImPACT, students are asked to self-report number of prior concussions, problems with attention deficit disorder/ADHD, diagnosis of a learning disability, repeating one or more years in school, and whether they attended special education classes. The database also included information regarding whether students had completed post-injury testing between the two baselines. We examined the percentages of student athletes who reported the same, more, or fewer lifetime concussions between the two baseline assessments. We could not independently verify self-reported concussions; therefore, we defined inconsistent concussion history as a decrease in the number of lifetime concussions reported at repeat testing, compared with at baseline. We further examined consistency in concussion reporting by examining a subgroup of students who had sustained an injury and completed a post-injury assessment during the interval between their two baseline evaluations (n=\u2009587). This was done to examine an increase in the number of self-reported concussions from the first to second baseline, which may be due to the athlete sustaining a new injury. The frequency of athletes with inconsistent concussion history was computed and analyzed using chi-square tests. The association between inconsistent reporting and baseline number of concussions was examined using a Spearman correlation because of violations of assumption of normality."

Animals were randomly assigned to sham (\nn\n=\u200930) or CCI groups (\nn\n=\u200938). Experimenters blind to group assignment analyzed all molecular assays and behavioral tests. All work was conducted in accord with the National Institutes of Health Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines.\n\nControlled cortical impact\nA unilateral CCI was administered over the forelimb area of the sensorimotor cortex (FL-SMC), as described previously.\n11\n,\n12\nBriefly, rats were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (100\u2009mg/10\u2009mg/kg intraperitoneally), a 4-mm craniotomy was created, centered over the FL-SMC (0.5\u2009mm anterior and 4\u2009mm lateral to bregma), then a CCI was induced with a 3-mm-diameter impact tip angled 18 degrees away from the vertical (Benchmark Stereotaxic Impactor; Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL), depressing the brain at 1.7 dorsoventral, at 3.0\u2009m/s for 300\u2009ms. The craniotomy was then covered with gel film and dental acrylic before incision suturing. Sham animals received all procedures up to, but not including, the craniotomy, because skull removal produces behavioral and neurochemical asymmetries.\n13\n\nMotor behavior assessment: ladder task\nThe ladder task was used to assess coordinated forelimb use, stepping accuracy, and limb placement.\n11\n,\n14\nAnimals were video recorded as they walked across a ladder (1\u2009m long, 3\u2009mm diameter metal pegs, spaced 1\u2009cm apart and raised 20\u2009cm from the table top). Three trials per test day were collected, and by slow motion playback, the number of total steps and the number of errors were recorded. Errors were counted when a rat's forelimb completely missed a rung and fell through rungs (score of 0), was placed on rung but when weight bearing the limb fell between rungs (score of 1), or slipped off rung (score of 2).

    "Methods": "Study population\nA total of 34 TBI subjects enrolled in the COBRIT at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center were included in the study. All participants or their legally authorized representatives (LAR) gave informed consent for the use of the participant's blood samples and clinical data in TBI research. If an LAR provided consent originally, the participant directly provided consent for continued involvement upon recovery of decision-making capacity. Baseline CT scans, vital signs, medical history, demographics, and injury information were obtained and recorded as described elsewhere.\n29\nNon-fasting blood samples were collected from COBRIT participants within 24\u2009h of injury and again at 30 and 90 days after injury. Blood was collected into plastic dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes, immediately placed on ice, centrifuged (15\u2009min, 2000\ng\n, room temperature) and frozen in aliquots within 1\u2009h after collection. Samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until tested.\nBlood samples of controls without TBI were processed and stored identically. One set of control samples (\nn\n=\u200919) was collected at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center under a clinical protocol designed to recruit healthy individuals. All research participants signed informed consent before participating in the study. TBI was excluded by questionnaire, as well as severe psychiatric conditions, congestive heart failure, active cancer, sleep disorder, pregnancy or lactation in women, uncontrolled diabetes, drug and/or addiction abuse or dependence, and medication with diuretics, beta blockers, or narcotics. A second set of control samples (\nn\n=\u200950) was purchased from a commercially available source (Bioreclamation) when controls were screened by a questionnaire and were determined to be free from hepatitis B and C and from HIV infections. There was no difference in age, race, or gender distribution between the two sets of controls. There were no significant differences in biomarker levels between the two sources of control samples. There was no gender difference in biomarkers levels in the TBI or the control group.\n\nImmunoassays\nGFAP, tau, and A\u03b242 concentrations in plasma samples were measured with a digital array technology (Quanterix Corporation, Lexington, MA), which uses a single-molecule enzyme-linked immunoarray method previously described.\n30\nSimoa\n25\nis a novel technology that employs highly sensitive immunoassays with LLOD \u2264100\u2009fg/mL. The lowest limit of quantification (LLOQ), LLOD, intra-assay coefficient of variation (%CV) and inter assay %CV for GFAP, tau, and A\u03b242 measured by Simoa are shown in\nTable 1\n.\nTable\n1.\nThe Lowest Limit of Quantification (LLOQ) and the Lowest Limit of Determination (LLOD), Intra-assay Coefficient of Variation (%CV), and Inter-assay %CV for Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP), Tau and A\n\u03b242\nMeasured by Simoa\nAssays\nLLOD\na\n, pg/mL\nLLOQ\na\n, pg/mL\nIntra-assay %CV\nInter-assay %CV\nGFAP\n0.8\n1.6\n14%\n12%\nTau\n0.068\n0.104\n6%\n5%\nA\u03b242\n0.176\n0.548\n14%\n2%\nOpen in a separate window\na\nValues are corrected for pre-dilutions (4\u2009\u00d7\u2009).\nEach plate of samples tested included an eight point calibration curve (run in triplicate), two controls (run in duplicate), and plasma samples (run in duplicate) with the tau, GFAP, and A\u03b242 assays. Samples were diluted offline manually using appropriate sample diluents and preferred dilution factors according to the product inserts for each assay following the recommended procedures. The laboratory scientists who undertook the analyses were blinded to the participant groups, and there was no difference in the distribution of cases and controls on the Simoa plates. Data analysis showed that 14% of GFAP of TBI and 70% of control samples were below LLOD. However, only 1 out of 34 of TBI samples was below LLOD on Day 0. Importantly, all data for tau and A\u03b242 in controls and in TBI subjects were above the LLODs.\n\nEvaluation of CT scans\nAll patients underwent CT imaging of the brain at the time of initial presentation to the Emergency Department (ED). Each patient's head CT was characterized using the recommendation of the TBI \u2013 Common Data Element (CDE) Neuroimaging working group including Marshall Grade.\n31\nEach CT was de-identified, and reviewed by a blinded reader, who had been qualified to read CT CDEs through use of a training and evaluation set. Imaging features were extracted in the database for the analysis.\n\nOutcomes\nThe primary outcome measure of COBRIT was the 180 day Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended score (GOSE).\n32\nThe GOSE provides eight categories of outcome (1\u20138): Dead, Vegetative State, Lower Severe Disability, Upper Severe Disability, Lower Moderate Disability, Upper Moderate Disability, Lower Good Recovery, and Upper Good Recovery. Ratings are based on patient consciousness, social relationships, and other sequela of TBI. An Upper Good Recovery score (8) indicates return to pre-injury baseline with no residual effects from the TBI.\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics with means and proportions were used to describe categorical variables. Biomarker levels were treated as continuous data. The Shapiro\u2013Wilk test was used for testing normality of the distribution. The Wilcoxon rank test or the Mann\u2013Whitney test was used for continuous variables. Intracranial lesions shown on initial CT scans were scored and analyzed as categorical variables. We assessed the ability of each biomarker level to separate patients with complicated mild TBI (cmTBI) from controls. This was quantified by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and AUC. In line with current statistical consensus, AUC of 0.8\u20130.9 is considered very good, AUC of 0.7\u20130.8 is considered adequate, and AUC <0.07 is considered poor. Spearman correlation and linear regression were used to test the association of variables. The Friedman test was used in a subgroup of patents for whom data at all three time points were available, to compare paired biomarker levels. Discriminant component analysis (DCA) was used to discriminate cmTBI from controls. Results with two tailed\np\n<\u20090.05 were considered significant.\nP\nvalues were not corrected for multiple comparisons. Statistical analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism (v. 6.02) (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, CA) or with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences SPSS (version 22, IBM Corporation)."

    "Methods": "Fluid percussion brain injury\nAdult male Sprague-Dawley rats (300\u2013350\u2009g; Harlan Laboratories Inc., Indianapolis, IN) were allowed access to food and water\nad libitum\n, with all experiments and animal care conducted in accord with National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee\u2013approved protocol. Rats were subjected to midline FPI, as previously described.\n21\n,\n22\nRats were anesthetized (5% isoflurane), transferred to a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA), maintained at 2% isoflurane, and 37\u00b0C body temperature monitored and maintained throughout the procedure. The skull was exposed and a 4.8-mm circular craniectomy was performed (centered on the sagittal suture midway between bregma and lambda) without disturbing the dura or superior sagittal sinus. A skull screw was secured into the right frontal bone. An injury hub was fabricated from the female portion of a Leur-Loc needle hub and affixed over the craniectomy using cyanoacrylate gel and methylmethacrylate (Hygenic Corp., Akron, OH). The incision was sutured at the anterior and posterior edges, and rats were then returned to a warmed holding cage until ambulation returned.\nApproximately 60\u201390\u2009min after the conclusion of the surgical procedure, animals were reanesthetized (5% isoflurane). The female end of the injury hub assembly was filled with physiological saline and attached to the male end of the fluid percussion device (Custom Design and Fabrication; Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA). Upon the return of the pedal withdrawal reflex, an injury of moderate severity (1.8\u20132.0 atmospheres) was administered by releasing the pendulum onto the fluid-filled piston. Sham animals were connected to the FPI device, but the pendulum was not released. Afterward, the injury hub assembly was removed\nen bloc\n, the craniotomy was inspected, and the incision was sutured. Animals were monitored for the fencing response upon impact,\n21\nchanges in respiration, and the return of the righting reflex. A moderate-severity brain injury was determined by recovery of a righting reflex in 5\u201310\u2009min. Sham-injured animals recovered within 15\u2009sec.\n\nGolgi stain\nAt post-injury day (PID) 1, 7, and 28, sham and brain-injured rats (\nn\n=\u20094/group) were overdosed with sodium pentabarbitol (200\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneally), decapitated, and the brain rapidly removed. At least 1 sham-operated animal was euthanized at each PID time point. The brain was processed for Golgi staining according to the manufacturer's instructions for the FD Rapid GolgiStain\u2122 Kit (FD NeuroTechnologies, Inc., Columbia, MD). Brains were sectioned (200\u2009\u03bcm) at \u221222\u00b0C on a cryostat and mounted on slides. Neurons were selected using the following criteria: 1) cell body and dendrites were fully impregnated and untruncated; 2) cell was relatively isolated; 3) within the BLA, and 4) identified as stellate or pyramidal subtype. Because of the low number of fully stained cells, all BLA and pyramidal and stellate neurons that matched these criteria were included in the quantification and analysis. Stellate neurons expressed round somas, with spiny dendrites radiating outward in all directions (\nFig. 1\n). Pyramidal neurons expressed triangular-like somas with a prominent apical dendrite that arose from the superficial pole of the cell body and several thinner basal dendrites on the opposite side (\nFig. 1\n). Neurons were traced at 320\u2009\u00d7\u2009using a camera lucida drawing tube attached to an Olympus BX51 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and quantified by Sholl analysis.\n25\n,\n26\nDendritic intersections were quantified at equidistant concentric circles in 20-\u03bcm increments from the soma. Number of cells/rat ranged from 4 to 9 for stellate neurons and 4 to 8 for pyramidal neurons. A Sholl analysis comparing sham animals confirmed there was no significant difference between animals, and the shams were combined into one sham cohort. Data were averaged across same cell types within each animal and analyzed across animals for each experimental group and cell type.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExperimental methods.

As described by Lifshitz and Lisembee,\n27\nrats were prepared using NeuroScience Associates Inc. (Knoxville, TN) instructions. Brains were shipped to NeuroScience Associates to be embedded into a single gelatin block (Multiblock\n\u00ae\nTechnology; NeuroScience Associates), cryosectioned, mounted, and stained with the de Olmos aminocupric silver staining technique, and counterstained with Neutral Red, in accord to proprietary protocols.\nStained sections were analyzed in our laboratory.\n27\nPhotomicrographs of silver stained BLA from both hemispheres were taken using a Zeiss microscope (Imager A2; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) in bright-field mode with a digital camera. Densitometric quantitative analysis was performed at 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009using ImageJ software (1.48v; NIH, Bethesda, MD). Grayscale digital images were digitally thresholded to separate positive stained pixels from unstained pixels, then segmented into black and white pixels, indicative of positive and negative staining, respectively. The percentage of argyrophilic (black) stained pixels was calculated for each image using the following formula:\n[count/total area measured]\u2009\u00d7\u2009100\u2009=\u2009percentage area stained black\n; where\ncount\nis the total number of black pixels. Eight images were analyzed per animal, with the percentage of black pixels averaged to a single value (per animal) and used in data analysis.\n\nGlial fibrillary acidic protein\nAt PID1, 7, and 28, sham and brain-injured rats were overdosed with sodium pentabarbitol and transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 4% paraformaldehyde (n\u2009=\u20094\u20136/time point; at least 1 sham at each time point). Brains were immersed in serial sucrose dilutions (15%, 30%) and cryosectioned (20\u2009\u03bcm). Sections were washed 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009with 1XPBS, blocked with 4% (v/v) normal horse serum in PBS for 1\u2009h, incubated in the primary antibody (rabbit anti-GFAP, 1:1000; catalog no.: Z0334; Dako, Carpinteria, CA) overnight at room temperature, rinsed in 1XPBS, incubated for 1\u2009h at room temperature with the secondary antibody (biotinylated horse anti-rabbit, 1:250; catalog no.: BA-1100; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), washed, blocked with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide, incubated with avadin/biotin complex (4\u00b0C, 20\u2009min), washed, and incubated with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (10\u2009min). Sections were dehydrated with ethanol, cleared in CitriSolv, and cover-slipped using distyrene plasticizer xylene. Densitometric quantitative analysis was performed identical to silver stain.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software (v.22; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) using a Macintosh computer (OSX 10.9.5). Dendritic complexity was analyzed by a mixed-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) for treatment condition (sham, PID1, PID7, and PID28) across the distances from the soma. GFAP and silver stain was analyzed by one-way ANOVA for time post-injury. When statistical significance was reached at\np\n<\u20090.05, least significant differences (LSD) post-hoc analyses were performed and described where indicated."

    "Methods": "Patient population\nThe multicenter validation cohort comprised patients treated at three pediatric Level I trauma centers: Monroe Carell Children's Hospital (MCCH), Nashville, Tennessee; St. Louis Children's Hospital (STLCH), St. Louis, Missouri; and Texas Children's Hospital (TCH), Houston, Texas. Like the training cohort at the University of Utah/Primary Children's Hospital (PCH), the retrospective validation cohort included all pediatric patients who underwent CTA of the head or neck for suspected BCVI during the 11-year study period (January 1, 2003\u2013December 31, 2013). Multi-institutional Institutional Review Board approval was obtained.\nCT scanning across centers was uniform. The proprietary brand of CT scanners used in the study varied from institution to institution, but the overall scanning protocol and technique were similar, using either a 64- or 320-slice scanner with 1-mm slice thickness with intravenous contrast infusion with Isovue 370 or Omni 300.\n\nData collection\nAt each center, the trauma and radiology databases were queried to identify trauma patients screened for BCVI with CTA of the head or neck. Mechanism of injury was categorized as either motor vehicle accident, pedestrian versus vehicle, >1-story fall, nonaccidental trauma, or other. Clinical information included initial GCS on neurosurgical evaluation, presence of focal neurological deficits on initial examination, and mode of treatment for TBI (medical vs. surgical). Radiological variables included presence of petrous temporal bone fracture or fracture through the carotid canal as defined in the original article.\n14\nWe abstracted any concomitant intracranial injury (epidural, subdural, or subarachnoid hemorrhage), presence of hypodensity on CT imaging consistent with ischemia, Rotterdam score\n15\n(a 6-point score based on noncontrast CT findings that predicts 6-month mortality in moderate and severe TBI),\n16\nand CTA radiation dose. We recorded whether dedicated cervical spine imaging was performed, and if so, the modality, cervical spine injury type, level of injury, and fracture through the foramen transversarium. We also recorded discharge disposition (home vs. other).\nThe primary outcome of interest, BCVI, was indicated by the presence of internal carotid artery or vertebral artery injury and grade of injury diagnosed by CTA. Each injury was classified according to the Denver grading scale for BCVI.\n17\nGrade 1 injury is characterized by intimal irregularity with <25% narrowing, Grade 2 injury is a dissection or presence of intramural hematoma with >25% narrowing, Grade 3 injury is the presence of a pseudoaneurysm, Grade 4 injury is an occlusion, and Grade 5 injury is transection with extravasation.\n17\n\nStatistical analysis\nStudy data were collected and managed using REDCap hosted at the University of Utah.\n18\nAll data analysis was performed in a de-identified manner at the lead site.\nData were summarized using means and standard deviations (SDs) for continuous variables and counts and frequencies for categorical variables. The demographic, clinical, and radiographic variables were compared among centers using an analysis of variance for continuous variables and \u03c7\n2\nfor categorical variables.\nThe validation analysis began by scoring each patient in the validation cohort using the Utah Score (\nn\n=\u2009411). After scoring, patients were classified as high (score \u22653) or low (score \u22642) risk. The score was split into two categories for two reasons: first, the risk of BCVI based on patient score was clearly dichotomized based on statistics alone (score of 2\u2009=\u20096.7% probability of BCVI vs. score of 3\u2009=\u200932.4% probability of BCVI;\nTable 2\n), and second, a dichotomized score would be most helpful in making a binary clinical decision during the initial trauma evaluation: to screen the patient or not. Patients were categorized in a 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 table assessing risk versus the presence/absence of BCVI. This comparison was analyzed using the Fisher exact test. We calculated percent misclassification, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Before the study, validation was defined as a misclassification rate of <25%.\n19\nA logistic regression model was developed for the Utah Score risk categorization and its association with BCVI. Using this model, we calculated the area under the curve or discrimination for the dichotomized Utah Score.\nIn a Bayesian analysis, we applied likelihood ratios from the original model (training cohort at PCH)\n14\nto the validation cohort to compute the post-test probability for the high- and low-risk dichotomizations for the Utah Score and compare with the actual or observed probabilities found in the validation cohort. Data were analyzed using SAS v.9.3 software.\nTo compare our pediatric Utah Score with previous models based on adult trauma data, we applied the Denver criteria (prediction model) to our entire cohort of pediatric patients (\nn\n=\u2009645). The Denver criteria for screening for BCVI in adults include GCS <6, petrous temporal bone fracture, diffuse axonal injury, and LeFort Type II and III fractures for carotid artery injury and cervical spine for vertebral artery injury.\n10\nWe calculated the observed probabilities within each of the Denver strata (0\u20134) by scoring each child within the entire cohort (\nn\n=\u2009645). We had not specifically collected diffuse axonal injury as a variable and used intracranial contusions as a proxy. Our observed percentages were directly compared with the predicted probabilities from Biffl and associates.\n10\nMore recent modifications to the Denver criteria suggest additional risk factors, but these were added via a descriptive nonanalytical method without presenting quantifiable risk prediction, which was included in the original article.\n20\nTherefore, meaningful comparisons of risk prediction were only possible with the data and analysis presented in that article."
