    "Methods": "Study design and setting\nThis retrospective multi-center observational cohort study included adults (\u226515 years) with moderate-to-severe TBI treated in an intensive care unit at two neurosurgical centers in Sweden between 2006 and 2021 (Center 1) or between 2008 and 2018 (Center 2). Moderate-to-severe TBI was defined as a Glasgow Coma Scale\n13\n(GCS) score of 3\u201313 on hospital admission. The study hospitals are the only neurosurgical centers in their regions and serve a combined population of 4,500,000 (43% of the Swedish population). Patients were excluded if they did not show any contusions, follow-up data were missing, primary treatment was initiated at another hospital, injury was penetrating, the first computed tomography (CT) scan was conducted >12\u2009h post-injury, there was absence of a second CT scan, or if they underwent contusion evacuation before a second CT scan was performed. Both centers generally adhere to the guidelines established by the Brain Trauma Foundation,\n14\nwhere unconscious patients are mechanically ventilated and intracranial pressure is monitored.\nThe study was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (Center 1 Dnr: 2019-04476, Center 2 Dnr: 2022-06526-02). Informed consent was not required for Center 1. In Center 2, written informed consent was obtained from most patients or their relatives during treatment or follow-up, but the requirement was waived if the patient or relatives could no longer be contacted.\n\nOutcome and exposure\nThe primary outcome was the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS),\n15\nassessed at a median of 8.0 months (interquartile range [IQR] 6.0\u201312) after injury, and subsequently dichotomized into unfavorable (GOS score \u22643, representing severe disability, vegetative state, or death) or favorable (GOS score \u22654, indicating moderate disability or good recovery). The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality, evaluated at the same time point as the primary outcome.\nThe exposure of interest was CE, defined as the absolute or relative increase in contusion volume between the first and second CT scan. The second CT scan was normally conducted 6\u20138\u2009h after the initial CT scan or earlier if clinically indicated. For patients who did not have a contusion on their initial CT scan (\nn\n=\u200977), only absolute CE could be calculated. If a patient was initially admitted to another hospital and then transferred to one of our centers, the CT scan performed at the first hospital was analyzed. If multiple contusions were present, their volumes were combined.\n\nData collection and contusion volume calculation\nPatients were identified through local databases that included all those admitted to each department with a TBI. Clinical data were obtained from electronic medical records software, and imaging data were retrieved from the radiological management software Sectra Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) IDS7 (Sectra AB, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden). Dedicated research nurses prospectively collected GOS data via validated questionnaires through mail and telephone interviews. Contusion volumes were calculated using semi-automated threshold-guided planimetry, excluding the surrounding edema. In Center 1, this was performed using the IDS7 software, as previously described,\n1\nwhile the BrainLab\n\u00ae\nelements software\n16\nwas used in Center 2 (BrainLab Germany Headquarters, Munich, Germany). Each center had one assessor who was blinded to patient outcomes, but was made aware of whether the CT scan they were analyzing was the initial or follow-up one. The latter was considered essential to ensure consistent definition of hematoma boundaries across scans.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAs all continuous data deviated from a normal distribution pattern (Shapiro\u2013Wilks test\np\nvalue <0.05), we present them as median (IQR), and categorical data are presented as counts (percentages).\nTo assess the agreement between the IDS7 and BrainLab\n\u00ae\nelements methods for measuring contusion volume, we calculated intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for 30 randomly selected patients from Center 1, in whom volumes were determined by a single assessor using both methods. We employed a two-way mixed effects model based on single measurements and absolute agreement for the ICC calculation,\n17\nusing the R-package \u201cirr\u201d.\n18\nMultivariable logistical regression analyses were performed to determine the association between CE and outcome, adjusting for baseline contusion volume and variables from the core and CT International Mission for Prognosis and Clinical Trials in Traumatic Brain Injury (IMPACT) model (age, GCS, pupillary status, Marshall CT classification, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and epidural hemorrhage\n19\n). Listwise deletion was used to handle missing variables.\nTo compare the predictive value of absolute and relative CE for unfavorable GOS and all-cause mortality, we generated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and compared their discriminatory performance using the DeLong method.\n20\nSensitivity, specificity, and Youden's index for several commonly used cutoff definitions of CE were also calculated. In a sensitivity analysis we then conducted subgroup evaluations in patients with baseline contusion volumes \u22651\u2009mL, severe TBI (GCS \u22648), and for each center separately. A univariable logistical regression model with interaction-term analyses was also used to investigate potential effect modifiers. Isolated TBI was defined as a moderate-to-severe TBI with an extracranial Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS)\n21\n\u2264 2.\nAll statistical analyses were conducted using R software version 4.1.2, and\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Patient selection\nmTBI patients were enrolled from a tertiary care center and level I trauma center, Memorial Hermann Hospital at the Texas Medical Center, Houston, TX, between December 2017 and August 2019. The study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) at the University of Texas McGovern School of Medicine (HSC-MS-12-0637). All patients were evaluated by an attending neurointensivist and diagnosed with mTBI, defined as a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of \u226513 and LOC <30 minutes. Each patient received a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head as part of routine clinical evaluation. Of the 84 TBI patients, 6 had no acute CT findings (7.14%), while the rest had intracranial findings including traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (\nn\n=\u200950, 59.5%), subdural hemorrhage (\nn\n=\u200947, 56.0%), epidural hemorrhage (\nn\n=\u20093, 3.57%), or contusions (\nn\n=\u200920, 23.8%). Multi-compartment hemorrhage was common (\nn\n=\u200931, 36.9%). No patients had significant mass effect or midline shift, and none required surgical intervention. A description of the types of hemorrhages found in each patient is provided in\nTable S1\n. Healthy volunteers were enrolled from outpatient clinics at the University of Texas Health Science Center and the University of Maryland Medical Center, and had no neurological diagnoses.\n\nDemographic, clinical, and outcome data\nDemographic data were collected for each subject including age, sex, and medical comorbidities. The modified Rankin Score (mRS) at discharge was assessed by the attending physician taking care of the patient.\n26\nThe GOSE is one of the most widely used metrics of disability and recovery after TBI.\n27\nGOSE outcomes range from 1 to 8 (1\u2009=\u2009dead, and 8\u2009=\u2009upper good recovery); the full scale is shown in\nTable S2\n. GOSE was assessed at discharge by the attending physician caring for the patient. GOSE and mRS at 6 months post-injury were assessed via follow-up phone call by trained research personnel using standardized questionnaires.\n\nSample collection and processing\nBlood samples were collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-containing tubes and centrifuged at 1000\ng\nfor 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C to remove circulating cells and isolate the plasma fraction. All mTBI subjects had a plasma sample collected within 24\u2009h after injury. Thirty-two of these mTBI subjects returned 3 months after injury (3.16\u2009\u00b1\u20091.05 months) to provide a second sample. For the healthy volunteer subjects (\nn\n=\u200935), a single blood draw was obtained and processed at enrollment. Plasma samples were stored at -80\u00b0C until used.\n\nMetabolomics\nMetabolomics was performed by Metabolon, Inc (Morrisville, NC) using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) as previously described.\n28\nMetabolites were identified based on comparisons of each ion with a reference library.\n29\nThe AUC for each metabolite peak was quantified and used in the fold-change calculations. A total of 318 lipid metabolites were identified and analyzed (\nTable S3\n). Lipid metabolites included sphingolipids and ceramides; acyl-carnitines; intermediates of fatty acid metabolism (acyl-choline, acyl-glutamine, acyl-glycine); fatty acids (short, intermediate, and long chain fatty acids; dicarboxylate, dihydroxyl, and monohydroxyl fatty acids; long-chain polyunsaturated (n3 and n6) fatty acids; PC, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylserine; and lysoplasmalogen and plasmalogen. Nomenclature for lipids includes the backbone and acyl chains in parentheses. Chemical structures were drawn with PubChem Sketcher V2.4 (\nhttps://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//edit3/index.html\n).\n\nBioinformatics analyses\nFor each metabolite, fold change between comparison groups (e.g., \u201cgood\u201d vs. \u201cbad\u201d dichotomized GOSE; mTBI vs. control) and corresponding raw and false discovery rate (FDR) corrected\np\nvalues were calculated in R using MetaboAnalyst 5.0 (\nhttps://www.metaboanalyst.ca\n).\n30\nFDR corrected\np\nvalues were considered to be significant at\np\n<\u20090.05. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for metabolites of interest.\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics (medians and interquartile ranges [IQR] or percentages) were calculated for each subject. Categorical variables were compared using Pearson \u03c7\n2\ntest, while continuous variables were compared using a Mann\u2013Whitney test. For descriptive statistics,\np\nvalues were two-sided and considered statistically significant if\np\n<\u20090.05. All statistical analyses were performed in R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, version 4.1.2).\n\nPredictive models\nFunctional outcomes at discharge and 6 months after discharge were quantified using GOSE scores dichotomized as a binary response: \u201cgood\u201d (GOSE \u22657) and \u201cbad\u201d (GOSE \u22646). Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed on metabolites comprising a particular pathway producing a new set of variables named \u201cprincipal components,\u201d and eliminating redundant dimensions, with original variables combined in each principal component.\n31\n,\n32\nPCA prevents overfitting by reducing the number of dimensions within the predictors. The \u201cPCAtools\u201d package in R was used to generate scree plots with the \u201celbow\u201d method used to select the number of PCs needed to account for at least 80% of the variation in the data set.\n33\n,\n34\nWe developed a baseline logistic regression model for mTBI patients (including age and sex) and predictive models (logistic regression models that included individual lipid metabolites or principal components in addition to baseline parameters). Models were developed to predict functional outcomes at discharge and 6 months after discharge. The area under the receiver operating curves (ROC) of the predictions was calculated, and the ROC curves were statistically compared using the DeLong test.\n35\nModels were developed using the \u201cscikitlearn\u201d toolbox available in Python (v3.6). Statistical analyses comparing ROC curves was performed using R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, version 4.1.2)."

    "Methods": "Participants\nParticipants included U.S. Active Duty military volunteers recruited from military treatment facilities in the San Diego area. The TBI groups consisted of adults (>18 years old) with persistent self-reported symptoms related to TBI sustained more than 3 months before study participation; the control group consistent of adults with no history of TBI or other neurological conditions (noTBI). Participants were divided into groups based on VA/DOD guidelines, defining mild TBI as <30\u2009min loss of consciousness, <24\u2009h confusion/disorientation, and/or <24\u2009h post-traumatic amnesia; moderate TBI as 30\u2009min-24\u2009h loss of consciousness, >24\u2009h confusion/disorientation, and/or >24\u2009h post-traumatic amnesia; and severe TBI as >24\u2009h loss of consciousness, GCS 3-8, and/or >7 days post-traumatic amnesia. Ninety participants (\nn\n=\u200921 noTBI,\nn\n=\u200952 mTBI,\nn\n=\u200917 msTBI) met full eligibility requirements and were included in analysis. After determining that there were no significant differences in brain metrics between the two groups, the moderate (\nn\n=\u200912) and severe (\nn\n=\u20095) TBI groups were combined for the purposes of this study. Participants were excluded from this study if they had a neurological condition, psychiatric disorders, contraindications for MRI, or a history of a medical condition that would be expected to affect cognitive or motor abilities.\n\nExperimental procedure\nAfter providing written informed consent, participants provided demographic information and medical history (\nTable 1\n). History of TBI was obtained using the Ohio State University TBI Identification Method (OSU TBI-ID)\n55\n,\n56\nand verified using available medical records.

A T1-weighted high-resolution image was acquired using a 3D T1w Turbo Field Echo (TFE) pulse sequence (TFE factor\u2009=\u2009256, repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u20096.7\u2009msec, inversion time (TI)\u2009=\u2009890\u2009msec, TE\u2009=\u20093.0\u2009msec, shot interval time\u2009=\u20093000\u2009msec, 218 shots, flip angle\u2009=\u20098\u00b0, 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256 matrix, phase encoding direction\u2009=\u2009y). One hundred and seventy slices covering the entire brain were acquired with a voxel resolution of 0.94\u2009\u00d7\u20090.89\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm. Total scan time was 10:57. Diffusion tensor images were acquired with a pulsed gradient-spin echo sequence with an echo-planar imaging readout in 32 directions (TR\u2009=\u20096853\u2009msec, TE\u2009=\u2009103\u2009msec, acquisition matrix\u2009=\u2009112\u2009\u00d7\u2009110, slice thickness\u2009=\u20093.00\u2009mm, flip angle\u2009=\u200990\u00b0, EPI factor\u2009=\u200955). Forty-eight slices covering the entire brain were acquired with an inplane resolution of 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092.04\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm. Total scan time was 8:46.\n\nMRI data analysis\nStructural MRI analysis\nMRI structural images were first analyzed using FSL's fMRI analysis tool, FEAT version 6.0.1 (FMRIB's Software Library\nhttp://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/\n).\n62-64\nThe skull was removed from the T1 images using the BET brain extraction tool\n65\nwith a fractional intensity thresholding of 0.4, specifying the voxel that represented the approximate center of the brain. Next, the T1 was registered to the standard MNI atlas with a 12 degrees of freedom affine transformation. This transformation was refined using FNIRT nonlinear registration with a warp resolution of 10\u2009mm.\n66\nCortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation were performed with the FreeSurfer image analysis suite (\nhttp://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu\n), using the built-in command\nrecon-all\nwith default settings. The technical details of these procedures are described in prior publications.\n45\n,\n67\u201379\nProcessing included motion correction, removal of non-brain tissue using a hybrid watershed/surface deformation procedure,\n69\nautomated Talairach transformation, segmentation of the subcortical white matter and deep gray matter volumetric structures,\n45\n,\n75\nintensity normalization,\n80\ntessellation of the gray matter white matter boundary, automated topology correction,\n74\n,\n81\nand surface deformation following intensity gradients to optimally place the gray/white and gray/cerebrospinal fluid borders at the location where the greatest shift in intensity defines the transition to the other tissue class.\n67\n,\n72\n,\n73\nOnce the cortical models were complete, surface inflation\n77\nwas performed to match cortical geometry across subjects.\n78\nA variety of surface-based data including maps of curvature and sulcal depth were created using both intensity and continuity information from the entire three-dimensional magnetic resonance volume. Cortical thickness was calculated as the closest distance from the gray/white boundary to the gray/CSF boundary at each vertex on the tessellated surface.\n73\nThe maps were created using spatial intensity gradients across tissue classes and were therefore not simply reliant on absolute signal intensity. Volume, surface area, and thickness for the Desikan-Killiany atlas cortical structures, as well as volume for subcortical structures and white matter segmentations, were extracted for each subject and scaled by total intercranial volume, where appropriate.\nVoxel-wise DTI analysis of fractional anisotropy\nDTI data were analyzed using FSL's FDT toolbox. Voxel-wise statistical analysis of FA was carried out using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS),\n82\nwithin FSL.\n63\nFirst, FA images were created by fitting a tensor model to the raw diffusion data using FDT, and then brain-extracted using BET.\n65\nAll subjects' FA data were then aligned into a common space using the nonlinear registration tool FNIRT,\n66\n,\n83\nwhich uses a b-spline representation of the registration warp field.\n84\nNext, the mean FA image was created and thinned to create a mean FA skeleton with a threshold FA value of 0.2, representing the centers of all tracts common to the group. Each subject's aligned FA data was then projected onto this skeleton and the resulting data were fed into voxel-wise cross-subject statistics. Statistical analysis was performed using the \u201crandomize\u201d command in FSL. The number of permutations was set to 10,000, and correction for multiple comparisons was achieved using threshold-free cluster enhancement with a family-wise error rate of\np\n<\u20090.05.\nRegion of interest DTI analysis of fractional anisotropy\nTo evaluate average FA in pre-defined white matter regions of interest, the brain was separated into 48 white matter regions based on the ICBM-label atlas.\n85-87\nAverage FA was extracted for each region for each participant using the mean FA image created in the FDT process described above. Following FA value extraction, the three participant groups were compared using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine regions of significant difference.\nPothole DTI analysis\nBecause of the heterogeneous nature of white matter damage in TBI, additional analyses were implemented examining DTI \u201cpotholes.\u201d Potholes represent white matter with FA values that are abnormally low compared with a healthy control group. Pothole analysis has been shown to be sensitive to white matter changes,\n88\nspecifically in mTBI, in previous studies.\n31\n,\n89\n,\n90\nTo begin, a normative template based on the MNI-registered DTI volumes of the noTBI participants was generated using tools available within FSL. FSL FAST\n91\nresults were used to restrict the calculations to white matter voxels common among noTBI participants. Volumes representing the mean and standard deviation (SD) of each white matter voxel were then calculated via fslmaths. For each TBI participant, their own FAST white matter map was used to restrict their DTI volume to white matter, and a z-score map was generated by subtracting the control group mean volume and dividing by the control group SD volume. The resulting z-maps were thresholded at z\u2009=\u2009-3, and FSL cluster was used to label contiguous voxels below this threshold. These resulting clusters are considered potholes. These potholes were then thresholded at \u226510\u2009mm\n3\n.\n90\nThe sum of pothole clusters for each participant was then used as the measure of reduced white matter organization in further analyses.\n\nStatistical analysis\nSPSS 28.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for statistical analysis. An independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney test was used to compare group differences depending on data normality. A one-way ANOVA was used when comparing differences among all 3 groups, with\npost hoc\nBonferroni analysis for significant difference between two-group pairs. Chi-square analyses were used to compare groups on categorical variables. Effect sizes (d) were computed to demonstrate the magnitude of observed differences. Spearman's correlation coefficients were used to examine associations between white matter and gray matter metrics. The significance level was adjusted by using the Bonferroni correction with\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Therapy Intensity Level (TIL) and alternative scales\nTIL refers to the 38-point scale developed by the CDE scheme for TBI.\n8\nThe domain or construct (i.e., targeted concept of a scale) of TIL is the therapeutic intensity of ICP management. The TIL scale has 12 items, each representing a distinct ICP-targeting treatment from one of eight modalities, as defined in\nTable 1\n. TIL was developed by an international expert panel, which discussed: 1) the relevant ICP-treatment modalities of modern intensive care; 2) the relative risk and efficacy of individual therapies to derive scores; and 3) practical and statistical limitations of previous TIL scores.\n8\nIn this way, TIL is a formative measurement model in which the construct (i.e., ICP treatment intensity) is not unidimensional but rather defined by the combination of items (i.e., ICP-targeting treatments).\n17\nTIL was shown to have high inter-rater and intra-rater reliability by Zuercher and colleagues.\n9\nIf a decompressive craniectomy was performed as a last resort for refractory intracranial hypertension, its score was included in the day of the operation and in every subsequent day of ICU stay. TIL scores can be calculated as frequently as clinically desired. For our analysis, we calculated the following TIL scores from the first 7 days of ICU stay:\nTable 1.\nScoring Configurations for TIL and Alternative Scales\nICP-treatment modality\nItem\nTIL\nuwTIL\nTIL\n(Basic)\na\nPILOT\nb\nTIL\n(1987)\nb\nSub-item\nScore\nMax\nScore\nMax\nScore\na\nScore\nMax\nScore\nMax\nPositioning\nHead elevation for ICP control or nursed flat (180\u00b0) for CPP management\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\nSedation and neuromuscular blockade\nSedation\n5\n3\n5\n4\nLow dose sedation (as required for mechanical ventilation).\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nHigher dose sedation for ICP control (but not aiming for burst suppression).\n2\n2\n2\n1\n1\nHigh dose propofol or barbiturates for ICP control (metabolic suppression).\n5\n3\n4\n5\n4\nNeuromuscular blockade (paralysis).\n3\n3\n1\n1\n\u2013\n2\n2\n1\n1\nCSF drainage\nCSF drainage volume\n3\n2\n5\n2\nLow (<120\u2009mL/24h)\n2\n1\n2\n4\n1\nHigh (\u2265120\u2009mL/24h)\n3\n2\n3\n5\n2\nCPP management\nFluid loading for maintenance of cerebral perfusion.\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\nVasopressor therapy required for management of cerebral perfusion.\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n\u2013\n\u2013\nVentilatory management\nHypocapnia for ICP control (P\na\nCO\n2\n[mm Hg])\n4\n3\n4\n2\nMild (35\u2009\u2264\u2009P\na\nCO\n2\n<40)\n1\n1\n2\n1\n1\nModerate (30\u2009\u2264\u2009P\na\nCO\n2\n<35)\n2\n2\n3\n2\n1\nIntensive (P\na\nCO\n2\n<30)\n4\n3\n4\n4\n2\nHyperosmolar therapy\nMannitol administration\n3\n2\n3\n6\n\u22642g/kg/24h\n2\n1\n2\n2\n3\n>2g/kg/24h\n3\n2\n3\n3\n6\nHypertonic saline administration\n3\n2\n3\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u22640.3g/kg/24h\n2\n1\n2\n3\n>0.3g/kg/24h\n3\n2\n3\n3\nTemperature control\nTemperature control (T [\u00b0C])\n5\n3\n5\n\u2013\n\u2013\nFever control (>38 or spontaneous <34.5).\n1\n1\n1\nCooling for ICP control (\u226535)\n2\n2\n3\n3\nHypothermia (<35).\n5\n3\n4\n5\nSurgery for intracranial hypertension\nIntracranial operation for progressive mass lesion, NOT scheduled on admission.\n4\n4\n1\n1\n4\n4\n4\n\u2013\n\u2013\nDecompressive craniectomy.\n5\n5\n1\n1\n4\n5\n5\n\u2013\n\u2013\nMaximum total possible score\n38\n21\n4\n38\n15\nOpen in a separate window\nThe TIL scale was developed by Maas and colleagues.\n8\nFor each calendar day, the highest score for each item was summed to derive the TIL score.\na\nTIL\n(Basic)\nis the maximum score (up to 4) among all administered sub-items over the calendar day.

The 21-point, unweighted TIL (uwTIL) scale replaces each sub-item score in TIL with its ascending rank index (i.e., 1, 2, 3, \u2026) within each item (\nTable 1\n). The five-category TIL\n(Basic)\nwas also developed by the CDE scheme for TBI and takes the maximum score, from zero (i.e., no ICP-related intervention) to four, amongst all included sub-items over the calendar day.\n8\nWe adapted the 38-point PILOT\n7\nand 15-point TIL\n(1987)\nscales\n6\nwith minor adjustments to fit the items of TIL with a daily assessment frequency. PILOT also was shown to have high inter-rater and intra-rater reliability by Shore and colleagues.\n7\nFor the four alternative scales, daily (i.e., uwTIL\n24\n, TIL\n(Basic)\n24\n, PILOT\n24\n, and TIL\n(1987)\n24\n), maximum (i.e., uwTIL\nmax\n, TIL\n(Basic)\nmax\n, PILOT\nmax\n, and TIL\n(1987)\nmax\n), and median (i.e., uwTIL\nmedian\n, TIL\n(Basic)\nmedian\n, PILOT\nmedian\n, and TIL\n(1987)\nmedian\n) scores were calculated in the same way as TIL\n24\n, TIL\nmax\n, and TIL\nmedian\n, respectively.\n\nStudy design and populations\nOur study population was prospectively recruited for the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) core and high-resolution studies. CENTER-TBI is a longitudinal, observational cohort study (NCT02210221) involving 65 medical centers across 18 European countries and Israel. Patients were recruited between December 19, 2014, and December 17, 2017, if they met the following criteria: 1) presentation within 24\u2009h of a TBI; 2) clinical indication for a CT scan; and 3) no severe pre-existing neurological disorder. In accordance with relevant laws of the European Union and the local country, ethical approval was obtained for each site, and written informed consent by the patient or legal representative was documented electronically. The list of sites, ethical committees, approval numbers, and approval dates can be found online at\nhttps://www.center-tbi.eu/project/ethical-approval\n. The project objectives and design of CENTER-TBI have been described in detail previously.\n18\n,\n19\nIn this work, we applied the following inclusion criteria in addition to those of CENTER-TBI (\nFig. 1\n): 1) primary admission to the ICU; 2) at least 16 years old at ICU admission; 3) invasive ICP monitoring; 4) no decision to withdraw life-sustaining therapies (WLST) on the first day of ICU stay; and 5) daily assessment of TIL.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nFlow diagram for patient enrollment and validation population assignment. CENTER-TBI, Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in TBI; ICP, intracranial pressure; ICP\nEH\n, end-hour ICP; ICP\nHR\n, high-resolution ICP; ICU, intensive care unit; TBI, traumatic brain injury; TIL, Therapy Intensity Level scale\n8\n,\n9\n; WLST, withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies.\nFor our sub-studies evaluating the association between TIL and ICP-derived values, we created two sub-populations based on the type of ICP values available. Patients with end-hour ICP (ICP\nEH\n) values, which were recorded by clinicians at the end of every other hour, constituted the TIL-ICP\nEH\nsub-population. Patients with high-resolution ICP values (ICP\nHR\n), which were automatically stored with monitoring software, constituted the TIL-ICP\nHR\nsub-population. All patients in the TIL-ICP\nHR\nsub-population were also members of the TIL-ICP\nEH\nsub-population (\nFig. 1\n).\n\nData collection\nData for the CENTER-TBI study was collected through the QuesGen electronic case report form system (QuesGen Systems Inc, Burlingame, CA, USA) hosted on the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF) platform (INCF, Stockholm, Sweden). All data for the validation populations, except high-resolution signals, were extracted from the CENTER-TBI core study\n19\n(v3.0, ICU stratum) using Opal database software.\n20\n\nICP management data for TIL calculation\nSince TIL\n24\nwas found to be a reliable summary of hourly TIL,\n9\nclinical data pertinent to the component items of TIL (i.e., ICP-guided treatments,\nTable 1\n) were recorded daily through the first week of ICU stay. We extracted all daily TIL item values for our population, and calculated TIL\n24\n, uwTIL\n24\n, TIL\n(Basic)\n24\n, PILOT\n24\n, and TIL\n(1987)\n24\nas defined in\nTable 1\n. For patients who underwent WLST after the first day of ICU stay, we only extracted TIL item information from before the documented date of WLST decision.\n\nICP\nEH\nand related values\nEnd-hour ICP (ICP\nEH\n), systolic blood pressure (SBP\nEH\n), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP\nEH\n) were recorded by clinicians every 2\u2009h for the TIL-ICP\nEH\nsub-population. Mean arterial pressure (MAP\nEH\n) was calculated as MAP\nEH\n=\u2009(SBP\nEH\n+ 2DBP\nEH\n)/3, and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP\nEH\n) was calculated as CPP\nEH\n=\u2009MAP\nEH\n\u2013 ICP\nEH\n. From ICP\nEH\nand CPP\nEH\n, we calculated the following values:\nICP\n24\nor CPP\n24\n, the mean ICP or CPP value over a calendar day of ICU stay,\nICP\nmax\nor CPP\nmin\n, the maximum ICP\n24\nor minimum CPP\n24\nvalue over the first week of a patient's ICU stay,\nICP\nmedian\nor CPP\nmedian\n, the median ICP\n24\nor CPP\n24\nvalue over the first week of a patient's ICU stay.\n\nICP\nHR\nand related values\nHigh-resolution signals were collected using either ICM+ software (Cambridge Enterprise Ltd, Cambridge, U.K.;\nhttp://icmplus.neurosurg.cam.ac.uk\n), Moberg CNS monitor (Moberg Research Inc, Ambler, PA, USA;\nhttps://www.moberg.com\n), or both. Blood pressure was obtained through arterial lines connected to pressure transducers. High-resolution ICP (ICP\nHR\n) was acquired from either an intraparenchymal strain gauge probe (Codman ICP MicroSensor, Codman and Shurtleff Inc., Raynham, MA, USA), a parenchymal fiber optic pressure sensor (Camino ICP Monitor, Integra Life Sciences, Plainsboro, NJ, USA;\nhttps://www.integralife.com/\n), or an external ventricular drain. Detailed data collection and pre-processing methods (i.e., artefact cleaning and down-sampling to ten-second averaged time series) applied to high resolution signals in our study have been described previously.\n21\nTen-second averaged ICP (ICP\nHR_10sec\n) and CPP (CPP\nHR_10sec\n) time-series were retrieved for this analysis, and, from ICP\nHR_10sec\nand CPP\nHR_10s\n, we calculated ICP\n24\n/CPP\n24\n, ICP\nmax\n/CPP\nmin\n, and ICP\nmedian\n/CPP\nmedian\nas described above.\n\nPhysician impressions\nAttending ICU physicians were asked to record their daily concerns with the patient's ICP and CPP, separately, on a scale from 1 (not concerned) to 10 (most concerned). Moreover, on each patient's ICU discharge summary, physicians were asked to record whether the patient experienced refractory intracranial hypertension during his or her ICU stay. Refractory intracranial hypertension was defined as recurrent, sustained (i.e., of at least 10\u2009min) increases of ICP above 20\u2009mm Hg despite medical ICP management. We extracted the daily ICP/CPP concern ratings and refractory intracranial hypertension impressions which coincided with the ICU stays of our population.\n\nBaseline characteristics, prognosis, and outcome\nWe extracted baseline demographic characteristics, Marshall CT classifications,\n22\nand Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)\n23\nscores from ICU admission.\n24\nWe also extracted Glasgow Outcome Scale\u2014Extended (GOSE) functional outcome scores at 6 months post-injury,\n25\nwith imputation of missing values as previously described.\n26\nFinally, we extracted ordinal functional outcome prognosis scores, calculated from a tokenized embedding of all available clinical information in the first 24\u2009h of ICU stay, as described previously.\n27\n\nValidation\nWe appraised the validity of TIL according to recommendations of best practice from clinimetric literature.\n28\nBased on the identified domain of TIL, we evaluated the construct and criterion validities of TIL. Our qualitative and quantitative assessments of TIL were performed against those of alternative scoring configurations (\nTable 1\n) for comparison.\n\nConstruct validity\nConstruct validity is the extent to which a clinical scale matches expectations of associations with parameters within or outside the identified domain. Construct validity is further broken down into convergent validity (i.e., associations with similar constructs), discriminant validity (i.e., associations with divergent constructs), and differentiation by known groups. In this work, statistical associations between study variables were measured with:\nSpearman's correlation coefficients (\n\u03c1\n) for static (i.e., measured once) variables,\nrepeated measures correlation coefficients (\nr\nrm\n)\n29\n\u2014interpreted as within-individual strength of association\u2014for longitudinal (i.e., measured over time) variables,\nlinear mixed effects regression (LMER) coefficients (\n\u03b2\nLMER\n) of daily scale scores (e.g., TIL\n24\n) when regressing ICP\n24\nor CPP\n24\non daily scale scores and the day of ICU stay (Day\nICU\n), accounting for inter-patient variability with random intercepts. Therefore,\n\u03b2\nLMER\nwere interpreted as the expected difference in ICP\n24\nor CPP\n24\nper unit increase of daily scale score, independent of time since ICU admission or inter-patient variation.\nFor convergent validity, we expected therapeutic intensity to correlate at least mildly (i.e., |\n\u03c1\n|\u22650.2, |\nr\nrm\n|\u22650.2, |\n\u03b2\nLMER\n|>0) with markers of injury severity (i.e., baseline GCS and baseline outcome prognoses), functional outcome (i.e., six-month GOSE), clinical concerns of ICP status, and ICP itself. Accordingly, we calculated: 1)\n\u03c1\nvalues between TIL\nmax\nand GCS, ordinal prognosis scores, GOSE, and ICP\nmax\n; 2)\n\u03c1\nvalues between TIL\nmedian\nand GCS, ordinal prognosis scores, GOSE, and ICP\nmedian\n; 3)\nr\nrm\nvalues between TIL\n24\nand physician concern of ICP and ICP\n24\n; and 4)\n\u03b2\nLMER\nof TIL\n24\nwhen regressing ICP\n24\non Day\nICU\nand TIL\n24\n(i.e., ICP\n24\n\u223cDay\nICU\n+TIL\n24\n), accounting for inter-patient variability with random intercepts.\nFor discriminant validity, we expected therapeutic intensity to be more strongly correlated with ICP and physician concerns of ICP than with CPP and physician concerns of CPP, respectively. Even though CPP control through fluid loading or vasopressor therapy is a component modality of TIL (\nTable 1\n), we expected TIL to capture ICP management (i.e., the construct) more accurately than CPP management. We compared: 1)\n\u03c1\nvalues of TIL\nmax\nversus CPP\nmin\nto those of TIL\nmax\nvs. ICP\nmax\n; 2)\n\u03c1\nvalues of TIL\nmedian\nversus CPP\nmedian\nto those of TIL\nmedian\nvs. ICP\nmedian\n; 3)\nr\nrm\nvalues of TIL\n24\nversus CPP\n24\nto those of TIL\n24\nvs. ICP\n24\n; and 4) the\n\u03b2\nLMER\nof TIL\n24\nwhen regressing CPP\n24\n\u223cDay\nICU\n+TIL\n24\nto the\n\u03b2\nLMER\nof TIL\n24\nwhen regressing ICP\n24\n\u223cDay\nICU\n+TIL\n24\n.\nFor differentiation by known groups, we expected TIL\nmax\nand TIL\nmedian\nto effectively discriminate patients who experienced refractory intracranial hypertension during ICU stay from those who did not. We calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), which, in our case, was interpreted as the probability of a randomly selected patient with refractory intracranial hypertension having a higher TIL\nmax\nor TIL\nmedian\nscore than one without it. We also compared the AUCs of TIL\nmax\nand TIL\nmedian\nto ICP\nmax\nand ICP\nmedian\nand determined the sensitivity and specificity of refractory intracranial hypertension detection at each threshold of TIL\nmax\nand TIL\nmedian\n.\n\nCriterion validity\nCriterion (or concurrent) validity is the degree to which there is an association between a clinical scale and other scales measuring the same construct, particularly a gold standard assessment. Since there is no extant \u201cgold standard\u201d for assessing ICP management intensity, we tested the concurrent criterion validity of TIL by calculating its associations with its predecessors (i.e., PILOT and TIL\n(1987)\n), mindful of their limitations as described above. More specifically, we calculated: 1)\n\u03c1\nvalues between TIL\nmax\nand prior scale maximum scores (i.e., PILOT\nmax\nand TIL\n(1987)\nmax\n); 2)\n\u03c1\nvalues between TIL\nmedian\nand prior scale median scores (i.e., PILOT\nmedian\nand TIL\n(1987)\nmedian\n); and 3)\nr\nrm\nbetween TIL\n24\nand prior scale daily scores (i.e., PILOT\n24\nand TIL\n(1987)\n24\n).\n\nComponent item analysis\nWe evaluated inter-item (i.e., inter-treatment) and adjusted item-total associations of TIL\n24\n, uwTIL\n24\n, PILOT\n24\n, and TIL\n(1987)\n24\nby calculating\nr\nrm\nvalues. Item-total correlations were adjusted by subtracting the tested item score from the total score prior to calculating the correlation. We measured Cronbach's alpha (\n\u03b1\n) to assess internal reliability amongst scale items at each day of ICU stay. Moreover, we calculated the median score contribution of each item per total TIL\n24\nscore. The association between each TIL\n24\nitem score and ICP\n24\n, CPP\n24\n, physician concern of ICP, and physician concern of CPP was calculated with\nr\nrm\nvalues. Finally, we trained LMER models regressing ICP\n24\nand CPP\n24\non all TIL items (with categorical dummy encoding) and Day\nICU\nconcurrently. The\n\u03b2\nLMER\nvalues from these models were interpreted as the average change in ICP\n24\nor CPP\n24\nassociated with each treatment when accounting for all other ICP-guided treatments, time since ICU admission, and inter-patient variability with random intercepts.\n\nTIL\n(Basic)\ninformation coverage\nWe examined the distributions of TIL\n(Basic)\n24\nper TIL\n24\nand TIL\n24\nper TIL\n(Basic)\n24\nto derive thresholds for categorizing TIL\n24\ninto TIL\n(Basic)\n24\n. We also calculated the information coverage (IC) of TIL\n(Basic)\nby dividing the mutual information (MI) of TIL\n(Basic)\nand TIL by the entropy of TIL. IC was calculated with TIL\n(Basic)\n24\nand TIL\n24\nfor days one through seven of ICU stay, with TIL\n(Basic)\nmax\nand TIL\nmax\n, and with TIL\n(Basic)\nmedian\nand TIL\nmedian\n.\n\nStatistical analysis\nMultiple imputation of missing values. Five of the static study variables had missing values for some of the patients in our study: GCS, GOSE, baseline prognosis scores, Marshall CT classifications, and refractory intracranial hypertension status. We assessed the patterns of missingness (\nSupplementary Fig. S1\n) and multiply imputed (\nm\n=\u2009100) these variables with independent, stochastic predictive mean matching functions using the mice package\n30\n(v3.9.0) in R (v4.2.3). We assumed these variables to be missing-at-random (MAR; as previously reported on CENTER-TBI data)\n31\nand supported this assumption by training imputation models on all study measures as well as correlated auxiliary variables (e.g., raised ICP during ICU stay).\nFor daily longitudinal study variables, we considered a value to be missing if the patient was still in the ICU and WLST had not been decided on or before that day. We assessed the longitudinal patterns of missingness (\nSupplementary Fig. S2\n) and multiply imputed (\nm\n=\u2009100) these variables with the multivariate, time-series algorithm from the\nAmelia II\npackage\n32\n(v1.7.6) in R over the first week of ICU stay. The algorithm exploits both between-variable and within-variable correlation structures over time to stochastically impute missing time series values in independently trained runs. We validated the MAR assumption by identifying characteristics significantly associated with longitudinal variable missingness (\nSupplementary Table S1\n) and included auxiliary information associated with value missingness (e.g., reasons for stopping ICP monitoring) in the imputation model.\nStatistical inference. We calculated 95% confidence intervals (CI) for \u03c1, r\nrm\n, \u03b2\nLMER\n, AUC, sensitivity, specificity, \u03b1, and IC values using bootstrapping with 1000 resamples of unique patients. For each resample, one of the 100 missing value imputations was randomly chosen. Therefore, confidence intervals represented the uncertainty due to patient resampling and missing value imputation.\n\nCode availability\nAll statistical analyses were performed in Python (v3.8.2) or R, and all visualizations were created in R. All scripts used in this study are publicly available on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/sbhattacharyay/CENTER-TBI_TIL\n."

    "Methods": "Ethical declaration and animal husbandry\nAll experiments were approved by the Institutional Care and Use Committee at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Cleveland. Animals were housed in groups of two or three, and exposed to a normal dark\u2013light cycle with free access to food, water, and environmental enrichment\nad libitum\n. The health and welfare of the animals was monitored daily by the study investigators and veterinary staff at Case Western Reserve University.\n\nBehavioral training and assessments\nAnimals were acclimated to the laboratory room testing environment and cereals in the home cage for five consecutive days. The animals were also handled by the researchers twice a day to minimize any stress/anxiety prior to exposure to behavioral testing. The following week, the animals were acclimated to the various testing apparatuses, which included a 10-min session each day in the glass cylinder used in the cereal eating assessment. The animals were trained to eat at least three of each cereal type (sphere-shaped: i.e., Cocoa Puffs or donut-shaped: i.e., Fruit Loops) within the 10-min session. For acclimation to the forelimb locomotor testing platform, rats were placed on top of an open field platform \u223c10\u2009cm in diameter and allowed to explore for 5\u2009min. Forelimb locomotor and cereal eating pre-training was conducted for five consecutive days. Baseline behavior performance was acquired following training and before LC2H (\nFig. 1A\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\n(A\u2013D)\nIncomplete cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) severely impairs forelimb function during walking and eating behavior at chronic stages.\n(A)\nTimeline of the experimental protocol.

(\nB\nand\nC\n) Lateral cervical level two hemi-section (LC2H) severely impairs forelimb walking ability and cereal eating behavior at 3 days post-injury (DPI), 1 week post-injury (WPI), and 12 WPI. There were no significant differences across the experimental treatment groups compared with controls. Color image is available online.\n\nForelimb function assessments\nForelimb function was determined through assessments that involved monitoring behavior that the animals performed naturally. This included the Forelimb Locomotor Scale (FLS)\n65\nand the Irvine, Beattie, and Breshnahan (IBB) forelimb recovery scale.\n64\nBaseline values were taken prior to injury and at 3 months after injury just prior to daily subcutaneous injection of high dose ISP or saline alone or combined with Nutella\u2009\u00b1\u2009PNNi oral gavage administration (for 60 days) and then weekly following treatment application (\nFig. 1A\n). Statistical comparisons were made between treatment groups and within behavioral measurements using two-way, repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with recommended post-hoc correction (Bonferroni) (GraphPad Prism).\nForelimb Locomotor Scale (FLS)\nWe used established methods detailed by Singh and colleagues to assess forelimb locomotion.\n65\nBriefly, rats are encouraged to continuously walk on top of an elevated circular platform \u223c10\u2009cm in diameter. Rats that remained stationary for longer than 10\u201315\u2009sec were enticed to move by having them follow a pencil or a piece of paper, or by lightly tapping or scratching on the side of the open field. If the animal failed to respond to these stimuli, it was picked up by the forequarters and placed in the center of the open field or opposite its previous position, which usually caused it to move. Rats were recorded during locomotion using a high-speed (60 frames/sec [FPS]) camera for offline scoring to assess forelimb walking functionality. Videos were scored in a blinded fashion in slow-motion (at least 50%) playback using the Lightworks video editing software. Recorded videos containing 3\u20134\u2009min of the animal freely walking on the elevated platform were measured using an 18-point scale (0\u201317). Animal locomotor behaviors were assessed for impairments and assigned a score reflecting the ability of the animal to perform steps that were consistently plantar, parallel, and weight-bearing.\n65\nIBB Forelimb Recovery Scale\nThese testing methods were established previously.\n64\nBriefly, animals were placed in the 25\u2009cm H \u00d7 20\u2009cm W clear glass cylinder that was used for previous acclimation and training. Each rat was given one sphere-shaped (Cocoa Puff) and one donut-shaped (Fruit Loop) cereal to eat. Their manipulations of the cereals were recorded using a high-speed (60 FPS) camera for offline scoring to measure forelimb and digit abilities during eating. Videos were scored blinded in slow-motion (at least 50%) playback using the Lightworks video editing software. Recorded videos containing the animal eating one sphere-shaped cereal (i.e., Cocoa Puff) and one donut-shaped cereal (Fruit Loop) were measured using a 10-point scale (0\u20139).\n64\nThe animal's ability to dexterously manipulate the cereals was assessed for impairments and assigned a score reflecting the ability of the animal to grasp the cereal with subtle adjustments made using the second, third, and fourth digits and wrist movements.\n64\n\nStimulation of forelimb utilization\nAll animals were placed in a pool (4\u2019 diameter) filled to a depth of \u223c46\u2009cm at a temperature of 35\u201338\u00b0C to match the rat's natural internal temperature. Animals were placed in the pool for 1\u2009min. Two to four rats were placed in the pool at one time. After swimming, rats were partially dried with a cotton towel and then placed in empty cages lined with paper towels and allowed to further dry and groom themselves uninterrupted for 1\u2009h at room temperature. The rats were then replaced back into their home cages. Swimming took place 5 days a week beginning 2 weeks after treatment application began, excluding the day prior to and the day of behavioral acquisition using the FLS and IBB assessments described (\nFig. 1A\n).\n\nLC2H injury and systemic treatments\nSCI surgeries were performed as previously described.\n53\nAdult female Sprague Dawley rats (280\u2009\u00b1\u200920\u2009g; Harlan Laboratories Inc., Indianapolis, IN, USA) were anaesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine + xylazine cocktail (70\u2009mg kg\n\u22121\n/7\u2009mg kg\n\u22121\n). The dorsal neck-shoulder area was shaved, cleaned, and sanitized using Betadine and 70% ethyl alcohol, and analgesics were administered through subcutaneous injection of meloxicam (1\u2009mg kg\n\u22121\n). Body temperature was maintained and monitored throughout the surgery at 37\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C. A dorsal midline incision \u223c3\u2009cm in length was made over the cervical region. After the skin and paravertebral muscles were retracted, a laminectomy was performed over C2 and the rostral spinal cord was exposed (\nFig. 1A\n). A 21G syringe needle was positioned at the midline of the spinal cord, and a left lateral durotomy and hemi-section were performed caudal to the C2 dorsal roots making certain that the needle tip extended to and was dragged along the ventral bony lamina surface. This process was repeated five times and ranged from the midline to the most lateral extent of the spinal cord. The muscle layers were sutured together with 3-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed using wound clips. The animals were given meloxicam (1\u2009mg kg\n\u22121\n) and sterile saline subcutaneously for up to 5 days post-surgery along with nutritional support if their weight dropped >5% of what it had been pre-injury. The anatomical completeness of the injury was confirmed through microscopy and behavioral assessment. Post-injury animals exhibited no signs of malnutrition or infection, but those that exhibited persistent autophagy as a result of the injury before or during the systemic treatment phase were excluded from the study. Before initiating any systemic treatments, all animals were confirmed to have achieved a performance score \u22644.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091 out of 17 at 3 days post-injury (DPI) as described in the locomotor assessment, and a score of 8\u2009\u00b1\u20091 12 weeks post-injury (WPI) (\nFigs. 1C\nand\n\u200b\nand2;\n2\n; see Forelimb Locomotor Scale section\n)\n.\n65\nFor cereal eating assessments, all animals were confirmed to have received a performance \u22640\u2009\u00b1\u20091 out of 9 at 3 DPI, and 2\u2009\u00b1\u20091 at 12 WPI\n(\nFigs. 1B\nand\n\u200b\nand4;\n4\n;\nsee IBB Forelimb Recovery Scale\nsection).\n64\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\n(A\u2013C)\nThe Forelimb Locomotor Score (FLS) is significantly improved following systemic treatment to remove chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) in the perineuronal net (PNN) and/or modulate receptor PTP\u03c3. (\nA\n) Chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) rats were measured for forelimb locomotor function before and after lateral cervical level two hemi-section (LC2H) and systemic intracellular sigma peptide (ISP)\u2009\u00b1\u2009perineuronal net inhibitor (PNNi). Both ISP\u2009\u00b1\u2009PNNi significantly improved weight-bearing stepping after chronic PTP\u03c3-PNN binding perturbation (average FLS score ISP analysis of variance [ANOVA],\np\n=\u20090.037). (\nB, C\n) At 24 weeks post-injury (WPI), animals receiving either systemic drug showed an average improvement in walking behavior, with combinatory recovery showing the greatest significance and rate of recovery (\np\n* < 0.05,\np** <\n0.005,\np***\n< 0.0005).

Only animals receiving combinatory therapy showed significant improvement as early as 17 weeks post-injury (WPI). (\nB,C\n) Only chronic injured animals receiving ISP + PNNi improved significantly in cereal eating behavior by 24 WPI (panel\nC\n). Rats that received PNNi alone demonstrated a trend toward significance 4 weeks after the termination of oral administration (\np\n* < 0.05, #\u2009=\u20090.1601). Bonferonni post-hoc analysis, data are reported as average\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM). Color image is available online.\nThree months after LC2H, the rats were randomly assigned to begin a systemic treatment protocol that included a daily 0.5\u2009mL subcutaneous injection of 500\u2009\u03bcg of intracellular sigma peptide (ISP) under the skin of the back near the lesion, combined with oral gavage feeding of Nutella mixed with sunflower oil with or without the small molecule (0.2\u2009g/mL) perineuronal net inhibitor, PNNi. Experimental animals were fed PNNi mixed with hazelnut spread thinned with sunflower oil twice daily at a dose at 2\u2009g/kg based on weight. Control animals were injected with saline and fed hazelnut spread thinned with sunflower oil not containing PNNi. Two separate cohorts received ISP or PNNi alone. These systemic treatments were administered with the goal of simultaneously disrupting the interaction between would-be sprouting axons and the rPTP\u03c3 receptor as well as to reduce the density of inhibitory extracellular perineuronal net components. Each cohort (\nn\n=\u20098\u201310) received the treatments daily for 60 days and were tested and assessed blindly each week for arm and hand function for the duration of treatment, and continuing 4 weeks following the termination of treatments. Our assessments (see details subsequently) of forelimb/paw function were conducted using the FLS\n65\nand the IBB forelimb recovery scale.\n64\nBoth are rating scales similar to the well-known Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) scoring method for overground walking, but are focused on the forelimb and digits.\n66\n\nLow-magnification histology of serotonergic fibers, PNNs, and confirming completeness of the cervical injury\nAt 24 WPI, animals received an overdose of anesthesia prior to cardiac perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Spinal tissue containing regions of interest were dissected and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. Prior to sectioning, the tissue was cryoprotected with sequential treatments first in a solution of 30% sucrose in PBS and then in a 1:1 mixture of 30% sucrose in PBS + OCT for 2 days; 30\u2009\u03bcm coronal sections of tissue were prepared rostral to caudal from cryoprotected cervical spinal cords (C5\u2013C8) using a Leica Cryostat. Immunofluorescence staining was performed using standard protocols. (Refer to\nTable 1\nfor a detailed list of primary antibodies.) In each case, primary antibodies were conjugated to an appropriate Alexa Fluor-containing secondary antibody for microscopic visualization. Nuclei were visualized using Hoechst a 33342 staining. Following the antibody staining, tissue sections were mounted to slides, protected with ProLong Diamond Mounting Medium, cover-slipped, and examined either with an inverted Leica SP8 confocal microscope or a Zeiss Axio Imager microscope.\nTable 1.\nAntibodies Used in This Study\nAntigen\nHost species\nDilution\nVendor\nCatalog number\nGFAP\nChicken\n1/1000\nEnCor Biotechnology\nCPCA-GFAP\nBiotinylated-WFA lectin\n-\n1/500\nVector Laboratories\nB-1355\nCat 301 (ACAN)\nMouse\n1/1000\nMillipore\nMAB5284\nSERT\nRabbit\n1/1000\nEnCor Biotechnology\nRPCA-SERT\nIba1\nRabbit\n1/1000\nEnCor Biotechnology\nRPCA-IBA1\nNeuro Filament (NF)\nRabbit\n1/1000\nEnCor Biotechnology\nRPCA-NF-H\n5 HT\nRabbit\n1/1000\nImmuno Star\n20080\nStrepavidin; Alexa Fluor 555\n-\n1/500\nInvitrogen (Life Technologies)\nS32355\nMouse; Alexa Fluor 488\nDonkey\n1/500\nInvitrogen (Life Technologies)\nA21202\nChicken; Alexa Fluor 488\nDonkey\n1/500\nJackson Immuno Research\n703-545-155\nRabbit; Alexa Fluor 488\nDonkey\n1/500\nInvitrogen (Life Technologies)\nA21206\nMouse; Alexa Fluor 555\nDonkey\n1/500\nInvitrogen (Life Technologies)\nA31570\nChicken; Alexa Fluor 555\nGoat\n1/500\nInvitrogen (Life Technologies)\nA21437\nHoechst 33342, trihydrochloride trihydrate\n-\n1/3000\nInvitrogen (Life Technologies)\nA21437\nOpen in a separate window\n\nQuantification of Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA)\n+\naggregates\nTissues from three separate animals per treatment condition were evaluated.

Aggregates with the lateral and ventral medial pathways were large diameter, globular structures (\nD\u2013F\n). In contrast, aggregates within the dorsomedial CST were smaller in diameter and presented ellipsoid or spherical morphologies (\nG\u2013H\n). Quantification of CSPG aggregates from these three anatomical sites (\nJ\u2013O\n) revealed that treatment with perineuronal net inhibitor (PNNi) + intracellular sigma peptide (ISP) associated with substantial clearing of these plaque-like structures from the dorsomedial CST (\nP\n).

Sections were obtained using a cryostat at 30\u2009\u03bcm/section spanning a \u223c15-mm-long cervical segment containing the LC2H. Spinal cord lesion area and volume were analyzed through fluorescent Nissl staining (ThermoFischer) performed on cross-sectioned tissue of each spinal cord at 500-\u03bcm intervals. The coverage of the lesion as well as the location was determined using a Zeiss Axio Imager microscope and quantified blindly using National Institutes of Health (NIH) ImageJ software analysis of three to four sections per animal that included the lesion epicenter by using monochromatic image and background readings subtracted at the defined area of interest. In all subjects, the left half of the cervical spinal cord was completely severed from the midline to the lateral-most extent of the tissue, and there were no deviations (Fig, 1A).\n\nStatistical analysis\nFor statistical analysis, divergences where\np\n<\u20090.05 were considered significant. Sample size for the\nin vivo\nbehavioral studies was based on a power calculation in which \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05 and \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.80, resulting in\nn\n=\u20098. Power analysis was conducted prior to all experiments to ensure that numbers (\nn\n) of animals per group were sufficient. The data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM). To ensure a normal distribution, data were subjected to the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test for normalcy prior to analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using a one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni correction (GraphPad Prism). At the time of processing and analyses of all experiments and assessments, investigators were blinded as to the treatment group of each animal. The functional and behavioral recordings from every animal in each group were analyzed without exclusion based on the outcome."

    "Methods": "Study sample\nData for this cross-sectional study were obtained from the Naval Health Research Center's (NHRC) MilCo Study, an ongoing Department of Defense (DOD) study. Sampling and recruitment methods are described elsewhere.\n55\u201359\nIn brief, MilCo enrollment began in 2001, with a new round of service members recruited in panels every three years until 2011, with a total of four recruited panels.\n59\n,\n60\nThese analyses included participants from panels 2 (2004), 3 (2007), and 4 (2011).\nTo be included in the MilCo study, panel 2 required service members to have one to two years in service, panel 3 required one to three years, and panel 4 required two to five years. This study utilized data from the most recent follow-up survey (wave 4 for panel 2, wave 3 for panel 2, and wave 2 for panel 4) conducted in 2014, which was the first to assess TBI. To be included in these analyses, service members needed to be on active duty or in the Reserves/National Guard (e.g., not veterans) with complete TBI data.\nParticipants enrolled in the study while they were still on active duty or Reserves/National Guard. Since enrollment of each panel, some participants have retired or completed military service. There were 112,655 participants who completed the 2014 survey, including 29,286 (26.0%) participants still serving on active duty or in the Reserves/National Guard including 5100 (17.5%) from panel 2, 8565 (29.2%) from panel 3, and 15,621 (53.3%) from panel 4. There were 1023 participants missing TBI and PCS data who were excluded from analysis resulting in a final sample size of 28,263.\n\nData collection\nThe MilCo study did not use a specific tool to assess PCS; however, participants were asked questions about various health conditions and symptoms consistent with several, but not all, questions included in the RPCQ.\n43\nThis survey guided our operationalizing of individual symptoms based on the following: Participants were asked how often, in the last four weeks, they were bothered by (1) fatigue, (2) restlessness, (3) sleep disturbances, (4) poor concentration, and (5) irritability or being easily angered on a Likert scale with possible answers \u201cNot at all,\u201d \u201cSeveral days,\u201d or \u201cMore than half the days.\u201d For the analysis we collapsed \u201cSeveral days,\u201d or \u201cMore than half the days,\u201d versus \u201cNot at all.\u201d\nParticipants were also asked the frequency, in the previous two weeks, that they had been bothered by: (1) depression, (2) sleep disturbances, (3) fatigue, (4) poor concentration, and (5) slowed thinking on a Likert scale of \u201cNot at all,\u201d versus \u201cSeveral days,\u201d \u201cMore than half the days,\u201d and \u201cNearly every day,\u201d which were combined for the analysis.\nThe questions, \u201cHas your doctor (in the last 3 years), told you that you have any of the following conditions? (yes/no)\u201d and \u201cHave you had persistent or recurring problems with the following? (yes/no)\u201d captured depression, headaches, memory loss or impairment, confusion, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and forgetfulness. An answer of \u201cyes\u201d to any of these questions was defined as having that symptom. If the participant answered \u201cno\u201d to similar symptoms in one question stem, but yes in another, they were categorized as having that PCS (i.e., if they said they were not bothered by depression, but said a doctor had diagnosed them with depression, this was categorized as \u201cyes\u201d for depression).\nFor the analysis, we created the dependent variable as the total count of PCS by summing up all the PCS for which participants answered \u201cyes.\u201d Nine total PCS were identified and defined for this study.\nTotal lifetime TBI was assessed through self-report, with participants being asked, \u201cHave you ever had an injury, such as from a fall, blow to the head, blast exposure, motor vehicle crash, sports, or any other cause that resulted in any of the following: (a) Being dazed or confused right after the injury?; (b) Being confused or not thinking clearly right after the injury?; (c) Not remembering the actual injury right after it happened?; (d) Not remembering things that happened right after the injury?; and/or (e) Losing consciousness or being knocked out?\u201d Participants were categorized as ever having a TBI if they answered \u201cyes\u201d to any of these questions.\nThose who experienced a TBI were then asked the number of times they experienced this before and during military service. For our TBI variable, those who reported never having a TBI were categorized as none, while the summation of those who did was categorized as one, two, three, and four or more.\nCovariates included years of age, sex (male/female), and race/ethnicity (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Other), military rank (enlisted/officer), military occupational category (MOC\u2014 Administration & Executives, Infantry/Tactical Operations, Electronics Repair & Engineering, Communications & Intelligence, Health Care, Technical & Professional, Craftworkers & Supply, Other/Not Specified), military status (active duty, Reserve, National Guard), and military branch (Army, Air Force, Coast Guard, Marine Corps, Navy).\nWe also included post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which was assessed using the validated Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Civilian Checklist (PCL-C). The checklist measures PTSD symptoms on a scale of 17 to 85 and requires a summed score of at least 50 for an individual to be categorized as experiencing PTSD. We categorized PTSD as yes/no based on the cutoff score of at least 50. Participants were also asked about negative combat experiences that included eight questions about experiences such as seeing dead bodies or knowing someone killed. The total experiences were summed and categorized as 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4+.\nTime in service for each panel was calculated by estimating the midpoint for time each panel likely would have entered the military based on enrollment criteria for the MilCo Study up until the survey was released to participants in 2014.\n\nStatistical analyses\nFrequencies and means were used to describe the sample population demographics and occupational characteristics. The frequencies of service-related lifetime TBIs were calculated for each participant as well as the overall and individual PCS. Bivariate analyses were conducted for the total number of TBIs, as well as the number of negative combat experiences, by the number of PCS (grouped as 0, 1-2, 3-5, \u22656), with associations examined using chi-square testing.\nWe also examined the total lifetime TBIs by the mean and standard error of the total number of PCS using Kruskal-Wallis testing. To examine the associations between lifetime TBIs and counts of PCS, we calculated unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using multi-variable zero-inflated negative binomial regression models; the offset was time in service. Any variable changing the adjusted relationship between TBI and PCS by more than 10% was retained in the final model.\nFurther, variables were evaluated for inclusion in the model using purposeful selection, as described by Hosmer and Lemeshow.\n61\nModel fit was evaluated with likelihood ratio tests and Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). All included variables improved the model fit and were statistically significant by the likelihood ratio test. The variance of PCS at each level of TBI was more than twice the mean at each level, and the alpha parameter indicated overdispersion was present, indicating Poisson count models were likely to be a poor fit of the data.\nFurther, 28% of participants reported zero PCS, indicating zero inflation may be present. Based on the AICs, a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model was a better fit compared with negative binomial and Poisson models. Therefore, we report findings obtained from the ZINB models used for final reporting. Statistical analyses were conducted using R\n54\n(univariate, bivariate, Kruskal-Wallis testing) and Stata version 14.2\n55\n(model building and analysis) statistical software programs."

    "Methods": "Review of clinical standard of care\nIn this review, our goal is first to summarize current standards of clinical care for adults with acute SCI in the human population. Thus, we referenced the most recent \u201cGuidelines for the Management of Acute Cervical Spine and Spinal Cord Injuries\u201d published by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons and the American Association of Neurological Surgeons as well as the clinical practice guideline entitled \u201cEarly Acute Management in Adults with Spinal Cord Injury\u201d published in 2008 by the Consortium for Spinal Cord Medicine.\n6\u201310\nIn addition, we referenced UpToDate,\n\u00ae\nan online database for clinical care standards described as an \u201cEvidence-Based Clinical Decision Support System\u201d offered by Wolters Kluwer. UpToDate\n\u00ae\nis widely utilized by physicians and healthcare providers for point-of-care reference as they make clinical decisions and so substantively contributes to a summary of practices currently utilized to manage acute SCI.\nWe utilized UpToDate\n\u00ae\nboth to cite its peer-reviewed and edited content directly and also to find journal articles from its cited sources provided for each healthcare summary. The primary summaries cited were \u201cAcute traumatic spinal cord injury,\u201d \u201cAnesthesia for adults with acute spinal cord injury,\u201d and \u201cOverview of inpatient management of the adult trauma patient.\u201d\n11\u201313\nWe also referenced other UpToDate\n\u00ae\nsummaries concerning care for medically related complications as are reported completely in our Works Cited list.\n2\n,\n14\u201320\nFinally, we searched PubMed\n\u00ae\nfor published, peer-reviewed journal articles describing healthcare guidelines for acute care of adults with SCI. We prioritized reference of the most recent guidelines, reviews, and meta-analyses available for a better understanding of current care standards. Our evaluation of PubMed\n\u00ae\nresults generated by our search queries was not intended to be exhaustive, but qualitative. Our collaborator and co-author, practicing spinal neurosurgeon, and researcher Dr. H. Francis Farhadi, provided oversight of our description of current standard of care for SCI.\n\nReview of high cervical SCI surgery veterinary aftercare\nOur focus for this portion of the review was on commonly utilized rodent models of high cervical SCI defined as C4 and above. Thus, we conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed\n\u00ae\nto find publications describing aftercare protocols for contusive and hemisection injuries in mice and rats. Search inputs were as follows: (C2 hemisection rat) OR (C2Hx rat) OR (C2 hemisection mouse) OR (C2 hemisection mice) OR (C2Hx mouse) OR (C2Hx mice) OR (high cervical contusion rat) OR (high cervical contusion mouse) OR (high cervical contusion mice). Literature reviews, clinical studies, and articles not written in English were excluded.\nAfter closer evaluation of study content, articles were also excluded if they did not utilize a contusive or hemisection injury model, if the level of injury fell caudal to the C4 spinal segment, if the induced SCI was a terminal procedure, or if a description of aftercare methods was omitted. We analyzed at least five of the most recent qualifying publications from each senior author included in the initial list of publications compiled by our search. In cases wherein a particular senior author had fewer than five publications meeting our criteria, all were evaluated. Of the 192 entries returned by our initial search criteria, 98 were ultimately included in this review.\n\nClinical care for spinal cord injury\nThe first recorded description of medical treatment of spinal cord injury can be found in the Edwin Smith-translated surgical papyrus thought to be written by the Egyptian physician Imhotep in the 30th century B.C.\n21\nThe writer described SCI as \u201can ailment not to be treated,\u201d and such a bleak assessment of SCI prognosis remained in essence unchanged for almost 5000 years until the 19th century A.D.\n21\n,\n22\nOnce medical professionals began to propose and develop treatments for persons with SCIs, their efforts targeted prevention of additional central neurotrauma after the initial insult through surgical decompression and, peripherally, on managing or preventing complications.\n22\nEven now, promising pre-clinical and clinical therapies targeted at the reversal of functional loss induced by SCI have not yet become a part of standard clinical practice.\n23\nToday, the standard of care still consists exclusively of treatments that seek to preserve remaining neurological function and prevent complications, but these are now better defined and standardized according to the history of injury as well as clinical signs and symptoms. These standards of care can be categorized and discussed as below with findings summarized in\nTable 1\n.\nTable 1.\nSummary of Clinical Care Standards for High Cervical SCI\nIntervention\nPurpose\nClinical Care\nAirway & breathing\nMaintenance of respiratory function\nIntubate at first indication of respiratory dysfunction, ventilating with 10\u2009mL/kg body mass & PEEP of 0-5 cmH\n2\nO.\nAnesthesia for intubation\nFacilitation of intubation\nPropofol & thiopental or etomidate & ketamine with neuromuscular blocker.\nChest physical therapy\nDecrease retention of lung secretions and atelectasis\nAs soon as tolerated, training to increase breathing ability and maintenance of respiratory health.\nOral hygiene care\nDecrease infection from aspirated mouth flora\nAssisted toothbrushing at least once per day, often with paste containing chlorhexidine.\nCardiovascular management\nMaintenance of adequate cardiac output and perfusion\nCorrection of active

NSAIDs,\nand\ngenerally rare NSAID use\n.\nAntibiotics\nInfection treatment or prophylaxis\nProphylaxis not indicated for SCI itself, but various antibiotics used for SCI complications and prophylaxis for surgery and penetrating trauma.\nAnticoagulation\nPrevention of coagulative complications\nTreatment with subcutaneous LMWH as soon as possible post-SCI and for at least 12 weeks, briefly interrupted for surgery.\nDermatologic care\nAvoidance of pressure sore-formation\nSpecial bedding, positional shifting with frequent skin integrity inspection.\nNutrition\nAdequate nutrition\nEarly enteral feeding if swallow function allows, monitor/correct glycemia.\nStress ulcer prophylaxis\nPrevent gastroduodenal stress ulcers\nProphylaxis with proton pump inhibitors for 4 wks.\nTemperature regulation\nAvert hypothermia and hyperthermia\nWarm with blanketing & warmed fluids, adjust to prevent overheating.\nTiming of spinal surgery\nPrevention of further spinal cord damage\nSurgical stabilization, reduction, or decompression within 24\u2009hrs. post-SCI as medically feasible.\nAnesthesia for spinal surgery\nFacilitation of surgery\nClosed reduction:\nDiazepam or meperidine\nInduction for surgery with general anesthesia:\nI.V. propofol, ketamine, and etomidate, not inhalables.\nMaintenance:\nFor somatosensory evoked potentials\nI.V. propofol, inhaled sevoflurane, and I.V. opioid (remifentanil, sufentanil, or fentanyl) with any neuromuscular blocking agent.\nMotor evoked potentials (MEP) or electromyography (EMG)\nno neuromuscular blocking agents\nFor MEP: propofol, sevoflurane, and an opioid\nFor EMG: sevoflurane and an opioid\nElectroencephalogram or electrocorticography\nI.V. remifentanil and a muscle relaxant with either inhaled anesthetic (nitrous oxide or sevoflurane) or I.V. dexmedetomidine and propofol.\nUrinary and bowel care\nBladder voiding and defecation\nUrinary catheterization and bowel assistance as needed for prevention of bladder distension and \u22651 bowel movement per day.\nSteroids\nNeuroprotection\nMethylprednisolone not recommended as first-line SCI treatment\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nAirway and breathing interventions\nRespiratory failure is common after cervical or high thoracic SCI as signified by increasing respiratory rate, decreasing forced vital capacity, increasing pCO2, or decreasing PO2 and necessitates urgent intubation and mechanical ventilation.\n11\nSpecial care should be taken in cases of cervical immobilization.\n11\nEven in patients who do not require mechanical ventilation, hypoxemia is common and must be recognized and addressed via administration of supplemental oxygen.\n8\nBecause of the common need for intensive cardiopulmonary monitoring and ventilation, the intensive care unit (ICU) is the most appropriate hospital setting for cervical SCI care.\n6\n,\n8\nIt is best to perform intubation for ventilation in controlled, non-emergent circumstances, so it is preferred to intubate at the first signs of respiratory distress in persons with SCIs at C5 or above.\n8\n,\n24\nFor patients likely to require long-term ventilation, tracheostomy is recommended as an early intervention, and orotracheal is preferred to nasotracheal intubation in the short-term.\n24\nFor the most part, ventilator settings are left to the judgment of the attending physician, but it is important to balance the concerns regarding ventilatory-induced lung injury at higher tidal volumes and increased collapse of small airways (atelectasis) at lower volumes.\n14\nAs a guide, care standards suggest a tidal volume of 10\u2009mL/kg of body mass.\n14\nPositive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) consists of residual positive pressure at the end of each inspiration imposed by mechanical ventilation to prevent atelectasis because the inflation generated by positive pressure ventilation decreases with each expiration.\n14\n,\n25\nOptimal settings in patients with SCI who have respiratory failure are not fully standardized, but typical practice is to use 0-5\u2009cm H2O of PEEP, avoiding overinflation.\n14\nExogenous surfactant administration also can serve to prevent atelectasis.\n25\nEven in spontaneously breathing patients, positive pressure is often administered through nasal cannula to enhance airway opening.\nAnesthesia for intubation\nFor facilitation of intubation induction of anesthesia via propofol and thiopental is common in patients who have no hemodynamic instability, but etomidate and ketamine are viable alternatives and are likely safer for patients at risk for hypotension.\n6\nIf within 48\u2009h of injury, a short-acting neuromuscular blocker such as succinylcholine should be used, but after 48h a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent is the paralytic of choice.\n6\nChest physical therapy for patients with respiratory motor dysfunction\nBeginning as soon as possible after injury, all persons with cervical or thoracic SCI are recommended to undergo chest physical therapy whether intubated or not to assist with improving respiratory function and health.\n6\n,\n14\nTechniques employed include deep breathing, glossopharyngeal breathing, and accessory muscle training, positioning changes, postural secretion drainage, manually assisted (quad) coughing, percussion, vibration, and mechanical insufflation-exsufflation.\n6\n,\n14\nSuctioning is also performed, through the tracheostomy if present or via the nasotracheal or orotracheal route.\n6\n,\n14\nSuctioning in non-intubated patients, however, misses the left mainstem bronchus 90% of the time because of anatomical orientation, and is also uncomfortable for the patient and could damage the larynx.\n14\nOral hygiene care for mechanically ventilated patients\nGood oral care significantly reduces the rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia by reducing the prevalence of mouth flora that could be aspirated while the epiglottis is bypassed by an endotracheal tube.\n26\n,\n27\nThe specific care protocol is not standardized, however, with different sources indicating different frequencies of tooth brushing and varied application methods for the various types of antimicrobial paste used.\n26\n,\n27\nIn the ICU, nurses typically perform their hospital's oral care procedures at least once per day, often including chlorhexidine application.\n26\n,\n27\nCardiovascular management\nAfter a high traumatic SCI, there is great risk of hemodynamic and/or neurogenic shock stemming from blood loss or interruption of sympathetic tone, respectively.\n8\n,\n11\nShock manifests as inadequate cardiac output and/or hypotension that worsen neurological outcome and can lead to death by hypoperfusion of vital tissues.\n8\n,\n11\n,\n28\nMany post-SCI patients able to breathe without mechanical ventilation still experience hypoxemia despite adequate alveolar ventilation likely because of ventilation/perfusion mismatch.\n8\nThus, the ICU is the most appropriate care setting for patients with SCI because of the close monitoring necessary to identify and manage cardiopulmonary issues.\n6\n,\n8\nEarly infusion of intravenous fluids and/or blood transfusions are vital to maintain an appropriate mean arterial blood pressure (BP), which is considered to be 85\u201390\u2009mm Hg by most guidelines.\n6\n,\n8\n,\n11\n,\n28\n,\n29\nOther therapeutic targets include systolic blood pressure of 90\u2013100\u2009mm Hg and heart rate (HR) of 60\u2013100 beats per minute.\n11\n,\n29\nFluid status must be monitored (target of urine output >30\u2009mL/h) to avoid exacerbation of spinal cord swelling, kidney dysfunction, and edema, as well as other relevant pathologies.\n11\n,\n29\nIn addition to fluid resuscitation, sources of cardiovascular dysfunction apart from neurogenic shock (e.g., blood loss) should be determined and remedied.\nCervical or high thoracic SCIs (above T6) often lead to loss of sympathetic innervation and might require treatment with norepinephrine for its chronotropic and vasopressor activity at both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors.\n6\n,\n28\n,\n29\nVasopressors with only alpha-adrenergic activity such as phenylephrine or midrodine are more appropriate for management of hypotension caused by more distal SCIs, but caution should be used with midrodine because of its propensity to cause urinary retention.\n6\n,\n28\n,\n29\nClose monitoring is required to avoid inducing elevated intracerebral pressure and cerebral edema via vasopressor treatment.\n28\nBradycardia might require management with external pacing, atropine, or other pacemaker drugs,6,11 During anesthesia, ephedrine is preferred because of its alpha and beta-1 agonist activity that increases BP and cardiac output in persons with bradycardia.\n18\nNorepinephrine and epinephrine are alternatives, but either requires central line placement for administration or is more suited for acute hypotensive episodes such as cardiac arrest or anaphylaxis, respectively.\n18\nPhenylephrine or vasopressin/terlipressin can be used during anesthesia in persons with elevated or normal HR, but vasopressin and its analogues are most appropriate for refractory hypotension and are used as a last resort in context of neurological injury because of their propensity to induce cerebral vasoconstriction.\n18\nAnalgesics\nAnalgesia is important to ameliorate individuals' pain after SCI. Ideally, the chosen analgesic will have fast onset, no risk of causing dependence, allodynia, or hyperalgesia, and have no side effects.\n19\nAll of these criteria are not to be met in any single agent, so a multi-modal approach is usually taken.\n19\nOverall, intravenous administration is preferred acutely after SCI. Opioids are the first-line treatment for pain in the critically ill patient, but their use after SCI, especially at the cervical level, might be limited because of their respiratory depressive effects because patients' respiratory function is often impaired after injury.\n19\nIn addition, opioids' sedative effects tend to impair neuromonitoring, which is often necessary acutely after SCI for diagnostic and surgical purposes.\n6\n,\n11\n,\n17\nFor these patients, a short acting opioid is most appropriate, such as fentanyl or remifentanil.\n19\nMorphine is also commonly used, but has increased proclivity toward causing pruritis and has a longer duration of action.\nFor non-opioid analgesia, acetaminophen is most commonly utilized, while non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen are uncommonly used.\n19\nThe primary contraindication to acetaminophen is hepatic insufficiency while the list of contraindications to NSAIDs is much more extensive, including recent surgery and surgical bleeding, non-surgical bleeding, renal dysfunction, platelet abnormality, heart failure, cirrhosis, asthma, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy.\n19\nFurther, cell culture and animal studies have indicated that NSAID use can inhibit bone healing\u2014a risk worth considering for human cases of SCI, despite some conflicting clinical data discussed in recent meta-analyses.\n30\u201332\nPatients with SCI often undergo surgery, need unimpaired bone regrowth, and are likely to have other comorbidities that contraindicate NSAID therapy, rendering acetaminophen a more appropriate analgesic.\n19\nFor refractory pain, ketamine has shown promise and can reduce the necessary opioid dosage to attain an appropriate level of pain control.\n6\n,\n19\nGabapentinoids such as gabapentin or pregabalin are additional options available for management of specifically neuropathic pain, or to reduce dependence on other analgesics in the long term.\n6\n,\n19\nFor persons with SCI unable to control their own analgesic administration via manipulation of a button, breath controlled methods can be used.\n6\nAntibiotics\nMore rostral SCIs confer greater risk of pneumonia than more caudal injuries.\n33\u201335\nIn addition, SCI in general renders patients more susceptible to infections of various sorts, a phenomenon thought to be influenced by a neurogenic mechanism termed spinal cord injury-induced immune deficiency syndrome (SCI-IDS).\n33\u201335\nIn addition to pneumonia, other common infectious pathologies associated with cervical SCI include urinary tract infections (UTIs) and infections at the site of a penetrating injury.\n28\nThe use of antibiotics is not indicated as prophylaxis for infection related to SCI per se because of guidelines intended to minimize antibiotic overuse and antibiotic resistance.\n26\nProphylaxis can become necessary, however, if surgery is needed, or if there is polytrauma involving open fractures or penetrating injuries to the thorax.\n13\nWhen antibiotic prophylaxis is warranted or when management of infection from a penetrating injury is necessary, the empiric antibiotic therapy is highly dependent on the specific context and anatomical location of injury or surgery type.\nEmpiric therapy for hospital or ventilator-associated pneumonia should cover\nStaphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n, and other gram-negative bacilli while the specific antibiotics utilized depend on hospital-specific prevalence of bacterial strains and patient characteristics.\n16\nFor UTIs in patients with SCI treated within the ICU, recommended empiric therapy should be instituted with both an antipseudomonal carbapenem and either vancomycin or a combination of both linezolid and daptomycin to cover methicillin-resistant\nS. aureus\n(MRSA).\n15\nFor all empiric regimens, treatments should appropriately change as analysis of patient samples and hospital-specific characteristics dictate.\nAnticoagulation\nPersons with SCI are designated as a population at high risk for blood clot formation because immobilization after SCI often causes venous stasis leading to hypercoagulability and possibly life-threatening complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.\n29\nThus, anticoagulative prophylaxis with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is the standard of care after SCI.\nThe LMWH is usually accompanied by mechanical prophylaxis that includes use of compression stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression.\n14\n,\n29\nIn cases wherein there is a heightened bleeding risk, mechanical measures can be used without pharmacological intervention. It is recommended to implement LMWH therapy as soon as possible after SCI and for at least 12 weeks, with brief interruption for necessary surgery.\n14\n,\n29\nUnfractionated heparin is an alternative if LMWH cannot be used, but evidence indicates lower efficacy.\n14\nTreatment with warfarin or direct anticoagulants is not recommended for acute SCI because of the heightened bleeding risk.\n14\nDermatologic care\nMeasures to prevent pressure sore formation are required for every immobilized patient with SCI and especially those with loss of somatosensation. Once patients' injuries are stabilized, logrolling is the standard technique utilized to shift the patient such that one aspect of the body is not constantly weight bearing.\n6\n,\n11\nUse of pressure-reducing cushions and bedding is also effective. Alternatively, a specialized rotating bed for patients with SCI can be used where available.\n11\nFrequent inspection of the skin integrity, especially at dependent areas overlying bony prominences, is vital as well as elimination of excess moisture and heat applied near the skin.\n6\nNutrition\nSwallow function must be evaluated before beginning oral feeding in any patient with cervical SCI.\n6\nOnly if risk of aspiration is low can oral feeding safely occur. Enteral feeding is preferred above parenteral whenever possible and should begin early, ideally within 72h of injury, once the patient is stable and able to tolerate it.\n6\n,\n7\n,\n9\n,\n13\nContraindications to enteral nutrition include progressive ileus, bowel obstruction, massive bowel resection, malabsorption, splanchnic hypoperfusion, fistulae, and insufficiency of enteral nutrition to meet caloric requirements.\n7\n,\n13\nTotal caloric requirements should be calculated by a 30-min energy expenditure measurement via indirect calorimetry, although it is important to correct for its propensity for overestimation.\n6\n,\n7\n,\n9\nBlood glucose levels should be monitored and treatment instituted to prevent hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia in patients with SCI is common and is associated with greater death and disability at one year after injury.\n6\n,\n13\n,\n36\n,\n37\nThe standard for control of hyperglycemia is intensive insulin therapy, with a target range for blood glucose of 80\u2013110\u2009mg/dL.\n6\n,\n13\n,\n36\nHypoglycemia is best prevented through nutrition according to guidelines described above to prevent exacerbation of neurological injury.\nStress ulcer prophylaxis\nCurrent standards define traumatic SCI patients and those on mechanical ventilation for >48h as high risk for stress ulcers and ulcer-associated gastrointestinal bleeding and thus recommend that all such patients receive prophylaxis for 4 weeks.\n6\n,\n11\n,\n13\n,\n20\n,\n38\nProton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are more protective against gastrointestinal bleeding than histamine receptor 2 (H2) blockers, and pantoprazole is the most common enterally administered PPI prescribed.\n6\n,\n11\n,\n20\nThere is an increased risk of\nClostridioides difficile\ncolitis, however, associated with PPI prophylaxis, that could recommend prescription of H2 blockers as a possible alternative.\n6\n,\n13\n,\n20\nTemperature regulation\nPoikilothermia, or an inability to maintain core body temperature, is common in cervical and high thoracic SCI and especially during anesthesia.\n6\n,\n12\nThus, body temperature must be measured and regulated appropriately until the individual is able to maintain appropriate body temperature \u223c37\u00b0C.\n6\n,\n12\nHypothermia is the most common manifestation of temperature dysfunction in persons with SCI, and so blanketing (heated or not) and warming of intravenous fluids are common and effective interventions.\n12\nContinued monitoring is important to avoid accidental hyperthermia, because sweating function is often impaired below spinal cord lesion.\nTiming of spinal surgery\nFor penetrating SCIs, surgery is often indicated for foreign body removal and disinfection.\n11\nTo prevent neurological deterioration and achieve mechanical stability of the spine, surgical stabilization, reduction, or decompression is indicated if spinal instability, ligamentous damage, or neurological dysfunction is severe or progressive enough.\n6\n,\n11\n,\n29\nFor cervical SCI, these metrics can be assessed through the Subaxial Cervical Spine Injury Classification (SLIC) scales determined by analysis of imaging and clinical findings wherein a score >4 indicates a need for operative management.\n29\nA T2 MRI is the gold standard for evaluation of spinal cord compression and vascular or ligamentous injury when available and clinically appropriate, while CT is the first-line imaging modality but cannot image spinal cord or other soft tissue as well as MRI.\n11\n,\n25\n,\n29\nClosed reduction is a management option for cervical spine fractures with subluxation, but not for thoracic or lumbar injuries.\n11\nIrrespective of the neural complete or incomplete nature of the SCI as assessed by the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS), current evidence supports early neural decompression within 24h of SCI when medically feasible.\n6\n,\n11\n,\n25\n,\n29\n,\n39\nAnesthesia for spinal surgery\nFor facilitation of spinal surgery, there are particular considerations with respect to appropriate anesthesia. Closed reduction can be facilitated through administration of a muscle relaxant or analgesic such as diazepam or meperidine. Induction of general anesthesia for open surgical approaches is intravenous, commonly consisting of propofol, ketamine, and etomidate.\n12\nOf note, inhalable anesthesia is not commonly utilized for induction.\n12\nMaintenance protocols for general anesthesia differ according to the type of neuromonitoring that is performed during the procedure.\n12\n,\n17\nAll inhaled agents tend to affect neuromonitoring to a greater degree than intravenous drugs, but many neuromonitoring modalities can tolerate low-dose sevoflurane.\n6\n,\n17\nFor cases indicating measurement of somatosensory evoked potentials, an appropriate maintenance protocol consists of intravenous propofol, inhaled sevoflurane, and intravenous opioid (remifentanil, sufentanil, or fentanyl) with any neuromuscular blocking agent (succinylcholine, rocuronium).\n6\n,\n17\nNo neuromuscular blocking agents can be used during motor evoked potentials (MEP) or electromyography (EMG).\n17\nSpecific protocols for MEP consist of propofol, sevoflurane, and an opioid while EMG requires low-dose sevoflurane and an opioid.\n17\nTesting with an electroencephalogram or electrocorticography indicates intravenous remifentanil and a muscle relaxant with either inhaled anesthetic (nitrous oxide or sevoflurane) or intravenous dexmedetomidine and propofol.\n17\nUrinary and bowel care\nUrinary dysfunction is common acutely after SCI, and indwelling urinary catheterization is part of the initial patient assessment unless contraindicated or in cases wherein there is no suspicion or sign of urinary retention.\n6\n,\n11\nBladder distention can be assessed by palpation or ultrasound.\n6\n,\n11\nAfter 3 or 4 days post-injury, indwelling catheters can sometimes safely be removed in preference for intermittent catheterization to decrease infection risk.\n6\n,\n11\nFor persons with SCI and gut dysmotility, one bowel movement per day is the goal.\n6\nSteroids\nMethylprednisolone (MP) was observed to have efficacy in reducing peritumoral cerebral edema and inspired MP's off-label use in the clinic to reduce edema in SCI beginning in the 1960s.\n40\nPromisingly, animal experiments demonstrated that MP treatment reduced edema, prevented intracellular hypokalemia, and improved neurological recovery after SCI because of its inhibition of lipid peroxidation and other mechanisms.\n11\n,\n40\nMultiple randomized controlled trials in the human population, however, have since evaluated MP after SCI, but any neurological improvement attributed to MP treatment has tended to be small and inconsistent while adverse effects attributable to MP were more robust and repeatable.\n6\n,\n9\n,\n11\n,\n41\nThus, MP is no longer recommended as a first-line treatment for SCI.\n6\n,\n9\n,\n11\n,\n41\nIf used despite recommendations, the best MP protocol for SCI seems to begin within 8h of injury and last for no more than 24h.\n25\n\nVeterinary care standards after C2 hemisection and high cervical contusion injury in mice and rats\nThe C2 hemisection (C2Hx) is a well-established animal model of a controlled, laceration-type incomplete SCI that generates consistent respiratory motor deficits ipsilateral to the lesion.\n42\u201346\nWhile the C2Hx is vital for the study of treatments to ameliorate a controlled, unilateral functional deficit, cervical contusion utilizes a clinically relevant forceful impact to model SCI.\n47\u201350\nHigh cervical spinal cord contusions, however, lead to less consistently severe respiratory motor deficits than hemisections.\n47\u201350\nBecause of these two injury models' complementary strengths and weaknesses, studies using C2Hxs and cervical contusions together portray a more complete picture of high cervical SCI than either approach alone. Thus, both experimental models in mice and rats are vital to our comparison of veterinary care protocols to the clinical treatment of spontaneous SCI in humans.\nIn the following sections, we will summarize veterinary care protocols used by the various laboratories studying C2Hx and high cervical contusions in mice and rats, organizing (where applicable) each intervention into the same categories we used to describe clinical care standard for SCI (\nTable 2\n). Where protocols substantively differ between various laboratories, we will list the specific interventions used by each research group.\nTable 2.\nSummary of Veterinary Care for Experimental High Cervical SCI in Murine Animals\nIntervention\nPurpose\nClinical Care\nAirway & breathing\nIntraoperative blood gas control\nSome laboratories intubate and ventilate animals during SCI surgery.\nCardiovascular management\nReplace blood loss\nFluid injections during and after surgery.\nAnalgesics\nPain relief\nMost common\n:. Opioid or opioid+NSAID.\nLess common\n: NSAID alone, opioid+ acetaminophen, or non-NSAID COX-3 modulators.\nAntibiotics\nInfection treatment or prophylaxis\nMost common\n: No prophylactic antibiotics.\nLess common\n: Systemic prophylactic treatment with various agents.\nAnticoagulation\nPrevention of coagulative complications\nNone\nDermatologic care\nAvoidance of skin damage\nSurgical site care and regular assessment.\nNutrition\nAdequate nutrition\nMost common\n: Diet supplementation & weight monitoring.\nLess common\n: Dextrose or glucose infusion.\nStress ulcer prophylaxis\nPrevent gastroduodenal stress ulcers\nNone\nTemperature regulation\nAvert hypothermia & hyperthermia\nMost common\n: Volitional access to heating pad.\nAnesthesia for spinal surgery\nFacilitation of surgery to induce C2Hx or high cervical conusion\nMost common:\nXylazine(or medetomidine) cocktail with ketamine.\nLess common\n: Inhalable isoflurane or halothane, pentobarbital, chloral hydrate, or fentanyl and midazolam.\nUrinary and bowel care\nBladder voiding and defecation\nMonitoring, bladder expression & bowel evacuation when needed.\nOpen in a separate window\nAirway and breathing interventions\nThe C2Hx model of cervical SCI is designed intentionally to induce a unilateral respiratory deficit while leaving the opposite side unimpaired.\n42\u201346\nThus, animal subjects that receive a C2Hx surgery do not require intubation or mechanical ventilation for post-surgical survival.\nThe Bolser, Mitchell, Luk\u00e1\u010dov\u00e1, and Vinit laboratories, however, sometimes utilize intubation and mechanical ventilation to administer inhalable anesthetics during C2Hx surgeries, and those interventions become necessary for survival when animals experience respiratory arrest after a cervical contusion injury.\n51\u201364\nIn such cases, the same anesthetic agents are maintained that were in effect during the injury surgery. No additional considerations of PEEP, chest physical therapy, or oral hygiene are described for either intraoperative or post-injury intubation or mechanical ventilation.\nCardiovascular management\nAfter SCI surgery, subcutaneous fluids (physiological saline or lactated Ringer solution) are often administered to maintain hydration.\n43\n,\n47\n,\n48\n,\n51\n,\n54\n,\n55\n,\n59\n,\n65\u2013106\nMurine subjects are usually provided access\nad libitum\nto drinking water immediately after surgeries with accommodations for limited mobility such as extended waterspouts.\nAnalgesics\nThe Askew, Baekey, Bonay, Chang, Fehlings, Gonzalez-Rothi, Goshgarian, Hsu, Lane, Lee, Lepore, Mansart, Tsai, and sometimes the Alilain, Decherchi, Fuller, Nantwi, Reier, and Vinit laboratories implement post-SCI systemic analgesic monotherapy with buprenorphine (a partial mu opioid receptor agonist).\n47\n,\n48\n,\n51\n,\n69\u201371\n,\n74\u201377\n,\n80\u201383\n,\n86\n,\n90\n,\n92-96\n,\n99\u2013101\n,\n106\u2013113\nThe Gauthier laboratory used pentazocine (an opioid), the Luk\u00e1\u010dov\u00e1 laboratory utilized metamizole (a non-opioid analgesic with activity at central cyclooxygenase-3), and the Novikov laboratory utilized flunixin (an NSAID) as monotherapy.\n60\n,\n91\n,\n114\n,\n115\nFor the Descherchi laboratory, their aftercare protocol sometimes consists of a combination of dextropropoxyphene (an opioid) and acetaminophen administered through drinking water.\n87\nPost-SCI analgesic treatment for Kastner laboratory animals included acetaminophen with codeine and/or morphine sulfate.\n84\n,\n116\u2013118\nDrs. Sieck and Mantilla usually post-operatively treat their experimental rats and mice with either acetaminophen and buprenorphine together or acetaminophen alone.\n119\u2013128\nIn one rat contusion study, the Sieck and Mantilla group administered the NSAID carprofen\nad libitum\nthrough the drinking water in addition to injectable buprenorphine.\n79\nIn other studies, the Alilain, Bolser, Dale, Fuller, Mitchell, Mateika, Reier, Sankari, and Vinit laboratories utilize a dual systemic approach consisting of both buprenorphine and NSAID administration (either carprofen or meloxicam).\n43\n,5256,\n58\n,\n59\n,\n61\u201365\n,\n67\n,\n68\n,\n73\n,\n78\n,\n88\n,\n89\n,\n97\n,\n103\n,\n129\u2013133\nDuring and immediately following Alilain and Kastner laboratory SCI surgeries, bupivacaine or procaine (sodium channel blockers) are often used for short-term, localized paralytic and analgesic effects.\n47\n,\n48\n,\n84\n,\n132\nThe recent cervical hemi-contusion publication from the Fern\u00e1ndez-Mu\u00f1oz laboratory stated that they treated animals with analgesics, but the specific protocol was not detailed.\n104\nNotably, the publications from the Cox, Feron, and Xu groups included no analgesic protocol for their post-SCI animals.\n98\n,\n102\n,\n105\nAntibiotics\nNo systemic prophylactic or responsive antibiotic treatment was included in the cervical SCI care protocols described by the Alilain, Askew, Baekey, Bolser, Chang, Dale, Fehlings, Gonzalez-Rothi, Hsu, Lane, Lee, Mateika, Nantwi, Reier, Sankari, Tsai, or Xu laboratories, or in the majority of Lepore, Fuller, and Goshgarian laboratory publications. Some Fuller and Goshgarian laboratory articles, however, do include enrofloxacin treatment after surgery.\n72\n,\n78\nOne Lepore lab publication induced their C2Hx injury in immunosuppressed rats and thus included cephazolin in their post-operative treatment regimen.\n81\nIn addition, the Alilain laboratory applies topical triple antibiotic ointment to subjects' minor skin wounds as they arise, according to veterinary staff instruction (personal communication).\nIn their past experimentation, Drs. Sieck and Mantilla have pre-emptively treated their post-SCI animals with penicillin G, the Descherchi laboratory has used amoxicillin, the Luk\u00e1\u010dov\u00e1 group used amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, the Mitchell group has often used enrofloxacin, and the Novikov laboratory has used benzylpenicillin for infection prophylaxis.\n52\u201356\n,\n58\u201360\n,\n79\n,\n86\n,\n91\n,\n120\n,\n125\n,\n130\n,\n131\nThe Feron and Kastner laboratories post-operatively treat animals with oxytetracycline and the Bonay, Mansart, and Vinit groups used trimethoprim and sulfadoxine.\n64\n,\n84\n,\n86\n,\n98\n,\n111\u2013113\n,\n116\u2013118\nThe Cox laboratory treated animals with gentamicin, although because their study was designed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of MP treatment, their prophylactic antibiotic treatment might have been motivated more to combat the risks of MP-induced immunosuppression than as part of standard post-SCI aftercare.\n105\nAlthough the specific agent(s) were not mentioned, the Fern\u00e1ndez-Mu\u00f1oz laboratory described that they implemented responsive antibiotic therapy if their post-surgery rats showed signs of infection.\n104\nDermatological care\nDuring cervical SCI surgery, ointment is applied to the anesthetized animals' eyes to prevent ocular damage.\n67\n,\n132\nOther skincare provided to experimental animals across all literature surveyed was limited to preparation of the sites for aseptic or sterile procedure, closure of the surgical incision, nail trimming, monitoring and prevention of autophagy, and cleansing of the animals' surgical site, fur, eyes, and mouth as needed post-surgery.\n42\n,\n43\n,\n47\n,\n48\n,\n51\n,\n53\n,\n56\u201374\n,\n77\u201384\n,\n86\u201397\n,\n99\u2013104\n,\n106\n,\n107\n,\n109-113\n,\n116\u2013121\n,\n123\n,\n129\n,\n132\u2013135\nExperimenters did not employ any treatment as prophylaxis for pressure sores.\nNutrition\nMurine subjects are usually provided access\nad libitum\nto normal chow immediately after surgeries with accommodations for limited mobility such as food pellets placed on the cage floor.

    "Methods": "Participants\nIndividuals with pmTBI (8\u201318 years) were diagnosed by clinicians independent of the study and were consecutively recruited from local emergency and urgent care departments in this ongoing study. Participants were evaluated at \u223c1 week (sub-acute assessment [SA] at 7.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2 days), 4 months (early chronic [EC] assessment at 133.0\u2009\u00b1\u200919.7 days) and 1 year (late chronic [LC] assessment at 371.3\u2009\u00b1\u200931.7 days) post-injury. Inclusion criteria represented a blend of American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine (upper limits: Glasgow Coma Scores \u226513, maximum loss of consciousness [LOC]\u2009=\u200930\u2009min, and maximum post-traumatic amnesia [PTA]\u2009=\u200924\u2009h) and Zurich Concussion in Sport Group (lower limits: at least two new symptoms) guidelines.\n8\nHC, recruited from the local community through fliers and word of mouth, were evaluated at equivalent time points. Both parents and children provided informed consent (parents of children <18 years old or adolescents 18 years old) and/or assent (children <18 years old) according to institutional guidelines at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine.\nBoth pmTBI and HC were excluded for history of major neurological diagnoses, moderate or severe TBI (> 30\u2009min LOC), developmental disorders (autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability), psychiatric disorders other than adjustment disorder, substance abuse/dependence, or non-English fluency. Additional exclusion criteria for HC included attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or a learning disability. Urine-based drug screens were conducted for all participants at all three visits. Positive results resulted in study exclusion. Any new brain injury during the protocol also resulted in exclusion from subsequent visits. A total of 286 pmTBI (\nn\n=\u2009162 males; 13.9\u2009\u00b1\u20092.8 years) participated in the study along with 218 sex- and age-matched HC (\nn\u2009=\n121 males, 13.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.9 years). See\nFigure 1\n,\nSupplementary text\n, and\nTable S1\nfor full details on enrollment, quality assurance, and retention rates across both cohorts and subgroups. The current study represents a partial replication and extension of findings from a previous article, with approximately half of the sample (total\nn\n=\u2009279) up to 4 months post-injury.\n6\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nParticipant flowchart. Flow chart of participant enrollment, inclusion, and data quality assurance from the sub-acute (SA), early chronic (EC), and late chronic (LC) phase visits for patients with pediatric mild traumatic brain injury (pmTBI) as well as healthy controls (HC). The mean number of days post-injury (DPI) at each assessment are included for pmTBI, whereas the mean number of days between SA and subsequent visits (days between visits; DBV) are included for both cohorts.\n\nProcedures\nAll participants and their parents completed a modified version of the Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI)\n22\nat each visit as well as providing a retrospective (R) rating at the SA visit. The PCSI was modified in the following ways with author permission: (1) the version of the PCSI for 13\u201318-year-olds was also utilized for 12-year-old participants to equate the response scale, and (2) all references to an injury were removed from both retrospective and concurrent questionnaires and instructions to avoid bias in HC. The retrospective (i.e., 1 month prior to initial visit) and concurrent (day of assessment) reporting instructions were also specified in the modified version.\nAll PCSI data were normalized to a percentage value (sum of individual rating/maximum score\u2009\u00d7\u2009100) because of different scale ratings for different age ranges.\n11\nThe methods used to calculate persistent PCS are similar to in our previous publication\n8\nand were based on a standardized rather than a simple change method because of superior psychometric properties. Specifically, normalized PCSI total scores were first converted to z-scores using the mean and standard deviation from the HC data separately for child and parental reports. Individuals from both pmTBI and HC groups were then operationally classified as being either highly symptomatic or non-symptomatic in a binary fashion using a distributional corrected z-score cutoff of z\u2009>\u20091.64.\n23\nData for self-reported Tanner stage of development were also acquired along with a semi-structured interview of pediatric TBI history to confirm injury severity.\n24\nAdditional clinical and neuropsychological measures were collected as part of this ongoing study, but have been previously presented in separate manuscripts.\n25\n,\n26\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll analyses were conducted in SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0. Armonk, NY) separately for HC and pmTBI. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) compared self- and parental ratings on total (primary results; percent of scale maximum) and sub-domain (supplemental results; percent of sub-scale maximum) PCSI scales using the negative binomial distribution. Results were Bonferroni corrected for the child and parental measures within pmTBI and HC cohorts (0.05/2\u2009=\u20090.025). Each group was further stratified based on biological sex and developmental stage (middle childhood [MC]: 8\u201312 years old; adolescence [AD]: 13\u201318 years old). Age cutoffs were determined based on a combination of general developmental theory\n27\u201329\nand reports of differential outcomes in persistent PCS for these two groups.\n9\nIntraclass correlation coefficients\n30\nwere used to examine both inter-rater reliability (ICC[2,k]; self-report vs. parental report) and test-retest reliability (ICC[2,1]). Gwet's AC1 estimation\n31\nevaluated agreement between child\u2013parent dyads for binary classification of significant PCS symptoms. All reliability estimates were categorized as poor (\u2264 0.39), fair (0.40\u20130.59), good (0.60\u20130.74), or excellent (\u2265 0.75) based on published guidelines, with excellent (\u2265 0.75) reliability deemed to be the minimal/acceptable number to establish good psychometric properties.\n32\nAll negative ICC values were replaced with a value of zero for graphical purposes only (i.e., Tables and Figures). The R module ggplot2 3.3.5 was used to generate figures."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll experimental procedures were approved by the University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The study was conducted and data are reported in accordance with the Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines.\n30\nSprague\u2013Dawley rats (56 males and 36 females [generation F0]) were purchased from Charles River. The F0 na\u00efve female rats were used as breeders only to generate offspring (generation F1). Rats were housed under controlled illumination (12-h light/12-h dark, lights on at 7:00\nam\n) and temperature (23-24\u00b0C) with free access to food and water. Within 24\u2009h of delivery, F1 litters were culled to 12 pups. At 21 days, pups were weaned and housed two per cage for the rest of the study. Experimental data in this study are from 92 male and 36 female rats. Three F0 male rats died immediately after TBI induction and were excluded from all analyses.\n\nTreatment groups\nFigure 1\nshows an overview of the study design. F0 male rats were randomized into two treatment groups (\nn\n=\u200928/group). Investigators were blinded to group assignments. The P60 F0 male rats in the TBI group were subjected to a moderate TBI via a midline fluid percussion injury (mFPI),\n11\n,\n27\nwhile the control F0 males (the Control group) were placed in a new cage, one per cage, for a time equivalent to the duration of the TBI induction procedure. Note that data from F0 male control rats and F1 male and female offspring of control sires were reported previously,\n27\nbut data from F0 rats in the TBI group and their F1 male and female offspring (which were tested at the same time as rats in the control groups) have not been published previously. A subset of the F0 TBI and Control rats (\nn\n=\u200910/group) was sacrificed on P66 to collect tissue samples to study acute effects. The remaining F0 males (\nn\n=\u200918/group) were mated with naive females on P90 to generate offspring (generation F1).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nStudy design.\nFor the mating process, a male/female pair was placed in the same cage for 72\u2009h. Thereafter, the F0 female was housed individually for the remaining gestation and postpartum rearing periods. A cohort of 18 breeding pairs of F0 male and female rats was used to produce F1 offspring (18 F1 rats/group/sex). A given F1 offspring experimental group included one to two rats/sex from a given F1 litter. At the age of 21 days, F1 pups were weaned and housed in sex-matched pairs for the rest of the study. F1 offspring of TBI and Control sires were not exposed to any treatment and were subjected to animal facility rearing only, except for neurobehavioral evaluations. The analysis of the breeding data does not indicate any difference in fertility of sires with moderate TBI when compared with sires in the Control group. Out of 18 breeding pairs per experimental group, one na\u00efve female rat mated with a male from the TBI group and two na\u00efve female rats mated with males from the Control group were infertile. There was also no statistical difference in the number of offspring sired by rats from the TBI and Control groups.\nThis study tested the hypothesis that offspring conceived by sires with a history of a moderate TBI develop neurobehavioral abnormalities in the absence of direct social interaction between sire and offspring. It is possible that TBI sires could affect F1 offspring through interactions with otherwise na\u00efve F0 dams during the 72-h mating period, or through stress or other signals (via auditory or olfactory modalities) in the colony room; however, the stress or other signals in the colony room would have been the same for F1 offspring of Control and TBI sires, and thus any such remotely-transmitted signals would have had to have affected offspring of TBI sires selectively. Also, all rats were housed in individually ventilated cages, which each received a separate supply of high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)-filtered air.\nThe same F0 sires that were used for mating with na\u00efve females to produce F1 offspring were evaluated sequentially in the elevated plus maze (EPM) on P105,\n27\n,\n31\npre-pulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response on P115,\n27\n,\n31\n,\n32\nand Morris water maze (MWM) between P125 and P130.\n27\n,\n33\n,\n34\nTen days after completion of the behavioral tests, stress-induced release of corticosterone was studied after exposing the same F0 males to physical restraint for 30\u2009min, as previously described.\n27\nThe same F1 male and female offspring were sequentially evaluated in the EPM on P60, PPI of the acoustic startle response on P70, and MWM between P90 and P95. Blood samples were collected using the \u201ctail clip\u201d method 30\u2009min after completion of the PPI test to measure stress serum levels of corticosterone, as previously described.\n27\nTen days after completing the\nin vivo\nstudies, the same F0 and F1 rats were anesthetized and sacrificed through decapitation to collect trunk blood and brain tissue samples for further analyses (\nFig. 1\n).\n\nMidline fluid percussion injury model of traumatic brain injury\nThe FPI device (Model 01-B; Custom Design & Fabrication, Inc., VA) was used to induce moderate TBI via mFPI, as previously described.\n27\nTo provide a uniform sevoflurane (SEVO) anesthesia duration and depth to all experimental animals, anesthesia in all rats was induced with 6% SEVO for 3\u2009min in an anesthesia chamber and then a rat was placed in a stereotaxic frame with a continuous supply of 3% SEVO for 37\u2009min via a nose cone. SEVO was delivered in a mixture with \u223c50% O\n2\nin air (1.5\u2009L/min). The rats' rectal temperature during surgery was monitored and maintained at \u223c+37.0\u00b0C using a homeothermic monitoring system (50-7220F; Harvard Apparatus, St. Laurent, Quebec, Canada). Following a \u223c15-mm midline incision in the scalp and fascia removal from the skull, a craniectomy was centrally made over the sagittal suture between bregma and lambda by using a 4.8\u2009mm trephine (Integra Miltex, Princeton, NJ). The dura was kept intact. The female hub of a 20-gauge Luer-Loc needle was placed over the craniectomy and secured first with cyanoacrylate gel and then with methyl-methacrylate dental cement (Henry Schein, Melville, NY). The dura was visually inspected to ensure that it was intact and no debris were present. The inducer was placed over the hub, filled with normal saline, and attached to the male end of the fluid percussion injury device while avoiding air bubbles at the junction. A pressure wave averaging 2.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2 atm was delivered by releasing the pendulum onto the fluid-filled cylinder. The righting reflex time (the time from the initial impact until the rat spontaneously rights itself from a supine position) was 8.97\u2009\u00b1\u20091.82\u2009min. The injury site was inspected for bleeding, herniation, hematomas, and dura integrity before the wound was sutured.\n\nThe elevated plus maze test\nThe EPM studies were performed using an elevated plus maze apparatus and BIO-EPM 3C video-tracking software (EB Instruments, Pinellas Park, FL, USA) during the light phase of the dark\u2013light cycle, as previously described.\n27\n,\n31\nThe maze consists of two opposing open (50\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009\u00d7\u20090.5\u2009cm) and two enclosed (50\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009\u00d7\u200945\u2009cm) arms elevated 75\u2009cm above the floor, with a 0.5-cm edge on the open arms. Animals were placed in the center of the maze facing an open arm and were allowed to explore the maze for 5\u2009min. The percentage of time spent in the open arms, the percentage of entries into the open arms, and the total distance traveled during the test were compared. The time spent in open arms and number of entries to open arms are calculated and presented as the percentage of the total time spent in the open and closed arms and the total number of entries to either open or closed arms, respectively.\n\nMeasurements of PPI of startle\nWe performed PPI of acoustic startle tests in rats using the SR-Lab startle apparatus (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA, USA), as previously described.\n27\n,\n31\n,\n32\nTesting occurred during the light phase of the dark\u2013light cycle. The entire test for a given animal lasted 28\u2009min. The animal enclosure (20\u2009cm in length, 9\u2009cm in interior diameter) permitted the animal to turn around in the enclosure. At the beginning of every testing session, each animal was placed in the cylindrical animal enclosure and exposed to a 70-dB white noise background for a 5-min acclimation period. The acclimation period was followed by a test session consisting of five types of trials: a 120-dB 40-msec pulse only; a 120-dB 40-msec pulse preceded by a 20-msec pre-pulse at intensities of 73 dB, 76 dB and 82 dB (i.e., 3 dB, 6 dB, and 12 dB above the background noise of 70 dB); and a no-stimulus trial of background noise. The delay between the onset of the pre-pulse and the onset of the pulse was 100\u2009msec. The trials were presented in pseudorandom order, with variable inter-trial intervals averaging 15\u2009sec. The first four trials and the last three trials consisted of 120-dB pulse-only trials. All five types of trials were presented eight times, each in pseudorandom order after the first four and before the last three pulse-only trials. The percent pre-pulse inhibition for each pre-pulse intensity was calculated using the following formula: % pre-pulse inhibition\u2009=\u2009100\u2009\u00d7\u2009[(pulse alone) \u2013 (pre-pulse + pulse)]/pulse alone. Data were collected as V\nAverage\namplitude (the average voltage during the response window).\n\nMorris water maze test\nTo evaluate spatial learning and memory in rats, we used the MWM behavioral assay, as previously described.\n27\n,\n33\n,\n34\nThe MWM apparatus consisted of a circular tank (183\u2009cm in diameter, 58\u2009cm in height). The maze was filled with water (23\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C) made opaque with the addition of nontoxic paint (Blick Art Materials, Highland Park, IL, USA). The pool was surrounded with black curtains on which were affixed large white geometric shapes (extramaze cues). The pool was divided into four equal quadrants, labeled NW, NE, SE and SW (NW\u2014northwest; NE\u2014northeast; SE\u2014southeast; SW\u2014southwest). A 12-cm diameter platform (the escape platform) was submerged 2\u2009cm below the surface of the water at a constant location in one of the quadrants. Data were recorded using a computer-based video tracking system (ANY-maze, Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL, USA). Rats received four trials of daily training over 5 consecutive days.\nOn each trial, rats were placed into the water facing the wall of the maze at one of the four quadrants. The start positions were varied in a pseudorandom manner. Once in the water, rats were allowed to swim until they found the hidden platform or until 60\u2009sec elapsed, at which time the rats were gently guided to the platform. Rats remained on the platform for 15\u2009sec before the next trial. Twenty-four hours later, the spatial memory test was performed. The spatial memory test lasted 60\u2009sec, during which time the escape platform was removed. The rat was placed in the pool in the contralateral quadrant (the entrance quadrant, SE) relative to the original location of the escape platform (the target quadrant, NW). The time spent in each quadrant and the number of times the rat crossed the previous location of the escape platform were recorded.\n\nStress-induced serum corticosterone levels\nTo measure stress-induced serum levels of corticosterone, F0 male rats were physically restrained for 30\u2009min. Physical restraint was administered using rodent holders (Kent Scientific Corporation, Torrington, CT, USA). Blood samples (\u223c300\u2009\u03bcL) were collected immediately before physical restraint and 10, 60, and 120\u2009min after the restraint. Blood sampling was done using the \u201ctail clip\u201d method, as previously described.\n27\nSpecifically, the distal 0.5\u2009mm of the tail was removed using a sterile scalpel blade and blood was allowed to drain directly into a microcentrifuge tube. The hemorrhaging was stopped by applying gentle digital pressure to the wound for \u223c1\u2009min. To measure stress-induced serum levels of corticosterone in F1 offspring, the tail blood samples were collected 30\u2009min after completion of the PPI of acoustic startle test, using the same technique described above.\n\nTissue collection\nRats were anesthetized with SEVO and decapitated. The trunk blood samples were collected and centrifuged at 4\u00b0C, 1000\u2009g for 15\u2009min, and then kept at -80\u00b0C for resting corticosterone and proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) assays. The hypothalamus was isolated by making an anterior cut at the level of the optic chiasm, a posterior coronal section anterior to the mammillary bodies, two sagittal cuts parallel to the lateral ventricles, and a dorsal horizontal cut at the level of the anterior commissure.\n23-25\nThe hippocampus was isolated from the respective blocks. All tissue samples were placed in vials filled with RNAlater solution (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).\n\nMeasurements of serum concentrations of corticosterone and IL-1\u03b2\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were used to measure serum concentrations of corticosterone (501320; Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI) and IL-1\u03b2 (BMS630; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) by following the manufacturers' instructions.\n\nMeasurement of messenger RNA levels\nThe messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in the hippocampus and hypothalamus were analyzed via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in a StepOnePlus\u2122 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), as previously described].\n27\nRNA was extracted from the samples using a RNeasy Plus Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), reverse transcribed with a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), and then analyzed via qRT-PCR. Taqman probes specific for\nSlc12a2\n(Rn00582505_m1),\nSlc12a5\n(Rn00592624_m1), corticotropin-releasing hormone (\nCrh,\nRn01462137_m1), glucocorticoid (\nNr3c1,\nRn00561369_m1) and mineralocorticoid (\nNr3c2,\nRn00565562_m1) receptors, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (\nBdnf,\nRn02531967_s1) were obtained from Applied Biosystems. Data were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (\nGapdh\n) mRNA (Rn01775763_g1). Gene expression was calculated using the \u0394\u0394CT method and data are presented as relative fold change from that of control animals.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nRats were anesthetized with SEVO and transcardially perfused with saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffer. The brains were collected and fixed in the 4% PFA solution overnight and then dehydrated in 30% sucrose solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4\u00b0C for 2 days. The brains were cut into 40-\u03bcm-thick coronal sections using a vibratome (VT1000 S; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). After blocking with 10% normal goat serum for 1\u2009h at room temperature, the slices were incubated with the primary antibodies rabbit anti-Iba1 (ionized calcium binding adaptor 1, a microglia/macrophage-specific protein marker; 1:500; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) and mouse anti-GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein, an astrocyte specific protein marker; 1:500; Invitrogen) in 1% bovine serum albumin at 4\u00b0C overnight. After washing with PBS for 10\u2009min\u2009\u00d7\u20093 times, the slices were exposed to the secondary antibodies Alexafluor 549 goat anti-rabbit and Alexafluor 488 goat anti-mouse (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 1\u2009h at room temperature. After washing out the secondary antibodies, the sections were incubated with 4\u00b4,6-diamidine-2\u00b4-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) for nuclear staining.\nA fluorescence microscope (BZ-X810E, Keyence, Osaka, Japan) was used to capture the images. Six sections of hippocampus per rat were analyzed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Three non-overlapping fields of each section in the hippocampal Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) area were randomly acquired. The immunoreactivity of a protein was quantified by calculating the percentage area with positive staining relative to the total area of the imaged field.\n24\n,\n25\nAll quantitative analyses were performed by an experimenter blinded to the group of each sample.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe primary outcomes in this study were the neuroendocrine and behavioral changes in F0 sires and in their F1 offspring. All other outcome measurements were secondary outcomes. Values are reported as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analyses were carried out on raw data using GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software, Boston, MA), SigmaPlot 14.0 software (Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA) and SPSS v27 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Boxplots were used to identify outliers. No outliers were detected that were not in the plausible range of values for the outcomes; therefore, all data were maintained in analyses. To analyze F0 data for acute\nSlc12a2\n,\nSlc12a5, Slc12a2/Slc12a5 ratio, Crh, Nr3c1, and Nr3c2\nmRNA levels, serum corticosterone and IL-1\u03b2 levels, hippocampal Iba1 and GFAP expression, long term EPM, and number of crossings over the former platform location during the MWM probe test, differences in long term gene expression, resting corticosterone and total corticosterone concentrations during the restraint, IL-1\u03b2 levels, and hippocampal Iba1 and GFAP expression, t-tests were used.\nA two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), with experimental groups and time as the independent variables, was used to analyze changes in serum corticosterone levels before and at three time-points after the restraint. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to analyze the F0 PPI data, with the treatment and pre-pulse intensity as independent variables. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA with experimental groups and days of training as the independent variables was used to analyze latencies to reach the escape platform during MWM training in F0 rats. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA with experimental groups and quadrants as the independent variables was used to analyze time spent in each quadrant during the MWM test in F0 rats. A two-way ANOVA with treatment and sex as the independent variables were used to assess F1 data for changes in EPM, MWM platform location crossing times, changes in gene expression, serum corticosterone levels at rest and after the PPI test, changes in serum IL-1\u03b2 levels and hippocampal Iba1 and GFAP expression.\nFor F1 PPI, MWM escape latency and time in each quadrant, linear mixed models for repeated measures were used, with PPI intensity, days of training, and quadrant modeled as repeated measures, respectively. These analyses account for within-subject corrections across repeated measurements. The models also included treatment and sex as main effects, as well as interaction terms. Multiple pairwise comparisons were done with the Holm-Sidak method. A\np\n\u2264\u20090.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll procedures were approved by the University of Kentucky's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All mice were group housed at 3\u20135 mice per cage under a normal light cycle. Female 3- to 4-month-old C57/BL6J mice (Jackson Laboratories) were used for all experiments.\n\nSpinal cord injury\nFor the SCI surgery, anesthesia was induced using 5% isoflurane and mice were maintained at 2\u20133% during the procedure. Mice received a surgical laminectomy followed by a 75 kdyn vertebral level T9 contusion SCI (Infinite Horizons Impactor; IH) as previously described.\n13\n,\n14\nBased upon\na priori\nexclusion criteria, any mouse receiving an SCI with abnormalities in the force versus time curve generated by the IH device was excluded from analysis. Abnormalities meriting exclusion include bone hits or instability in the spinal cord at the time of injury and occurred in four mice (two from each group). After exclusion criteria were applied, force and displacement were similar between groups (force: vehicle\u2009=\u200976.42\u2009\u00b1\u20091.83 kdyn, ethanol\u2009=\u200977.17\u2009\u00b1\u20092.59 kdyn,\np\n=\u20090.421; displacement: vehicle\u2009=\u2009724.3\u2009\u00b1\u2009119.7\u2009\u03bcm, ethanol\u2009=\u2009655.0\u2009\u00b1\u200999.0\u2009\u03bcm,\np\n=\u20090.137). After injury, muscle and skin incisions were closed using monofilament suture. Mice that opened their incision more than once were excluded from the study. One mouse was excluded from the vehicle group for this reason. Mice received an analgesic (Buprenex SR, 1.0\u2009mg/kg) and antibiotic (1646RX, Enrofloxacin, 5.0\u2009mg/kg, Enroflox), as well as saline (1.0\u2009mL/day for 5 days) following surgery. Mice in the ethanol metabolism experiment did not receive analgesic or antibiotic until after the blood was collected to prevent hemodilution. Bladders from all SCI mice were manually expressed twice per day during the study.\n\nEthanol administration and plasma ethanol concentration measurements\nTo achieve a rapid and reproducible plasma ethanol concentration (PEC) of approximately 250\u2013300\u2009mg/dL, ethanol was delivered via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection 40\u201350\u2009min prior to SCI; i.p. administration was chosen over oral administration because compared with oral gavage i.p. injections of ethanol are more reproducible, safer for the animal, and cause a higher PEC.\n15\n,\n16\nA 250\u2013300\u2009mg/dL PEC range was ideal because it has been used previously in rodent models of SCI and it effectively models a binge-drinking episode in rodents.\n7\n,\n12\nIt is important to note that PEC is 1.09 to 1.18 times higher than BAC because serum and plasma samples contain more water than whole blood and alcohol is distributed uniformly throughout body water.\n17\nTo determine the effect of SCI and isoflurane anesthesia on ethanol metabolism, 14-week-old female mice (ethanol [etoh] group\nn\n=\u20098, isoflurane [iso] + etoh group\nn\n=\u200911, SCI+iso+etoh group\nn\n=\u200912) were given an i.p. injection of 20% (v/v) ethanol in saline at a dose of 3\u2009g/kg. The same dosing paradigm was used to assess functional recovery and tissue pathology. In the cohort of mice used to measure ethanol metabolism each mouse in the iso+etoh group was paired with a mouse from the SCI+iso+etoh group. Both mice were anesthetized for the same length of time and received the isoflurane dose via a dual output nose-cone system. Blood was taken approximately every hour after dosing and only one sample was taken from each mouse. Blood was collected from the facial vein into heparin-coated capillary tubes (16.440.100, Sarstedt) and transferred into 1.5\u2009mL ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-coated tubes. Plasma was separated from whole blood via centrifugation for 10\u2009min at 1500\ng\nat room temperature. Plasma was isolated and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until plasma ethanol concentration was measured using the Analox AM1 Analyser (Analox Instruments). The Analox AM1 Analyser uses an alcohol oxidase enzyme-based detection assay to quantify ethanol concentration in a sample. The alcohol oxidase enzyme catalyzes the reaction of ethanol and oxygen into acetaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide. The instrument measures the rate of oxygen consumption, which is directly proportional to sample ethanol concentration. All samples were run in triplicate and an average of the three values were used as the PEC.\n\nBehavioral analysis\nLocomotor assessments were made using the CatWalk XT Gait Analysis System (Noldus) and the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS).\n18\nFor CatWalk analysis, mice underwent three testing sessions: 1 week prior to injury and 4 and 6 weeks post-injury (wpi). The CatWalk features a red overhead light and green illuminated walkway that reflects light in response to the contact of the mouse's paw that is then captured via calibrated video recordings. Gait analysis was performed by the same researcher in a dark room. Animals were acclimated in the room for 30\u2009min prior to testing. For a single run, the mouse was first placed in the open end of the CatWalk under the red ceiling light and allowed to walk across the walkway to the darkened escape enclosure. Each mouse completed three continuous runs on each analysis day and a minimum of three valid runs, or complete walkway crossings, were obtained for each subject. Trials in which the mouse stopped or turned around during a run were excluded from analysis. Mice that did not complete three continuous runs after 25 attempts were excluded from analysis.\nThe BMS utilizes a 9-point rating scale to characterize gross locomotor functions ranging from complete paralysis (score 0) to normal functions (score 9) as mice explore an open field for 4\u2009min.\n18\nBMS scores were obtained at 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 days post-injury (dpi) by two experimental raters who were blinded to treatment groups. In the week prior to injury animals were acclimated to the sandbox used for BMS scoring once for 5\u2009min. Each hindlimb was scored separately based on movement (e.g., ankle placement and stepping), coordination, and trunk stability. Averaging both hindlimb scores generated a single score for each mouse. BMS sub-scores were derived from observations made during BMS scoring. BMS sub-scores are based on features of locomotion such as trunk stability, coordination, and paw placement that are observable in higher-functioning mice.\n18\nBMS sub-scores permitted a better resolution to differentiate between mice with higher BMS scores.\n\nHargreaves thermal sensitivity assessment\nThe Hargreaves test of thermal hypersensitivity was used as previously described\n19\nand modified for mice\n20\n,\n21\n(37370, Ugo Basile, Germany). Mice were acclimated to testing boxes (37370, Ugo Basile, Germany) for 2\u2009h/day for 2 days prior to testing and acclimated for 1\u2009h prior to data acquisition. Testing was performed pre-SCI and at 42\u2009dpi. For each test, an infrared laser was aimed at the plantar surface of each hindpaw. The laser is calibrated to reach a maximum temperature of 55\u00b0C over a 25-sec period. The time at which the animal responded to the thermal stimulus was recorded. Responses were only counted if they were a deliberate flinch, indicated by an abrupt lifting and replacement of the paw, sometimes followed by licking of the paw. Responses in which mice moved without an explicit reaction to the heat were not considered valid. Each mouse's paws were given at least 1\u2009min of rest in between trials. Many mice were tested simultaneously, which enabled the experimental tester to switch between mice regularly. Three response times were obtained per hindfoot and the six recorded times for both feet were averaged to generate one score per mouse per time-point.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nAt 42\u2009dpi mice were anesthetized using an overdose of ketamine (4.0\u20135.0\u2009mg) and xylazine (0.4\u20130.5\u2009mg) and euthanized via transcardial perfusion using phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% formaldehyde (Millipore Sigma). Spinal cords were extracted and post-fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 2\u2009h at room temperature before being transferred to 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffer (PB) overnight. Spinal cords were dehydrated in 30% sucrose for a week and embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (4583, Sakura Finetek USA, Inc.). Five spinal cords were embedded in each OCT block with 2\u20133 cords per group randomly selected. Serial 10\u2009\u03bcm coronal sections were collected on ColorFrost Plus Microscope Slides (22-037-246, Fisher Scientific). Ten sets of tissue were generated that spanned the length of the lesion and the distance between each section on a single slide was 100\u2009\u03bcm.\nAll slide-mounted sections received antigen retrieval at 80\u00b0C in sodium citrate buffer with 0.1% Tween-20 (pH 6.0) for 5\u2009min. Sections were then treated with 0.3% H\n2\nO\n2\nin 40% methanol and PBS for 30\u2009min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. Next, sections were blocked in 5% normal goat serum in PBS/0.1% Triton-X 100 for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Sections were then stained overnight at room temperature with neurofilament-200\u2009kD (1:1500; Ck x NF200; NFH, Aves Labs). Sections were washed twice in PBS followed by 1-h long incubation with biotinylated secondary antibody (1:500; Goat anti-chicken, BA9010, Vector Laboratories). Sections were then incubated in avidin biotin complex solution (ABC; 1:200; PK-6100, Vector Laboratories) and developed using 3,3\u2019-diaminobenzidine (DAB; SK-4100, Vector Laboratories). Sections were counter-stained with eriochrome cyanine to visualize spared white matter. Stained slides were dehydrated using graded ethanol dilutions, cleared using Histoclear (101412-878, VWR Scientific), and coverslipped using Permount (SP15-500, Fisher Scientific). Slides were imaged using Axioscan (model Z1, Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, GE) at 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification and visualized and quantified using Halo software (Indica Labs, Albuquerque, NM, USA).\nTissue sparing was assessed by tracing intact white and gray matter at 100\u2009\u03bcm intervals throughout a 1.4\u2009mm span of the lesion centered on the lesion epicenter. The lesion epicenter was quantitatively defined as the section containing the least amount of spared tissue. All analyzed sections were oriented with respect to the lesion epicenter. Lesion length was defined as the total span of the spinal cord in which at least 5% of the cord area was negative for both myelin and axons (i.e., 5% damaged).\n\nExclusion criteria summary\nSixteen mice were originally included in each group. Of the 16 original mice in the vehicle group: 4 mice were excluded because of abnormalities in the force\u2009\u00d7\u2009displacement curve during injury and 1 mouse was excluded for reopening its sutures multiple times;\nn\n=\u200911 from the vehicle group for behavioral evaluation. Of the 16 mice in the ethanol group, 2 were excluded for abnormalities in the force\u2009\u00d7\u2009displacement, 1 did not survive the surgery, and 2 were euthanized for extremely poor recovery after SCI at 1\u2009dpi;\nn\n=\u200910 from the ethanol group for behavioral evaluation. During analyses of tissue pathology, one block of 5 mice was excluded due to excessive tissue loss due to spinal cord sections falling off the slides. This block included 2 previously excluded subjects and 2 additional mice from the vehicle group and 1 from the ethanol group. Final numbers for anatomical analyses:\nn\n=\u20099 for vehicle and\nn\n=\u20099 for ethanol group.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism software (v9.4.1, Boston, MA, USA). Simple linear regression was used to quantify ethanol metabolism rate. Metabolism rates were compared using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). AUC comparisons were made using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Holm-Sidak post hoc tests. BMS scores, sub-scores, and regularity index scores between treatment groups and over time were compared using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA also with Holm-Sidak post hoc tests. Paw withdrawal latency, stride length, print area, and regularity index comparisons were made with a two-way ANOVA. The lesion area at the epicenter and lesion length were compared using a Student's\nt\n-test. The lesion area over the length of the lesion was compared using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA with Fischer's post hoc tests.\nP\n\u2264\u20090.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "All procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Virginia (UVA) and the study protocol was approved by the Naval Medical Research Center Institutional Review Board in compliance with all applicable federal regulations governing the protection of human subjects. The investigators have adhered to the policies for protection of human subjects as prescribed in AR 70-25.\n\nInformed consent was provided by all participants and procedures were performed during a 1-day evaluation at UVA. A total of 21 SMs were recruited into experimental and control groups for the study. SMs were screened for inclusion in the study by a SOCOM nurse practitioner located at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida. SMs within the experimental group must have had a prior history of blast exposure in training or operations. Subjects in the control group must not have had a history of previous exposure to explosives, including but not limited to explosive entry (breacher) operations/training, heavy weapons use, and/or explosives ordinance disposal (EOD). A history of moderate or severe TBI as defined by the American Congress of Rehabilitation, MRI contraindications, current severe medical condition, current diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) disorder other than mild TBI, and any cardiac, respiratory, or other medical condition that may affect cerebral metabolism were all criteria for exclusion from the study.\n\nDemographics, clinical history, and neuropsychological assessment\nParticipant history was acquired, including demographics, military history, and medical history, along with a head injury questionnaire. The head injury questionnaire included eliciting a history of cause of injury, age of injury, loss of consciousness, presence of amnesia related to the event, changes in mood, sleep problems, or other associated clinical symptoms. Additionally, subjects were administered the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC) Blast Exposure Threshold Survey (BETS).\n22\nThe BETS elicits information on exposure to weapons and explosives, injury history, auditory symptoms, vestibular symptoms, mood issues, sleep issues, and cognitive symptoms. Neuropsychological testing and administered inventories included the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics 4 TBI-MIL (ANAM4 TBI-MIL), Combat Exposure Scale (CES), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWI), and Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI).\n\nGeneralized blast exposure value (GBEV)\nThe BETS with the accompanying GBEV was recently developed specifically for military SMs to relate the type and amount of blast exposure to reported symptomology.\n22\nThis value is analogous to the Cumulative Head Impact Index (CHII) for former high school and college football players.\n23\nThe motivation for such measures is to simultaneously characterize a specific population and identify brain trauma exposure, relate that exposure to outcomes, and determine a threshold for increased risk of long-term problematic health outcomes. Analogously, the GBEV is determined by the following formula:\nG\nB\nE\nV\n=\n0\n.\n976\n1\nB\nE\nC\n+\n288\n2\nB\nE\nC\n+\n41\n3\nB\nE\nC\n+\n77\n4\nB\nE\nC\n4\nf\nr\ne\nq\n+\n75\n5\nB\nE\nC\n5\nf\nr\ne\nq\nwhere\nBEC\nis the \u201cblast exposure count\u201d defined as the product of 1) years of experience with a weapon, 2) months of experience per year, 3) days of experience per month, and 4) number of exposures per day. Categorization of Light arms, Artillery, Recoilless rifles, and Explosives (CLARE) are denoted for each term in parentheses: (1BEC) small arms; (2BEC) large arms (including shoulder-fired); (3BEC) artillery (or large weapons carried by a vehicle); (4BEC) small explosives; and (5BEC) large explosives.\nfreq\nrefers to the daily frequency variable for each category.\n\nSerum biomarkers\nAll samples were measured in a fully blinded manner. Blood samples were collected into tubes with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and centrifuged before being aliquoted and placed in the freezer at \u221280\u00b0C for long-term storage. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) were isolated from thawed samples as previously published.\n24\nOf thawed samples, 500\u2009\u03bcL were defibrinated with thromboplastin D and incubated at room temperature for 30\u2009min before centrifuging for 5\u2009min at 10,000\ng\nat 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was transferred into fresh tubes with added ExoQuick exosome solution, mixed, and incubated for 60\u2009min at 4\u00b0C before centrifuging. The resulting pellet containing all EVs was resuspended in 500\u2009\u03bcL ultra-pure water and placed at \u221280\u00b0C for long-term storage. EVs were precipitated by using ExoQuick plasma prep and exosome precipitation kits (System Bioscience, Inc.). Five microliters of thrombin (5000\u2009U/mL in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) were added to 500\u2009\u03bcL plasma to a final concentration of 5\u2009U/mL thrombin. Tubes were incubated at room temperature (25\u00b0C) for 5\u2009min while gently mixing prior to centrifugation at 10,000\u2009rpm for 5\u2009min. The resulting supernatant was transferred to a new tube with ExoQuick to precipitate EVs for 30\u201360\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. Then, vials were centrifuged at 1500\ng\nfor 30\u2009min. The resulting EV pellet at the bottom of the tube was resuspended in 500\u2009\u03bcL of PBS.\nBDEVs were enriched in aqueous solution by precipitating with neuronal-specific antibodies SNAP25, PSA-NCAM, and CD171 from total circulating EVs from the plasma. Exosomal and plasma levels of tau, neurofilament light chain (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were analyzed using a high-sensitivity Simoa HD-X analyzer (Quanterix, Lexington, MA, USA) and a paramagnetic bead-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Coefficient of variation (intra- and inter-plate) values were below 15% for all analytes. Coreplex cytokines panel of IL-6, IL-10, and TNF\u03b1 were analyzed using an SP-X Imaging and Analysis System (Quanterix). Because the array volumes are approximately 2 billion times smaller than an ELISA, a rapid buildup of fluorescent product is generated if labeled protein is present, and it provides detection ability between 100 and 1000 times that of ELISA methods. With diffusion defeated, this high local concentration of product can be readily observed. Samples were distributed randomly across plates and all assays were run in duplicate.\n\nRadiotracer synthesis\n[\n18\nF]DPA-714 was synthesized in accordance with U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP)<823> guidelines by the University of Virginia Radiochemistry Core, as previously described.\n25\n[\n18\nF]DPA-714 was synthesized in a 13.5\u2009\u00b1\u20093.04% radiochemical yield (EOB) with a molar activity of 34.3\u2009\u00b1\u20099.9 Ci/\n\u03bc\nmol (1258\u2009\u00b1\u2009366 GBq/\n\u03bc\nol;\nn\n=\u20093) in a total synthesis time of 90\u2009min. In all cases, radiochemical purity was >99%.\n\nNeuroimaging\nPET-CT\nImaging was performed with a Siemens Biograph mCT (PET-CT) scanner (Siemens Healthineers, Knoxville, TN, USA). Measurements of body height and weight were performed before scan acquisition. A computed tomography (CT) scan was performed with a 100 mAs tube current, 100\u2009kV voltage, 64\u2009\u00d7\u20090.6\u2009mm collimation, pitch of 0.55, reconstruction at a 2-mm slice thickness, and scanning time of 17.3\u2009sec. Subjects received an intravenous, bolus injection of [\n18\nF]DPA-714 (296\u2009\u00b1\u200917\u2009MBq) at the onset of a 90-min dynamic list mode PET acquisition. Genotyping was performed to determine TSPO polymorphism status for each subject. PET image reconstruction was performed at an image size of 400 with a 2.0 amplification factor and Gaussian filter with a full-width half maximum of 2.0. The TrueX + time of flight (TOF) method was used with five iterations and 21 subsets. Attenuation correction was performed using the NeuroAC calculated attenuation correction method.\n26\nUsing MiM version 6.9.7, (MiM Software, Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA), reconstructed and attenuation corrected images underwent motion correction, and static images binned at 20\u201390\u2009min were generated using SumIP.\nMRI\nMRI neuroimaging was employed and the protocol included three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted imaging (isotropic 1.0-mm spatial resolution), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI; (isotropic 1.5-mm spatial resolution, multi-shell with b-values of 1500 and 3000\u2009s/mm\n2\n; 98 directions), resting state blood oxygen dependent (BOLD) imaging (10-min resting state acquisition, isotropic 2-mm spatial resolution, and 800-msec temporal resolution), susceptibility weighted imaging (3D gradient echo), and 3D arterial spin labeling (ASL; gradient-and spin-echo [GRASE] acquisition module and pseudo-continuous blood tagging). In addition, calibration/correction data were acquired to characterize spatial distortions in echo-planar-based acquisitions (BOLD and diffusion) and static field inhomogeneity. All data were collected on a state-of-the-art 3 Tesla MR scanner (Prisma, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) using a 64-channel head radiofrequency coil. The total acquisition time was roughly 1.5\u2009h.\n\nData processing\nProcessing and quantification of the previously described imaging data employed multiple packages including MRtrix3 and the various libraries available within the ANTsX software ecosystem (\nFig. 1\n). Derived imaging data used in this study included cortical thickness maps from T1-weighted MRI, diffusivity-based scalar images (e.g., fractional anisotropy) from diffusion-weighted MRI, functional scalar activation summarized via amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), and network correlation maps. Summary perfusion and PET scalar images were also generated for each subject. ANTs tools\n27\nwere used to register each T1-weighted image to an average population template as used in previous studies.\n28\nSubsequently, each subject-specific scalar image was aligned to the corresponding T1-weighted image, thus providing a set of transformations to warp each image to the common template space.\n27\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nNeuroimage processing diagram for this study. Following image acquisition, computational processing generates several derived images per subject, which are registered to the study template via each subject's T1-weighted MRI. These aligned images are organized per modality, which are reduced in terms of dimensionality to representative bases using the SiMLR framework. CT, computed tomography; FA, fractional anisotropy; fALFF, fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; PET, positron emission tomography; SiMLR, Similarity-driven Multi-view Linear Reconstruction.\nDetails concerning modality-specific processing are as follows.\nDiffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)\nThe standard MRtrix3 pipeline\n29\nwas used for diffusion tensor reconstruction and subsequent generation of diffusivity maps, specifically those corresponding to fractional anisotropy (FA) and radial diffusivity (RD). Pre-processing steps included denoising,\n30\nwhole-brain extraction,\n31\nand tensor reconstruction.\n32\nThe average diffusion-weighted MR image was normalized to the corresponding T1-weighted MR image. Motion and eddy current correction were incorporated into the pipeline using the dwifslpreproc MRtrix3 program, which interfaces with the underlying FMRIB Software Library commands eddy, topup, and applytopup.\n33\n,\n34\nCortical thickness\nANTsX employs a registration-based framework for estimating cortical thickness\n35\nthat has been tailored and evaluated for both cross-sectional and longitudinal\n36\nMR data. More recently, a deep-learning-based framework has been developed and evaluated\n37\ndemonstrating both superior measurement quality and increased computational efficiency. Briefly, processing includes brain extraction, brain parcellation based on six tissue types (i.e., cerebrospinal fluid [CSF], gray matter, white matter, deep gray matter, brainstem, and cerebellum), and application of the diffeomorphic registration based cortical thickness (DiReCT) cortical thickness algorithm.\n35\nThis yields a scalar image with non-zero values in the cortical gray matter providing a voxelwise estimate of thickness (in millimeters).\nResting-state fMRI\nResting-state functional MRI (fMRI) processing, performed in the R-based ANTs interface (ANTsR), has been described previously.\n8\n,\n38\nBriefly, motion correction was applied to each time series. Nuisance parameters included the transformation parameters, the framewise displacement,\n39\nand component-based method (CompCor) contributions.\n40\nSummary images from the corrected time series included fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF).\n41\n,\n42\nCerebral blood flow (CBF) from first-pass perfusion imaging\nSimilar to the other image time series, the mean spatial image was generated and used as the reference image for motion correction. CBF images were generated using a singular value decomposition technique\n43\nwith the arterial input function generated automatically.\n44\nVisual inspection of the CBF images revealed non-biological artifacts that persisted after standard confound modeling and processing. Consequently, CBF was excluded from the statistical analysis.\nPET\nPET images were also motion-corrected using ANTsX tools. The toolbox for partial volume correction (PVC) in PET (PETPVC),\n45\nwhich provides several published methods for performing PVC, was used for additional pre-processing. Finally, after inspecting several anatomical regions and the range of PET activity, values were normalized for each subject based on the corresponding PET values in the left and right caudate. These segmented regions were identified using the corresponding T1-weighted image and the Desikan-Killiany-Tourville labeling protocol available in ANTsXNet.\n37\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe multifaceted neurological effects stemming from blast exposure necessitate multiple observations/measurements to characterize the associated structural, functional, and metabolic sequelae. In this study, the battery of measurements included multi-modal neuroimaging, self-reported or clinical neuropsychological assessment, and blood biomarkers. Such measurements can be inherently noisy and incomplete while simultaneously mutually overlapping and complementary. A recently developed statistical framework, known as similarity-driven multi-view linear reconstruction (SiMLR),\n46\nhas been employed for exploring and analyzing such data. Successful application includes a recent investigation into a career breacher cohort characterized by repetive low-level blast exposure\n8\nwhere the use of SiMLR permitted identification of significant group effects spanning multiple modalities, including those mentioned previously.\nBriefly, SiMLR is a multi-view extension of earlier techniques (i.e., single-view eigenanatomy\n47\n,\n48\nand dual-view sparse canonical correlation analysis [SCCAN]).\n49\n,\n50\nEach of these techniques is rooted in principal component analysis (PCA) with additional spatial constraints specifically tailored for neuroimaging data.\n46\nAkin to PCA, these techniques are used for principled data dimensionality reduction\u2014an important consideration in the context of neuroimaging where a single image can contain several orders of magnitude of statistically dependent data. In this way, and in contrast to standard mass voxelwise univariate\n51\nor region of interest (ROI)-based approaches,\n52\n,\n53\nstatistical power is conserved by clustering data prior to statistical testing and adjustment for multiple comparisons, analogous to principal components regression.\n54\nSiMLR's default setting identifies low-dimensional embeddings that optimize the joint predictive power between all modalities equally. We instead use a path modeling approach\n46\n,\n55\nwhere SiMLR optimizes the predictive power from PET to the other modalities and from each MRI modality to PET. This strategy guarantees that the PET neuroinflammation modality drives the nature of the learned features across all modalities.\nFormally, through SiMLR optimization, the\ni\nt\nh\nmodality,\nX\ni\n, is represented by a pair of matrices\nU\ni\n,\nV\ni\nwhere the columns of\nU\ni\nare the low-dimensional bases spanning\nX\ni\nand the columns of\nV\ni\nare the regularized, sparse representation of each modality component. As mentioned previously, this permits principal component regressions of the form:\nU\ni\n,\nl\n\u223c\nd\n0\n+\nd\n1\n+\n\u2026\n+\nd\nn\nwhere the set of\nd\nj\nrepresents the explanatory variables (e.g., age, gender, and brain volume) and\nl\ndenotes the specific basis vector of the\ni\nt\nh\nsolution.\nTo explore the relationship between GBEV, control, or exposed status (denoted as\na\nr\nm\nt\nbelow) and the imaging modalities, the following quasi-Poisson regression model was used:\n56\u201358\ng\nG\nB\nE\nV\n\u223c\n\u03b2\na\nA\ng\ne\n+\n\u03b2\nc\no\nt\nh\ne\nr\nC\no\nn\n+\n\u03b2\nt\na\nr\nm\nt\n+\n\u03b2\nm\nl\nU\nm\no\nd\na\nl\ni\nt\ny\n,\nl\nwhere each\n\u03b2\nis a coefficient,\ng\nis the\nlog\nlink function,\n56\nAge\nis subject age, and\notherCon\nrepresents the number of reported concussions from non-blast-related events. Quasi-Poisson regression models are appropriate for count or frequency data such as GBEV that is often non-Gaussian/overdispersed.\n58\nThe\nmodality\nis one of\nPET\n,\nCT\ncortical thickness from T1-weighted MRI,\nFA\n(fractional anisotropy from DTI),\nfALFF\n(resting state), or\nJacobian\n(a measure of localized volumetric change relative to a study template).\n59\n\nCritical GBEV threshold analysis\nThe above equation allows modeling the non-linear relationship between imaging variables and GBEV while controlling for baseline exposure level (\na\nr\nm\nt\n), age, and concussions. The discrete control/exposed variable\na\nr\nm\nt\ndefines a split of the cohort based on a GBEV threshold\nt\nwhere\nt\nvaries between 9875.6 and 177,424 at discrete points determined by the values of our cohort. The threshold 65,309 corresponds to the original operator (\nn\n=\u20099) versus non-operator (\nn\n=\u20099) grouping. The regression parameter\n\u03b2\nm\nl\non the term\nU\nm\no\nd\na\nl\ni\nt\ny\n,\nl\nis our key outcome of interest for statistical testing; it represents the degree to which the relationship between the modality's\nl\nt\nh\nfeature embedding and the total GBEV score accelerates in exposed subjects. In particular, we test for significant relationships between imaging variables (primary outcomes from PET with secondary outcomes from MRI) and GBEV after controlling for the other covariates. We assess significance of the\n\u03b2\nm\nl\ncoefficients via permutation testing where the GBEV score is permuted 50,000 times per model. This empirical approach to\np\n-value calculation is generally more conservative than model-based methods and leads to a minimum\np\n-value of 2e-05.\n\nAnalysis of biomarker and cognitive measurements\nWe adopt the same quasi-Poisson model as described above but instead use BDEVs or cognitive measures as predictors instead of SiMLR imaging components. In addition, we analyze these relationships only at a single threshold of \u226565,309, which is consistent with the original control versus exposed grouping."

    "Methods": "Overall study design\nThe CARE4Kids research program uses a two-cohort longitudinal methodology. The DC will undergo testing using the Developmental Test Battery (DTB) of multi-modal biomarkers developed in the three Research Cores. The DC sample will be recruited from multiple sources including emergency departments, urgent care centers, primary care clinics, and specialty clinics. These DC markers were chosen based on differential time course, potential for treatable targets, and longitudinal correlation with PPCS outcome. These biomarkers include autonomic nervous system measurements, MRI neuroimaging, and biofluid tests. The most predictive and scalable DC measures will be incorporated into the Validation Test Battery (VTB) and collected in the second phase, the Validation Cohort (VC). The VC will be recruited from the same Care4Kids consortium sites but expanded to include additional primary care clinics/networks and emergency departments (acutely/subacutely at T1) and followed to 3 months post-initial assessment. In this more generalizable VC, the endophenotype clinical and biomarker measures will be validated as prognostic tools in a risk stratification algorithm, which will set the stage for future studies of treatment for PPCS.\nWe will also enroll a cohort of 100 typically developing, non-concussed youth ages 11.00-17.99 years who will be used to develop normative data of autonomic function for comparing typically developing youth and youth with concussion.\n\nStudy population, eligibility criteria, and recruitment\nThe study subjects are enrolled at each of the six sites across the Care4Kids consortium (University of California at Los Angeles, University of Washington/Seattle Children's, Children's National Research Institute, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, University of Rochester, and Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Hospital). They are being recruited from concussion subspecialty clinics, primary care clinics, emergency departments, athletic trainers who work for the institutions of the investigators, and athletic teams through presentations to teams and parents. Study participants are adolescents of any gender with the following inclusion criteria:\n1.\nAges 11 to 17.99 years, and\n2.\nDiagnosed with a concussion by a health care provider using Concussion in Sport Group criteria,\n5\nand\n3.\nEnglish speaking (parents can be English or Spanish speakers), and\n4.\nAble to be scheduled for the first research visit (T1) < 35 days post-injury, and\n5.\nContinuing to experience post-concussion symptoms at T1, defined as experiencing at least one symptom \u201cmore than usual\u201d relative to pre-injury status.\nSubjects meeting the inclusion criteria are further screened for any of the following exclusion criteria:\n1.\nDiagnosis of severe autism or other significant developmental delay limiting active participation in the protocol, or\n2.\nSignificant neurological disorder (any neurodegenerative disorder, stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, epilepsy) but migraine not excluded, or\n3.\nSevere psychiatric illness or substance abuse (actively suicidal, psychosis), or\n4.\nHistory of moderate or severe TBI (other than concussion), or\n5.\nConcussion within the last 3 months if asymptomatic at time of evaluation, or any prior concussion if still symptomatic, or\n6.\nInability to read or sign assent/consent.\nIn addition to screening at the sites mentioned above, study information is also distributed at local athletic leagues, schools, and community outreach events to raise awareness of the study. After screening subjects, informed consent and assent is obtained either in person or through electronic consent. Approximately 370 subjects will be enrolled during the DC and approximately 350 subjects will be enrolled during the VC; this is further explained below in the section on \u201cExpected power.\u201d\nScreened and eligible patients are enrolled by research staff using institutional review board\u2013approved parent consent and teen assent forms. Enrolled participants then proceed with the longitudinal research design as outlined in the Participant Flow Diagram (\nFig. 1\n); each of the T1 and T3 assessments takes approximately 5\u2009h to complete. Individuals with metal braces are eligible but will automatically be assigned to the non-imaging group. Financial incentives are offered to both the child and the parent for each visit at T1 and T3; youth completing 6 of 7 days on MyCap (an application that allows outcome data capture via mobile device) are entered into a weekly lottery for an additional $50 incentive.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nPatient flow diagram for the Discovery Cohort. T0, Date of injury; C, Screen, consent; R, imaging opt out/in; i, neuroimaging conducted; T1, Study visit, labs drawn; T2, Remote engagement with app; T3, Study visit, labs drawn; T4, Remote engagement with app.\nWe will also recruit a control group of typically developing youth ages 11.00-17.99 years who are English speaking but who do not have a history of concussion. The same exclusion criteria for the concussed youth will also apply to them. These individuals will only be studied once and receive the same baseline assessments as the concussed group, but will not receive any MRI examination or blood tests.\n\nBaseline assessments\nThe baseline assessment (T1) is administered between 7 and 35 days post-injury. Participants undergo the complete test battery, including participant and parent questionnaires, autonomic protocol, headache phenotyping examination, neurocognitive assessment, and blood sample. We also document through parent questionnaire whether other injuries occurred at the time of the event resulting in concussion. Participants undergo MRI neuroimaging at the baseline time-point in addition to the other tests above. A summary of the visit schedule is shown in\nFigure 2\nand the flow through the procedures of the visit is shown as\nFigure 3\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nStudy visit schedule for the Discovery Cohort.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nCARE4Kids study visit timeline. Target timeline for a CARE4Kids study visit including a 15-min break.\n\nNeuropsychological and headache protocol\nPersistent cognitive problems following mild TBI (mTBI) in adolescents likely reflect central nervous system (CNS) and autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction, and may be influenced by psychosocial factors, and individual variations in pre-injury function. We therefore collect a rich set of information on premorbid psychosocial function, injury characteristics, and CNS and ANS markers to identify risk factors for adverse cognitive outcomes that can be used to guide timely and effective interventions. The neuropsychological protocol for the study encompasses standardized neurocognitive testing, standardized questionnaires, and a demographic/clinical history questionnaire devised for this protocol.\nCognitive measures\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox Cognition measures assess the participant's neurocognitive functioning (\nTable 1A\n). Fluid, crystallized and overall cognitive abilities will be assessed, including attention/executive functioning, working memory, episodic memory, language, and processing speed. The specific subtests administered include the age-appropriate versions of the Picture Vocabulary Test, List Sorting Working Memory Test, Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Test, Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test, and Auditory Verbal Learning Test. The total time allocated for the Toolbox is approximately 20\u2009min. The NIH Toolbox cognitive measures have shown robust reliability and validity compared to gold standard cognitive measures in children.\n14\nTable 1A.\nNIH Toolbox Subtests Administered\nTest Name\nType\nDomain\nTime (min)\nDescription\nNotes\nPicture Vocabulary\nCrystallized\nLanguage\n4\nIdentify one of four photos that matches the word heard presented\niPad\nFlanker Task\nFluid\nAttentional Control/Executive\n3\nIdentify the orientation of a fish or an arrow in the middle of the screen and while inhibiting (ignoring) the orientation of the stimuli around it\niPad Home Base\nList Sorting\nFluid\nWorking Memory\n7\nRecall a list of animals, foods, or foods and animals from smallest to largest\nKeyboard and Answer Sheet for RA input\nPattern Comparison\nFluid\nProcessing Speed\n3\nCompare 2 pictures and decide if they are the same or different as quickly as possible\niPad\nRey Auditory Verbal Learning\nFluid\nVerbal Memory\n3\nRecall a list of words presented over three trials\nRA records responses on iPad\nOpen in a separate window\nNIH, National Institutes of Health; RA, research assistant.\nIn coordination with the NIH Toolbox, the Children's Exertional Effects Rating Scale (ChEERS), a 7-item dimensional rating scale of key post-concussion symptoms, will be administered immediately before and after the cognitive tests (NIH Toolbox) to measure changes in symptoms attributable to cognitive exertion.\n15\nExertional effects have been shown to be predictive of outcome above and beyond cognitive performance and Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI) symptom ratings.\n16\nSymptoms Reports (\nTable 1B\n). The primary post-concussion tracking tool in the study is the PCSI,\n17\n,\n18\nwhich was designed for patients in our age group. Both self and parent reports are collected at each study time-point (in person and remote visits). At T1, both participant and parents are asked to rate the participant's pre-injury symptoms to allow us to obtain a baseline of symptom load unrelated to injury. In addition, the Post-Concussion Executive Inventory (PCEI), validated for concussion, is administered to both participants and parents to identify real-world deficits in executive functioning. The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)\n19\nmodified for concussive symptoms is administered to measure how catastrophizing about concussive symptoms might negatively impact experiences of those symptoms and potentially impact recovery. This measure has been used to identify negative cognitions that predict poor outcome following concussions.\n20\nWe will also assess the child's exposure to adverse childhood events (ACEs), using the adolescent self-report Pediatric ACEs and Related Life-events Screener (PEARLS). Additional measures of personal, psychological, and family factors to measure the biopsychosocial tapestry of concussion risk are administered (see\nTables 1A\nand\n\u200b\nand1B\n1B\nfor full list of measures). The participant questionnaires take approximately 35-45\u2009min to administer. The parent questionnaires take approximately 30\u2009min to complete.\nTable 1B.\nNeuropsychological Battery Administered\nMeasure\nSelf (min)\nParent (min)\n# items\nType\nPost-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI)\n4\n4\nSet\nPost-Concussion Executive Inventory (PCEI)\n4\n4\nSet\nShort STAI (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), State\n1\n\u2013\n6\nSet\nK-CAT (psychiatric symptoms)\n7\n5\nCAT\nPain Catastrophizing Scale (modified)\n2\n2\n13\nSet\nCLASS-3 (school probs and stress response)\n4\n4\nSet\nPROMIS - Sleep\n2\n2\n4 or 10\nCAT\nDemographic/Clinical History\n4\n5\nvariable\nSet\nPubertal Development Scale (PDS)\n2\n\u2013\nSet\nHIT 6 (migraine severity and PEDS MIDAS (migraine related quality of life)\n2\n\u2013\nSet\nMulti-dimensional Assessment of Parenting Style (MAPS)\n\u2013\n5\n34\nSet\nParenting Style Inventory-II (PSI-II)\n4\n\u2013\n15\nSet\nConnor-Davidson Resilience Scale\n4\n\u2013\n25\nSet\nPACE Self-Efficacy\n4\n\u2013\n17\nSet\nFamily Resources Scale (FRS)\n\u2013\n5\nSet\nAdverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)\n2\nSet\nMinutes (total)\n44\n38\nOpen in a separate window\nMAPS measures family functioning (e.g., dimensions of warmth, supportiveness, hostility, etc.).\nCAT, computer adapted test.\n\nHeadache\nThis portion of the study is targeted towards better defining endophenotypes leading to post-traumatic headache (PTH). Classification based on current International Classification of Headache Disorders-3 criteria (which only broadly classifies post-traumatic headache)\n21\nmay not reflect complexities of PTH pathophysiology in the setting of concussion. A better understanding of PTH and associated neurological dysfunction may require a finer granularity of phenotypic characterization\u2014distinct from what has been developed for primary headache disorders. Determination of PTH phenotype may have practical importance not only in terms of predicting persisting symptoms, but also as an indicator of potential benefit of phenotype-specific therapies.\nWe postulate that migraine-like post-traumatic headache may be a unique post-concussion endophenotype with a distinct recovery timeline and markers that could be inferred from physical, imaging, autonomic or blood biomarkers. There are numerous components that will test this hypothesis. Extensive headache questionnaires are obtained at the T1 and T3 visits (\nTable 2\n). Headache questions were designed to integrate with the Headache and Concussion NINDS Common Data Elements (CDEs). We also chose to use the MyCap platform\n22\nto longitudinally monitor headache and associated features, medication use, and a basic indicator of sleep quantity to more fully characterize headache burden and characteristics from recruitment and the first study visit (T1) until the recovery visit (T3). We are also utilizing validated migraine disability assessment tools at the T1 and T3 research visits, the Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment (PedsMIDAS),\n23\n,\n24\nand Headache Impact Test 6 (HIT 6).\n25\nTable 2.\nSymptoms and Examination Checklist for Headache Assessment\nT1 symptoms:\nPresence of headache\nYes/no\nHeadache temporal features\nOnset of headache after injury (days), frequency (or continuous)\nHeadache Severity\n1-10 pain scale\nHeadache Quality\nPulsating/constant/stabbing\nHeadache Location\nUnilateral/bilateral, frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital, vertex, global\nAssociated symptoms\nLight/sound sensitivity, Nausea/anorexia\nMigraine aura symptoms\nVision, sensory, language, motor symptoms\nCranial autonomic symptoms\nEye redness/tearing, nasal discharge\nOther associated symptoms\nCognitive dysfunction, fatigue\nNeck pain\nWith or without headache\nDizziness, vertigo, and/or lightheadedness\nWith or without headache\nVision\nBlurred vision, double vision, difficulty focusing, difficulty reading\nExacerbating/relieving\nMovement/activity, upright vs. supine posture, menstrual period if applicable\nPrior headache history\nPrevious history of migraine diagnosis/ severe headache of any kind\nFamily history\nFamily history of migraine diagnosis/severe headache of any kind\nMedication use\nAnalgesics, oral contraceptives, stimulants, antidepressants\nCaffeine use\nCannabis use\nExamination\nVital signs\nScreening neurological exam\nEvaluation of eye movements\nTest of convergence function\nNormal/abnormal\nOccipital nerve tenderness\nYes/no\nAnterior radiation of pain with occipital nerve pressure\nYes/no\nIpsilateral/contralateral neck pain on flexion, extension, rotation w/extension (facet load)\nYes/no\nOpen in a separate window\nHeadache Impact/Disability Metric: Headache Impact Test \u2013 6 (HIT-6)\nBetween T1 and T3 - Daily Phone Diary:\nPresence/absence of headache\nYes/no\nDuration of headache\nHours or continuous\nHeadache severity\n1-10 scale\nLocation of headache\nNausea\nYes/no\nLight or sound sensitivity\nYes/no\nDizziness or lightheadedness\nYes/no\nBlurred or double vision\nYes/no\nFlashing lights or wavy lines in vision\nYes/no\nMedication intake\nSpecify\nSleep\nHours\nOpen in a separate window\nT3 (second in-person visit)\nClinical features: Same as T1 without historical features\nExamination: same as T1\nOpen in a separate window\nAssociated with these headache features, we are characterizing blood-flow pathophysiology through advanced neuroimaging (arterial spin labeling; ASL) and white matter microstructure with diffusion tensor imaging and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). The prospective measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF) using ASL in this project has the potential to provide highly meaningful information regarding changes in blood flow as a mechanism of PTH and as an indicator of PPCS outcomes. Fluid biomarker data will also supplement this analysis, we are investigating pathophysiologic associations with pain neuropeptides such as calcitonin gene-related peptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, and Substance P.\nTo assess for physical examination markers that correlate with outcomes, research coordinators have been trained in a standardized head and neck examination, tailored for headache disorders, to assess for cervical and neurologic components of persistent posttraumatic headache (\nTable 2\n).\n\nAutonomic biomarker protocol\nThere is growing interest in the role of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in concussion because of major overlap in symptoms of concussion and dysautonomia. Many patients with concussion present with classic dysautonomic signs such as postural orthostatic tachycardia, headache, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, and anxiety.\n26\u201329\nConversely, many patients with autonomic disorders without brain injuries have similar symptoms as patients with concussion, including dizziness, vertigo, nausea, mood swings, anxiety, fatigue and intolerance to exercise, concentration and memory problems, and photophobia and phonophobia.\n5\nBrain regions that may be particularly vulnerable to head impact forces, such as limbic cortex, hypothalamus, and midbrain nuclei, are all key structures in the central autonomic network. In a recent review, 33 of 36 studies identified ANS anomalies in concussed athletes not found in non-athletes.\n26\nGiven the dearth of treatments for persistent concussion symptoms, autonomic dysregulation may be a promising target for new mechanistically grounded treatments.\nGiven the limitations in prior research, we designed a protocol to measure psychophysiological responses (heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory dynamics) under conditions shown in prior research to activate sympathetic and/or parasympathetic activity. In addition, we include a non-cardiovascular measure of autonomic function-the pupillary light response. A potentially important innovation is the use of an inexpensive wearable device (Scosche Armband)\n30\nto collect heart rate data in parallel with one of the most widely used electrocardiography systems to assess cardiac function in autonomic function research\u2014the Biopac system. If the data from the Schosche Armband provide heart rate data comparable to the Biopac system we will consider using it in the validation phase.\nThe autonomic assessment protocol continuously measures psychophysiological responses during several conditions designed to stimulate sympathetic and/or parasympathetic activity. The conditions (\nFig. 4\n) include heart-rate deep breathing, pupillary light response, cognitive/emotional challenge (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test), hand-grip test, and an active standing test. Each of the stressors is followed by a post-activation recovery period to measure the stress-response and recovery. The protocol is complicated, requiring presentation of instructions to participants about how to respond to a variety of tasks and different stimuli. To standardize the administration of instructions, presentation of stimuli, and acquisition of psychophysiological data across six data collection sites, stimulus presentation software (E-Prime) is used to deliver the instructions to participants, as well as the visual and auditory stimuli for all conditions, task timing and recording response. This approach reduces the burden on research staff allowing them to focus on ensuring proper signal acquisition. E-Prime directly interfaces with continuous data acquisition software (Biopac AcqKnowledge) and automatically time-locks task events. The Scosche Band collects data concurrently, but on a separate application.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 4.\nAutonomic protocol.\nHuman factors were strongly considered given the challenge of training research staff at six sites, anticipated staff turnover, and the need for ongoing quality control. To support research staff in navigating the detailed training and competency required for this project, all training information is housed on an interactive, online smart board, Miro.\n31\nThis website allows centralized hosting of training manuals, videos demonstrations, informational documents, updates to the protocol, and monitoring systems easily accessible through a visual format, which we believe facilitates training and protocol fidelity across sites. Research assistants undergo extensive training in how to connect electrodes, blood pressure cuffs, etc., to participants to acquire biologically accurate signals, and protocol administration using E-Prime. Since research sites are distributed across the country, experiment fidelity and data quality are ensured by verifying signal accuracy of the psychophysiological data and then by multiple live observation of study protocols conducted via zoom. This allows the research coordinators at UCLA to monitor both the participant and the data coming in.\n\nImaging biomarker protocol\nMulti-modal MRI can reveal and measure a wide spectrum of brain alterations in mTBI, beyond gross anatomical changes (\nTable 3\n). Diffusion MRI (dMRI) can model white matter (WM) tracts, and is acutely sensitive to microstructural alterations that result from mTBI, including axonal damage, glial and inflammatory responses, and edema.\n32\nSome studies using dMRI after sports related concussion show poorer WM organization after injury, correlated with plasma biomarkers of injury-related inflammatory processes.\nTable 3.\nImaging Modalities\nModality\nScan parameters\nDerived Measures\nUsefulness\nAnatomical MRI (T1w and T2w)\nVoxel size\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm\n3\n, 176-225 slices (T1w), 176-256 slices (T2w), scan time\u2009=\u20099-14\u2009min for both\nRegional cortical thickness and surface area, subcortical volumes for 96 regions\nMorphometry can be altered in children with concussion and TBI relative to neurotypical controls\ndMRI\nVoxel size\u2009=\u20091.7mm\n3\n, diffusion weighting\u2009=\u2009500 (6), 1000 (15), 2000 (15), 3000 (60), 81 slices, scan time\u2009=\u20097-9\u2009min\nStandard (tensor) and advanced DKI and NODDI metrics of WM microstructure; diffusivity metrics for 14 major WM tracts\nExamines tracts that have previously shown atypicality in children with concussion and TBI\nSWI/QSM\nVoxel size\u2009=\u20090.5-1.0\u2009\u00d7\u20090.5-1.0\u2009\u00d7\u20092.0-3.0\u2009mm\n3\n, scan time\u2009=\u20096\u2009min\nMagnetic susceptibility of biological tissue; regional T2\n*\nvalues\nReflects venous vasculature, hemosiderin microbleeds, and aspects of microstructure (e.g., iron, calcium, and myelin).\nrsfMRI\nVoxel size\u2009=\u20092.4\u2009mm\n3\n, 60 slices, TR\u2009=\u2009800\u2009msec, TE\u2009=\u200930\u2009msec, scan time\u2009=\u200920\u2009min (4\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009min runs)\nFunctional connectivity metrics using seeds from the 20-component analysis of the BrainMap activation database and rsfMRI dataset\nExamines functional activity and connectivity\nASL\nVoxel size\u2009=\u20091.8\u2009\u00d7\u20091.8\u2009\u00d7\u20094.0\u2009mm\n3\n, 26 slices, scan time\u2009=\u20095\u2009min\nRegional measures of cerebral blood flow\nMeasures perfusion\nOpen in a separate window\nMRI, magnetic resonance imaging; TBI, traumatic brain injury; dMRI, diffusion MRI; DKI, diffusion kurtosis imaging; NODDI, Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging; WM, white matter; SWI, susceptibility-weighted imaging; QSM, quantitative susceptibility mapping; rsfMRI, resting-state functional MRI; TR, repetition time; TE, echo time; ASL, arterial spin labeling.\nThe timing of assessment is critical for dMRI, however, as swelling and bleeding can alter measures.\n33\nWith resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), researchers can quantify disruptions in coordinated functional activity across the brain. In acute mTBI, alterations in functional connectivity have been detected,\n34\n,\n35\nand may be predictive of cognitive performance months later.\n34\nSimilar results have been shown in sports-related mTBI, with acute alterations that resolved later.\n36\n,\n37\nAlthough rsfMRI studies can identify disruptions in acute mTBI, challenges in interpreting the blood oxygen\u2013level dependent signal mean that rsfMRI on its own cannot determine whether disruptions are due to disconnection (site or network specific), poor perfusion, disruption of cerebrovascular reactivity, or a hybrid of these.\n38\nASL maps changes in CBF at a fine scale across the brain, revealing direct vascular contributions of rsfMRI alterations. To date however, studies of ASL in mTBI have been inconclusive: some studies show lower CBF 24-48\u2009h after injury\n39\nwhile others show higher CBF (2 and 6 weeks post-injury),\n40\npotentially with an interaction with sex.\n41\nLastly, QSM is modality whose application to TBI has accelerated in the last decade, aiming to noninvasively estimate the magnetic susceptibility of biological tissue.\n42\nQSM noninvasively estimates the magnetic susceptibility of biological tissue, which can be altered by macro- or micro-hemorrhage. QSM images can also be used to derive quantitative measures of white matter hyperintensity burden and for qualitative grading of lacunar infarctions and evidence of closed head injury (e.g., cortical contusions). In the CARE4Kids project, we modeled our protocols on the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) neuroimaging protocol which has been successfully used to scan over 10,000 adolescents,\n43\nsupplemented with specialized scans ideal for clinical assessment of concussion (ASL and QSM).\n\nFluid biomarker protocol\nSeveral key physiologic processes likely related to the persistence of PPCS are detectable in peripheral blood. Concussion-related axonal injury, inflammatory activity, membrane turnover and oxidative stress result in altered neurotransmission leading to a disruption of neural networks.\n44\nThese physiologic processes can be assessed in peripheral blood by measuring neuronal/glial proteins, lipids, inflammatory cytokines, and neuropeptide neurotransmitters. A group of blood-based proteins reflecting these processes was selected based on evidence of diagnostic and/or prognostic capability and availability of commercial assays (\nTable 4\n). While most published blood biomarker studies involve adults, several involving EMAs underscore their potential in this age group.\n45-47\nTable 4.\nProposed Fluid-Based Biomarkers to be Measured in EMAs\nTBI Physiologic process\nMarker Type\nMarker\nAxonal injury\nNeuronal/glial Injury\nGFAP, UCH-L1, total Tau, NF-L\nInflammatory activity\nCytokines\nTNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, VEGF\nMembrane turnover and oxidative stress\nLipids\nLPA, FA 2-OH C16:0, FA C18:0, TUDCA, PE ae C36:4, PE aa C38:6, LysoPC a C20:4\nAltered neurotransmission\nNeuropeptides\nCGRP, PACAP, Substance P\nOpen in a separate window\nEMA, early and middle adolescents; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; UCH-L1, ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase isoenzyme L1; NF-L, neurofilament light chain; TNF-\u03b1, tumor necrosis factor alpha; IL, interleukin; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; FA 2-OH C16:0, 2-hydroxypalmitic acid; FA C18:0, stearic acid; TUDCA, tauroursodeoxycholic acid; PE ae C36:4, phosphatidylethanolamine plasmalogen; PE aa C38:6, diacyl-phosphatidylethanolamine; LysoPC a C20:4, lysophosphatidylcholine; CGRP, calcitonin gene-related peptide; PACAP, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide.\nQuantification of fluid biomarkers (FBMs) at a single, acute post-injury time-point, as well as changes across two time-points, can aid in the early identification of EMAs most vulnerable to PPCS. Importantly, these biomarkers have different temporal dynamics,\n48\nwhich suggests that a combination of these markers (or changes in marker values over time) might be the most effective in identifying EMAs at risk for poor recovery and chronic symptoms.\nUsing markers in blood to assess physiologic vulnerability to PPCS in EMAs has several advantages. The processes of drawing, shipping, and storing blood are well known world-wide and the equipment required relatively inexpensive. In addition, blood-based protein assays are readily scalable. The blood drawing procedure is well known and accepted by the general public, although EMAs may be more likely to be adversely affected by the anticipatory anxiety and distress associated with venipuncture.\n49\nTo address this barrier, a needle-free, lancet-based device shown to improve the acceptability of phlebotomy in pediatric populations\n50\n,\n5\n1 is also be tested as part of this protocol.\nNon-fasting blood samples will be collected at T1 and T3 by certified phlebotomists via venipuncture using specimen collection kits provided by the NINDS BioSEND Repository following established protocols. Serum and plasma will be collected from whole blood following BioSEND standard processing procedures. Within 30\u2009min of collection, samples will be centrifuged at 2000 G for 15\u2009min and stored locally at -80\u00b0C and then shipped overnight on dry ice to BioSEND Repository for long-term storage. Assays will be batched to minimize variability, with each batch run with appropriate standards and controls to ensure reliability.\nIt is anticipated that integration of FBMs, along with imaging and autonomic biomarkers, into a clinically practical risk-stratification algorithm will be critical for accurate prediction of EMAs at high risk for PPCS.\n\nRemote assessment\u2014T2\nFollowing the T1 test battery, participants and parents will respond to questionnaires from home using their mobile devices. This study employs MyCap, a mobile application developed by Vanderbilt University, that integrates with the REDCap study database. A mobile device will be provided to those parents and/or participants who do not have one of their own. Over the approximately 2-month period between the T1 and T3 test batteries, participants and parents will receive the following questionnaires:\nParticipants:\n1.\nDaily questionnaires querying headache phenotype and exercise\n2.\nWeekly questionnaires querying additional behaviors such as napping and stress\n3.\nBi-weekly administration of the PCSI\nParents:\n1.\nBi-weekly questionnaire about changes in medications, treatment, and other interventions\n2.\nBi-weekly administration of the Parent-PCSI\nT2 questionnaire distribution begins starting the day after T1 and proceeds until the T3 timepoint (3 months post-injury).\n\nThree-month follow-up assessment\u2014T3\nThree months after injury, the participants complete the entire test battery administered during the baseline assessment, T1. Participants in the imaging arm will undergo neuroimaging again at this time-point. It is anticipated that some participants will not be willing or able to return for an in-person assessment at this time. For those participants, a remote T3 is available, which includes questionnaires but without biomarker assessments. All participants are encouraged to attend the T3 in person for full data acquisition.\n\nRecovery discovery assessment\u2014T4\nTo collect complete recovery data, parents will receive monthly questionnaires at 4-, 5-, and 6-months post-injury to ask whether their child has recovered from the concussion. Once the parent indicates complete recovery, which is defined for them as \u201call of the symptoms that were caused BY THE INJURY have GONE AWAY and DO NOT RETURN when doing physical or mental activities such as exercise or studying for school,\u201d they will estimate a date of recovery and will no longer receive surveys. Parents who indicate \u201cno, not recovered\u201d will complete additional questions about the nature of the persistent symptoms and will continue to receive monthly queries up to 6-months post-injury.\n\nData analysis\nDevelopment cohort analysis\nAnalytical approach\nOur overall approach will involve iteratively fitting models to predict PPCS as defined by a PCSI Retrospective Adjusted Post-Injury Difference (RAPID) score (pre-injury PCSI score subtracted from the post-injury PCSI score) greater than 5 at the T3 visit.\n52\nBenchmark predictability will be determined with clinical factors alone; next we will test predictability of individual biomarkers alone; the third step will combine clinical, biomarker and psychosocial variables; finally, we will examine the effects of confounders and effect moderators such as medication and treatment, gender, mechanism of injury, and comorbidities. For each model we will estimate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). We will employ 10-fold cross validation to avoid overfitting. Point estimates will be the average of the estimates from each of the ten folds and we will calculate bootstrapped confidence intervals.\nBenchmark model\nClinical variables previously shown to be related to developing PPCS\n13\ninclude: age, gender, prior concussion history and symptom duration, history of physician-diagnosed migraine, physician-diagnosed anxiety, physician-diagnosed depression, self-reported headache, self-reported sensitivity to noise, and self-reported fatigue. We will test for differences between participants with and without PPCS using chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests as appropriate. We will fit separate logistic regression models using each variable as well as varying combinations of variables. Models will be ranked in terms of AUC with the model producing the best testing characteristics serving as the benchmark for evaluating improvements at predicting PPCS with the addition of biomarkers.\nIndividual biomarkers\nFor each biomarker, the AUC and Youden's index will be calculated in univariable logistic regression models to predict PPCS. One model per imaging modality will be developed. For modalities producing many predictors, we will use principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality prior to modeling. The optimal dichotomization of each multi-level or continuous biomarker will be selected using a combination of Youden's index and clinical judgment.\nBenchmark + individual biomarkers\nNext, we will separately add each biomarker and psychosocial variables to the benchmark model and assess changes in testing characteristics. Biomarkers will be ranked from most to least improvement in AUC. Any biomarker with a marginally significant\np\nvalue (\np\n<\u20090.20) for either a main effect or interaction will be eligible for the risk stratification model and continued in the Validation Phase.\nExpected power\nWe will enroll 370 EMA in the Development Cohort. With an expected loss to follow-up rate of 15%, we project having data from 315 EMA available for this analysis. We project 35% of males and 50% of females to have PPCS at follow-up.\n53\nAssuming an equal split between males and females, we estimate we will have 268 PPCS participants in the Development Cohort. Based on the results of the 5P study, we expect our benchmark model to achieve an AUC of 0.68. Our expected sample size will provide a power of 0.78 to detect an increase in AUC of 0.06.\nRisk stratification algorithm\nUsing all clinical factors and biomarker passing the above threshold, we will develop a risk stratification tool for predicting PPCS. A common rule of thumb for logistic regression models is to have at least 10 participants per predictor. It is likely we will have more than 26 clinical and biomarker candidate variables; therefore, we will apply a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalty to our logistic regression model. We will use 10-fold cross validation to estimate the optimal value of the tuning parameter, t*. We will then choose the value of t, t\u2032, which produces the least complex model and has a prediction error within one standard deviation of the t* model. Our clinical risk score will be developed from our final model by assigning points to each predictor variable with the final point total corresponding to the risk estimate, following the method described by Sullivan and colleagues.\n54\nHigh, medium, and low risk cut points will be determined by a consensus meeting of the investigators. We will report standard testing metrics such as AUC, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, likelihood ratio negative, and likelihood ratio positive.\n\nValidation cohort analysis\nWe will use the Validation Cohort to test the predictive ability, sensitivity, and specificity of our algorithm. If we are unable to demonstrate acceptable performance of the risk stratification rule (AUC <0.65) on the validation cohort, we will create a new algorithm which incorporates 66% of the development and validation cohorts for derivation and validate it on the remaining 34% of participants.\n\nEndophenotypes\nLatent class analysis (LCA) will be used to classify multi-dimensional clinical and biomarker variables into phenotypic groups. Continuous variables and biomarkers will be dichotomized or broken into three groups (i.e., high, medium, low) according to clinical and biological cutoffs. To avoid fitting a model with too many variables we will conduct screening on all potential clinical, biospecimen, autonomic, and imaging variables. We will compare distributions of predictors between the PPCS and non-PPCS groups using two-sample t-tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous predictors and chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests for categorical and binary predictors. Predictors achieving a marginally significant\np\nvalue of 0.10 or less will be included in the LCA model. The number of classes will be selected by comparing the log likelihood ratio, Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and\np\nvalues. Models producing sparse groups will be rejected in favor of models with fewer groups of sufficient size. Models will be assessed for clinical plausibility and goodness of fit will be examined using entropy r-squared, univariate residuals, and bivariate residuals.\nIf too many variables pass the screening method and threaten the stability of the LCA model, we will first perform dimension reduction via PCA within each domain: clinical, FBM, autonomic, and imaging. We will investigate the use of previously published scores, as well as perform PCA within domains before rerunning the LCA. In order to capture any interactions potentially excluded from the LCA approach, we will build a Classification and Regression Tree (CART). Different paths through the tree will be examined for combinations of variables and identification of phenotypes. Ten-fold cross validation will be used to determine the optimal value for the complexity parameter. Variables determined to be most important for class selection will be examined. Any biomarkers important for identifying phenotypes will be continued in the Validation Phase. This analysis will be repeated for two specific endophenotypes of interest migrainous headache and anxiety/mood disorders by replacing the general outcome of overall PPCS with each specific symptom cluster.\nAs an alternate approach, we will apply a group LASSO procedure where categories of predictors are included or excluded together. In this fashion, we will be able to assess the importance of each type of biomarker or clinical variable. Additionally, LASSO can sometimes perform poorly in the presence of many correlated predictors. We will explore utilizing an elastic net procured for deriving our final logistic regression model as well. All models will be compared in terms of AUC and sensitivity.\n\nAnticipated products\nThere are several major deliverables that will arise from this project. The primary goal will be an algorithm to improve prediction of one or more endophenotypes of PPCS. By linking clinical symptom phenotypes to objective markers (neurocognitive, PTH, autonomic, imaging and/or molecular), it is hypothesized that different biological categories of PPCS will be identifiable as early as possible. This will have implications for clinical management: 1) mechanism-based therapies may be directed toward specific endophenotypes; and 2) different endophenotypes may have different prognosis and recovery trajectories. Further, the potential to identify these subtypes of PPCS will likely enhance research efforts by focusing future clinical treatment trials to endophenotypes with specific biological targets, as well as open the possibility of preventive interventions to interrupt ongoing processes that may lead to chronic symptoms.\nThis effort will also contribute substantially to the Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research (FITBIR) database, providing not only clinical data (symptoms, neurologic examination and neurocognitive) but linked to deep biomarker phenotypes based on each of the three cores. Importantly, much of the extant data in FITBIR comes from adult TBI subjects (TRACK-TBI, CARE Consortium), and a major contribution of CARE4KIDS CONSORTIUM will be the addition of hundreds of adolescent mTBI/concussion subjects. In addition to the repository of individual multimodal data, CARE4KIDS CONSORTIUM will also collect, organize, and store individual blood/serum samples in the NINDS biorepository at BioSEND. This will be a resource for future investigations.\nAnother important contribution of CARE4Kids Consortium will be the innovative use of different remote data collection methods. This study is collecting interim symptom and treatment data from both subjects and parents during the remote T2 data collection, using prompts from the MyCap app, which interfaces with the REDCap database. In addition, we are monitoring data entry compliance and using compliance as a retention/motivational tool to keep subjects engaged between their in-person T1 and T3 study visits. We are also using a follow-up questionnaire, Recovery Discovery (piloted during the 4CYC data collection that preceded CARE4Kids Consortium) to help identify more precisely when a subject symptomatically recovers from their concussion. Remote blood collection will be explored through a comparative study of the Hemolink device with conventional venipuncture. If validated, this could provide an important additional means to capture blood-based markers without the subjects having to be in-person. And lastly, while the autonomic biomarker core currently requires a complex, highly monitored data collection protocol, promising remote autonomic data collection devices (like the Scosche armband) will be validated against a gold standard of in-person physiological monitoring. Such devices offer the potential to collect daily changes in activity, sleep, and autonomic function."

Immediately prior to injury, the rats were anesthetized with isoflurane using a SomnoSuite Low-Flow Anesthesia System (Kent Scientific Corp., Torrington, CT, USA). Rats received 900\u2009mL/min flow at 4.0% isoflurane until fully anesthetized and then were placed on a nose cone (400\u2009mL/min at 2.5% isoflurane) for physiological recordings. Rats were placed into a mesh netting support (Industrial Netting, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and secured into the MBD (2 ft from open end of tube) laterally with the left side facing the blast.\n54\nOnce loaded into the MBD, the rat's body was protected from direct forces by a steel tube that surrounded the body but left the head completely exposed to the blast. The rats were subjected to compressed helium-driven blasts at 11 psi peak static overpressure (blast parameters for each group are detailed in\nTable 1\n) to model mbTBI. Physiological recordings were taken using SomnoSuite technology (MouseSTAT) 5\u2009min before and 5\u2009min after the mbTBI procedure. Sham animals had all procedures performed, except for blast exposure. Rats were monitored and recovered before return transportation.\n\nMP201 administration\nMP201 was formulated at either 8 or 80\u2009mg/kg in the vehicle solution (mixture of 99% 0.5% methyl cellulose and 1% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO; CHEBI:28262]).\n38\nRats were given 10\u2009mL/kg or approximately 2.5\u2009mL of solution (depending on weight) at each dose of MP201, or vehicle depending upon group designation. MP201 was administered by oral gavage according to the experimental design (\nFig. 1\n). MP201 was given 15\u2009min post-mbTBI on the days of blast exposure.\n\nFractionated mitochondrial magnetic separation\nFMMS was completed to fractionate synaptic and glia-enriched mitochondria based on recent publications\n50\u201352\nwith key modifications for rat brain tissue. Unilateral hippocampus, PFC, and AEP regions were dissected following CO\n2\nexposure. Tissues were homogenized and centrifuged at 1300\ng\nfor 3\u2009min. This homogenate contains free-floating glia-enriched as well as intact synaptosomes. The supernatant was placed in a fresh tube and the pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer to be spun again at 1300\ng\nfor 3\u2009min. The supernatants from the first and second spins were incubated with anti-Tom22 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) at a concentration of 8\u2009\u03bcL for every 1\u2009mg of starting wet-tissue weight for 30\u2009min. Brain tissue of 8\u2009\u03bcL/mg was determined as the optimal concentration that ensured all free mitochondria were captured.\nThe mixture was then added to MACS separation LS columns, attached to a Quadro MACS Separator (catalog #130\u2013097-040, Miltenyi Biotec) to capture free mitochondria (glia-enriched fraction). The column was plunged and the resulting sample was transferred to a 1.5\u2009\u03bcL microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 13\u2009,000\ng\nfor 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. Meanwhile, the eluate (containing synaptosomes) from the LS columns was spun at 13,\u2009000\ng\nfor 10\u2009min before being placed into the pressurized nitrogen cell disruptor. Once the synaptosomes burst, the resulting solution was incubated with anti-Tom22 microbeads (3\u2009\u03bcL for every 1\u2009mg of starting tissue) for 30\u2009min. The mixture was then added to new MACS separation LS columns, attached to a Quadro MACS Separator, plunged, and spun down for protein quantification.\n\nMitochondrial respirometry using Seahorse XFe96\nMitochondrial bioenergetics were assayed in isolated mitochondria according to previous studies.\n51\n,\n52\nBriefly, Seahorse XFe96 Flux Analyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used to determine oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) in the presence of mitochondrial substrates, inhibitors, and uncouplers. On the day before the assay, the sensor cartridge was hydrated. On the day of the assay, injection ports A to D of the sensor cartridge were loaded to measure the OCR in various mitochondrial respiration states. Chemical stocks were diluted appropriately in respiration buffer (RB; 125\u2009mM KCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin [BSA], 20\u2009mM HEPES, 2\u2009mM MgCl\n2\n, and 2.5\u2009mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, adjusted pH 7.2) to make the final concentration of the chemicals 5\u2009mM pyruvate, 2.5\u2009mM malate, and 2\u2009mM adenosine diphosphate (ADP; via Port A; State III\nC1\n), 2.5\u2009\u03bcM oligomycin A (via Port B; State IV), 4\u2009\u03bcM carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP; via Port C; State V\nC1\n), and 1\u2009\u03bcM rotenone and 10\u2009mM of succinate (via Port D; State V\nCII\n).\nNext, 3\u2009\u03bcg non-synaptic and 6\u2009\u03bcg synaptic mitochondrial protein, as measured using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (#23227, Pierce), were loaded per well in a volume of 30\u2009\u03bcL. Plates were centrifuged and RB was gently added for a total volume of 175\u2009\u03bcL in each Seahorse XFe96 well. OCRs were measured based on additions in each injection port. Raw OCR values were used for analysis within a given experiment and reported in all figures. Plate-to-plate and day-to-day variation may result in variable absolute OCR values between experiments, which necessitated the use of blocking factor in statistical analysis.\n\nOxidative damage measurements\nMitochondrial homogenate aliquots (unused during respiration assays) were stored at \u221220\u00b0C until utilization for oxidative stress dot-blots. In these samples, 3-nitrotyrosine (3NT) and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) were assessed as previously described.\n19\n,\n52\nProtein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay kit (catalog #23227, Thermofisher). Dot-blots were made from 500\u2009ng of mitochondrial lysate per sample in a 96-well Bio-Dot microfiltration apparatus (Bio-Rad). Nitrotyrosine polyclonal antibody (1:2500; catalog #A-21285, Thermofisher) and anti-4 HNE antiserum (1:2500; catalog #HNE11-S, Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX, USA) were used along with IRDye 800 CW goat anti-rabbit IgG (1: 10,000; catalog #926-3221, LI-COR Biosciences, USA) secondary antibody to detect 4-HNE and 3-NT expressions from mitochondrial lysates. The membranes were scanned and dot-blot intensities were quantified using a LI-COR DLx Odyssey imaging system.\n\nMitochondrial complex activity quantification\nMethods were adapted from those of Kalimon and colleagues.\n55\nFrozen mitochondrial aliquots were utilized for the assessment of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes in the Seahorse XFe96 Flux Analyzer. Mitochondria were thawed on ice prior to dilution in Mir05 buffer (0.5\u2009mM EGTA, 3\u2009mM MgCl\n2\n, 60\u2009mM lactobionic acid, 20\u2009mM taurine, 10\u2009mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 20\u2009mM HEPES, 110\u2009mM sucrose). Mitochondria (1.5\u2009\u03bcg) were resuspended in 75\u2009\u03bcL of Mir05 buffer and spun at 3000\ng\nfor 10\u2009min. The OCR measurements were carried out using Seahorse XFe96 after topping up the wells with 100\u2009\u03bcL of MiR05 to final concentrations of alamethicin (35\u2009\u03bcg/mL), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH; 3.5\u2009mM), and cytochrome c (17.52\u2009\u03bcM). Remaining substrates and inhibitors of the electron transport chain were prepared in RB without BSA and loaded into the injection ports as followed: (A) rotenone (0.8\u2009\u03bcM) and succinate (10\u2009mM), (B) antimycin A (1\u2009\u03bcM), (C) ascorbate (20\u2009mM) and N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD; 5\u2009mM), and (D) sodium azide (549.3\u2009mM). Complex I activity was derived from the NADH reading minus the antimycin A reading. Complex II activity was calculated from the succinate reading minus the antimycin A reading. Complex IV activity was derived from the ascorbate/TMPD reading minus the sodium azide reading.\n\nStatistical analysis\nPower analysis was conducted (using G*Power statistical software, version 3.0.10) for all experimental data and was based on previous published literature from our group. Analysis was completed based on the analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical tests and output of F score.\nA priori\nanalysis was performed and effect size was calculated based on expected mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD) within each group. Sample size was calculated using the following parameters: \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05, 1 \u2212 \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.8, and SD 20% of mean for experimental groups. Primary outcomes for sample size determination were State III mitochondrial bioenergetics. Statistical analysis was performed using Graph Pad Prism (GraphPad Software, CA, USA) or JMP 12 (SAS, NC, USA). For all analyses, a significant difference among groups was defined as\np\n<\u20090.05. For each measure, data were measured using interval/ratio scales. The Brown-Forsythe and Bartlett's tests were performed to ensure homogeneity of variance. Further, the Shapiro-Wilk test was completed to ensure normality. As these criteria were met for all experimental data, parametric statistics were employed for all analyses. Two-way ANOVA with Sidak's post hoc or one-way ANOVA test with Dunnett's post hoc were employed, where appropriate."

    "Methods": "After appropriate ethics approval, we performed a population-based retrospective observational cohort study using administrative and clinical data that were linked from multiple datasets. We have reported previously on our data sources, methods for cohort creation, variables, validation strategies, and analysis plans.11Additional details are provided inSupplementary Appendix SA1.\n\nPatient sample\nAll adult patients who were treated for acute cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral or cauda equina tSCIs in the province of British Columbia (BC) in Canada from 2001 to 2017 were identified by scanning the Discharge Abstract Database (Hospital Separations) using International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes by Population Data BC.\n12\nThe tSCI case definition was validated by mapping ICD-10 CA codes to International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) descriptions of tSCI by level and severity.\n11\nThe eligible patient sample represents all tSCIs over this 17-year period in a geographic population estimated to be more than 5 million.\n13\nPopulation Data BC provides research access to linkable, longitudinal, de-identified patient-level datasets. Over the 17-year period of the study, the attitudes of the treating spine surgeons at the specialized center with regard to treatment of patients with acute tSCI did not change substantially. For example, early surgery was always advocated while use of methylprednisolone was not, and intensive multi-disciplinary rehabilitation was always provided.\nWe excluded patients who had an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of less than 9 (considered minor injuries).\n6\nWe excluded patients with sensorimotor complete (American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale [AIS] A) injuries because almost all individuals with such complete injuries were treated in specialized care (93% of 563), thus precluding a comparison against non-specialized care.\n\nData sources\nData were linked from the Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract Database (Hospital Separations),\n12\nBC Provincial Vital Statistics Agency (Deaths),\n14\nthe BC Trauma Registry, Medical Services Plan (MSP) Payment Information File,\n15\nMSP Consolidation File (MSP Registration and Premium Billing),\n16\nand the Rick Hansen Spinal Cord Injury Registry (RHSCIR).\n17\n,\n18\n\nInterventions\u2013specialized versus non-specialized acute SCI hospital care\nWe defined specialized acute hospital according to recommendations reported by Parent and associates\n3\n(\nTable 1\n). Only one acute care hospital in BC met these criteria over the study duration, which was also the only acute care hospital in BC accredited under the Accreditation Canada SCI Standards of Care program.\n2\nAll other hospitals in our dataset (\nn\n=\u200911) were considered non-specialized care. Patients whose acute care occurred at a non-specialized center but whose subsequent rehabilitation occurred at a specialized SCI rehabilitation center were analyzed in the non-specialized acute hospital care group.\nTable 1.\nComponents of Specialized Acute Hospital Care for Patients With Acute Traumatic Spinal Cord Injuries According to Recommendations Reported by Parent and Coworkers\n3\n1. Location within or in close proximity to a Level 1 trauma center\n2. 24-h on call availability of a dedicated spine surgery team\n3. 24-h rapid access to magnetic resonance imaging and an operating room\n4. A dedicated \u201cspinal unit\u201d for patient care that involves a physical space with a wide range of multi-disciplinary specialists (spine surgeons, physiatrists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nurse coordinators, social workers, psychologists)\n5. A streamlined referral partnership to an in-patient spinal cord injury rehabilitation center\nOpen in a separate window\n\nStatistical analysis\nWe present unadjusted survival using Kaplan-Meier curves. We tested for unadjusted and adjusted associations between type of care and the primary outcome event of death at one year from the time of first tSCI admission after injury using univariate and multiple logistic regression. Candidate variables were initially selected based on clinical importance, and adjusted models. Candidate variables were: age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, ISS, spine surgery, traumatic brain injury, injury level, transfer from another hospital, and time to admission.\n1\n,\n3\n,\n4\n,\n6\n,\n18\u201322\nWe evaluated model fit using the coefficient of determination (Nagelkerke R\n2\n), and we also performed Hosmer-Lemeshow \u201cgoodness-of-fit\u201d tests, which showed satisfactory performance for all models. Odds Ratios (ORs) are reported with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs). We removed the spine surgery variable from our final models because it was highly colinear with specialized care.\nWe performed\na priori\nsubgroup analyses investigating the effects of specialized care among patients with age <65 years and ISS of \u226516 (major trauma) and \u226525 (critically injured\n19\n) because prior literature suggested differential prognosis among these patients.\n6\n,\n20\u201322\nWe performed secondary analyses using Cox regression to account for censoring and propensity-score matching to alternatively control for potential confounders. Propensity score matching used a 1:1 greedy technique with the same variables as the logistic regression models (age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, ISS, surgery, traumatic brain injury [TBI], injury level, transfer from another hospital, and time to admission).\nCaliper distance was 0.25 and no particular variables were set to be exact matches between groups. Mortality rates between matched groups were compared using a chi-square test. We also report on death at 30 days as a secondary outcome.\nAll tests of significance were two-tailed and\np\nvalues <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Missing data were managed by substitution from other data sources within the linked cohort when available. We report Relative and Absolute Risk Reductions (RRR and ARR) and Numbers Needed to Treat (NNT\u2009=\u20091/ARR) to prevent one death to aid interpretation of treatment effects, based on the propensity score matched analyses. Standard Differences are reported for continuous variables. Cells with less than five events were not reported to protect privacy. We used SAS software (version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc.) and Microsoft Excel (version 16.51, Microsoft Corp.)."

    "Methods": "Participants\nThe Football Players Health Study (FPHS) at Harvard University\n12\nrecruited 31 former ASF players between the ages of 33 and 60 who: (1) contracted with professional ASF leagues after 1960, the year hard plastic helmets were adopted\n13\n; (2) completed the FPHS Health and Wellness survey between the ages of 29 and 55 years; and (3) had previously self-reported a diagnosis of cardiometabolic, neurocognitive, chronic pain, and/or sleep disorder or as unafflicted by any of those conditions.\n14\nThese participants underwent PET scanning on the Discovery MI-5 (GE Healthcare) PET/CT scanner at the Gordon Center for Medical Imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA) between 2019 and 2020. We examined p-Tau tracer uptake among 27 former professional ASF players after exclusions based on tracer failure, compromised cerebellum data, or lack of corollary MRI data.\nA convenience sample of 11 white male controls (age range: 47\u201360) was recruited from the Framingham Heart Study\n15\ncohort to characterize molecular signatures of pre-clinical and clinical Alzheimer disease using PET. These control participants were unexposed to RHI and scanned on the same Discovery MI-5 (GE Healthcare) PET/CT scanner at the Gordon Center for Medical Imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA) between 2018 and 2020. Informed consent was obtained from all participants and approval was granted by the Human Research Protection Program at Mass General Brigham.\n\nCovariates\nAge and race were determined as described previously.\n1\nOnly players who endorsed either \u201cBlack\u201d or \u201cwhite\u201d were included, because of the limited ASF participation of other race groups. The FPHS Health and Wellness survey queried age of first football exposure and years of youth, high school, collegiate, and professional play.\nThese were used to categorize four football exposure measures: (1) age of first football exposure, (2) total years of football, (3) total National Football League (NFL) seasons, and (4) self-reported total number of concussion signs and symptoms (concussion signs and symptoms score) accumulated during football play or practice.\nAs described previously,\n1\n,\n16\n,\n17\nthe concussion signs and symptoms score was quantified by summing the frequency of each of 10 concussion signs and symptoms (included headaches, nausea, dizziness, loss of consciousness, memory problems, disorientation, confusion, seizure, visual problems, and feeling unsteady on one's feet) reported to have occurred after a blow to the head or neck. Total NFL seasons was used as a continuous variable in models adjusting for age, race, and position. Position was divided into defensive back, defensive line, kicker/punter, linebacker, offensive line, quarterback, running back, tight end, wide receiver, and special teams only.\nFor comparison with the football player sample in Stern and associates,\n6\nwe conducted sensitivity analyses only in players with subjective cognitive complaints. Consistent with previous work,\n6\nperceived neurocognitive function was measured (Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders [Neuro-QOL\n18\n]-Applied Cognition-General Concerns [short form]). Specifically, to create a subsample of football players selected for reporting subjective neurocognitive dysfunction, participants scoring more than one standard deviation below the mean (i.e., T-score <40) were considered to have subjective cognitive dysfunction, and they were included in sensitivity analyses. An additional sensitivity analysis was conducted in ASF players over the age of 43 to match ASF participants in the Stern and associates\n6\nstudy.\n\nNeuroimaging data acquisition\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nAll subjects underwent structural MRI procedures for anatomical reference. A three-dimensional (3D) structural T1-weighted multi-echo magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MEMPRAGE) image was acquired using a 3 T Skyra (Siemens Medical Systems) scanner and root-mean squared image calculated for the population of former ASF players. A 3D structural T1-weighted turbo field echo (TFE) was acquired using a 3 T Achieva (Philips) scanner for the control population. All MRI scans had a matrix size of 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256 and a slice thickness of 1\u2009mm and 1\u2009mm isotropic voxel dimensions.\nPositron mission tomography (PET)\nAll subjects underwent PET procedures on the same scanning equipment in the same location. Each participant received A\u03b2 and p-Tau PET imaging measured by C-Pittsburgh Compound B([\n11\nC]-PiB) and [\n18\nF]-FTP (Avid Radiopharmaceuticals), synthesized and administered onsite. [\n11\nC]-PiB imaging was acquired in dynamic mode with an injection of 15mCi (555\u2009MBq) intravenous bolus, and [\n18\nF]-FTP was measured 75\u2009min after a 10mCi (370\u2009MBq) bolus injection for a duration of 30\u2009min.\nPrior to each PET scan, a low-dose X-ray computed tomography (CT) scan was performed for attenuation correction. Each PET scan used the full width at half maximum (FWHM) spatial resolution, measured at the center of the axial field of view (radial position\u2009=\u20091\u2009cm), was 4.3\u2009mm and 5.1\u2009mm in transverse and axial directions, respectively.\nPET data were reconstructed using a validated 3D time-of-flight iterative reconstruction algorithm with five iterations and 16 subsets while applying corrections for scatter, attenuation, deadtime, random coincident events, and scanner normalization. Final reconstructed images contained voxel dimensions of 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u200989 and voxel sizes of 1.173\u2009\u00d7\u20091.17\u2009\u00d7\u20092.8mm.\nImage processing and analysis\nPET data processing was performed using Matlab software,\n19\nbased on code and function from SPM12\n20\nand FSL\n21\nsoftware packages. The MRI images were processed and manually edited on FreeSurfer (FSv6.0).\n22\nAll MRI and PET images were registered into the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space as described previously.\n23\nThe PET images were motion-corrected and rigidly co-registered to the structural MRI image, transformed into the MNI space using a 12-parameter affine transformation followed by nonlinear warping. The transformation matrices were combined and applied inversely on MNI, Harvard\u2013Oxford atlases (available in FSL), and FreeSurfer regions to warp the regions of interest (ROI;\nSupplementary Table S1\n) into the native PET images for extraction of radioactivity time\u2013activity curves.\nThe PiB and FTP retentions were expressed by distribution volume ratios (DVR) and 80\u2013100\u2009min standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR), respectively, with the cerebellar grey matter as reference.\n23\n,\n24\nSubjects were defined as A\u03b2 positive if the PiB DVR global A\u03b2 burden in a large neocortical aggregate (FreeSurfer-derived \u201cFLR\u201d regions composed of frontal, lateral parietal and temporal, and retrospenial regions) was \u22651.2.\n25\nThe ROIs surveyed were bilateral superior frontal, bilateral medial temporal, and left parietal from the MNI and Harvard\u2013Oxford atlases to compare with published findings.\n6\nWe additionally utilized FreeSurfer parcellation results to examine more precisely brain regions from the medial temporal cortex known to be involved in AD and CTE-NC,\n26\nsuch as the entorhinal cortex,\n27\n,\n28\nhippocampus,\n29\nparahippocampus, and amygdala.\n30\nWe calculated correlations between choroid plexus and hippocampal FTP uptake separately in Black and white players to explore evidence of potential off-target neuromelanin FTP binding.\n\nNeuropsychological Testing\nIn-person neuropsychological tests were selected to approximate testing conducted by Stern and associates,\n6\nincluding measures of depression (PHQ-9),\n31\nmemory (Neuropsychological Assessment Battery [NAB] List Learning Test Delayed Recall),\n32\nand executive function (Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System Category Fluency Test [D-KEFS]\n33\n).\nThe PHQ-9 is a 9-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess symptoms of depression experienced during the previous fortnight.\n31\nParticipants rate the frequency of depression-related symptoms and/or behaviors on a 0\u20133 scale, with higher scores representing greater symptoms, and the cutoff score for screening positively for depression is 10.\n34\n,\n35\nThe D-KEFS Category Fluency Test\n33\ninvolves naming as many words that belong to a specific category as possible within one minute (i.e., first names for a specified gender). The number of correct words produced are age-corrected (mean\u2009=\u200910, standard deviation [SD]\u2009=\u20093).\nThe NAB List Learning Test\n32\ninvolves three learning trials of a 12-word list, followed by an interference list, and then free recall testing immediately after the interference list and after a 10\u201315\u2009min delay. Participants who obtained a low score on a performance validity test (Test of Memory Malingering or TOMM,\n36\nTrial 1 score \u226435) were excluded from analyses using the cognitive test scores, but imaging data and mood scales for these participants were included.\n\nStatistical analysis\nBetween group differences were calculated with voxelwise linear regression models of FTP SUVR maps using SPM12 (\np\n<\u20090.005; uncorrected for multiple comparisons) and restricted to \u2265100 voxel clusters to increase comparability with similar studies. Between group comparisons for region-based analyses was performed with Mann\u2013Whitney tests. Spearman age-adjusted partial correlations were used to illustrate relationships between regional FTP SUVRs and total years of football exposure.\nWe utilized a two-step residual method adjusting for age, race, and position\n37\nto assess associations between SUVR values and football exposures. First, we used demographic and football-relevant variables from the questionnaire administered to 2265 FPHS participants within the age range of the PET subjects (29 years to 60 years). We extracted the residuals from separate linear regression models of each football exposure predicted by age, race, and football position.\nWe then tested linear models to predict PET SUVR values using the residuals from the first stage model for each exposure. By design, the residuals reflect the variation in each football exposure variable independent of age, race, and position, thus adjusting for age, race, and position. Age- and race-adjusted multi-variable linear regression was used to measure associations between SUVR and neurocognitive and mood outcomes (the dependent variables). Exposure analyses were conducted using R Statistical Software.\n38\nAll sensitivity analyses on subsets of the former player sample were conducted and analyzed as described previously. Distributions were reported using means and SD measures, and statistical significance was set at\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Study design and patients\nThe Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) core study is a prospective longitudinal non-randomized observational study, registered at\nclinicaltrials.gov\nNCT02210221, which included patients with TBI from 18 countries across Europe and in Israel between 2014 and 2017. Inclusion criteria were: (1) a clinical diagnosis of TBI, (2) a clinical indication for a computed tomographic (CT) scan, (3) presentation within 24\u2009h of injury, and (4) informed consent obtained according to local and national policies. Patients were excluded if they had a severe pre-existing neurological disorder that would confound outcome assessments. For this particular study, patients from Israel and those <16 years of age were excluded. Ethical approval for the CENTER-TBI study was obtained from all responsible medical ethical committees, and informed consent procedures followed applicable regulations.\n23\n\nClinical data\nClinical data were prospectively collected by local research staff using electronic case report forms (eCRF). Data were de-identified using a randomly generated Global Unique Patient Identifier (GUPI) and stored on a secured database by the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF) (\nwww.incf.org\n) in Stockholm, Sweden. Data were extracted in January 2021 (version 3.1) and included demographic characteristics, trauma and injury information, results of neurological assessment, imaging, and patient outcomes. Using the baseline Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, patients were classified into three categories of TBI severity: GCS 13\u201315 (mild TBI), GCS 9\u201312 (moderate TBI), and GCS 3\u20138 (severe TBI).\n24\nThe baseline GCS score is a derived variable and represents the total GCS score for baseline risk adjustment. The systemic injury severity score (ISS) was categorized into three groups: ISS \u226416 (minor injury), ISS 17\u201325 (major injury), and ISS >25 (critical injury).\n25\nPre-injury health status was classified using the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification.\n26\nBrain injury is further described according to the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) and classified as minor, moderate, serious, severe, critical, or unsurvivable.\n27\n\nHealthcare consumption\nHealthcare consumption data were extracted following the same procedure as with clinical data. The healthcare consumption of patients included seven main healthcare service categories: (1) pre-hospital care, including ambulance transportation and, for secondary referral patients, costs of TBI-related admission and any emergent surgical interventions in the \u201creferring hospital,\u201d before admission to a CENTER-TBI study hospital; (2) hospital admission, including initial assessment and care at the emergency room (ER) and length of stay (LOS) in days at the ward or ICU; (3) all surgical interventions, both intra- and extra-cranial; (4) imaging of the brain; (5) laboratory; (6) blood products; and (7) rehabilitation; including only LOS at an inpatient rehabilitation center. Healthcare consumption of outpatient rehabilitation care facilities was not included. The transitions of care forms, in which the care pathway of patients was registered, were used to extract the in-hospital LOS of patients. Inpatient rehabilitation LOS was extracted using the transitions of care forms and patient-reported outcome forms. Missing LOS at the ward, ICU, and rehabilitation were imputed using single imputation. All healthcare services registered within CENTER-TBI and included in this study are reported in\nSupplementary Table S1\n.\n\nHealthcare costs\nBecause of the unavailability of country-specific unit prices for each healthcare service, Dutch reference prices were used as fundament for this study. In addition, definitions, calculations, and sources of country-specific unit prices may vary (e.g., unit prices can differ based on the inclusion/exclusion of personnel costs), which could potentially lead to an over- or underestimation of costs when such unit prices are used. For example, it was found that the reported monthly salary for a senior resident ranged from a low between \u20ac500 and \u20ac800 in Eastern Europe to a high of \u20ac7900 in Norway.\n28\nBy using a uniform price list, this study focuses on differences in healthcare consumption rather than price differences among countries.\nReference prices were extracted from the Dutch Guidelines for economic healthcare evaluations.\n29\nReference prices not mentioned in the Dutch Guidelines were complemented using unit prices reported by the Netherlands Healthcare Authority or by using the average national price, based on declared fees\n30\n,\n31\n(\nSupplementary Table S1\n). First, using the Dutch national general consumer price index, all reference prices were corrected to EURO 2017, the last year of patient inclusion (\nSupplementary Table S2\n).\n32\nSecond, in order to calculate the economic burden of a patient with TBI within Europe, the Dutch reference prices were converted to country-specific unit prices by correcting the Dutch reference prices for the purchasing power parity (PPP) for the general domestic product (GDP) (\nSupplementary Table S3\n). The GDP-PPP is the standard measure when comparing differences in life standards among countries.\n33\nThird, the total intramural healthcare costs were calculated by multiplying the number of healthcare units (e.g. length of days at ward and ICU for hospitalization costs) with the corresponding reference price, according to country of admission. See Supplemental Methods,\nSupplementary Tables S2\nand\nS3\nfor further details about the calculations.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Baseline characteristics of patients are based on crude data and presented as absolute numbers and percentages. Continuous variables are presented as medians (interquartile range [IQR]) and means (standard deviation [SD]). Median and mean prices were rounded to hundreds. To compare continuous and categorical variables across all subgroups, the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test and the \u03c7\n2\ntest were applied respectively. A\np\nvalue <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Healthcare consumption (i.e., LOS at ICU, ward, and rehabilitation unit) and total healthcare costs were presented for the total study population, including all severities, and according to TBI severity.\nMissing data were statistically imputed based on correlations among baseline characteristics, healthcare consumption, in-hospital mortality, and Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) score at 6 months using the mice package in R.\n34\nTo determine between-country differences in ICU and ward LOS, a mixed linear regression model was applied, with results presented in forest plots. The country effect was included in the model as a random intercept, and case-mix adjustment was performed using variables in the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI (IMPACT) prognostic model: age, pupils, GCS score, hypoxia, hypotension, traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, epidural hemorrhage, Marshall CT classification, hemoglobin, and glucose measurements.\n35\nCountries including fewer than five patients per severity group were excluded from this analysis.\nWe used a mixed general linear model (GLM) with gamma distribution and log link function to determine which baseline characteristics were associated with the total intramural healthcare costs. GLM models are recommended for use in linear regression of costs data, as they provide parametric methods of analysis in which non-normal distributions can be specified.\n36\nA random effect for country was added to both the univariable and multi-variable models to account for between-country differences in costs. Statistical analysis were performed in STATA and R version 4.0.4.\n37\n,\n38"

Patients were excluded if they had severe pre-existing neurological disorder that could confound outcome assessments.\n2\nIn CENTER-TBI, participants were differentiated by care pathway and assigned to the emergency department (ED) stratum (discharged from an ED), admission stratum (admitted to a hospital ward), or intensive care unit (ICU) stratum (admitted to the ICU).\n2\nWe selected participants who were 16 years or older with a baseline GCS 13 to 15 and available outcome assessments. The majority of predictors measured at presentation were missing in <5% of included participants, but post-traumatic amnesia duration (15-17%), loss of consciousness (7-8%), education levels (9-13%), and employment (5-6%) had higher percentages of missingness (\nTable 1\n;\nSupplementary Table S1\n). CT variables were missing in 5-7%, early symptoms in 26-29%, and biomarkers in 17-20% of participants (\nTable 1\n;\nSupplementary Table S1\n). Missing predictor data were imputed to allow for fair comparison between model variants using multi-variate imputation by chained equations assuming a missingness at random mechanism.\n28\nThe imputation model contained all predictor and outcome variables, and predictive mean matching was used for continuous, logistic regression for binary, proportional odds logistic regression for ordinal, and polytomous regression for categorical data. For the development of models containing 2-3\u2013week symptoms, we only selected participants for whom this assessment was obtained. By the CENTER-TBI study design, these assessments were performed in ED stratum and a subgroup of patients admitted to a hospital ward.\n2\nTable 1.\nCharacteristics of Mild TBI Patients With Available 6-Month Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE;\nN\n=\u20092376) and Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ;\nn\n=\u20091605), and 2-Week RPQ (\nn\n=\u2009640;\nn\n=\u2009476) in the CENTER-TBI Study\n6-month GOSE\n6-month RPQ\n6-Month GOSE +2-3-week RPQ\n6-Month 2-3-week RPQ\nn\n2376\nMissing %\n1605\nMissing %\n640\nMissing %\n476\nMissing %\nAge median [Q1, Q3]\n53 [34, 68]\n0\n53[35, 66]\n0\n49[31, 62]\n0\n51[34.75, 63]\n0\nSex male (%)\n1519 (63.9)\n0\n1018 (63.4)\n0\n378 (59.1)\n0\n279 (58.6)\n0\nPre-injury health ASA-PS (%)\n0.8\n0.4\n0\n0\nNo systemic disease\n1292 (54.8)\n909 (56.9)\n383 (59.8)\n383 (59.8)\nMild\n803 (34.1)\n538 (33.7)\n2024 (31.9)\n158 (33.2)\nSevere\n261 (11.1)\n151 (9.4)\n53 (8.3)\n39 (8.2)\nPsychiatric history (%)\n312 (13.3)\n1\n202 (12.6)\n0.5\n86 (13.5)\n0.2\n62 (13.0)\n0\nCause of injury (%)\n1.8\n1.6\n1.1\n1.3\nfall and other\n1353 (58.0)\n888 (56.2)\n373 (58.9)\n268 (57.0)\nTraffic\n846 (36.2)\n613 (38.8)\n226 (35.7)\n185 (39.4)\nviolence\n135 (5.8)\n78 (4.9)\n34 (5.4)\n17 (3.6)\nGlasgow Coma Score (%)\n0\n0\n0\n0\n13\n161 (6.8)\n103 (6.4)\n15 (2.3)\n12 (2.5)\n14\n421 (17.7)\n269 (16.8)\n56 (8.8)\n39 (8.2)\n15\n1794 (75.5)\n1233 (76.8)\n569 (88.9)\n425 (89.3)\nTotal Injury Severity Score (ISS)\nmedian[Q1-Q3]\n10 [5, 18]\n0.9\n10[5, 18]\n0.7\n5 [2, 9]\n0.2\n5[2.75, 9]\n0\nISS extra-cranial\n3[0,9]\n0\n4[0,9]\n0\n1[0,4]\n0\n1[0,4]\n0\nHead AIS\n3[2,3]\n1\n3[2,3]\n0.8\n2[1,2]\n0.3\n2[1,2]\n0.2\nAny intracranial abnormality (%)\n1028 (46.3)\n6.6\n718 (47.4)\n5.5\n113 (18.6)\n5.2\n98 (21.4)\n3.6\nNFL \u226448\u2009h\nmedian [Q1, Q3]\n13.5 [7.2, 28.5]\n20.4\n12.8 [7.3, 25.7]\n18.2\n8.4[5.2, 14.4]\n16.4\n8.8[5.6, 14.4]\n13.7\nRPQ Total Score at presentation\n1\nmedian [Q1, Q3]\n8 [2, 15]\n29.4\n8 [2.75, 15]\n26.2\n8 [2, 15.75]\n10.9\n8.50 [2, 16]\n11.3\nRPQ Total Score at 2-3 wks\n2\nmedian [Q1, Q3]\n8 [0, 20]\n73.1\n8[2, 21]\n70.3\n8[0, 20]\n0\n8 [2, 21]\n0\nRPQ Total Score at 6 months median [Q1, Q3]\n6 [0, 16]\n32.5\n6 [0, 16]\n0\n4 [0, 14]\n25.6\n4 [0, 14]\n0\nGOSE at 180 days\n0\n0.1\n0\n0\n1\n89 (3.7)\n0\n1 (0.2)\n0\n3\n99 (4.2)\n42 (2.6)\n8 (1.2)\n4 (0.8)\n4\n74 (3.1)\n53 (3.3)\n1 (0.2)\n1 (0.2)\n5\n174 (7.3)\n119 (7.4)\n27 (4.2)\n21 (4.4)\n6\n247 (10.4)\n205 (12.8)\n53 (8.3)\n49 (10.3)\n7\n517 (21.8)\n410 (25.6)\n133 (20.8)\n118 (24.8)\n8\n1176 (49.5)\n775 (48.3)\n417 (65.2)\n283 (59.5)\nOpen in a separate window\n1\nAt median 1 day post-injury [Q1:Q3: 0-1].\n2\nAt median 20 days [Q1-Q3:15-28]).\nTBI, traumatic brain injury; CENTER-TBI, Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury; ASA- PS, American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status classification; AIS, Abbreviated Injury Score; NFL, neurofilament light.\n\nOutcomes assessed at 6 months\nWe analyzed associations with 6-month GOSE and PPCS. The GOSE\n13\nhas the following categories: 1) dead; 2) vegetative state; 3) lower severe disability; 4) upper severe disability; 5) lower moderate disability; 6) upper moderate disability; 7) lower good recovery; and 8) upper good recovery. The GOSE was collected using structured interviews and patient/caregiver questionnaires. The categories vegetative state and lower severe disability were combined in one group, as these could not be differentiated in the postal questionnaire. Overall, \u223c22% had GOSE scores outside of the pre-specified 5-8-month window.\n2\nWe used GOSE ratings imputed to exactly 180 days based on the GOSE recorded at different time-points (from 2 weeks to 1 year) based on a multi-state model.\n29\nThe imputed GOSE variable was made by the CENTER-TBI statisticians and directly extracted from the CENTER-TBI dataset.\n29\n,\n30\nPPCS were assessed by the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ).\n31\nThe RPQ consists of 16 common symptoms that can appear after mTBI/ concussion. Participants are asked to rate how problematic symptoms were compared with symptoms before the injury on a 5-point rating scale (0\u20134). A score of 0 indicates \u201cnot experienced at all\u201d; 1 indicates \u201cno more of a problem (than before)\u201d; 2 indicates \u201ca mild problem\u201d; 3 indicates \u201ca moderate problem\u201d; and 4 indicates \u201ca severe problem.\u201d The total score is calculated as the sum of items, with a range from 0 (representing no change in symptoms since the injury) to 64 (most severe symptoms). When calculating the total score, \u201c1\u201d responses were rated as 0. The questionnaire was translated and linguistically validated in languages of the participating centers.\n32\nWhen using a binary end-point, we dichotomized the RPQ Total score based on a cutoff \u226516.\n33\n\nCandidate predictors\nQuestionnaires\nThe RPQ was assessed in the hospital center (at presentation or before discharge, median 1 day [Q1-Q3:0-1]), and after 2-3-weeks in participants from ED stratum and in a subgroup of Admission stratum (median 20 days [Q1-Q3:15-28]). The Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM)-5 (PCL-5),\n34\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7),\n35\nPatient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)\n36\nwere administered at 2-3 weeks, and were considered as predictors in the \u201c2-3\u2013week\u201d prognostic models. The PCL-5\n34\nmeasures symptoms of PTSD according to DSM-5 criteria. It consists of 20 items that can be answered with 0\u2009=\u2009not at all to 5\u2009=\u2009extremely, and it can have a score range of 0-80. The GAD-7\n35\nmeasures severity of a general anxiety disorder. It comprises seven items that can be answered from 0\u2009=\u2009not at all to 3\u2009=\u2009nearly every day, and it can have a score range of 0-21. The PHQ-9\n36\nmeasures the severity of major depressive disorder symptoms. It contains nine items using a 4-point rating scale (from 0\u2009=\u2009not at all to 3\u2009=\u2009nearly every day), and it can have a score range of 0-27.\nClinical and sociodemographic characteristics\nSociodemographic, pre-injury, and injury-related variables were prospectively collected as follows: age, GCS, total injury severity score (ISS), sex, psychiatric history, pre-injury health (American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status [ASA PS] Classification), prior TBI, history of migraines or headaches, education level, employment, living alone, cause of injury, alcohol intoxication, pupillary reactivity, post-traumatic amnesia, loss of consciousness, vomiting, and headache (\nSupplementary Table S1\n). GCS is the total GCS at baseline (post-stabilization value at emergency department). ISS can range from 0 to 75 (in brain-injured population from 1 to 75)\n37\nand is calculated as the sum of the squares of the three body regions with the highest Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). If any AIS is scored 6, the ISS is automatically 75. Additionally, we calculated extra-cranial ISS (considering the AIS of the face, abdomen, chest, extremities, and external injuries, and excluding the head AIS) and head AIS (the highest AIS out of brain injury, head, neck, and cervical spine).\nCT variables\nWe included the following CT characteristics, scored upon central review of the CT scans obtained at presentation: traumatic axonal injury (TAI), cisternal compression, midline shift (> 5\u2009mm), subarachnoid hemorrhage, contusion, (non-) evacuated hematoma, and a composite variable any abnormality on CT (\nSupplementary Table S1\n).\nBiomarkers\nWe included the following biomarkers sampled \u226448\u2009h after injury: glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), serum neurofilament light (NFL), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B), total-Tau (t-tau), and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase -L1 (UCHL1). The median sampling time was 14\u2009h (Q1-Q3: 6-20\u2009h). The sampling was within 24\u2009h for the majority of patients (91%).\nThe sampling of blood-based biomarkers has been described in previous studies.\n21\nS100B and NSE were measured with a clinical-use automated system, using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay kit (ECLIA; Elecsys S100 and Elecsys NSE assays) run on the e602 module of Cobas 8000 modular analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) at the University of Pecs (Pecs, Hungary). Serum GFAP, UCHL1, NFL, and t-tau were analyzed with an ultrasensitive immunoassay using digital array technology (Single Molecule Arrays, [SiMoA]-based Human Neurology 4-Plex B assay (N4PB) run on the SR-X benchtop assay platform (Quanterix Corp., Lexington, MA) at the University of Florida (Gainesville, FL). Medians and interquartile ranges were shown for continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables (\nTable 1\n;\nSupplementary Table S2\n).\n\nModel development\nBased on a systematic review,\n38\na recent review and validation study,\n12\nsubsequent studies,\n17\n,\n39\n,\n40\nand clinical expertise, we selected candidate predictors and easily obtainable core variables. The selection of \u201ccore variables\u201d was guided by the most frequent predictors from prognostic models that satisfied our methodological quality criteria.\n12\nFor GOSE, the core model included age, GCS, and ISS. For RPQ, the core model included sex, psychiatric history, and pre-injury health. We extended the core models with: 1) other clinical and sociodemographic variables available at presentation; 2) RPQ total score measured at presentation or before discharge; 3) CT variables; 4) blood-based biomarkers; and 5) RPQ total score, CT results, and biomarkers (\nFig. 1\n); and 6) in the subgroup of participants in whom symptom assessments were performed at 2-3 weeks, 2-3\u2013week post-concussion and mental health symptoms.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nModeling strategy.\nWe used ordinal logistic regression to model the relationship between predictors and the GOSE, and linear regression to model the relationship between predictors and RPQ total score. We assessed nonlinear effects of age, ISS, and biomarkers. We assessed non-linear transformations with polynomials of log-transformed ISS and log-transformed values of biomarkers for both outcomes, and non-linear transformations with polynomials of age and of log-transformed GFAP for prediction of RPQ. When we examined extra-cranial and head injury severities separately, we assessed nonlinear transformations with polynomials for head AIS for prediction of GOSE.\nIn the first model extension, the Core model was extended with other clinical variables (Clinical and sociodemographic characteristics). Core variables were included (\u201cforced\u201d) into the model and clinical predictors were selected based on Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC;\nFig. 1\n;\nFig. 2A\n). The AIC was used to select the best model fit with the smallest number of parameters: a higher AIC indicates better predictive ability (how much a predictor adds to the model) penalizing for the complexity of the model (as expressed by the degrees of freedom). AIC strikes a balance between identifying predictors and preventing overfitting. In the second phase, the Clinical model was extended with other categories of variables (i.e., variables 2-6 as listed above). The additional predictors were selected based on the AIC for individual factors, and core variables were always included (\u201cforced\u201d) into the model (\nFig. 1\n). The AIC for candidate predictors in examined models was reported graphically.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nThe Core and Clinical models for prediction of Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) and Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire (RPQ). Black circles indicate selected predictors based on Akaike's Information Criterion. Black triangles indicate pre-specified core predictors. Alcohol, alcohol intoxication; ASA-PS, American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status; Cause, cause of injury; GCS, Glasgow Coma Scale; ISS, Injury Severity Score Total; Neuropain H, history of migraines/headaches; PreTBI, prior traumatic brain injury; PsychiatricH, psychiatric history; PTA, post-traumatic amnesia; LOC, loss of consciousness.\nBootstrap validation with 500 repetitions was used to estimate a uniform shrinkage factor (corrected calibration slope) and optimism in performance. We report model equations for which the regression coefficients of the final models were multiplied by a shrinkage factor and the model intercept was re-estimated. We also report the equations of models that were refitted to a dichotomized GOSE (cutoff GOSE\u2009=\u20098), using the same shrinkage factor. The performance of ordinal logistic regression models was quantified with the concordance index (C), which quantifies the ability of a model to discriminate between patients with different levels of outcome. Overall performance was quantified with partial Nagelkerke R2, which represents the scaled difference in the log-likelihood of a model with and without the prognostic factor(s). The performance of the models was also reported for different cutoffs of the GOSE. The performance of linear regression models was quantified with the proportion of explained variance (R2). For comparison with other studies, we also reported C obtained in logistic regression analysis that modeled the relationship between predictors and a dichotomized RPQ Total score. Performance was calculated across imputed datasets and confidence intervals were estimated using 200 bootstrap samples.\nTo examine calibration of the models for predicting complete (upper-good) recovery (GOSE\u2009=\u20098) and significant post-concussion symptoms (RPQ \u226516) in different European regions, we performed cross-validation with a leave-one-region-out approach: The regions West, North and South-East (\nSupplementary Table S1\n) were consecutively left out for model fitting and were then used for model validation. The R-package rms\n41\n(Regression Modeling Strategies) was used for all regression analyses."

    "Methods": "Animals\nMale and female C57BL/6J (WT) mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Two to five mice of same-sex groups were housed in standard room conditions with 12\u2009h light and dark cycle and allowed to access free food and water\nad libitum.\nThe total number of mice used after sham or injured procedures was: 20 mice (15 male; five female) in the rmTBI group and 15 mice (13 male; two female) in the sham group. All animal procedures were approved by the University of Florida's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nRepetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI) by Closed-Head Impact Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration\nThe rmTBI procedure was followed as suggested by Namjoshi and colleagues 2014; 2.5-3 months old male and female WT mice were subjected to two mild closed-head injuries (0.6\u2009J) at 24\u2009h intervals using Closed-Head Impact Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration (CHIMERA) impactor. Number and temporal spacing of injuries mimic our previous findings using a closed-head injury model of TBI.\n12\nMice were anesthetized with isoflurane (induction 3-4% and maintenance 1-2.5%). Meloxicam (10\u2009mg/kg body weight) was administered subcutaneously for 2 days prior to impact procedure to mitigate pain in the test animals. Animals were positioned supine in the holding bed of the impactor. After impact, animals were transferred immediately to the recovery chamber until fully ambulatory. Sham mice were exposed to all these procedures, except for the impact. At 7 days post-injury (dpi), transcardial perfusions were performed with sterile ice-cold 0.9 % saline and the brain tissues were harvested. One hemi-brain was micro-dissected and stored for further analysis. The remaining hemi-brain was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for further histological analysis.\n\nT2 and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquisition\nAnatomical T2-weighted, diffusion weighted and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) scans were collected between 5-7\u2009dpi for rsfMRI and DTI analyses. Sham and rmTBI mice were anesthetized with a mixture of isoflurane (induction 4%, maintenance: 1%) and medical grade air (70% N\n2\nand 30% O\n2\n) and positioned prone on a custom-built holder with a radiofrequency (RF) coil was placed atop the head. Images were acquired using an 11.1T MRI scanner (Magnex Scientific Ltd, Oxford, UK) with high power gradient sets (RRI BFG-240/120-S7; maximum gradient strength of 1000 mT/m at 325 Amps and a 200\u2009msec rise time; RRI, Billerica, MA). A custom-made 2.0\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u20092.5\u2009cm quadrature RF surface transmit/receive coil tuned to 470.7\u2009MHz (1 H resonance) was used for B1 excitation and signal detection (RF engineering lab; Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy Facility, Gainesville, FL).\nFor rsfMRI study, a T2- weighted Turbo Rapid Acquisition with Refocused Echoes (TurboRARE) sequence was acquired with the following parameters: effective echo time (TE)\u2009=\u200941.42\u2009msec, repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u20094\u2009sec, RARE factor\u2009=\u200916, number of averages\u2009=\u200912, the field of view of 15\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u200915\u2009mm and 0.9\u2009mm thick slice, and a data matrix of 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256 with 14 interleaved ascending coronal slices. Resting-state images were collected using a single-shot spin-echo echo planar imaging (SE-EPI) sequence with the following parameters: TE\u2009=\u200915\u2009msec, TR\u2009=\u20092\u2009sec, 600 repetitions, and a data matrix of 64\u2009\u00d7\u200948 with 14 interleaved ascending coronal slices in the same space as the T2 anatomical. Two additional single repetition SE-EPI scans were collected, one with phase encode gradient lobes (\u201cPE blips\u201d) collected along the positive gradient direction and the other collected with PE blips reversed to the negative PE direction (Bruker Paravision binary method for distortion correction is kindly provided by Dr. Matthew Budde, Medical College of Wisconsin).\nFor DTI images, 4-shot, 2-shell spin echo planar diffusion imaging sequence in Bruker Paravision, with TR\u2009=\u20094\u2009sec, TE\u2009=\u200919\u2009msec, number of averages\u2009=\u20094, gradient duration \u03b4\u2009=\u20093\u2009msec, diffusion time \u0394\u2009=\u20098\u2009msec, 54 images with three different diffusion weightings, two b\u2009=\u20090, 6 directions with b\u2009=\u2009600\u2009sec/mm\n2\n, and 46 directions with b\u2009=\u20092000\u2009sec/mm\n2\n. Image saturation bands were placed on either side and below the brain to suppress non-brain signal during image acquisition. A navigator signal was used by the Bruker reconstruction software to improve signal stability in the 4-shot EPI. Diffusion images had the same field of view (FOV) and slice thickness as the anatomical scan but with a lower resolution data matrix size of 128\u2009\u00d7\u200996 and 17 slices (resolution: 0.117\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20090.117\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20090.7\u2009mm) in the same space as anatomical scans.\n\nrsfMRI and DTI image pre-processing and analysis\nFunctional connectivity of rmTBI mice brain was analyzed by graph theoretical analysis.\n13\nSE-EPI distortions were corrected using TOPUP in FSL.\n14\nThe pair of opposite phase-encode blip scans were used to estimate the susceptibility-induced off-resonance field, which is used to unwarp subsequent EPI volumes.\n14\nImage pre-processing and analysis was carried via in-house UNIX terminal using Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI),\n15\nFMRIB Software Library (FSL)\n16-18\nand Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs).\n19\n,\n20\nAnatomical and distortion-corrected functional scan masks outlining mouse brain boundaries were generated in MATLAB using Three-Dimensional Pulsed Coupled Neural Networks (PCNN3D).\n21\n3dDespike in AFNI was used to remove time series spikes and 3dvolreg for image volume alignment. Preprocessed scans were cropped and a high-pass temporal filter (< 0.009Hz) was used (3dTproject) to remove slow variations (temporal drift) in the fMRI signal. Independent component analysis decomposition was then applied using Multivariate Exploratory Optimized Decomposition into Independent Components (FSL MELODIC version 3.0) to preprocessed scans to assess noise components in each subjects' native space prior to spatial smoothing and registration. Noise-related signal along brain edges, in ventricular voxels, and large vessel regions were suppressed using a soft (\u201cnon-aggressive\u201d) regression approach using fsl_regfilt.\n16\nA low-pass filter (> 0.12\u2009Hz) and spatial smoothing (0.4\u2009mm full width at half maximum [FWHM]) were then applied to the fMRI scans.\nPreprocessed anatomical and fMRI scans were aligned to a parcellated mouse common coordinate framework (version 3, or CCFv3) template.\n22\nBilateral region of interest (ROI)-based nodes (64 total) were created with the guidance of the annotated CCFv3 parcellation and using tools in ITKSNAP and FSL. In ITKSNAP, the template with overlaid parcellation was used to find the left hemisphere voxel coordinates for each of the nodes included in this study, which were distributed as evenly as possibly without overlap across the mouse brain template. The node coordinates were positioned in subregions of all areas for example the optic tract and thalamus. We created 0.6\u2009mm diameter spherical nodes (resolution: 0.05\u2009mm\n3\n) centered on the voxel coordinates. The right hemispheric representations of the same nodes were then created to complete left and right representations for each node. For subject-to-atlas registration, fMRI scans are up-sampled from a native space 0.234\u2009\u00d7\u20090.3125\u2009\u00d7\u20090.9\u2009mm resolution (spatially smoothed at 0.4\u2009mm FWHM) to a down-sampled template resolution of 0.1\u2009mm\n3\n.\nAnatomical scans were cropped and N4 bias field correction\n23\napplied to T2 images to correct intensity variations due to RF field inhomogeneities.\n24\nThe extracted brain maps were linearly registered to the mouse template using FSL linear registration tool (FLIRT).\n16\nThe linear registration output was then nonlinearly warped to the template space using ANTs (\nantsIntroduction.sh\nscript). Anatomical-to-atlas linear and nonlinear transformation matrices were applied to fMRI scans at a later stage. Brain extraction using a mask was first applied to fMRI scans and the cropped scans were then aligned to their respective higher resolution anatomical scans. Timeseries functional images were split into 600 individual volumes and the first in the series was linearly aligned to the anatomical scan using FLIRT (same parameters as above, except 6 degrees of freedom was used in this step). ANTs (\nantsRegistrationSyNQuick.sh\nscript) was used to warp the lower resolution functional images to their structural (using a single stage step deformable b-spline syn with a 26-step b-spline distance). Linear and nonlinear warping matrices for fMRI-to-anatomical alignment were applied to individual scans in the time series, then the merged 4-D functional timeseries were moved to the atlas space using the prior anatomical-to-template transformation matrices.\nA total of 64 ROI masks, divided into 32 left and 32 right ROIs, were included in our analyses. Center voxel coordinates were used for 3D network visualizations in BrainNet viewer in MATLAB.\n25\nSignal timeseries were extracted resulting in 64 individual ROI text files per subject with L2-normalized resting state signals as a vector of 600 data points. The timeseries files were used in cross-correlations and in calculations of Pearson r coefficients for every pairwise combinations of ROIs (1dCorrelate in AFNI). The resulting number of pairwise correlations was 1952 per subject (after removing 64 self-correlations). Correlation coefficients were imported to MATLAB and Fisher's transform applied to ensure a normal distribution of z values prior to analyses.\nDiffusion MRI scans were processed as previously described using tools FMRIB software library FSL.\n26\n,\n27\nTensor element reconstruction and estimates was performed using weighted least squares regression on DTIFIT in FSL.\n28\nRegions of interest were manually selected in ITK-SNAP to estimate their mean intensity and volumes. These included thalamus, optic tract, fimbria, corpus callosum, hippocampus, and amygdala.\n\nFunctional network analysis\nFunctional network analysis was completed as previously reported.\n29\nBriefly, the Brain Connectivity Toolbox\n30\nand MATLAB were used to determine weighted matrices. Edge densities thresholds were set in a range from 2 to 40% to calculate the following global network metrics: Clustering Coefficient (tendency of nodes to cluster and connect within the network), Characteristic Path Length (average of shortest path length between all pairs of nodes in the network), Transitivity (probability of neighboring nodes to be interconnected within the network), Global Efficiency (efficiency to communicate across distant brain regions), Louvain Modularity (density of connections within a neural cluster), and Small World Index (high local clustering with shortest path length). Unless otherwise indicated in the figures, a 10% threshold was used for all the node-specific measures.\n13\n,\n29\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nFormalin-fixed, Paraffin-embedded coronal brain sections (5\u2009\u03bcm) were used for the immunohistochemistry (IHC) study. Both sham and rmTBI slides were processed simultaneously. The slides were deparaffinized in xylene twice for 5\u2009min each and rehydrated sequentially in the gradient of ethanol followed by water for 3\u2009min each. The antigen retrieval was performed by immersing slides in 10\u2009mM citrate with 0.5% Tween 20 (pH 6.0) and 30\u2009min incubation in the steamer. The endogenous peroxidases were removed by incubating the slides with the mixture of 0.3% H\n2\nO\n2\n/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 10% Triton X-100 (100\u2009\u03bcL for 200\u2009mL of 0.3% H\n2\nO\n2\nsolution) for 20\u2009min. Blocking was performed with 10% normal goat serum/phosphate-buffered saline with Tween (PBS-T; 0.05% Tween) for 30\u2009min at room temperature (RT). After blocking, the brain sections were incubated overnight with the following antibodies: Iba1 (1:1000, PA5-27436, Invitrogen) and GFAP (GA5; 1:1000, 3670S, Cell Signaling) at 4\u00b0C for microglia and astrocytes, respectively. After incubation, the slides were washed with PBS-T and incubated for 30\u2009min with corresponding biotinylated secondary antibody (Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG Antibody [H+L], Biotinylated-[BA-1000]; Goat Anti-Mouse IgG Antibody, Biotinylated, R.T.U. BP-9200; Vector Laboratories).\nFurther, the sections were incubated with avidin-biotin complex (ABC) reagent for 20\u2009min (VECTASTAIN Elite ABC-HRP Kit, Peroxidase Standard), PK-6100) following washes with PBS-T and developing with 3, 3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB) kit (KPL DAB Reagent Set, SeraCare cat no. #5510-0031). The slides were then washed twice in PBS, 5\u2009min each, and counter-stained with hematoxylin for 1-2\u2009min. The slides were washed briefly in water and dehydrated with the gradient of alcohol (70% ethanol, 90% ethanol, and 100% ethanol) for 3\u2009min each and incubated in xylene twice for 5\u2009min each. The sections were mounted with Cytoseal Mountant 60 (Epredia 83104) and air dried. The slides were scanned using an Aperio image scanner (20\u2009\u00d7\u2009objective lens, Scan Scope\u2122 XT, Aperio Technologies, Inc. Vista, CA) and quantified using Image Scope software (v12.4.3.5008) positive pixel count program. Three sections per mouse at 55\u2009\u03bcm apart were averaged to calculate the expression of Iba1 and GFAP.\n\nSpatial proteomics analysis using the NanoString GeoMx Digital Spatial Protein profiling (DSP) platform\nFormalin-fixed paraffin-embedded brain tissues were sectioned on the coronal plane at 5\u2009\u03bcm thickness. DSP staining and assay procedures were conducted according to the manufacturer-directed protocol. Nuclei were fluorescently labeled with SYTO 13 (GeoMx Nuclear Stain Morphology kit, Item no. 121300303, Nanostring, Seattle, WA), and microglia cells were labeled with an Iba1 (GeoMx Alzheimer's Morphology Kit, Item no. 121300306, NanoString, Seattle, WA) antibody. The regions of interest (ROIs) were selected based on visual identification of anatomic regions using SYTO 13, aided by Iba1 expression. The following ROIs were selected: primary somatic sensory area, dentate gyrus polymorph layer, thalamus, and the optic tract. The following protein cores and modules were used for multiplexed protein quantification: Neural Cell Profiling (Item no. 121300120), Parkinson's disease pathology (Item no. 121300122), Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology (Item no. 121300121), AD pathology extended (Item no. 121300123), Glial cell subtyping (Item no. 121300125), and autophagy (Item no. 121300124) markers. Samples were processed on the NanoString GeoMx system and the nCounter max system following manufacturer's instructions. Data were analyzed using GeoMx DSP analysis suit Version 2.4.0.421 as suggested by manufacturer instructions. Briefly, the Field of view registered-quality control (FOV-QC) was adjusted to 45% to check the low count score. All the QC passed segments were normalized to housekeepers such as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and histone H3. Background corrections were performed with the negative background targets. Background corrected files were changed to tab-delimited files, and custom scripts with slight modifications were used to generate volcano plots.\n\nStatistical analysis\nGraphPad Prism 9 software was used to perform all the statistical analysis. Mann-Whitney test followed up with FDR-Benjamini Hochberg correction (q\u2009=\u20095%) to determine significant differences in nodal properties between control and injured mice. Grubbs' test was performed (Alpha\u2009=\u20090.05). Outliers, data beyond the outlier boundary with mean\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5 standard deviations, were removed from global, regional, and efficiency analyses data sets. Repeated measures two-way analysis of variance was performed to measure the global differences and differences between density thresholds in rsfMRI data. An unpaired t-test was performed within the GeoMx DSP analysis suit to analyze the NanoString GeoMx Spatial Profiling data. Uncorrected P-values and effect size are reported using methods previously described for functional connectivity network visualizations.\n29\nAll the results were represented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation;\np\n<\u20090.05 is considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Selection of studies\nWe selected studies underlying the CDC Guideline,\n33\nwhich were identified through a systematic review.\n34\nWe collected the articles identified for four of the six clinical questions from the systematic review (Questions 1, 4, 5, and 6 on the topics of diagnosis, short-term prognosis [within 1 year of injury], longer-term prognosis [beyond 1 year post-injury], and treatment/rehabilitation, respectively). Our focus was on diagnosis and management; thus, we did not examine the studies relevant to the two clinical questions that addressed neuroimaging. A total of 38 studies were identified; one study was excluded because it was a conference presentation, resulting in a final sample of 37 published studies.\n39\u201375\n\nData extraction\nWe developed a coding sheet to identify SDoH and associated subcategories derived from both the Healthy People 2020\n5\nand Healthy People 2030\n4\nwebsites. Each of these websites lists the same five SDoH domains: Economic Stability, Education Assess and Quality, Health Care Access and Quality, Neighborhood and Built Environment, and Social and Community Context. Healthy People 2020 provided a bulleted list of these five domains, with several key issues and underlying factors within each domain. For example, a key issue listed under Economic Stability is \u201cpoverty.\u201d We included each of the key issues and underlying factors as separate variables to code. We then cross-referenced this list with the information on Healthy People 2030, which provides a separate webpage for each SDoH domain, with an \u201cOverview and Objectives\u201d section that presents brief text descriptions. Three authors (NEC, AKK, BCL) read each text description and extracted any additional key issues or underlying factors that were not included in the Healthy People 2020 bulleted list. For example, in the Health Care Access and Quality domain, health and/or dental insurance was listed in Healthy People 2030, but it was not on the Healthy People 2020 list; therefore, it was added to the coding sheet.\nThe coding sheet also included summary information about the study sample including the sample size, average age, age range, as well as the gender, racial, and ethnic composition of the sample (coders collected the exact sample details or identified that the information was \u201cNot Reported\u201d by the study authors). The coding sheet also included study design, whether studies included exclusionary criteria based on demographic, sociocultural, or health factors, and whether studies mentioned future directions/research needs regarding social determinants or health equity. Lastly, we added summary variables to characterize whether, or the extent to which, each study analyzed or provided information about the following five key health equity variables: race, ethnicity, culture/acculturation, SES, and language. Coders could indicate whether the study: 1) provided no mention of the variable; 2) included the variable as a demographic category only; or 3) examined the variable in depth (e.g., the health equity variable was a primary variable of interest in the study or outcome/prognostic results were stratified and reported across levels of the variable). The study coding sheet is included in the online supplemental materials.\nAfter the coding sheet was developed, four authors (NEC, AKK, BCL, IAI) reviewed the 37 articles. Five studies were assigned to all four raters as training articles and the raters met as a group to discuss and calibrate ratings. The remaining 32 articles were assigned to two raters each. Authors performed a content analysis independently by extracting details for each study and completing the coding sheet described above. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Lastly, two authors (NEC and AKK) independently determined whether articles addressed SDoH by examining the variables in an inferential or intentional way (e.g., the SDoH variable represented a primary focus or emphasis of the study, or the SDoH variable served as a primary predictor of outcome), or in a descriptive or demographic way (e.g., the SDoH variable was summarized as a demographic variable only, mentioned in the\ndiscussion\nsection as an area of future study, or utilized as a design feature of the study such as might pertain to recruitment, inclusion/exclusion criteria).\n\nData analysis and synthesis\nThe percentages of studies that were identified as including each of the five SDoH domains and each of the five key health equity variables were calculated and summarized descriptively. No statistical significance testing or quantitative synthesis/meta-analytic techniques were used."

    "Methods": "Data source\nData were derived from the prospective dataset obtained during ProTECTIII,\n1\na randomized multi-center phase-III clinical trial to determine the efficacy of intravenous progesterone as a neuroprotective agent when administered within 4\u2009h of TBI. Patients with non-penetrating moderate to severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score [GCS] 4\u201312) who presented to participating United States trauma centers within 4\u2009h of injury were screened for enrollment. Patients with hypoxia, hypotension, spinal cord injury, status epilepticus, and bilateral unreactive pupils were excluded.\nA composite functional outcome metric using the Glasgow Outcome Scale, Extended (GOS-E) and Disability Rating Scale (DRS) endpoints was measured at six months, the limit of prospective follow-up during ProTECTIII. The 882 patients were enrolled in ProTECTIII from 2010 to 2013 before its cessation for futility in the primary outcome (effect of progesterone vs. placebo). Data from this cohort, however, include rigorously adjudicated multi-modal monitoring and cross-sectional imaging, representing one of the largest prospective TBI cohorts nationally.\nStandardization of methods throughout the clinical trial was optimized; for example, all baseline head CT data were acquired within 4\u2009h of TBI. All imaging findings were coded prospectively in a standardized imaging case report form (CRF) by a blinded central neuroradiologist. Each imaging CRF included 70 imaging biomarkers per patient.\n\nCovariates and outcomes\nFor the purposes of the present analyses, the ProTECTIII data were applied to identify predictive markers of death and poor outcome. Poor functional outcome was defined as DRS \u22656 or GOS-E \u22645. Data on clinical and imaging characteristics, ICP, and surgical intervention (craniotomy, hemicraniectomy, or external ventricular drain placement) were assessed.\nThe predictive value of physiological variables including ICP has been described previously.\n13\nFor example, a recorded ICP \u201ctransgression\u201d is defined as an instance of ICP \u226520\u2009mm Hg that persists for at least 10\u2009min duration. The threshold of 20\u2009mm Hg was selected based on past analyses of the ProTECTIII dataset.\n13\nThe proportion of time with elevated ICP is computed as the proportion of hours during which at least one such transgression was recorded, divided by the total number of hours over which ICP recordings were maintained. Maximum ICP is the greatest absolute ICP value measured during any transgression. Analysis of correlation between CT data and ICP recordings is limited to those patients in whom invasive monitoring was performed (GCS \u22648,\nn\n=\u2009354).\nImaging variables extracted for use in the present analysis include five signs of elevated ICP (sulcal obliteration, lateral ventricular compression, compression of the third ventricle, presence of midline shift, and visualized herniation). Visualized herniation was itself a composite metric that included transtentorial, uncal, tonsilar, or upward herniation present on head CT. Phenotype of lesions include subdural hematoma (SDH), EDH, SAH, intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH), multi-focal contusion, IVH, and DAI. Location of lesion is defined as: lobar, basal ganglia, or infratentorial hemorrhage. Presence of lesions \u226530 cc based on volume is assessed; volumes were measured using methods of semi-automated lesion segmentation and volume estimation published previously by these authors.\n3\n\nStatistical analysis\nData analyses were performed using R (\nR 4.0.5 and R Studio 1.4\n). Multi-variate logistic regressions were applied to evaluate the association of clinical covariates, such as signs of increased ICP or phenotype/location of traumatic hemorrhage, with binary response variables, defined as death and poor functional outcome. To analyze continuous response variables, such as maximum ICP, average ICP, and time until death, multiple linear regressions and analysis of effect size were used. The proportion of time spent with ICP \u226520\u2009mm Hg of the total time over which ICP measurements were recorded, was also considered as a separate continuous response variable. Number of CT biomarkers of elevated ICP was assessed as a categorical predictor.\nStatistical significance (\np\nvalue) was calculated by using Wald test and F test under assumption of logistic regression and linear regression, respectively, with 95% confidence interval (CI) and\np\n<\u20090.05 utilized to define statistical significance. Odds ratios (ORs) and CIs for regression coefficients were calculated.\nReceiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves assessing accuracy of the composite number of signs of elevated ICP on CT, Marshall score, and Rotterdam scores as three potential predictors of patient outcome (death and poor six-month functional outcome) were calculated and compared. Calculations were based on 100 iterations of logistic regression with an 80/20 training/testing split. Areas under these curves (AUC) values were subsequently calculated and reported with the 95% CI displayed."

    "Methods": "Participants\nThis study was reviewed and approved by the local Institutional Review Boards of Northwell Health and participating institutions. This study was listed on\nclincaltrials.gov\n#NCT02731027. Written informed consent was obtained from all individuals, or their proxies, before study enrollment. Participants were recruited from 2016-2020 at Level One Trauma Centers associated with: Northwell Health, The Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation, University of Louisville, Thomas Jefferson University, University of British Columbia, and the Ohio State University Medical Center. All samples included in this analysis were collected prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. For inclusion in the control group (CTL), individuals without SCI were: (\n1\n)\n>\n18 years of age, (\n2\n) without current or history of cancer, (\n3\n) without a history of SCI, autoimmune or neurodegenerative diseases, and (\n4\n) were similar in age range and sex distribution as the participants with SCI. Inclusion criteria for participants with SCI were: (\n1\n)\n>\n18 years of age, (\n2\n) initial SCI 0-3 days prior, (\n3\n) classified with an American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grade of A to D, and (\n4\n) neurological injury level of cervical (C)4-thoracic (T)10. The presence of a SCI was determined by clinical and radiographic presentation. Neurological level of injury (NLI) and severity of injury were classified according to the International Standards for Neurologic Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI), resulting in the AIS of A, B, C or D. AIS A indicates motor and sensory function below the NLI is absent (motor complete), AIS B indicates some sensory, but not motor, function below the NLI is present (motor complete), AIS C and D indicate motor function is partially preserved below the NLI (motor and sensory incomplete), with greater motor function preserved in AIS D as compared to AIS C(\n36\n). Patients with active infections at the time of a study visit were asked to reschedule it as soon as possible and/or to complete any remaining study visits when their infections had resolved.\nFor this report, samples from individuals with acute motor complete injuries (AIS A or B, N\u2009=\u20096) were analyzed as a group and compared to samples from individuals with acute motor incomplete injuries (AIS C or D, N\u2009=\u20096). While individuals with AIS B injuries have better physical and psychosocial health outcomes than individuals with AIS A injuries at 12 MPI(\n37\n), here we included the single individual with an acute AIS B injury in the motor complete group because their biochemical profile clustered with the other samples from individuals with motor complete (AIS A) injuries. Potential participants were excluded if there was documented medical history of cancer, autoimmune disease, other neurologic disease, or for any reason that a physician felt their participation was contraindicated. The data presented here are from the first 12 participants with SCI who had blood samples collected at a minimum of three study visits, including the acute sample.\nBlood samples from participants with SCI were scheduled for collection at study visits 0-3 days post injury (DPI, \u201cacute\u201d), and again at 3 MPI, 6 MPI, and 12 MPI. For participants without SCI (CTL), blood samples were obtained once. Due to logistical challenges and medical events, not all blood samples were available for analysis by all three biological outcomes presented here. If an individual had an active infection or pressure injury at the time of a study visit, no blood sample was drawn at that time. The number of participants with SCI included in each analysis were: RNA-sequencing (N\u2009=\u200910), ELISA (N\u2009=\u200912), and flow cytometry (N\u2009=\u20097, only from Northwell Health participants). CTLs were recruited at Northwell Health and their samples were used for RNA-sequencing (N\u2009=\u20099) or flow cytometry (N\u2009=\u200912) analyses.\n\nRNA-sequencing\nWhole blood was collected in PAXgene tubes (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands) and stored at -80C until analysis. Total RNA was isolated by QIAcube, using the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands). RNA quality was determined on the Agilent Bioanalyzer, mRNA-Seq libraries were prepared (Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with RiboZero Globin (Catalog #20020612) and 100\u2009bp paired-end reads were collected on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (Northwell Health). Using Partek Genomics Flow software (St. Louis, MO, USA), trimmed reads were aligned using STAR to the human genome (hg38 genome assembly), filtered for expression >50, normalized using the Trimmed Mean of\nM\n-values (TMM) method using the edgeR package embedded in Partek Genomics, and log2 transformed. Differential expression of transcripts was determined by one way ANOVA with a fold change greater than 1.5, using the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg FDR <0.05 or <0.001, as indicated (Partek Genomics Flow). For functional analysis of differentially expressed (DE) genes, if multiple transcripts for the same gene symbol were DE, then the transcript with the lowest\np\n-value for that gene symbol was included for further analyses. Venn diagrams were created in Venny to determine distinct or shared genes by study visit(\n38\n). Functional analysis of DE genes was performed using the bioinformatics platform Enrichr(\n39\n). Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed using default parameters (Partek Genomics Flow) for the determination of the component number.\n\nFlow cytometry\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were purified from fresh whole blood using Ficoll Paque Plus (GE Healthcare) and the manufacturer's standard protocol. PBMCs were labeled with fluorescently labeled multicolor antibody panels (\nSupplementary Table S1\n) and then fixed with 4% PFA. One-two million cells were stained in each antibody cocktail and approximately 150,000 total events were collected using a BD LSRII Flow Cytometer. Analysis was performed using FlowJo software (FlowJo, LLC). Cells were first gated as leukocytes using forward (FSC) versus side scatter (SSC), and then the singlet population was selected. Cell types and activation states were defined by standard gating strategies (\nSupplementary Fig. S1\n).\n\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for protein profiling\nCytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were measured in plasma samples from participants with SCI using commercially available single analyte ELISAs and multiplex bead-based assays. Single analyte ELISAs were used to measure C Reactive Protein (CRP, IBL International #EU59131), and High Mobility Group Box 1 protein (HMGB1, IBL International # ST51011), according to manufacturers' recommended protocols. ELISA data were collected on a SpectraMax plate reader (Molecular Devices) and analyzed using GraphPad Prism 9. A multiplex assay (Bio-Plex Pro Human Cytokine Screening Panel, 48-plex, #12007283) was used to measure an additional 48 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. Assays were performed according to manufacturers' recommended protocols. Data was collected on a Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad) and analyzed using Bio-Plex manager software. Plasma samples were assayed in duplicate. Assay ranges were essentially as specified by the manufacturers. Kit controls were within expected concentration ranges, %CV across all samples and all analytes were 7.3%, with an average recovery of 100% and a range of 70-130%. For statistical analysis, measurements below the limit of detection were assigned a value of half the lowest detectable value (LLOQ). Analytes (N\u2009=\u200934/50) that were detectable in >50% of the samples were compared between samples from participants with SCI (motor complete vs. incomplete injuries)."

    "Methods": "The post-TBI ADRD subcommittee followed methods deployed in the 2013 ADRD Conference,27the 2016 ADRD Summit,28and the 2019 ADRD Summit,24as previously described25and explained in greater detail in the ADRD Summit 2022 Report to the National Advisory Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NANDS) Council.29A brief summary is provided below in the next section.\n\nPre-summit activities\nThe session chair of the post-TBI AD/ADRD special topic subcommittee (K.D.O'C.), together with NIH session leads, formed a subcommittee by selecting from a roster of experts with diverse and relevant expertise in TBI, post-traumatic neurodegeneration, neuropathology of TBI and AD/ADRDs, basic and translational TBI and AD/ADRD science, TBI and dementia epidemiology, and neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers of TBI and dementia. The subcommittee met regularly via teleconference between November 2021 and March 2022 to evaluate progress since the 2019 ADRD Summit, examine enduring gaps in knowledge, and develop and refine scientific recommendations.\nA joint NINDS/NIA request for information solicited public input on updating the ADRD research priorities, and NIH staff provided the subcommittee with responses for review. Cross-committee coordination was facilitated by monthly teleconferences of the Summit Organizing Committee which consisted of scientific committee chairs, the Summit Scientific Chair, NIH and other federal officials including the NINDS/NIH Summit lead, and the Steering Committee. The Post-TBI AD/ADRD Subcommittee chair attended MED committee meetings to facilitate coordination and complementarity of recommendations, and other subcommittee members rotated attendance at all AD/ADRD Committee meetings to facilitate interdisciplinary and cross-committee communication. Committees and their participants are detailed in the ADRD Summit 2022 Report to the NANDS Council.\n30\nThe ADRD Summit 2022 agenda and draft recommendations were posted online and distributed to ADRD Summit registrants to gather input from stakeholders and the public.\n\nSummit\nBecause of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the 2022 ADRD Summit was held on a virtual 2-day platform on March 22 and 23, 2022. Engagement of stakeholders was encouraged through interactive question and answer sessions as a proxy for an open microphone; efforts were made to closely approximate the open interactions achieved at prior in-person summits. Participants were invited to speak during the live session by using a virtual hand-raising feature or typing their names into the chat so that they could be called upon to address the speakers and panels directly.\nMore than 1500 individuals registered for the 2022 ADRD Summit, nearly double the registration numbers from prior summits. Up to 700 registrants attended most sessions, which were also recorded for archival viewing.\n31\n,\n32\nPost-TBI AD/ADRD subcommittee chair (K.D.O'C.) provided a brief introduction to the topic area, and subcommittee members presented a summary of scientific rationale and draft recommendations for investigating post-TBI AD/ADRD. As with prior ADRD summits, the primary goal was to seek public input on recommendations from a wide stakeholder audience including researchers; clinicians; representatives from government, industry, and non-profit organizations; and individuals with lived experience, their loved ones, caregivers, and advocacy groups.\n\nPost-summit follow-up\nFollowing the summit proceedings, NINDS led a closed executive session with session chairs, NIH and other federal officials, Steering Committee members, and the scientific chair to review stakeholder input from the summit, consider proposed revisions, and edit the draft recommendations. Over teleconference, the TBI-ADRD Subcommittee met to further refine the content, prioritization, and proposed timelines for research recommendations. The finalized ADRD Summit 2022 Prioritized Research Milestones recommendations were submitted in a report\n30\nto the NANDS Council, approved by them in September 2022, and then submitted together with the ADRD Summit 2022 Success Criteria to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) NAPA Council in November 2022. Upon acceptance by the NAPA Council, the research recommendations became ADRD research implementation milestones in the National Plan."

For the three level 1 trauma centers, eligible participants included all traumatic brain injury patients presenting to the emergency department who underwent a clinically indicated head computed tomography (CT) scan within 24\u2009h of injury. Study exclusion criteria consisted of pregnancy, being in law enforcement custody, being on psychiatric hold, non-English speaking, and having contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n14\nThe TRACK-TBI Pilot Study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of all participating institutions and written informed consent was obtained at each study visit from participants or proxies.

A capture antibody for each biomarker was printed on an electrode array spot within the wells of 96-well MULTI-ARRAY\n\u00ae\nplates. Detection antibody was conjugated with electrochemiluminescent SULFO-TAG\u2122. To reduce background and reduce heterophilic antibody interference, diluents contained various blockers including purified mouse immunoglobulin. Plates were read on a SECTOR\n\u00ae\nImager 6000 reader. Calibrator dilutions were assayed in duplicate, and samples were measured in singlicate in order to maximize the number of assays run with limited sample volume.\n17\nEach plate also contained a control sample made from a plasma pool and eight dilutions of a recombinant calibrator for each biomarker. The calibrator data was fitted with a four-parameter logistic curve fit and used to quantitate control and sample biomarker concentrations. The calibration curve also was used to estimate the upper limit of each immunoassay's linear range.\n\nTBI severity indices and outcome measures\nTBI severity was assessed by the initial Glasgow Coma Scale\n2\n(GCS; classified as mild [score 13-15] vs. moderate/severe injury [score 3-12]) and the initial head CT (classified as positive vs. negative for acute intracranial injury defined according to the TBI Common Data Elements [CDE] Neuroimaging Working Group expert consensus recommendations).\n18\n,\n19\nIn secondary analyses, we also considered the CT findings of the presence versus absence of contusions, subdural hemorrhages (SDHs), subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAHs), intraventricular hemorrhages (IVHs), and diffuse axonal injury, as well as MRI findings in a subsample of 123 participants (presence vs. absence of any injury-related findings and the presence vs. absence of microhemorrhages; all defined according to the TBI CDE Neuroimaging Working Group expert consensus recommendations).\n18\n,\n19\nGlobal functional outcome was assessed at 3 and 6 months by the Glasgow Outcome Scale, Extended-TBI Version (GOSE-TBI), which is a self- or proxy-reported global measurement of functional impairment due only to the TBI (i.e., not due to co-occurring polytrauma).\n20\nThe GOSE-TBI was categorized as 1-4 (dead; vegetative state; lower/upper severe disability) versus 5-8 (lower/upper moderate disability; lower/upper good recovery). Secondary symptom-related and cognitive outcomes were assessed at 6 months, including the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire\n21\n(RPQ; measure of self-reported post-TBI symptoms, higher scores indicate more severe symptoms), the Satisfaction with Life Scale\n22\n(SWLS; measure of general life satisfaction, higher scores indicate greater life satisfaction), the 18-Item Brief Symptom Inventory Global Severity Index\n23\n(BSI-18-GSI; measure of psychological distress, higher scores indicate more severe psychological symptoms), the California Verbal Learning Test\n24\n(CVLT; test of verbal learning and memory, sum of trials 1-5, higher scores indicate better performance), the Trail Making Test Parts A and B\n25\n(TMT-A and TMT-B; test of executive function and processing speed, time to completion, higher scores indicate worse performance), and the Processing Speed Index from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 4th Edition\n26\n(WAIS-PSI; test of processing speed, higher scores indicate better performance).\n\nStatistical analysis\nBaseline characteristics of TRACK-TBI Pilot Study participants with (\nn\n=\u2009159) and without (\nn\n=\u2009427) available biomarker data are shown using means and standard deviations (SDs) for continuous variables, and numbers and proportions for categorical variables. Characteristics were compared between groups using Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests for continuous variables and Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables. Baseline characteristics were also compared between included participants with and without 3- and 6-month GOSE-TBI outcomes.\nSpearman's correlations were calculated between each microvascular injury biomarker pair. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for associations of each biomarker with measures of injury severity (age-adjusted) and GOSE (age- and GCS-adjusted) outcomes. We additionally used false discovery rate (FDR) correction to control for multiple comparisons. Spearman's correlations were used to assess the associations of each individual biomarker with the secondary outcomes of RPQ, SWLS, BSI-18-GSI, CVLT, TMT-A, TMT-B, and WAIS-PSI scores. Due to the skewness of the biomarker distributions, log-transformed values were used for all the modeling.\nIn addition to examining associations of injury severity and outcomes with each biomarker separately, we performed a non-linear principal components analysis on 15 biomarkers (excluding c-Fibronectin as it was not measured in all included participants) for dimension reduction. A scree plot was generated to determine the percent of variance accounted for by each principal component (PC). A 1000 times permutation test was used to test whether the variance accounted for was greater than chance, and results were used to identify components for subsequent analyses. Individual scores for each participant on the PCs were calculated based on the weight of the loadings for all biomarkers. Logistic regression and Spearman's correlations were used to estimate the associations of the first and second principal component (PC1 and PC2) scores with injury severity and GOSE-TBI and secondary outcomes. The PC analysis was conducted using the syndRomics package\n27\nin statistical software R (version 4.1.2).\n28\nAll other analyses were performed using statistical software R (version 3.6.1)\n28\nand a two-sided\np\nvalue <0.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Research participants\nStudy participants included 98 children, age 8 to 15 years, consecutively treated at the ED at Rady's Children's Hospital, San Diego, for either a mTBI or OI. Inclusion criteria for the mTBI group were: 1) evidence of a TBI that resulted in an observed loss of consciousness; 2) a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)\n71\nscore of 13-14; or 3) a GCS score of 15 with at least two symptoms of concussion as noted by the ED medical staff (e.g., persistent post-traumatic amnesia, transient neurological deficits, vomiting, nausea, headache, diplopia, dizziness).\nExclusion criteria for the mTBI group included: 1) loss of consciousness greater than 30\u2009min or a GCS score of less than 13; 2) any injury requiring neurosurgical intervention; 3) documented history of previous TBI meeting the above criteria for at least mTBI; 4) associated injury that is severe, documented with the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS)\n72\nscore greater than 3; 5) hypoxia, hypotension, or shock associated with the injury; 6) associated injury that is likely to interfere with cognitive testing (e.g., injury to dominant upper limb); 7) alcohol or drug ingestion involved with the injury; 8) pre-injury neurological disorder, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, or intellectual deficiency; 9) any medical contraindication to MRI and MEG; 10) illegal immigrant status; 11) history of child abuse; 12) extensive dental hardware or orthodontia (e.g., braces and large metal dentures; fillings were acceptable) or other metal objects in the head, neck, or face areas that cause artifacts in the MEG data, not removable during pre-processing; and 13) currently taking medications (e.g., some sedative neuroleptics and hypnotics) known to alter the power of brain rhythms.\n73\nInclusion criterion for the OI group was the presence of upper or lower limb fractures. Exclusion criteria for the OI group included: 1) injury to the head or TBI; and 2) exclusion criteria 3 through 13 for the mTBI group above. Determination of eligibility was made by review of the electronic medical record and screening interview with the parent/guardian.\nParticipants were invited to attend three research sessions at different time-points: 1) at baseline (approximately 3 weeks post-injury); 2) at MRI (approximately 7 weeks post-injury); and 3) at 3-month follow-up. Entry criteria were specified with respect to the initial ED visit regardless of symptom status at the baseline or subsequent visits.\n\nPost-concussive symptom assessment\nDuring the baseline and 3-month follow-up sessions, parents rated PCS on the Health and Behavior Inventory (HBI) scale,\n74\nwhich is comprised of 20 items that assess cognitive (\nn\n=\u200911) and somatic (\nn\n=\u20099) symptoms that have been related to TBI. The 11 cognitive symptoms include problems with attention, distractibility, concentration, memory, following directions, daydreaming, confusion, forgetfulness, task completion, problem solving, and learning. The nine somatic symptoms were headaches, dizziness, the feeling of a spinning room, faintness, blurred vision, double vision, nausea, commonly fatigued, and easily fatigued. The frequency of each symptom is rated on a four-point scale ranging from 0 (\u201cnever\u201d), 1 (\u201crarely\u201d), 2 (\u201csometimes\u201d), and 3 (\u201coften\u201d). Thus, the ranges of the HBI domain scores are from 0-33, 0-27, and 0-60 for cognitive, somatic, and total score, respectively. The scale has been used and has been recommended for use in research in pediatric TBI studies.\n74\n,\n75\nFactor analyses demonstrated dimensions representative of cognitive and somatic symptoms. The HBI has adequate construct validity, good to excellent internal consistency, and reliability, and can be used in longitudinal assessments of children.\n76\nThe parent-rated version rather than the child-rated version of the HBI was used for these analyses because the parent may be in the best observational role to rate symptoms following injury.\n77\nParents rated their child's somatic and cognitive symptoms during the 1-month interval prior to the injury, the week of baseline (acute/sub-acute visit), and the week of the 3-month follow-up. The severity of cognitive, somatic, and total symptoms is calculated by summing the scores in each domain.\n\nMEG data acquisition and signal pre-processing\nrs-MEG data were collected at the University of California, San Diego MEG Center using the VectorView\u2122 whole-head MEG system (Elekta-Neuromag, Helsinki, Finland) with 306 MEG channels. The rs-MEG exam was conducted during the acute/sub-acute baseline post-injury visit. Participants sat inside a multi-layer magnetically-shielded room.\n78\nMEG recordings were divided into two 5-min blocks where the participant was instructed to keep his/her eyes closed and empty his/her mind. Data were sampled at 1000\u2009Hz and run through a high-pass filter with a 0.1\u2009Hz cut-off, and a low-pass filter with a 330\u2009Hz cut-off. Micro eye blinks and eye movements were monitored using two pairs of bipolar electrodes, and heart signals were monitored with another pair of bipolar electrodes.\nSubstantial efforts were taken to help ensure that participants were alert during the rs-MEG recordings. Prior to MEG sessions, participants completed a questionnaire about the number of hours they slept the previous night, how rested they felt, and if there was any reason that they might not be attentive and perform to the best of their abilities (e.g., headache, pain). Sessions alternated between eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions, and eye blinking and movement were monitored. During MEG recording, participants were viewed on camera and technicians continuously monitored alpha band oscillations, which are consistently associated with tonic alertness.\n79\n\nPre-processing steps to remove artifacts and noises in rs-MEG data\nEyes-closed rs-MEG sensor waveforms were first run through MaxFilter, also known as signal space separation,\n80-82\nto remove external interferences (e.g., magnetic artifacts due to metal objects, strong cardiac signals, environment noises) and to co-register the MEG data by removing the small head movements across the two 5-min eyes-closed sessions. Residual artifacts near the sensor array due to micro eye movements and residual cardiac signals were removed via Independent Component Analysis using Fast-ICA.\n83\n,\n84\nThe waveforms associated with top independent components were examined by an experienced MEG data analyst, along with eye and heart signals. Independent components associated with eye movement, heartbeats, and other artifacts were removed.\n\nStructural MRI, MEG-MRI registration, boundary element method forward calculation\nStructural MRI of the participant's head was collected using a General Electric 3T MRI scanner. The acquisition contains a standard high-resolution anatomical volume with a resolution of 0.94\u2009\u00d7\u20090.94\u2009\u00d7\u20091.2\u2009mm\n3\nusing a T1-weighted three-dimensional inversion recovery prepared fast spoiled gradient recalled (3D-IR-FSPGR) pulse sequence. Scanner-related non-linear imaging distortions were corrected using a gradient non-linearity correction approach.\n85\nTo co-register the MEG with MRI coordinate systems, three anatomical landmarks (i.e., left and right pre-auricular points and nasion) were measured for each participant using the Probe Position Identification system (Polhemus, USA). By using MRILAB (Elekta/Neuromag) to identify the same three points on the participant's magnetic resonance (MR) images, a transformation matrix involving both rotation and translation between the MEG and MR coordinate systems was generated. To increase the reliability of the MEG-MR co-registration, approximately 120 points on the scalp were digitized with the Polhemus system, in addition to the three landmarks, and those points were co-registered onto the scalp surface of the MR images.\nThe T1-weighted images were also used to extract the brain volume and innermost skull surface (SEGLAB software by Elekta/Neuromag). The Realistic Boundary Element Method (BEM) head model was used for MEG forward calculation.\n86\n,\n87\nThe BEM mesh was constructed by tessellating the inner skull surface from the T1-weighted MRI into \u223c6000 triangular elements with \u223c5\u2009mm size. A cubic source grid with 5-mm size was used for calculating the MEG gain (i.e., lead-field) matrix, which leads to a grid with \u223c10,000 nodes covering the whole brain. MRIs were reviewed by a board-certified neuroradiologist (JRH), who determined that no mTBI or healthy control participant had visible lesions on MRI.\n\nMEG source magnitude imaging using Fast-VESTAL\nVoxel-wise MEG source magnitude images were obtained using our high-resolution Fast Vector-based Spatio-Temporal Analysis (Fast-VESTAL) MEG source magnitude imaging method.\n67\n,\n88\nThis approach requires the sensor waveform covariance matrix. The artifact-free, eyes-closed, rs-MEG sensor-waveform datasets were divided into 2.5-sec sections. The data in each section were first direct current (DC)-corrected and then run through one of the following band-pass filters for delta (1-4\u2009Hz) and gamma (30-80\u2009Hz) bands. Notch filter at 60\u2009Hz was applied to remove the power line signals.\nWaveforms from all 306 sensors were used in the analysis. Sensor-waveform covariance matrices were calculated in the time domain for individual sections after the band-pass filtering, in the same way as in our previous studies to preserve the phase information.\n54\n,\n88\nThen the final sensor-waveform covariance matrix was obtained by averaging the covariance matrices across individual sections for the concatenated 10-min rs-MEG data that combined the two 5-min blocks. From the covariance matrix, whole-brain MEG source magnitude images for each frequency band were obtained for each participant using the Fast-VESTAL procedure.\n67\n,\n88\n,\n89\n\nDesign of rs-MEG machine learning approach\nThe proposed rs-MEG ML approach is a supervised leaning method.\nFigure 1\nshows the diagrams of the ML approach. In the 98 participants and for each frequency-band model, voxel-wise whole-brain rs-MEG source images obtained from Fast-VESTAL were first spatially registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)-152\n90\nbrain-atlas template using FLIRT, an affine transformation program from FSL software.\n91\n,\n92\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSupport vector machine (SVM) machine-learning diagram. The input images include resting-state magnetoencephalography (rs-MEG) source imaging volumes in standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)-152 space across different frequency bands and participants. The rs-MEG source images are first convolved with a Gaussian kernel. Next, the maximum values from individual functional regions of interest are pooled to form the Pooling Layer. The elements in the Pooling Later are reshaped into the Flatten Layer. SVM with Recursive Feature Elimination is used to classify the individuals into either orthopedic injury (OI) or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) groups.\nSpatial convolution and Max-pooling using functional regions of interest (ROIs)\nOnce in MNI-152 space, the rs-MEG source imaging data from all frequency bands were first run through a spatial convolution layer. This convolution operation convolved the imaging data with a 3D Gaussian kernel with 5.0\u2009mm full width half maximum (FWHM) to further reduce the inter-subject variability in anatomy. Then, a Max-pooling procedure was applied to the spatially convolved rs-MEG source imaging data. In this procedure, the MEG source imaging voxels were grouped into 184 gray matter functional ROI variables using the FCONN parcellation with similar sizes.\n93\nIn each functional ROI, the maximum activity was obtained across all voxels within such an ROI. After regressing out age, 184 ROI features for each frequency band were obtained\nThe spatial convolution and Max-pooling procedure based on functional ROI played important roles in feature selection and dimension reduction, which is similar to the steps in 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D-CNN) for imaging processing,\n94\nexcept for two main differences. The first main difference is spatial convolution uses only the Gaussian kernel in rs-MEG ML, without any spatial-gradient based convolutional filters. The second main difference is that the Max-pooling is based on functional ROI in rs-MEG ML, rather than on Euclidean distance in 3D-CNN. These differences are discussed below.\nOnly one convolutional filter with Gaussian smoothing kernel was used in rs-MEG ML. This is one main difference between rs-MEG ML and the typical CNN approaches that use a large number of spatial gradient-based convolutional filters for processing structural images.\n95\u2013100\nThe gradient-based convolutional filters are good for detecting edges and shapes in images, and they usually require a large number (e.g., thousands) of samples to train. However, rs-MEG source magnitude images only contain \u201chot spots\u201d without edge, shape, and other features. The single layer of convolutional filter with a Gaussian smoothing kernel in rs-MEG ML, in combination with our Max-pooling layer (see below) using 184 functional ROIs, effectively achieved the goal of dimension reduction using a smaller number of samples to train.\nThe Max-pooling procedure based on functional ROIs\n93\nwas used in rs-MEG ML, instead of the geometric Max-pooling procedure based on Euclidean distance in typical CNN.\n95\u2013100\nIt is common that functionally distinct regions are next to each other with small Euclidean distance. The functional ROI-based Max-pooling has the advantage of taking into consideration the boundaries of functionally distinct regions. The rs-MEG source activity from the variables were reshaped into a 1-dimensional Flatten Layer for: 1) classifying mTBI and OI participants; and 2) predicting the symptom recovery in terms of PCS with a regression model. Age was projected out before further analyses.\nUse rs-MEG ML to classify mTBI and OI participants\nFor a training data set, SVM-classification function with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)\n101-103\nwas used to obtain the optimal ROI features from the Max-pooling ROI variables across all frequency bands (\nFig. 1\n). Initially, all K variables present in our ROI dataset were included in training the network model. Then, the performance of the RFE-SVM model was calculated. Next, we computed the performance of the model after eliminating each variable (K times). Specifically, we dropped one ROI variable every time and trained the model on the remaining K-1 variables. The ROI variable whose removal had produced the smallest (or no) change in the performance of the model was dropped. This process was repeated until no ROI variable could be eliminated. The source activity from the subset of ROI variables after the RFE were sent to SVM classification. In the SVM classification model (\nFig. 1\n), \u201cH\u201d stands for hyperplane(s) and \u201cM\u201d stands for maximum margin(s). The specific functions of SVM classification and RFE will be from the Scikit-lean Python Package. The output classes as shown in\nFigure 1\nwere the mTBI and OI groups\nThe performances of rs-MEG ML were examined for each individual frequency band, by changing the rs-MEG source imaging data in the Input Layer from the combined both-frequency bands data to that from each frequency band. The rest of the network design remained the same.\nUse rs-MEG ML to predict PCS recovery with regression\nAdditionally, we examined the ability of the rs-MEG ML approach for predicting the recovery with respect to PCS. In this approach, the ML diagram was similar to\nFigure 1\n, except the SVM-regression function was used for predicting the PCS scores and replaced the SVM-classification function. The rs-MEG data at the acute/sub-acute injury visit was used to predict the PCS score changes between the 3-month follow-up visit and the acute/sub-acute visit (i.e., 3-month PCS score minus the acute/sub-acute PCS score)\n\nModel building and performance evaluation for rs-MEG classification\nThe present rs-MEG ML model was built using a supervised learning approach. The entire set of 98 participants (59 mTBI and 39 OI) was used to generate the predictive model. The model performance was evaluated using Monte Carlo cross-validation.\n104\nThe participants were randomly split into a training set of 88 individuals (89.8%) and a validation set of 10 individuals (10.2%). The training set was used to establish the rs-MEG ML model, with the prediction accuracy computed on the validation set. The procedure was repeated 1000 times, with model performance averaged over the 1000 iterations. To control for label imbalance, the proportion of OI participants in each validation set was constrained to 30-70%. Age was projected out from the rs-MEG data before the above analyses were conducted.\nThe evaluation of model performance included: 1) sensitivity\u2009=\u2009TP/P, where P is number of mTBI subjects in the validation set and TP is the number among these correctly labeled as mTBI by the model; and 2) specificity\u2009=\u2009TN/N, where N is number of OI subjects in the validation set and TN is the number among these correctly classified as OI. SVM is a forced classification approach: it does not output individual-level classification probabilities, so no classification thresholds were used in determining sensitivity and specificity (e.g., via receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curves). Note that due to the limited sample size, the classification procedure uses the entire dataset for model training, with model evaluation via cross-validation, rather than splitting it into a training and testing dataset.\n105\nMonte-Carlo cross-validation was found in standard settings to more accurately estimate predictive performance than other options such as leave-one-out cross-validation.\n106\n,\n107\nThe choice of a 90:10 split of the training:validation sample in cross-validation corresponds to the choice of K\u2009=\u200910 for K-fold cross-validation, which is recommended as finding a balance between accurate estimation of predictive performance and leaving enough data for model training.\n105\n\nConventional voxel-wise analyses for rs-MEG source imaging\nAdditional analyses were conducted using the conventional MEG source magnitude imaging using a voxel-wise statistical analysis approach.\n67\nIn this approach, the registered rs-MEG source magnitude images in MNI-152 space were spatially smoothed using a Gaussian kernel with 5\u2009mm FWHM, followed by a logarithmic transformation using FSL. Then, a voxel-wise, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to test for differences between the mTBI and control groups, with age as a covariate. Family-wise error rate across voxels were controlled by using a standard cluster analysis for the t-value maps to create the corrected group statistical maps (\np\n<\u20090.01) for the MEG source magnitude images.\n67\n\nTraining and testing procedure for rs-MEG to predict PCS recovery\nTo predict PCS recovery (i.e., difference score, 3-month PCS score minus the acute/sub-acute PCS score) using the ML with rs-MEG data collected during the acute/sub-acute exam, the mTBI and OI groups were analyzed separately. For the mTBI group, the training data set contained 53 (or 89.8%) children and the testing data set contained six (or 10.2%) children. Again, to examine the robustness of the performances of rs-MEG ML, the procedures were repeated for 1000 different combinations of the 53 \u2013 6 splits. For the OI group, the number of children in the training and validation data sets were 35 (or 89.7%) and four (or 10.3%), respectively. The procedures were repeated for 1000 different combinations of the 35 \u2013 4 splits.\nWe focused on the combined rs-MEG ML model with both delta- and gamma-activity. Age was projected out from both the rs-MEG and the PCS difference score before these analyses were conducted. Two measures were used to assess the predictive performance of the rs-MEG ML approach: 1) the correlation value across subjects between the measured and ML-predicted PCS scores, and 2) the variance explained on the testing data sets by the ML-predicted PCS score out of the measured PCS score."

    "Methods": "The study was approved and conducted according to the guidelines set by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of New Mexico. The results are reported based on the Animal Research: Reporting ofIn VivoExperiments (ARRIVE) 2.0 Guidelines for Reporting Animal Research (Supplementary Checklist).25Male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA) were used for the experiment. They were maintained under standard conditions (25\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00b0C, humidity of 50\u2009\u00b1\u20096%, 12\u2009h light/dark cycle) with unlimited access to standard food and water for at least 1 week, for acclimatization, prior to the neurobehavioral training. Prior to inducing TBI, animals were randomly assigned to three study groups: (1) control (TBI with sham stimulation treatment), (2) lower dose nVNS (TBI with five 2-min doses), and (3) higher dose nVNS (TBI with five 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092-min [4\u2009min] doses). For randomization, we used a publicly available algorithm (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USAhttps://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/randomize1.cfm).\n\nInduction of TBI\nRats were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane in an induction chamber and were maintained during the procedure with 2.0\u20132.5% isoflurane. Rats in each studied group were kept under anesthesia for the same duration based on the most prolonged required anesthesia (90\u2009min post-injury) to avoid study bias. Buprenorphine (0.03\u2009mg/kg), meloxicam (2\u2009mg/kg), and 5\u2009mL of normal saline were administered subcutaneously (SC) shortly before the injury to alleviate pain and dehydration. Prior to surgery, the scalp and neck areas were shaved. We used a standard CCI model, as previously described.\n26\u201330\nBriefly, animals were placed in a standard rodent stereotaxic frame. The scalp was exposed, and the skull's fascia was retracted laterally to each side. Craniotomy was performed over the left motor cortex area using a micro drill with a 5-mm trephine. Next, a CCI device (Impact one, Leica Microsystem, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) with a 3-mm flat impactor tip was centered at 2.5\u2009mm lateral and 3.0\u2009mm posterior from bregma to induce a moderate injury with the following parameters: 5\u2009m/sec speed, 100\u2009ms dwell time, and 2\u2009mm deformation depth. After the injury was induced, the skin was sutured closed without replacing the skull flap. As part of post-operative care, administration of meloxicam (once daily) continued for 3 days to alleviate any possible pain and discomfort.\n\nnVNS therapy protocol\nA modified version of the commercial gammaCore (electroCore, Inc., NJ, USA) with miniaturized electrodes affixed to a Velcro collar was used to deliver non-invasive electrical stimulations (24\u2009V, 60\u2009mA, and 1\u2009ms duration bursts of 5\u2009kHz sinewaves, repeated at 25\u2009Hz), see\nFigures 1\nA and B. We initiated nVNS therapy 30\u2009min post-TBI with five nVNS treatments at the highest intensity/amplitude (24\u2009V) with two treatment durations (lower dose [five 2-min] or higher dose [five 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092-min], 10\u2009min apart); see\nFigure 1C\n. The device was attached but not turned on for the control group. The gammaCore device is factory programmed by the manufacturer to automatically deliver 2\u2009min of stimulation. Therefore, for a 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092-min stimulation, the device was turned on again within 15\u201330\u2009sec to deliver the second 2-min stimulation. At the completion of the nVNS therapy, the rat was moved to an intensive care system for recovery from anesthesia (Water Jacketed Warmer ICU Base with Clear Dome Cover, DW-1, ThermoCare, Sparks, NV, USA).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExperiment setup configuration.\n(A)\nModified gammaCore device for rat studies,\n(B)\nMiniaturized electrodes,\n(C)\nthe non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) protocols used for the experiment: lower dose (five 2-min) stimulations and higher dose (five 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092-min) stimulations.

Assessments were performed on days 1 and 7 post-TBI. For the beam walking, the time to cross the 1-m distance, number of footfalls, and falling from the beam (if applicable) were recorded and scored. For post-TBI assessments, an arbitrary 15\u2009sec was assigned to the crossing time if the rats fell from the beam before completing the task.\nBalance and motor function were also assessed using a rotarod test (Rotamex-5; Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH).\n31\u201334\nThe rats were trained on the apparatus until they could hold their balance on the rotating rod for 120\u2009sec in multiple trials with a rotational speed between 0 and 20\u2009rpm and an acceleration of 2\u2009rpm every 4\u2009sec (cutoff time at 120\u2009sec). For post-TBI assessments, the assessment continued until the cutoff time of 120\u2009sec or until the animal fell, where the latency to falling was recorded. Some of the rats would not stay on the rotating rod for 120\u2009sec, which may have been the result of increased anxiety and not the motor deficit. Therefore, rats were given two trials, 30\u2009min apart, for post-TBI assessments. We used the best time from the two trials as the result.\n\nAnxiety assessments\nAn elevated plus maze (EPM) was used to assess anxiety in animals before and after TBI, see\nFigure 1E\n.\n32\u201334\nThe 5-min follow-up assessments were videotaped on days 1 and 7 post-TBI. We used the EPM anxiety index ranging from 0 to 1, where an increased value expresses increased anxiety-like behavior:\n32\u201334\nE\nP\nM\nA\nn\nx\ni\ne\nt\ny\nI\nn\nd\ne\nx\n=\n1\n\u2212\nO\np\ne\nn\nA\nr\nm\nT\ni\nm\ne\nT\no\nt\na\nl\nT\ni\nm\ne\ni\nn\na\nl\nl\nA\nr\ne\na\ns\n+\nO\np\ne\nn\nA\nr\nm\nE\nn\nt\nr\ni\ne\ns\nT\no\nt\na\nl\nE\nn\nt\nr\ni\ne\ns\ni\nn\na\nl\nl\nA\nr\ne\na\ns\n2\nTo assess anxiety, we previously reported a novel paradigm using a modified beam walking (MBW) test that can provide information on anxiety level changes in rodents, which can potentially be a substitute for the EPM.\n34\nFor evaluation of anxiety on MBW, we defined two behaviors: peeking and full-body emergence from the safe box during a 5-min recording from the time the rats crosses the beam and enters the safe box on the apparatus. To obtain a single value that integrates anxiety-related behaviors on the MBW, a novel MBW anxiety index value (modified from our previously reported equation\n34\n) was calculated and ranged on a scale from 0 to 1 (mimicking the EPM anxiety index range), where total time on MBW refers to 5\u2009min:\nM\nB\nW\nA\nn\nx\ni\ne\nt\ny\nI\nn\nd\ne\nx\n=\n1\n\u2212\nT\ni\nm\ne\nS\np\ne\nn\nt\nP\ne\ne\nk\ni\nn\ng\n+\nT\ni\nm\ne\nF\nu\nl\nl\ny\nE\nm\ne\nr\ng\ne\nd\nT\no\nt\na\nl\nT\ni\nm\ne\no\nn\nM\nB\nW\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies\nMRI studies were conducted by the investigators (C.M.W., E.T., and Y.Y.) blinded to the treatment groups. The rats, anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane, were placed in a dedicated holder and positioned in the isocenter of a 7-T MRI scanner with a 30-cm bore (Bruker Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) equipped with a 20-cm gradient with a strength of 660 mT/m and shim systems.\nMRIs of the rats with T2-weighted (T\n2\nW) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) were conducted on days 1 and 7 post-TBI, along with additional baseline MRI conducted in 7 intact normal rats for comparison. A fast spin-echo sequence (i.e., rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement [RARE]) was used to acquire T\n2\nW MRI with the following parameters: repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE)\u2009=\u20095000\u2009ms/50\u2009ms, field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u200940\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u200940\u2009mm, slice thickness\u2009=\u20090.5\u2009mm, inter-slice thickness\u2009=\u20090\u2009mm, number of slices\u2009=\u200932, matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, number of averages\u2009=\u20094. Those parameters provided high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio imaging.\nDWI was implemented based on echo planar imaging (EPI) with parameters: TR/TE\u2009=\u20093000\u2009ms/20\u2009ms, FOV\u2009=\u200940\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u200940\u2009mm, slice thickness\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm, inter-slice distance\u2009=\u20090\u2009mm, number of slices\u2009=\u200916, matrix\u2009=\u2009128\u2009\u00d7\u2009128, number of averages\u2009=\u20094. An apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map was generated in Paravision 6 (Bruker Corporation).\n\nBrain lesion analysis\nWe used medical image processing, analysis, and visualization (MIPAV, National Institute of Health) software for performing planimetry measurements, as reported previously.\n35\u201339\nBriefly, the lesion comprising the hyperintense region (caused by edema) and tissue rupture/swelling observed on each MRI slice was outlined and multiplied by the slice thickness (0.5\u2009mm). The total lesion volume was the sum of the volumes for each slice.\nAnalysis of lesion ADC was performed using Vivoquant software (version 2021, Invicro, Needham, MA, USA). ADC maps (voxel size: 0.31\u2009\u00d7\u20090.31\u2009\u00d7\u20091.00\u2009mm, dimensions: 128\u2009\u00d7\u2009128\u2009\u00d7\u200916\u2009mm) were re-sampled to match the structural T2 image voxel size (0.16\u2009\u00d7\u20090.16\u2009\u00d7\u20090.50\u2009mm) and image dimensions (256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u200932\u2009mm). Volumes-of-interest (VOIs) were drawn on the transverse view of the structural T2 image and applied to the co-registered ADC maps. Specifically, a two-dimensional (2D) circular region of interest (ROI) was placed within the ipsilateral cortical lesion on the slice of maximal injury and on two adjacent slices to obtain a lesion VOI. The same procedure was performed in the contralateral cortex to obtain a normal tissue VOI. The ipsilateral lesion and contralateral cortex VOIs were equal in volume (2.23\u2009mm\n3\n). ADC values were determined as the % difference between the ipsilateral and the contralateral cortical tissues.\n\nBrain voxel-based morphometry\nVoxel-based brain volumetric changes were assessed using the T\n2\nW images with Advanced Normalization Tools in Python (ANTsPy)\n40\nand the FMRIB Software Library (FSL, Oxford, UK\n41\n). Brain scans were exported from Bruker to NIFTI.\n42\nInitial bias-field correction was performed, followed by skull stripping using a 2D U-Net deep learning method,\n43\na manual skull contour correction where necessary, and a second bias-field correction. As previously published by Pagani and coworkers,\n44\nvoxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis was performed following skull stripping. Briefly, a template from seven intact rats was created in ANTsPy, whereby individual brains of each subject were then non-linearly co-registered, and the Jacobian determinant map quantifying the amplitude of the local brain tissue shrinkage or expansion was determined. VBM was then performed using the FSL \u201cRandomise\u201d tool for non-parametric permutation inference on neuroimaging data with one-way between-subjects analysis of variance (ANOVA) and threshold-free cluster enhancement for image-based\np\nvalue determination. For better 2D visualization, projections from four MRI slices were created as either the mean with Jacobian determinants in the range of -0.4 to +0.4 for each studied group or the maximum projection of the image-based ANOVA\np\nvalue (threshold as 1-\np\n<\u20090.05), with this overlaid onto the gray scale T\n2\nW MRI intact baseline template, unless otherwise indicated.\n\nHistopathological assessments\nHistopathological studies were conducted by the investigators (O.A.B. and K.S.S) blinded to the treatment groups. Rats were transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS; their brains were harvested, fixed for 24\u2009h in 4% PFA in PBS, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS, and frozen in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA, USA) using dry ice for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Sample rat brains from each treatment group were sectioned coronally using cryostat Leica CM1850 (Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Tissue morphology was displayed by H&E staining protocols (Anatech LTD Harris hematoxylin and eosin-Y) for 10\u2009\u03bcm sections. Images were taken using NanoZoomer 2.0-HT slide scanner and analyzed using Hamamatsu\nNDP.view2\nsoftware (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Hamamatsu City, Japan).\n\nStatistical analysis\nMedian and inter-quartile ranges (IQR) were used to present weight, lesion volumes, and neurobehavioral results. We used the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test for normality, which has been recognized as the most powerful and commonly used normality test.\n45\nKruskal\u2013Wallis tests were used for overall inter-group differences at each time point (day 1 and day 7), followed by post-hoc Conover tests for paired group comparisons. Effect sizes were measured for the lesion volumes using the common Cohen's\nd\n(with pooled standard deviation [SD]). Following the common interpretation, Cohen's\nd\ncutoff values 0.20, 0.50, 0.80, and 1.2 were chosen for interpreting small, medium, large, or very large effect sizes, respectively. Multivariate days 1 and 7 treatment group effects for lesion volumes, neurobehavioral test performances, and anxiety indices were assessed using repeated-measures ANOVA. The Spearman Rho correlations were computed between lesion volumes and anxiety indices. A partial linear (Pearson) correlation was computed to assess the correlation between the two anxiety indices while controlling for the effect of the lesion volume. The effect of the treatment group on the footfall incidence for the MBW test was tested with Mann\u2013Whitney tests and a Poisson regression model, assuming a Poisson distribution for the fall count data. The statistical analysis was performed with a custom R code and MedCalc (v20.014).\nFor the ADC map % difference values, two outliers (far out values according to Tukey definition\n46\n) in the control group and one outlier in the lower dose nVNS group for day 7 were removed. These outliers were also removed for day 1 for applying the Wilcoxon paired tests between days 1 and 7. Intergroup differences for ADC % difference values on day 1 and day 7 were tested with Mann\u2013Whitney tests (independent samples). The homogeneity of variances among the three rat groups was tested using the Levene test. For VBM statistics, the FSL Randomize function with one-way between-subjects ANOVA and threshold-free cluster enhancement for image-based\np\nvalue determination was used. A\np\nvalue of 0.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Data source\nPatient records were obtained from the Institutional Review Board-approved North America Clinical Trial Network (NACTN) SCI registry. The registry is a prospective cohort database with patients being enrolled on admission. The data analyzed were collected across a consortium of 15 centers between 2005 and 2022. The database is capturing demographics and injury characteristics (including time of injury), treatment, complications, discharge disposition, and outcomes including American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) score. Information about this registry are detailed in a method article found within this special edition, titled \u201cNorth American Clinical Trials Network (NACTN) Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) Registry: Methodology and Analysis.\u201d The current analysis focused on acute outcomes during the initial hospitalization after injury.\n\nStudy cohort extraction\nThe exact time of injury was provided in the demographics file and was used to classify participants (\nn\n=\u2009759) into one of the four groups with injuries at 6:00 AM\u201312:00 PM, 12:00 PM \u22126:00 PM, 6:00 PM\u201312:00 AM, or 12:00 AM\u20136:00 AM. Time is presented in 24-h format and grouped as follows: 6:00\u201312:00, 12:00\u201318:00, 18:00\u201324:00, and 24:00\u20136:00. Those with missing exact time of injury were excluded. Other exclusion criteria were penetrating injury and those classified as SCI without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA). For retained participants, demographics, characteristics of injury, treatment, time trajectories to treatment (injury to arrival to surgery) were then obtained from the demographics, clinical evaluation, surgery summary, complications, discharge, and American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS) files. Time trajectories were calculated as hours elapsed between date times of injury, arrival and surgery (for those who underwent surgery).\n\nDescriptors and characteristics\nDemographics considered were age, sex, and race. Mechanism of injury and injury level were included to characterize the injury. Co-morbidities recorded in the data files are high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, heart attack, pulmonary, malignancy, smoking, and drug abuse, and were all included in this study. Initial clinical status was evaluated with blood pressure measurements, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP\u2009=\u2009(SBP +2DBP)/3). Initial ASIA AIS measurements, motor, pinprick and light touch scores) were used to describe the participants and their injury. Initial ASIA AIS measurements were those taken before surgery or within 7 days of injury for those who did not undergo surgical intervention for their SCI (the first within that window).\nFor AIS score progression, those presenting scores were compared with results of AIS evaluation that were taken within one month of a six-month period after SCI. Such data were available for 308 patients that were included in this study. Treatment parameters (surgery vs. not, time of surgery) were noted. Time of surgery was the hours elapsed between injury and surgery, divided into categories: 24\u2009h or under and over 24\u2009h. For those who underwent surgery after 24\u2009h, an additional categorization of their arrival time was made (arrival before 24\u2009h and arrival after 24\u2009h.\n\nOutcomes\nHospital length of stay, deaths, and discharge disposition for the included participants were obtained from the discharge information file. Additional outcomes were complications (cardiac, gastrointestinal/genitourinary, pulmonary, and skin) obtained from different complications files.\n\nStatistical methods\nSummary statistics were used to present the data. For continuous variables, median with 1st and 3rd quartiles were used because they were not normally distributed per the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For categorical variables, frequency count and percentage were used. Four group comparisons (SCI at 6:00\u201312:00, 12:00\u201318:00, 18:00\u201324:00, or 24:00\u20136:00) were performed using the Brown-Mood test for continuous variables and Chi-square tests for categorical variables. Subsequent two-by-two comparisons were performed using quantile and logit regressions with the characteristic or outcome of interest as the independent variable and the time group as the only dependent variable through linear contrasts. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to evaluate correlations between hour of injury and ASIA motor, pinprick, and light touch scores. All tests were two-sided with 5% significance level. Data pre-processing and analysis were performed in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC)."

    "Methods": "Animal groups and experimental design\nAll animals were housed in standard laboratory cages under 12:12-h light\u2013dark cycle conditions with standard rodent chow and water available\nad libitum\n. All experiments were performed during the light cycle. All animal procedures were approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Forty-two adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (220\u2013250\u2009g; Harlan Laboratories, Madison, WI, USA) were randomly divided into two groups: (1) spinally intact group (\nn\n=\u200912) and (2) T8 complete transection group (\nn\n=\u200930). In the spinally intact group total of 12 animals, all 12 were used to pharmacologically test LUT function and then 6 animals were used for Western blot study and the other 6 were used for histological study. In the T8 complete transection group, there were four subgroups at four different time points, including 1 (\nn\n=\u20096), 2 (\nn\n=\u20096), 4 (\nn\n=\u20096), and 8 weeks (\nn\n=\u200918) post-injury. All animals in the 1, 2, and 4 week post-injury groups were used for Western blot study. In the 8 weeks post-injury group, all 18 animals were used to pharmacologically test LUT function by intravenous (\nn\n=\u200912) or intrathecal (\nn\n=\u20096) drug delivery. After assessments of LUT function, 6 of the 12 animals with intravenous delivery were used for Western blot study and the other 6 animals were used for histological study. The spinal cord surgery was performed using ketamine/xylene anesthesia, and LUT functional assessments were prepared using isoflurane surgery and then recovery for 1\u2009h prior to recordings when the animals were awake. All efforts were made to minimize suffering. All procedures were performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nT8 spinal cord laminectomy and complete transection surgery\nAnimals had operations performed under general anesthesia using intraperitoneal administration of ketamine (60\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg). The body temperature was monitored by a rectal probe and maintained using a heating pad underneath the animal, which automatically adjusted the temperature based on feedback from the rectal probe. A sterile eye lubricant (Paralube) was applied to prevent dehydration. The musculature was cut from T7-T9 following the skin incision and the dorsal surface of the T8 segment was exposed by laminectomy. The spinally intact group did not receive the following injury procedures. For the complete transection group, a complete cut was made by a scissor at T8, resulting a separated gap (2\u20133\u2009mm) between two stumps. A high-magnification surgical microscope was used to confirm that there was no remaining neural tissue between the two stumps of cord. The overlying musculature was sutured closed and the skin was closed using 4-0 black monofilament suture.\n\nWestern blot analyses of spinal cord tissues\nThe spinally intact animals and animals at four different time points (1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks) post-SCI were subjected to transcardial perfusion with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The spinal cord rostral to the injury (T5/6), and sympathetic (T10\u223cL2) and parasympathetic (L6/S1) segments of spinal cord were homogenized in a radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). All samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. Protein concentration was estimated using a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Protein lysates were prepared in 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and dithiothreitol (DTT) and then incubated at 95\u00b0C for 5\u2009min. Equal amounts of protein were loaded into each well (50\u2009\u03bcg) of stain-free Novex 4\u201312% Tris-Glycine Mini Gels, WedgeWell format (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). After gel electrophoresis, protein samples were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Blots were blocked in 5% dry milk in tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) for 1\u2009h at room temperature (RT). Primary antibody (5-HT\n1A\nreceptor, MAB11041, 1/1000 in TBST containing 5% bovine serum albumen (BSA); Millipore Sigma, Temecula, CA, USA) was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. After three washes in TBST for 5\u2009min, blots were incubated in secondary antibodies (HRP-conjugated anti-mice IgM, Abcam, Waltham, MA, USA) at RT for 2\u2009h. Chemiluminescence was detected using Clarity Western ECL substrate (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), imaged using a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc MP, and analyzed using Imagelab software version 6.1 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) for volumetric analysis of protein expression. 5-HT\n1A\nreceptor levels were normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (a loading control, 2118, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) as a loading control. All results were normalized by taking the value of the spinally intact group as 100% to obtain a comparative value. The significance was assessed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey's\npost hoc\ntest with Graphpad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad). The 95% confidence level (\np\n<\u20090.05) was considered statistically significant.\n\nImmunohistochemistry for 5-HT\n1A\nreceptor and analyses of immunoreactivity intensity\nAt 8 weeks post-SCI, animals were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The spinal cords were removed and stored in 4% PFA overnight, and then transferred to 30% sucrose solution. The L6/S1 segment of spinal cords were sectioned by cryostat in 30\u2009\u00b5m pieces for an immunohistochemistry process, and the 15 sections (120\u2009\u00b5m apart) in each animal were selected. The sections were blocked by blocking solution (PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 3% BSA) and then incubated with antibodies against 5-HT\n1A\nreceptor (MAB11041, Millipore Sigma) and NeuN (Abcam) overnight at room temperature. All sections were rinsed three times with PBS for 10\u2009min and then incubated at RT for 1\u2009h with secondary antibodies (Abcam) including Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibodies. The sections were rinsed three times with PBS, and mounting media (Vector Laboratory, Newark, CA, USA) was added before they were cover-slipped. The sections were photographed by a Zeiss confocal microscope for further analysis.\nStandardized areas for sampling in sections from each animal in each group were selected by Photoshop and ImageJ. The mean number of pixels containing immunoreactive product in the sampled area was measured and multiplied by the average intensity. This value was subtracted from background immunolabeled intensity, as measured in a separate adjacent section. Graphs were plotted and statistics were assessed using Graphpad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad). The intensities are shown as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM) in units of the percentage of the mean intensities from spinally intact rats, which are presented as 100%. Significant differences between groups are indicated by a signifier (\np\n<\u20090.05;\np\n<\u20090.001) using an unpaired\nt\ntest. Light intensity and threshold values were maintained at constant levels for all analyses.\n\nAwake urodynamics, EUS electromyography (EMG) recording, and pharmacological interventions\nAnimals were anesthetized under 2.5% isoflurane with oxygen to perform surgeries and then cystometry and EUS EMG recording were performed when the animals were awake. The urinary bladder was exposed by an incision of the midline abdomen. A catheter (polyethylene 50) was inserted into the bladder through a small incision at the apex of the bladder dome. The bladder end of a pulmonary embolism (PE) catheter was heated to form a collar and was secured with a purse-string suture on the opening of the detrusor. The end of bladder catheter was connected to a pressure transducer (model P23XL-1; Gould Ohmeda, Valley View, OH, USA), an amplifier (Astro-Med, Inc., West Warwick, RI, USA), and an Aladdin single-syringe infusion pump (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA) for signal recording and saline infusion. A normal saline-filled femoral vein catheter was inserted into the femoral vein for drug delivery. The bladder catheter exited from the rostral edge of the abdominal wound, which was closed in layers. The skin above the vascular catheters was also closed. Fine (50\u03bcm diameter) Teflon-insulated platinum wire electrodes (A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA, USA) were inserted percutaneously on both sides of the mid-urethra using a 27-gauge needle for subsequent measurements of EUS EMG activity. Next, rats were placed in a universal restrainer (Braintree Scientific, Inc., MA, USA) to perform physiological tests. Following a 1\u2009h recovery period from anesthesia, continuous cystometrograms (CMGs) were collected using constant infusion (0.1\u2009mL/min) of saline by an infusion pump (World Precision Instruments) through the catheter into the bladder to elicit repetitive voids. The electrodes were connected to an AC amplifier (Astro-Med, Inc.) with high- and low-pass frequency filters at 10\u2009Hz and 1\u2009kHz and a recording system (DASH 8X, Astro-Med, Inc.) at a sample frequency of 10\u2009kHz. Continuous cystometry at a flow rate of 6\u2009mL/h for 1\u2009h prior allowed the LUT to adjust to the flow rate. After 1\u2009h the pump was stopped and the bladder was emptied by aspiration through the bladder catheter via a stopcock port. The pump was restarted and after at least three reproducible filling CMGs were obtained, WAY100635 from Sigma (0.02\u2009mg/kg, 0.2\u2009mg/kg, 1\u2009mg/kg, 2\u2009mg/kg) for spinally intact or WAY100635 (0.2\u2009mg/kg, 1\u2009mg/kg, 2\u2009mg/kg) and propranolol (2\u2009mg/kg) for complete SCI animals were intravenously administered through the right site of femoral vein, and then another filling CMG was performed, from which measurements were taken for three to five filling cycles. Drug solutions were administered in a volume of 0.1\u2009mL followed by a 0.1\u2009mL flush of saline. In addition to the systemic delivery of WAY100635, the intrathecal injection of WAY100635 (0.002\u2009mg/kg, 0.02\u2009mg/kg) with the tip at lumbar segments was used to determine site of action in the SCI animals. For intrathecal catheter preparation, the laminectomy at T10 spine was made to expose the upper lumbosacral segment of spinal cord after midline incision on the back of the skin. A 27 G needle was used to make a small hole in the dura mater and a 32 G intrathecal catheter (CS-32, Braintree Scientific, Inc.) was inserted into the intrathecal space advancing 0.3\u2009cm caudally to approximately reach the L1/L2 spinal segment. The catheter was secured with tissue glue (3M) and the other end of catheter was used for the drug injection during the awake urodynamics and EUS EMG recordings.\n\nQuantification of CMG and EUS EMG recordings\nDuring each of the individual interventions in the CMG and EUS EMG recordings, three to five consecutive and stabilized micturition events were segmented for analysis as described in our previous studies.\n21\n,\n22\nSegmented data included the full duration between the completions of two consecutive voiding contractions. The defined parameters used to analyze both CMG and EUS EMG recoding data are shown in\nFigure 1\n. CMG voiding parameters include: the voiding efficacy (%), peak voiding pressure (cmH\n2\nO), bladder volume capacity (mL), voiding duration (sec), voiding interval (min), and high-frequency oscillation (HFO) (sec). The period of the voiding cycle from the empty bladder with saline infusion until the first micturition occurred was used to determine voiding efficacy. It was calculated by the percentage of voiding volume in the amount of total saline infused. Non-voiding contractions (NVCs) were determined as contractions with amplitudes >5\u2009cm H\n2\nO that were not observed with any successful micturition. The CMG non-voiding parameters include: amplitude (peak pressure \u2013 baseline pressure) (cmH\n2\nO), single non-voids duration (sec), number of non-voids, and percentage of time with non-void activity during the bladder-filling phase (%). The EMG parameters included (during the bursting phase): the number of EMG bursts, EMG bursting duration (sec), EMG burst interval (sec), and EMG burst amplitude (mV). EMG bursts were qualified as coordinated when they were timed in sync with the CMG HFO. The amplitude of tonic EUS EMG activity during the bladder filling phase also was analyzed. All data collection and data analysis were performed in a blinded fashion. Data are presented as group mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM, and were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA with a Fisher's\npost hoc\ntest. Significance level was set to 0.05 for all comparisons.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nThe illustration of parameters of voiding, non-voiding, and electromyography (EMG) in the analyses of cystometrograms (CMG) and external uretheral sphincter (EUS) EMG recordings.

    "Methods": "The AIBL-VETS study was designed to be compatible with the U.S. Department of Defense\u2013funded Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative veterans study (DOD ADNI) to allow independent validation of findings and pooling of data.\n\nParticipants\nEx-military service personnel who served in Vietnam age 60-85 years, with and without TBI, were recruited through retired veteran organizations such as the Returned Services League and the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia, as well as the Older Veterans' Psychiatry Program located at Austin Health, Melbourne, Australia. Exclusion criteria included prior diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder, schizophrenia, dementia, mild cognitive impairment, substance abuse/dependence within the last 5 years, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contraindication, major, unstable medical condition, and previous participation in clinical trials involving an amyloid-targeting therapy.\nTo be included in the TBI cohort, participants were required to have sustained at least one TBI between the ages of 16-40 years. TBI severity was assessed based on criteria set by the U.S. Department of Defense and Department of Veterans' affairs (\nTable 1\n).\n40\nMedical records from the time of injury were not available. Given reliance on self-report, and to ensure injuries were given accurate severity ratings (mild/moderate/severe), only participants who clearly recalled details of their injury were included. To be included in the control group, participants met the same inclusion/exclusion criteria, but were required to report no prior history of TBI nor post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Approval for this study was obtained from the Austin Health Human Research Ethics Committee, the U.S. Human Subjects Research Protection Office of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Material Command, and the Australian Department of Veterans Affairs Ethics Committee. All participants provided consent prior to participating, and there were no direct incentives offered for participation.\nTable 1.\nCriteria Used by Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs (VA/DoD) to Categorize Head Injury Severity\nMild\nModerate\nSevere\nLoss of consciousness\n0 - 0.5\u2009h\n0.5 - 24\u2009h\n> 24\u2009h\nAlteration of consciousness\nA moment - 24\u2009h\n> 24\u2009h; severity based on other criteria\n> 24\u2009h; severity based on other criteria\nPost-traumatic amnesia\n0 - 1 day\n1 - 7 days\n> 7 days\nGlasgow Coma Scale\n13 - 15\n9 - 12\n3 - 8\nStructural imaging\nNormal\nNormal/abnormal\nNormal/abnormal\nOpen in a separate window\n\nProcedure and materials\nAll participants were screened over the phone to ensure they matched study criteria. Those deemed suitable for the initial assessments were invited into the research center to undergo psychiatric and neuropsychological assessment and an interview to obtain detailed TBI history. Participants were asked to give a detailed account of events surrounding the injury, including age at injury, injury cause, presence and length of unconsciousness, alteration of consciousness and post-traumatic amnesia, as well as information as to medical attention sought, and disruption of usual activities due to injury. Based on this information, and in relation to the information included in\nTable 1\n, each injury was classified as mild, moderate, or severe.\n\nPsychiatric well-being\nThe psychiatric evaluation consisted of several measures to assess PTSD severity, drug and alcohol use, sleep quality and medical history. A PTSD diagnosis was allocated based on the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS)\n41\nlifetime and current score. A lifetime CAPS score of over 40 was indicative of previous PTSD, while a current CAPS score of over 40 indicated current PTSD. The Addiction Severity Index-lite\n42\nwas used to assess alcohol/substance use, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI),\n43\nsleep quality and disturbance. A score >5 on the PSQI was indicative of poor sleep quality.\n\nOther measures\nParticipants also self-reported years of education, military service history, cigarette smoking status, and medical history. Comorbidities such as hypertension, ischemic heart disease, stroke, diabetes, migraine, and sleep apnea were determined via self-report in an interview with the study psychiatrist. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype was determined by direct sequencing. The Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR) also was assessed to provide a measure of pre-morbid intelligence. Participants also completed the Combat Exposure Scale (CES)\n44\nto classify the level of wartime stressors experienced.\n\nImage acquisition and processing\nParticipants underwent tau, amyloid, and\n18\nF-FDG PET, performed on separate days using\n18\nF-Flortaucipir,\n18\nF-Florbetaben, and\n18\nF-FDG respectively. All radiotracers were produced on site, at Austin Health. The scans were acquired on a Siemens 128 micro computed tomography (CT) PET/CT camera at the University of Melbourne. A 30-min acquisition was performed 75\u2009min post-injection of\n18\nF-Flortaucipir, and 20-min scans were acquired 90\u2009min post-injection of\n18\nF-Florbetaben and after 30\u2009min uptake time while resting quietly in a dimly lit room post-injection of\n18\nF-FDG. Low-dose CT scan was used for attenuation correction. There was no correction for partial volume effects. In a previous paper, we reported no difference in hippocampal or gray matter volumes between the TBI and control groups in this cohort.\n45\n\nDOD ADNI validation cohort\nData and scans from the US Department of Defense Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (DOD ADNI) database (\nadni.loni.usc.edu\n) were used to validate the A\u03b2 and tau PET findings. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, as well as other biological, clinical, and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to detect and measure the progression of pre-clinical, MCI and early Alzheimer's disease. In the DOD ADNI cohort, 57 normal control (NC) and 74 TBI (16 mild TBI, 58 moderate-to-severe TBI) cognitively unimpaired veterans underwent a\n18\nF-Florbetapir \u03b2-amyloid scan, while 30 NC and 46 TBI (11 mild, 35 severe) had a\n18\nF-Flortaucipir tau scan (\nSupplementary Table S1\n). After download, these scans were processed using the methods described below for the Australian veteran cohort to provide compatible Centiloid and standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) results.\n\nImage analysis\nReconstructed PET images were processed using CapAIBL, a previously validated tracer uptake quantification software package.\n46\nThe SUVR quantification process is described in-depth elsewhere\n47\n; however, in brief, an adaptive atlas was automatically fitted to each A\u03b2 PET image to match the A\u03b2 PET retention pattern. Each image was then spatially normalized to the best fitting atlas. Centiloid values (CL) were then computed using the SPM8 mask and CapAIBL calibration equations from Bourgeat and colleagues (2018).\n48\nAll tau and\n18\nF-FDG scans were normalized using the same CapAIBL software, but instead of the A\u03b2 analysis, multi-tau atlases\n46\nand a mean\n18\nF-FDG atlas were used. Spatially normalized tau scans were sampled in three different composite regions, as per earlier work\n49\n: mesial-temporal (Me), temporoparietal (Te), and rest of neocortex (R). The Me region comprised entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, parahippocampus and amygdala, and the Te region comprised regions inferior and middle temporal, fusiform, supramarginal and angular gyri, posterior cingulate/precuneus, superior and inferior parietal, and lateral occipital. Rest of neocortex (R) was made up of dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal, orbitofrontal, gyrus rectus, superior temporal and anterior cingulate. Glucose metabolism also was investigated in the global neocortex (a composite of frontal (dorsolateral, ventrolateral, and orbitofrontal), parietal (superior parietal and precuneus), lateral temporal (superior, middle, and inferior), lateral occipital lobe, gyrus supra-marginalis, gyrus angularis and anterior and posterior cingulate), and in the frontal composite alone, the mesial temporal region (Me as used for tau image analysis) and in an area defined to give a posterior cortical index (PCI) comprising the lateral temporal, parietal, and precuneus cortex as commonly used in FDG PET studies of AD.\nFor FTP and FDG, standardized uptake values (SUV) were calculated for all brain regions examined by dividing the regional SUVs by the cerebellar cortex SUV. As there might be some potential pathology in cerebellum of TBI patients, we also did cerebellum SUV comparison between TBI and non-TBI individuals. All the scanners were phantom calibrated for SUV calculation. The quantitative results (CL and SUVR) were the primary outcome measures and all quantification was performed blind to history of TBI.\n\nVisual reading of images\nAll\n18\nF-Florbetaben,\n18\nF-Flortaucipir, and FDG images were also visually inspected blind to history of TBI. Each image was assessed by a nuclear medicine specialist experienced in interpretation of these scans. All\n18\nF-Florbetaben and FDG scans were rated as \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cnegative,\u201d and\n18\nF-Flortaucipir images were rated as \u201cnegative,\u201d \u201cequivocal,\u201d or \u201cpositive.\u201d\n\nStatistical analysis\nPower analysis was calculated from amyloid scans in age matched healthy controls from the AIBL and showed that to observe a moderate effect size between groups (Cohen's d\u2009\u2265\u20090.5), with 80% power, a total of 62 participants would be required. Percentages were calculated for categorical variables. Participant characteristics and demographics were compared between individuals in the TBI cohort and the veteran control group using t-tests and the Wilcoxon signed rank test (when variables were not normally distributed) for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables, as well as Cohen's d to measure effect sizes. Hierarchical regressions were used to investigate the influence of covariates, including age, APOE e4 status, years of education, pre-morbid intellectual functioning, and lifetime PTSD severity. The Weschler Test of Adult Reading was used to provide an estimate of IQ, and CAPS Lifetime score as a measure of lifetime severity of PTSD. Variables that had a significant effect on the outcome variable were then controlled for in an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). A\np\nvalue of less than 0.05 was deemed statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Organizational setting\nThis study occurred in United States-based YMCAs. YMCAs are a youth serving organization with locations worldwide that provide low-cost competitive youth sports opportunities. In the United States, more than 4 million youth participate in activities sponsored by the YMCA. The YMCA has a national office that is responsible for setting the general mission, policies, and overhead structure for the semi-autonomous local YMCA Associations and their subordinate branches. About 2,400 regional \u201cassociations\u201d typically oversee several local \u201cbranches.\u201d Associations have responsibility for oversight, training, local policy implementation, and resource support and allocation. Associations oversee siloed activities across branches (e.g., the association sports director oversees the activities of all branch sports directors). Branches directly implement programming, managing day-to-day operations. At the time this study was conducted, there was no required YMCA policy related to coach education about concussion. Key stakeholders involved in study implementation at the national level were the national sports director and a representative from associations; the national sports director is responsible for planning, overseeing and supporting sports programs at YMCA associations across the country. At the association level, stakeholders were Association Directors and/or Sports Directors, and at the branch level they were Sports Directors or Volunteer coordinators; the coaches are volunteers at all YMCA branches.\n\nIntervention and implementation strategy\nIntervention.\nThe intervention had four core components, all of which used CDC youth sport materials: (1) CDC HEADS UP online training for coaches to be completed by all coaches prior to the start of the competitive season; (2) supplementary CDC HEADS UP resources (poster, sticker, clipboard, fact sheet); (3) eight weekly CDC HEADS UP messages for coaches to discuss with their athletes; (4) guidance for how local organizations can integrate HEADS UP resources and messages with existing YMCA \u201cValues\u201d resources through existing communication processes, including e-newsletters and the visual message board at the front desk of all YMCA branches.\nImplementation strategy.\nYMCA administrative leaders at a national level developed an approach to supporting implementation of the CDC HEADS UP youth sport coach materials that was relevant to the YMCA\u2019s organizational structure. Key considerations for implementation included: the importance of incorporating CDC HEADS UP materials into branch-level safety protocols and practices; the need to allow for branch-level flexibility in how and when materials were shared with coaches; and the need to minimize the administrative asks of the volunteer coaches by having branch administrative staff work in tandem with and support coaches with implementation. Elements of the YMCA\u2019s approach to implementing CDC HEADS UP coach education are outlined below.\nLocal adaptation.\nLocal organizations made decisions about where to hang the CDC HEADS UP poster for maximum impact, how to share information with coaches about completing the CDC HEADS UP online training, and how and when to follow-up with coaches about their implementation of the CDC HEADS UP materials, including the eight weekly conversation prompts. Local organizations also made decisions about how to incorporate CDC HEADS UP content into their YMCA \u201cValues\u201d materials and communications.\nReminders.\nIn the intervention condition, YMCA administrators at the branch level sent email reminders and held intercept meetings on practice fields and at games with volunteer coaches as well as YMCA sports administrative staff. The goal of this communication was to check in with coaches about using the CDC HEADS UP materials to talk about concussion safety with their athletes.\nTechnical assistance.\nThe research team held weekly technical assistance calls with each association and offered on-demand individual technical assistance appointments, Intervention materials were delivered to intervention condition branches.\n\nSample and randomization\nParticipants were volunteer coaches at 15 YMCA associations in the United States. Associations were eligible to participate if they had two or more branches, and if they sponsored competitive male and female sports teams for youth ages 12-17. Associations applied to participate in the project, with eligibility adjudicated by the project YMCA team members. Where possible, randomization occurred at the branch level, and was used to assign branches within associations to the intervention and control conditions. Branches competing against each other were randomized to the same condition to limit the possibility of contamination (e.g., seeing CDC HEADS UP posters in gyms and locker rooms, overhearing pre-game discussions by intervention coaches). In three associations, there were multiple branches but only one league and all teams played their games at a single facility. At these associations, all branches were assigned to the intervention condition.\n\nData collection procedure\nAcross both conditions, coaches completed surveys prior to the start of the competitive season (before intervention branches had received any CDC HEADS UP materials), and at the end of the season. Branch sports directors facilitated survey data collection primarily by distributing an online survey link. Paper surveys were also an option, and coaches who indicated a preference for paper surveys were provided with an envelope addressed to the research team that included postage. Up to 5 reminders were emailed to coaches at each branch at each data collection time point. Coaches received $45 compensation for their participation in survey data collection ($20 for the baseline survey and $25 for the post season survey). To facilitate matching baseline and post-season responses, coaches provided their first name, age, zip code and the street number of their dwelling. FHI 360 Protection of Human Subjects Committee approval (884643-5) was obtained for all study activities.\n\nMeasures\nCommunication behavior.\nCoach communication with athletes about concussion in the prior season was a constructed variable that combined coaches\u2019 responses to three questions about their actions while at the YMCA during this past season. The questions were: Did you have a meeting with your athletes about concussion safety? (yes/no); Did you review with your athletes the YMCA\u2019s rules for dealing with concussions? (yes/no); How often did you speak informally with athletes on your team about concussion safety? (Never/Occasionally/Frequently). If a coach said, \u2018Yes\u2019 or Occasionally\u2019/\u2019Frequently\u2019 to these questions they were classified as having communicated with athletes about concussion during the prior season.\nCommunication intentions.\nCoaches indicated how likely they would be to engage in two communication practices in the future: \u201cHold a meeting to talk to my team about concussion safety\u201d or \u201cTalk informally to my team about concussion safety\u201d. Each question was scored on a 4-point Likert Scale (1=\u201cVery unlikely\u201d, 2=\u201cSomewhat unlikely\u201d, 3=\u201cSomewhat likely\u201d, 4=\u201cVery likely\u201d), and the two responses summed to create a scale with a possible range of 2-8.\nConcussion knowledge.\nQuestions separately assessed knowledge about two topics addressed in the CDC HEADS UP educational materials for coaches: concussion identification and concussion management. Eleven questions about concussion identification had the following prompt: \u201cIf someone falls, get bumped of gets hit, which of the following can be signs of a concussion.\u201d Examples of symptoms included headache or pressure in the head, and balance problems or dizziness. Items were scored as true (1) or false (0), generating an index with a possible range of 0-11 where higher scores indicate more knowledge about injury mechanisms and symptoms. Knowledge about concussion management was assessed by six scenario-based questions, with coaches indicating whether they \u201cshould\u201d engage in the specific behavioral practices, such as allowing an athlete who sustained a possible concussion to keep playing in a game. Response options were on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from \u201cDefinitely should not\u201d (1) to \u201cDefinitely should\u201d (4), summed to create concussion management knowledge index with a possible range of 6 to 24, where higher scores indicated more knowledge about concussion management practices addressed in the CDC HEADS UP educational materials for coaches.\nPerceived YMCA administrator norms.\nCoaches responded to 3 questions about what their YMCA administrators would want them to do (1=\u201cStrongly disagree\u201d, 2=\u201cSomewhat disagree\u201d, 3=\u201cSomewhat agree\u201d, 4=\u201cStrongly agree\u201d) related to concussion management. The total numbers were summed to create a scale with possible range of 3-12, where higher values indicate perceived norms more supportive of concussion management practices consistent with CDC HEADS UP guidance.\nExposure to non-intervention concussion information.\nCoaches in both the intervention and control groups also indicated the types of concussion information they had been exposed to separate from the intervention, which included: online training; poster; fact sheet; quiz; website information; an app; movie or documentary; TV show; presentation or talk; book, magazine or other print material; and social media. These items reflected the different modalities of CDC HEADS UP resources, supplemented by other frequently used approaches to concussion knowledge translation.\n25\nThe number of different modalities of education to which the coach was exposed was summed to create an index with a possible range of 0 to 11.\nAdditional covariates.\nPotential covariates measured were coach demographic characteristics (sex, race and ethnicity, highest level of education completed), whether they were a first-time coach (Yes/No), whether they had ever been diagnosed with a concussion (Yes/No), and level of contact in the sport they coached. Level of contact was classified as a high contact sport if their team played basketball, soccer, or football in the previous 12 months; all other sports were classified as non-high contact.\n\nAnalysis\nThe primary goal of the study was to determine whether there was increased communication about concussion safety among coaches who were exposed to the intervention. Time was included in bivariate and multivariable analyses to assess change in the primary outcome variable (coach communication behaviors) pre- vs. post-intervention. We conducted descriptive analyses as well as bivariate and multiple regression analyses to assess whether the proportion of coaches who had communicated with athletes about concussion improved from pre- to post-intervention periods. A bivariate model was first applied, including only a single variable at a time to assess associations with the outcome variable. Since more traditional levels such as 0.05 can fail in identifying variables known to be important, we chose a P\u2013value cut-off point of 0.20 as a first step.\n26\n,\n27\nAll candidate variables that had P\u2013values <=0.20 in the bivariate models were entered into the multivariable model. Analyses were conducted separately for the intervention and the control groups. Similar methods were employed to assess change pre- to post-intervention for secondary outcomes (coach knowledge about concussion, perceptions that YMCA administrators want them to communicate about concussion, and intentions to communicate with their athletes about concussion safety).\nSubsequently, we sought to identify additional factors that were associated with communicating with athletes about concussion safety. Analyses were conducted using a similar approach to multivariate model specification as described above, and included both as independent variables coach demographic characteristics, exposure to non-intervention sources of concussion information, and the secondary outcomes as they were theorized to be causally related to coach communication (e.g., coach knowledge about concussion).\nAcross models, the analytic intent was to measure within-person changes in survey responses across the two time points. However, due to the low number of coaches who completed both the pre- and post-surveys, we used a cross sectional analysis approach with generalized estimating equations [GEE] repeated measures to account for the correlation among matched participants and a potential cluster effect for YMCA associations. A robust Poisson model with sandwich standard error estimator generated by GEE was used to estimate the risk ratios (RR) in the bivariate models and adjusted risk ratios (aRR) in the multivariable models.\n28\nA sensitivity analysis was conducted at the individual level with the smaller subset of coaches who had full data."

    "Methods": "In this narrative review, authors performed a comprehensive literature search in PubMed and as a group, arrived at a cohesive description and set of recommendations for diagnosing and treating post-TBI GHD. As part of this review, authors investigated reported prevalence rates of post-TBI PTHP and GHD. Search terms used were \u201cTBI\u201d or \u201ctraumatic brain injury\u201d and \u201cGHD\u201d or \u201cgrowth hormone deficiency\u201d or \u201cPTHP\u201d or \u201cpost traumatic hypopituitarism.\u201d (This review was not intended as a meta-analysis, as there is a lack of sufficient literature to power such an analysis.)\n\nStudies included in the analysis of PTHP prevalence rates were those that reported only anterior pituitary deficiencies in pediatric and adolescent patients in the chronic phase after TBI. Studies that reported non-anterior pituitary deficiencies, including diabetes insipidus, were excluded. If possible, for studies that reported both anterior and non-anterior pituitary deficiencies, prevalence rates for anterior pituitary deficiencies were extracted and reported here. GHD was required to be diagnosed using a stimulation test, adhering to the cutoff value of <10\u2009\u03bcg/L suggested in the Growth Hormone (GH) Research Society guidelines published in 2000.9For studies that reported GHD prevalence rates based on more or less stringent thresholds, these guidelines were retroactively applied and the resulting prevalence rates are reported.\n\nStudies included in the analysis of GHD prevalence rates were those that reported rates of GHD in pediatric and adolescent patients in the chronic phase post-TBI. As above, reports of GHD were limited to those that were diagnosed using a stimulation test and that adhered to the cutoff value of <10\u2009\u03bcg/L suggested in the GH Research Society guidelines published in 2000.9For studies that reported GHD prevalence rates based on more or less stringent thresholds, these guidelines were retroactively applied and the resulting prevalence rates are reported.\n\nThe results of these analyses are presented inSupplementary Table S1andSupplementary Table S2. Although there was insufficient literature to power a meta-analysis, these analyses are nonetheless beneficial for the understanding of PTHP and GHD following TBI in pediatric and adolescent patient populations.\n\nTBI events in children and adolescents\nIn recent years, TBI has been increasingly recognized as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children and adolescents.\n10\n,\n11\nA TBI is defined as a change in brain function or pathology as a result of an external force.\n12\nIt is accompanied by impairments in neurologic function (e.g., alterations in balance, weakness, altered vision) or mental disturbances (e.g., confusion, disorientation).\n13\nTBI may also be accompanied by a number of additional sequelae, including loss of consciousness, neuroinflammation, epilepsy/seizures, hydrocephalus, brain swelling, headache, olfactory dysfunction, motor disturbances, cognitive deficits, attention and memory difficulties, sleep problems, and endocrine changes.\n6\n,\n8\n,\n13\u201323\nOne meta-analysis estimated that the occurrence of TBI is approximately 110 per 100,000 in pediatric populations (< 15 years of age) and 618 per 100,000 in adolescent and adult populations.\n24\nIn older adults and young children, TBI is most frequently caused by falls, while in young adults, TBI is most frequently caused by motor vehicle accidents.\n25\nOther increasingly reported causes of TBI in young adults include domestic abuse or violence and sports injuries.\n25\n,\n26\nThe rate of TBI may be up to twice as common in males, although it is difficult to estimate the precise incidence in any given population due to underreporting of mild and moderate injuries.\n24\n,\n27\nAltered brain function can stem from head injuries of any severity, ranging from concussion and mild TBI to severe TBI. Concussion is largely a clinical diagnosis, relying on balance testing and neuropsychological evaluations to indicate cognitive deficits.\n12\nThe severity of TBI is typically classified using the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), which assesses performance in three domains: eye, motor, and verbal. Individual scores from each domain are added together for an overall GCS score.\n13\nScores between 3 and 8 indicate severe TBI, while scores of 9 to 12 and 13 to 15 indicate moderate and mild TBI, respectively (\nTable 1\n).\n25\nWhile the GCS system is useful for the initial evaluation and stratification of patients with TBI, the system is limited by its high inter-rater score variability, can be confounded by sedation or intubation in a hospital setting, may be unreliable in patients between 9 and 12 years of age, and does not accurately reflect pathological or anatomical differences in TBI.\n13\n,\n28\n,\n29\nScores are especially variable in young children, at least in part due to difficulties assessing the verbal score component\n29\n; therefore, a pediatric GCS assessment incorporating age-appropriate modifications has also been developed.\n28\n,\n30\nSome studies suggest that the GCS motor subscore may perform similarly to, if not better than, the full GCS when predicting severe head trauma in adults; however, this requires additional investigation and validation in pediatric populations.\n28\n,\n31\n,\n32\nTable 1.\nMeasurements of TBI Severity\nMeasurement system\nMild TBI\nModerate TBI\nSevere TBI\nGCS\n13-15\n9-12\n3-8\nAmnesia\n\u2264 24\u2009h\n> 24\u2009h to <7 days\n\u2265 7 days\nLoss of consciousness\n0-30\u2009min\n> 30\u2009min to <24\u2009h\n\u2265 24\u2009h\nOpen in a separate window\nTBI, traumatic brain injury; GCS, Glasgow Coma Score.\nAn alternative to the GCS is the Full Outline of UnResponsiveness (FOUR) score, which includes four components: eye, motor, brain stem, and respiratory scores. The advantages of the FOUR score over the GCS system are that it has been adapted for the pediatric population and has been shown to have good inter-reporter variability when evaluating pediatric trauma severity.\n33\nThe FOUR score may hold an advantage over the GCS in subcategorizing patients with low GCS scores and in evaluating patients in intensive care unit (ICU) settings, although these observations are based on limited clinical data; therefore, additional studies are needed.\n34\nOther informative clinical measures of severity include duration of post-traumatic amnesia and witnessed loss of consciousness (\nTable 1\n).\n29\n,\n35\n,\n36\nOf note, the endocrinopathies addressed here can occur after any degree of concussion/TBI.\nThe time after a TBI event is typically stratified into the acute and chronic phases. The acute phase is defined as the 2 to 4 weeks following the injury.\n25\n,\n27\n,\n37\nAcute TBI may be associated with symptoms including irritability, headache, dizziness, loss of consciousness, olfactory dysfunction, amnesia, confusion, and seizures.\n13\n,\n16\n,\n17\n,\n21\n,\n23\nAdrenal insufficiency may occur in the acute phase and has been reported in 2 to 43% of children with TBI.\n27\nAdrenal disturbances may be characterized by hypoglycemia, fatigue, confusion, hypotension, and hyponatremia.\n11\n,\n25\nDeficiencies in the adrenal axis should be addressed and treated immediately during the acute phase, as these deficiencies can be life-threatening and may also correlate with neurological dysfunction.\n11\n,\n25\n,\n27\n,\n38\nDI, which, when it occurs, almost always presents in the acute phase, is uncommon in children who have experienced TBI.\n10\nWhen DI does occur, it is rarely permanent but should be addressed immediately.\n7\n,\n8\nEvaluation of TSH and free T4 for identification of TSH deficiency during the acute phase can result in unreliable readings, as thyroid hormone concentrations can change during stress, illness, and hospitalization.\n19\n,\n39\n,\n40\nTherefore, it is not recommended that thyroid function be evaluated until at least 3 months post-TBI.\n41\nDeficiencies in other anterior pituitary hormones, including gonadotropins and GH, may present during the acute phase; however, the relevance of these deficiencies in the acute phase is unclear and testing is often deferred until at least 3 to 6 months post-TBI.\n25\n,\n27\nThe presence or lack of pituitary deficiencies in the acute phase does not reliably predict the development of hypopituitarism in the chronic phase; even testing for acute adrenal insufficiency, the one recommended pituitary test in the acute period, does not predict chronic adrenal insufficiency in either adults\n42-44\nor children.\n45\nThis is because deficits identified within the first year following the TBI event may be transient and recover over time.\n25\nAs the focus of this article is GHD in the chronic phase post-TBI, the acute phase will not be discussed further. Diagnosis and treatment of additional pituitary hormone deficiencies in the chronic phase will be discussed in later sections.\nThere is no clear threshold delineating the end of the acute phase and the beginning of the chronic phase. However, it is suggested that by 3 months post-TBI, a patient has entered the chronic phase, during which a wide range of physical, behavioral, and cognitive outcomes can occur.\n25\n,\n27\nPhysical symptoms associated with TBI in the chronic phase include fatigue, headache, dizziness, nausea, and sleep pattern alterations.\n11\n,\n13\n,\n21\n,\n23\nLess commonly, TBI may be associated with alterations in or loss of vision, hearing, or smell\n21\n; olfactory dysfunction may be correlated with the severity of TBI.\n15\nPatients who have experienced a TBI event may be at increased risk of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and may experience personality changes, including increased irritability, impulsivity, and apathy.\n13\n,\n19\n,\n21\n,\n46\nImportantly, mental and physical symptoms of depression, TBI, and PTSD may overlap, complicating the diagnosis.\n36\n,\n46\nPatients may also experience word-finding difficulties, attention and memory disturbances, social isolation, increased instances of being bullied, and reduced academic performance.\n13\n,\n17\n,\n47-49\nThere is considerable debate around the effect of age on TBI outcomes. For example, children display increased levels of neuronal plasticity, which could aid in a more rapid and robust recovery following TBI.\n7\n,\n45\nConversely, TBIs that occur during specific times in a child's life, particularly during critical times of cognitive and neuronal development and during physical and sexual maturation, may therefore have a greater impact on post-TBI outcomes.\n17\n,\n50\n\nPost-TBI hypopituitarism in children and adolescents\nA subset of patients with TBI will experience PTHP, defined as a deficiency in one or more pituitary hormones following a traumatic event to the brain.\n37\nSevere TBI seems to correlate with the highest risk of PTHP\n11\n,\n37\n,\n51\n; however, PTHP can occur with any severity of TBI or even with repetitive concussions.\n52\u201356\nSeveral mechanisms play a role in the pathophysiology of PTHP. Shearing and compression forces, which occur during the TBI event, can lead to pituitary tissue necrosis, reducing pituitary hormone production and secretion.\n27\nStalk torsion or displacement caused by TBI can lead to disruption of blood flow to the pituitary gland.\n11\n,\n27\nTBI-induced edema, hemorrhage, or increased intracranial pressure can cause pituitary compression and dysfunction.\n11\n,\n25\nPatients with TBI also display increased glutamate excitotoxicity, which can lead to neurocognitive defects, particularly during key developmental periods.\n6\n,\n25\n,\n57\nFinally, TBI can induce inflammation, ischemia, oxidative stress, and cytotoxicity in the nervous system. These factors may accelerate necrosis of neuronal cells and can increase blood\u2013brain barrier permeability, resulting in increased pituitary antigen exposure and the potential development of autoantibodies and hypophysitis.\n6\n,\n14\n,\n25\n,\n27\n,\n37\n,\n58\nAs part of this review, a retrospective analysis was performed on studies that reported PTHP prevalence rates in children and adolescents post-TBI. This analysis revealed that PTHP may be present in 10 to 58% of pediatric and adolescent patients at any time during the chronic phase of TBI (\nSupplementary Table S1\n).\n26\n,\n45\n,\n59\u201366\nStudies selected for inclusion in this analysis were those that reported on anterior pituitary deficiencies during the chronic phase. Reports of GHD were restricted to those diagnosed using a stimulation test and a threshold value GH <10\u2009\u03bcg/L.\n9\nWhen studies reported on both anterior and non-anterior pituitary deficiencies, prevalence rates for pituitary deficiencies of interest were extracted from a larger data set if possible (detailed in\nSupplementary Table S1\n). The large range of PTHP prevalance rates reported here is likely indicative of differences in study design, variability and low reproducibility of testing methods, timing of pituitary axis measurements, and injury severity.\n7\nAge and sex of study participants may also contribute to variations in reported PTHP prevalence rates. One study suggested that the highest rates of pituitary hormone deficiencies in children occur between 7 and 11 years of age.\n10\nWhile overall rates of PTHP seem to be similar in males and females,\n19\nsex-specific diagnoses may vary based on the specific hormone being investigated. For example, males appear to present with increased rates of GHD relative to females.\n46\nLarger studies are needed to confirm these findings; however, this discrepancy may reflect the increased referral, evaluation, and treatment of boys for growth deceleration and short stature compared with girls.\n46\n,\n67\nWhile reports of endocrine dysfunction in adults after TBI typically favor isolated pituitary abnormalities, reports in children favor multiple pituitary deficiencies. This may reflect selection bias (multiple deficiences often correlate with a more severe presentation and increased reporting) and varying diagnostic and referral practices between adult and pediatric populations.\n64\nIn general, adults and children tend to present with comparable overall rates of pituitary deficiencies, and in both populations, GH is the most common pituitary hormone affected.\n22\nBased on evaluation of existing reports, between 9.1% and 47.8% of children and adolescents with TBI may develop GHD (\nSupplementary Table S2\n).\n26\n,\n45\n,\n60-63\n,\n65-67\nAs in\nSupplementary Table S1\n, reports of GHD in\nSupplementary Table S2\nwere restricted to those diagnosed using a stimulation test and a threshold value GH <10\u2009\u03bcg/L.\n9\nFor studies that reported GHD prevalence rates based on different criteria, these guidelines were retroactively applied, where possible (for more details, see\nSupplementary Table S2\n). Similar to the reports on PTHP already noted, this broad range is likely due to differences in the timing and methodology of GHD testing. Clinical consequences of GHD may include reduced adult height, decreased lean body mass and muscle strength, reduced metabolic rate, increased abdominal fat, decreased quality of life (QOL), cognitive issues, and memory and attention deficits.\n25\n,\n68\u201371\nThere is evidence to suggest that TBI with GHD confers worse risk for cognitive issues (e.g., poorer verbal learning, verbal short-term memory, and attention) than does TBI without GHD.\n11\n,\n25\n,\n37\nAdditional anterior pituitary abnormalities observed in children and adolescents in the chronic phase post-TBI may include ACTH deficiency (reported at 2-43%), gonadotropin deficiency (reported at 6-16%), TSH deficiency (reported at 2-33%), and precocious puberty (reported at 2-16%).\n7\n,\n11\n,\n27\n\nTesting for GHD in pediatric and adolescent patients with TBI\nConsensus guidelines published in 2005 recommend that adults with moderate to severe TBI undergo endocrine screening.\n72\nHowever, there are currently no screening guidelines specific to children or adolescents for investigating endocrine dysfunction after a TBI.\n10\nIn adults, GHD is diagnosed based on biochemical assessment of the GH axis using well-defined thresholds. In children, GHD can be strongly indicated based on insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentrations, height velocity, or other auxologic features, but is often confirmed with biochemical testing.\n8\n,\n65\n,\n73\n,\n74\nChanges in growth are not universally observed in these patients.\n7\n,\n63\nGiven that GHD can be transient and that secretory patterns may change over time, children should undergo routine GH testing (e.g., every 6 months) for at least 1 year post-TBI.\n7\n,\n11\n,\n27\nWhile some GH stimulation tests have been applied to younger populations (detailed below), sensitive and specific cut points for the biochemical detection of GHD in children are currently debated, and results of these tests should be interpreted with caution.\n75\nGH stimulation tests should be performed only after treatments for all other pituitary hormone deficiencies have been established, as changes in other pituitary hormones can affect GH axis testing results.\n76\n,\n77\nThe insulin tolerance, growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) + arginine, GHRH + growth hormone-releasing peptide 6 (GHRP-6), glucagon, arginine, clonidine, levodopa (\nl\n-DOPA), and macimorelin tests have all been used to detect GHD in pediatric and adolescent patients.\n7\n,\n60\n,\n65\n,\n67\n,\n74\n,\n78\n,\n79\nStimulation test thresholds ranging from <5 to <10\u2009\u03bcg/L have been suggested as indicative of GHD in children,\n73\n,\n80\n,\n81\nwith the current consensus value listed as <10\u2009\u03bcg/L.\n9\nThe use of several of these tests is limited by safety concerns and availability. The insulin tolerance test (ITT) is used less frequently in the U.S. due to its potential to cause complications of hypoglycemia (especially in patients with undiagnosed adrenal insufficiency) and contraindication in patients with a history of cardiac disease or seizures.\n23\n,\n25\n,\n37\n,\n76\n,\n82\nThe GHRH + arginine and GHRH + GHRP-6 tests cannot detect GHD of hypothalamic origin and are unavailable in many countries.\n25\n,\n74\nIn the U.S., recombinant GHRH was removed from the market in July 2008\n11\n,\n76\nand GHRP-6 was never available. It is important to note that the diagnostic accuracy of stimulation tests may be reduced in patients with glucose intolerance or obesity; body mass index (BMI)-adjusted thresholds have been suggested for some tests, such as the GHRH + arginine test.\n25\n,\n76\n,\n83\n,\n84\nGiven the availability, safety, and contraindications for the above-mentioned stimulation tests, the glucagon stimulation test (GST) is now emerging as the preferred GHD diagnostic test for adults.\n11\nThe preferred diagnostic test in children is less clear.\nMacimorelin is an orally administered GH secretagogue receptor agonist that binds the ghrelin receptor, stimulating dose-dependent GH production. Macimorelin was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for diagnosis of adult GHD in December 2017. The original approval listed a cutoff value of 2.8\u2009\u03bcg/L, but a higher cutoff value of 5.1\u2009\u03bcg/L was subsequently demonstrated to increase GHD detection sensitivity.\n76\n,\n85\nThus far, there is no indication that different cutoff values will be required for patients with different BMIs.\n76\nAdvantages of the macimorelin test include easy oral dosing and fewer blood draws\n74\n; however, macimorelin is a more expensive diagnostic agent than other options.\n76\nMacimorelin is currently being investigated for the diagnosis of GHD in pediatric populations, with initial reports revealing that the compound is both safe and well tolerated.\n78\nOther agents, including LUM-201, are also being evaluated for the diagnosis of GHD in children.\n86\nAs IGF-I concentrations are partially GH-dependent, serum IGF-I measurements have been used to diagnose GHD. Very low IGF-I concentrations are suggestive of GHD and it has been reported that IGF-I concentrations >0 standard deviation score (SDS) make GHD unlikely at any age.\n74\n,\n87\nHowever, IGF-I concentrations are also influenced by a variety of other factors and should be used as a diagnostic tool with caution, as there is a large overlap in IGF-I production between patients with GHD and those who are GH sufficient, particularly in very young children.\n3\n,\n74\n,\n88\n,\n89\nIGF-I concentrations may be normal in patients who fail provocative GH testing; therefore, serum IGF-I is not always a reliable indicator of GHD.\n18\n,\n45\n,\n74\n,\n89-91\nWhile similar stimulation testing options exist for patients in the pediatric, adolescent, and adult populations, GH secretion varies considerably during childhood and adolescence. Thus, while diagnostic thresholds have been well defined for adult GHD, appropriate thresholds for the diagnosis of GHD in childhood and adolescence are currently debated.\n92\nPrevious consensus guidelines suggest that a peak stimulated GH concentration <10\u2009\u03bcg/L indicates the presence of GHD in children. However, this threshold value does not take into account sex, age, BMI, or the specific stimulation test used.\n9\n,\n81\n,\n92\nSex steroids induce GH secretion, and children in puberty are less likely to test as GH-deficient compared with prepubertal children.\n74\n,\n93\nWhile the effectiveness of sex steroid priming is still debated, priming may improve the specificity of some GH stimulation tests in prepubertal children\n74\n; guidelines published in 2016 suggest the use of priming (with oral \u03b2-estradiol or intramuscular testosterone) in prepubertal boys >11 years of age and prepubertal girls >10 years of age with an expected adult height within -2 standard deviation (SD) of the normative reference population.\n81\n\nTreatment of GHD in pediatric and adolescent patients\nPatients with PTHP must have other (non-GH) pituitary hormone deficiencies diagnosed and treated before assessment of possible post-TBI GHD.\n76\nIn addition to decreased height velocity, adolescents and young adults with severe GHD report decreased QOL related to physical health and emotions. One study in 16- to 25-year-old participants reported that these outcomes can be detected using a generic QOL questionnaire but not using the disease-specific QoL-AGHDA (Quality of Life-Assessment of Growth Hormone Deficiency in Adults) questionnaire, indicating that the disease-specific questionnaire may not be applicable in adolescents and young adults with GHD.\n94\nIf the presence of GHD is biochemically confirmed, GH treatment in children and adolescents can improve height outcomes, depression, memory, information processing speed, executive function, and QOL.\n68\n,\n95\u2013100\nTreatment with GH can also improve bone mineral density, decrease fat mass, increase lean muscle mass, and improve cardiopulmonary functional capacity.\n69\n,\n71\n,\n101\nHowever, GH replacement may also unmask underlying cortisol or thyroid hormone insufficiencies, necessitating close monitoring of the adequacy of glucocorticoid and thyroid hormone replacement following initiation of GH therapy.\n9\n,\n77\n,\n81\nDosing of GH in pediatric patients is currently recommended at 22 to 35\u2009\u03bcg/kg/day, with subsequent titration to normalize IGF-I concentrations to between 0 and +2 SDS.\n76\n,\n81\nTitration should also take into account possible side effects, which can include headaches, arthralgia, edema, and insulin resistance.\n76\n,\n102\nIt is important to consider the timing of GH replacement in children when it is used in conjunction with sex hormone replacement, as this can affect the attainment of adult height. During puberty, increases in circulating GH, IGF-I, and sex hormones lead to accelerated height velocity but also to estrogen-induced epiphyseal fusion.\n93\n,\n103\n,\n104\nTo ensure that adult height is obtained, GH treatment should start as early as possible after the diagnosis of GHD.\n105\nSome studies have suggested that adult height may also be achieved by increasing the GH dose during puberty (to mimic the pubertal increase in GH secretion observed in individuals who are GH sufficient) or by delaying puberty using gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs.\n103\n,\n104\n,\n106\nIt is important to note that oral estrogen-based contraceptives may reduce the effects of GH replacement therapy in women.\n77\n,\n81\n,\n107\nLong-acting GH (LAGH) options have been developed with the aim of improving patient experiences, adherence, and outcomes. These GH products are modified to allow for rapid absorption into and/or delayed removal from the circulation.\n73\n,\n76\n,\n108\n,\n109\nIn the U.S., only one such product is currently approved for use in pediatric patients with GHD: once-weekly lonapegsomatropin-tcgd, a transiently PEGylated LAGH option, was approved by the FDA in August 2021 at a recommended dose of 0.24\u2009mg/kg body weight for pediatric patients age \u22651 year who weigh at least 11.5\u2009kg.\n110\nAdditional LAGH options have been approved outside of the U.S. for the treatment of pediatric GHD, including somatrogon (Canada, Australia, Japan, and the European Union), somatropin (South Korea), and PEGylated somatropin (China).\n108\n,\n109\n,\n111\nFinally, somapacitan, a reversible albumin-binding GH analog has been approved for adult GHD in the U.S. (August 2020) and Europe (March 2021) and is currently being studied in pediatric populations.\n109\nPatients who have experienced a TBI event should also receive cognitive behavioral therapy and/or counseling to address the effects of anxiety, depression, memory issues, and sleep issues.\n20\n,\n112\n,\n113\nSpeech therapy (for cognitive deficits, including for executive function issues), physical therapy (for vestibular deficits), and exercises to help rehabilitate vision and balance may also be beneficial.\n20\n,\n114\nIdeally, a multi-disciplinary team of providers will be involved in the management and treatment of patients with TBI, particularly those with GHD (\nTable 2\n). Patients who experience a TBI may first present to a primary care physician (PCP) or trauma ICU team, depending on the severity of the injury. PCPs and other physicians caring for patients with TBIs should refer patients to a neurologist to address issues in mental status, memory, cognition, and reflexes; a physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R) specialist for diagnosis and treatment of speech, balance, gait, and other post-TBI problems; and a behavioral health specialist to manage behavioral problems and changes.\n20\n,\n115\nProviders should also refer individuals with moderate to severe TBI and those with chronic, persistent symptoms to an endocrinologist with experience evaluating and treating pituitary deficiencies such as GHD to address potential TBI-related hormonal deficiencies.\n11\nEndocrinologists should be a part of the care team for any patients with GHD or other pituitary deficiencies.\n72\nThe authors also recommend that endocrinologists and other providers seeing patients with hormonal deficiencies obtain a thorough medical history, including questions about TBI history, in order to appropriately evaluate pituitary deficiencies. Having a core multi-disciplinary care team and clear referral pathways is imperative in facilitating the screening of possible endocrinopathies and all phases of the recovery process in patients with TBI and GHD. It may also be beneficial to have one provider serve as the point of contact and care coordinator for patients.\nTable 2.\nSpecialties and Subspecialties That May Be Involved in the Short-Term and/or Long-Term Care of Patients With TBI and GHD\nInitial presentation\nAdditional referral categories\nExamples of providers\nICU team\nPCP\nEndocrinology\nEndocrinologist\nNeurology\nNeurologist\nNeurosurgeon\nPM&R\nPM&R specialist\nOccupational therapist\nSpeech therapist\nPhysical therapist\nBehavioral health\nBehavioral health specialist\nCognitive rehabilitation specialist\nPsychotherapist\nOpen in a separate window\nPatients may present to either a PCP or an ICU team, or later to another specialty, depending on the severity of the TBI. PCPs and other providers caring for patients with TBIs should refer patients to several additional specialties depending on injury severity and symptoms: endocrinology (to assess pituitary hormone deficiencies; for most hormonal deficiencies, these referrals should occur in the chronic phase following TBI); neurology (to address issues related to mental status and cognition); PM&R (to assess vision and balance); and behavioral health (to assess cognitive and psychosocial needs). Other providers familiar with TBI may be incorporated into the care team as necessary based on the symptoms of an individual patient. Referrals do not need to stem from the providers caring for the patient during initial presentation. Rather, any provider caring for a patient with TBI should be aware of the complexity of possible symptoms and should refer to appropriate specialties as needed.\nTBI, traumatic brain injury; GHD, growth hormone deficiency; ICU, intensive care unit; PCP, primary care physician; PM&R, physical medicine and rehabilitation.\n\nAssessment and treatment of GHD in the transition phase\nThe transition phase is a broadly defined period typically beginning in late puberty and ending in adulthood, approximately 6 to 7 years after the achievement of adult height.\n26\n,\n77\nThis phase is marked by substantial physical and psychosocial changes including cessation of linear growth, sexual maturation, and cognitive development, and a push for independence. These factors, along with the requirement to manage chronic illnesses and migrate management from pediatric to adult healthcare systems, combine to make the transition period a high-risk time during which many individuals may discontinue treatment and/or be lost to follow-up care.\n116\nPoorly managed transitions have been shown to increase morbidity and mortality\n76\n,\n116\nand three national surveys conducted in the U.S. revealed that 60% of patients with specialized healthcare needs and their families do not receive the required support for a successful transition to adult healthcare services.\n116\nAs endogenous production of GH and IGF-I declines during the transition phase, GH status should be reevaluated at this time.\n77\nFurther, pituitary deficiencies post-TBI can develop at a delay: evaluation of pituitary status, especially GH production, may be prompted by new symptoms during the transition phase. Current recommendations suggest retesting patients in the transition phase for GHD using GH stimulation tests when there is clinical suspicion of GHD and when serum IGF-I SDS is <0.\n76\n,\n117\nBecause most transition-age patients with GHD are asymptomatic, the authors recommend that patients with serum IGF-I SDS \u22650 be followed for evidence of symptoms or body composition changes. Testing is indicated after completion of longitudinal growth and at least 1 month after discontinuation of GH therapy.\n76\n,\n77\n,\n102\n,\n117\nChildren who have completed linear growth early may need to be retested for GHD using the pediatric testing options described above. In general, the number of stimulation tests required to confirm GHD in transition-age individuals is dependent on the level of suspicion for GHD.\n76\nRetesting is not required in patients with \u22653 pituitary hormone deficiencies and with low serum IGF-I (< -2.0 SDS), as GHD is likely in these patients.\n73\n,\n76\n,\n102\nAs in initial pituitary hormone analyses, GH stimulation tests should be performed after diagnoses and treatments for all other pituitary hormone deficiencies have been established.\n76\n,\n77\nSpecific tests and cut points for confirming GHD in transition-age patients have not been extensively studied.\n102\nThe ITT (GHD threshold \u22645\u2009\u03bcg/L),\n76\n,\n77\n,\n88\nGST (GHD thresholds <3\u2009\u03bcg/L for normal-BMI patients, and overweight patients with BMIs between 25-30\u2009kg/m\n2\nand a high pretest probability of GHD and <1\u2009\u03bcg/L for obese patients with BMI >30\u2009kg/m\n2\nand overweight patients with BMIs between 25-30\u2009kg/m\n2\nand a low pretest probability of GHD),\n76\nand macimorelin tests (GHD threshold \u22642.8\u2009\u03bcg/L, only approved for patients aged \u226518 years)\n76\nare recommended for diagnosis of GHD in adult patients. However, the ITT is used less frequently due to its contraindications and safety concerns.\n76\nArginine, clonidine, and\nl\n-DOPA have been shown to have low sensitivity in transition-age and adult patients and are therefore not recommended for confirmatory testing during transition.\n76\n,\n118\nThe predictive value of serum IGF-I concentrations alone to detect GHD in the transition phase has proven to be disappointing. One report showed that using the common threshold of IGF-I \u2264 -2 SDS to indicate GHD would have excluded over one-third of transition-age study patients found to have GHD.\n119\nInstead, IGF-I concentration measurements should be used only in conjunction with stimulation tests to determine GHD. Biochemical assay results can also be affected by nutritional and pubertal status; there is no consensus on priming with sex steroids prior to testing for GHD in transition-age patients.\n75\nAlthough GH provocation tests are considered the mainstay of GHD diagnosis in transition-age patients, issues with variability, reproducibility, and limited evidence for cutoff values in these patients mean that results should be interpreted cautiously.\n75\nBesides holding for retesting purposes, it is recommended to continue GH therapy in patients with confirmed GHD during the transition period, even if adult height has been achieved, as treatment is associated with improved body composition, bone health, cognitive function, QOL, and lipid metabolism in adulthood.\n73\n,\n76\n,\n92\n,\n98\n,\n120\nPatients who remain GH deficient after reaching adult height can be at risk of adverse metabolic outcomes, increased fat mass and BMI, decreased bone mineralization and mineral density, and decreased QOL if GH therapy is stopped.\n73\n,\n76\n,\n82\n,\n121-123\nThe optimal length of time for GH treatment in transition-phase individuals and adults is unclear. In general, if the patient continues to see clinical benefit from the treatment, it may have to be continued throughout adulthood.\n76\nIn some situations, the patient's partner, caregiver, or family member may be an important historian of the continued symptomatic benefits of GH treatment, as individuals with TBI and some otherwise healthy adults with GHD may not recognize these treatment benefits themselves.\nDuring the transition phase, current guideline recommendations support resuming GH dosing at approximately 50% of the last-used pediatric dose, with adjustments made thereafter to keep IGF-I between 0 and +2 SDS.\n76\n,\n102\nSome individuals may require higher GH doses during puberty and young adulthood; however, these doses typically decrease with age and as IGF-I concentrations naturally fall.\n76\nIGF-I should be monitored at least every 6 months\n77\nand the GH dose should be adjusted based on serum IGF-I, clinical response, and any side effects (e.g., headache, hyperglycemia) that may occur.\n76\n,\n102\nCurrent guidelines suggest that patients be monitored annually for blood pressure, body measurements (height, weight, BMI, hip and waist circumference), lipid profiles, and bone mineral density.\n76\nSerum glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and laboratory parameters related to other pituitary hormone deficits should also be monitored.\n102\n,\n117\nIn their own clinical practice, the authors of this review note that they obtain annual readings of most of the parameters mentioned above but may also obtain additional readings, including liver enzymes, comprehensive metabolic panels, and thyroid function tests. Choice of specific tests ordered may vary based on factors including the final adult height of the patient, length of time since TBI, age, and medical history. A few authors note that they also obtain body composition (in late-stage adolescents) and bone mineral density by DEXA (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry); however, this can be complicated by cost and availability.\n\nTransition phase challenges\nThere are many challenges to transitioning a pediatric patient with a history of TBI and GHD to adult services. One barrier to adequate care and appropriate referrals to adult endocrinologists is the limited awareness (among both patients and providers) of the need to continue GH treatment in transition-age and adult patients.\n76\n,\n123\nGiven the misconception that GH is important only for attaining adult height, there is a risk that a patient may discontinue GH treatment while under pediatric care or may stop seeing a pediatric endocrinologist altogether without realizing the importance of adult GH replacement and endocrinology care.\n82\n,\n123\nIn the experience of these authors, patients with GHD often stop GH treatment for a period of time during the transition phase; however, there are insufficient data to report on the number of patients who are retested and who eventually resume GH treatment. Emerging data continue to show that GH treatment can improve non\u2013height-related parameters such as bone mass, body composition, and QOL, even after adult height has been reached. Therefore, it is crucial that patients with TBI and GHD visit an adult endocrinologist to evaluate and treat GHD in the transition phase.\n70\n,\n76\n,\n77\n,\n82\n,\n117\n,\n122\nA lack of communication and coordination between pediatric and adult healthcare providers can result in inefficient treatment, patients being lost to follow-up as adults, or a large gap between the end of pediatric care and the beginning of adult care.\n117\n,\n123-125\nIn one study, the median time between the end of GH treatment in pediatric care and first evaluation in adult care was 3.4 years\n120\n; as discussed above, this gap in treatment can have negative consequences on metabolism, body composition, and bone density.\n82\nInsurance coverage issues can also severely limit a patient's access to appropriate transitional and adult healthcare.\n116\n,\n123\n,\n125\nThe transition phase occurs at a time when many young adults will age out of their parents' health insurance plans, and it is therefore critical for these individuals to obtain adequate coverage. Although only 3.5% of young adults with special healthcare needs were uninsured in 2010, 34.3% did not have adequate coverage to meet their needs.\n126\nIn general, the more complex a patient's condition is, the greater the negative impact that condition has on the ease of transition.\n127\nThe transition phase can be made more complicated by unrecognized and insufficiently treated concomitant deficiencies in pituitary hormones besides GH, as affected patients will need to optimize and continue multiple hormone treatments during the switch from pediatric to adult care. Additionally, patients with cognitive difficulties (such as may stem from the TBI) may be incapable of managing their own care and may require assistance from transition care coordinators, caregivers, and/or family members.\nTo achieve appropriate continuity of care during the transition phase, it is important that providers begin counseling patients and caregivers on transition strategies as early as possible. Ideally, this should be at approximately 11 to 12 years of age or at the time of diagnosis. Generalized programs such as the Ready Steady Go program in the U.K. and the Got Transition initiative in the U.S. have been developed to assess patient readiness and indicate knowledge gaps prior to transition from pediatric to adult care\n128\n,\n129\nand may also help to facilitate smooth transition for patients with TBI and GHD. Endocrinology-specific tools have also been developed, including the Endocrine Society readiness questionnaire and the Pediatric Endocrine Society transition toolkit.\n123\nIt can be helpful to develop a documented transition plan that details all the steps that need to be taken during the move to adult services.\n76\n,\n127\n,\n129\nIn addition, it has been suggested that adapting modes of communication to those preferred by younger patients (e.g., phone apps and text messaging) may contribute to improved transitions to adult healthcare offices.\n123\nIt is important that pediatric providers communicate directly with adult providers to facilitate the seamless transition of their patients.\n76\nDirect communication can involve conversations between physicians, transfer of health records, and referrals to adult providers.\n123\nFormal meetings or joint healthcare visits attended by both pediatric and adult providers can also improve continuity during the transition of care.\n123\nAs has been shown in other chronic conditions, including diabetes mellitus and cystic fibrosis, dedicated transition clinics staffed by pediatric and adult providers and transition care coordinators can increase communication and make the process more seamless. Unfortunately, these clinics may not be available to all patients for socioeconomic and/or geographic reasons.\n76\n,\n77\n,\n125\nRegardless of the availability of transition care clinics and coordinators, patients with TBI and GHD should establish care with one provider (typically their PCP or endocrinologist) to act as a single point of contact during their transition to adult services. Notably, a 2019 advisory board suggested that the pediatric endocrinologist should play a central role in the transition of patients with GHD without TBI, including providing access to educational materials and developing a specific plan for the patient's transfer to adult care.\n123\nIt seems likely that the pediatric endocrinologist could play a similarly effective role in the transition of care for patients with both TBI and GHD.\n\nConclusion\nThe occurrence of post-TBI GHD in pediatric, adolescent, and transition-age patients is underappreciated by many healthcare providers and its diagnosis and management has been incompletely studied to date. While multiple GHD diagnostic tests are available to children and young adults, there is a lack of consensus as to sensitive and specific thresholds for indicating GHD in this population. Similarly, well-defined diagnostic thresholds are lacking in the transition phase. Retesting for GHD is critical during this period, as it will inform the possible resumption of GH treatment and subsequent effects on body composition, metabolic status, and QOL. The transition phase is a complex period limited by few formal guidelines, minimal communication between providers, substandard counseling of patients and families, and inadequate insurance coverage. With this review, we aim to increase understanding of the diagnostic and treatment challenges facing patients with TBI and GHD during the transition phase, focus attention on the need for GH therapy beyond attaining adult height, and encourage providers to maintain awareness of the complex, multi-disciplinary needs of these patients."

    "Methods": "Participants\nThis case-control study consisted of two groups (choking group vs. choking-na\u00efve group) and was conducted from February 2021 to June 2021. Individuals were recruited from our separate campus-representative sexual health survey and from an online post on the Indiana University classifieds. Following consent to study participation, all participants completed a screening questionnaire to determine eligibility and group assignment. For general inclusion, participants were required to be female, enrolled at Indiana University, and between 18 and 30 years of age. For the choking group, additional inclusion criteria were that the women reported having been choked 4 or more times during consensual partnered sexual events in the past 30 days, whereas the women in the choking-na\u00efve group were free of any lifetime sexual choking/strangulation experience. Participants in both groups were excluded if they were pregnant or had had a moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), although mild TBI was permitted. However, women with mild TBI within the past year and a history of more than two mild TBIs were excluded. Additional exclusion criteria were any MRI contraindications, neurological conditions (e.g., epilepsy, aneurysm, tumor), or psychological/psychiatric conditions (e.g., psychosis, post-traumatic stress disorder). The Indiana University Institutional Review Board approved the study, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.\nAfter confirming eligibility and group assignment, we scheduled the participants for data collection. In addition to completing a questionnaire about their health history and experiences with being choked during partnered sexual events, participants in both groups completed the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression-related symptoms,\n20\n,\n21\nthe Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7) for anxiety-related symptoms,\n22\n,\n23\nand the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) for assessment of alcohol consumption, drinking behaviors, and alcohol-related problems.\n24\n,\n25\n\nMRI data acquisition\nThe MRI data were acquired on a 3T Siemens Prisma MRI scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a 64-channel head/neck coil. Anatomical MRI was also obtained using a T1-weighted, three-dimensional (3D) magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) pulse sequence with the following parameters: repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE)\u2009=\u20092400/2.3\u2009msec, inversion time (TI)\u2009=\u20091060\u2009msec, flip angle\u2009=\u20098 degrees, matrix\u2009=\u2009320\u2009\u00d7\u2009320, bandwidth\u2009=\u2009210\u2009Hz/pixel, iPAT\u2009=\u20092, which resulted in 0.8-mm isotropic resolution. Resting-state BOLD (blood-oxygen-level-dependent) signal was collected using a simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) single-shot echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with the following parameters: TR/TE\u2009=\u2009800/30\u2009msec, flip angle\u2009=\u200952 degrees, matrix\u2009=\u200990\u2009\u00d7\u200990, field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u2009216\u2009mm, resolution\u2009=\u20092.4\u2009mm isotropic, and multi-band acceleration factor\u2009=\u20096, with 1000 total volumes acquired over 12\u2009min. This sequence was acquired while the participant was asked to relax with their eyes open while passively viewing a crosshair.\n\nPreprocessing for surface-based analysis\nThe workflows of the preprocessing for surface-based analysis require extensive steps, as described in fMRIPrep.\n26\nThe detailed steps can be found in\nSupplementary Appendix S1\n. Preprocessing for anatomical data included that each participant's T1-weighted image was corrected for intensity non-uniformity. The T1 image was skull-stripped, and brain tissue segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white matter (WM), and gray matter (GM) was performed on the brain-extracted T1 image. Brain surfaces were reconstructed using\nrecon-all\n(FreeSurfer 6.0.1).\n27\nThe brief summary of preprocessing steps is as follows: 1) a reference volume and its skull-striped version were generated using fMRIPrep; 2) the BOLD reference was co-registered to the T1 image; 3) head-motion parameters with respect to the BOLD reference were estimated before any spatiotemporal filtering; 4) the BOLD time-series were resampled onto their original, native space by applying the transforms to correct for head motion; and 5) head motions that were beyond a threshold of frame-wise displacement >0.2\u2009mm, as well as 1 volume before and 2 volumes after, were identified using Friston 24-parameter model regression and excluded to address the residual effects of motion in group analyses.\n\nALFF and ReHo analyses\nAfter the preprocessing, ALFF and ReHo analyses were conducted using DPABISurf.\n17\n,\n30\nFor ALFF, the resampled functional images were spatially smoothed with a full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of 6\u2009mm. De-trend and band-pass filtering (0.01\u20130.1\u2009Hz) were performed to remove the effects of low-frequency drift and high-frequency noise. The resting-state time-series for each voxel was transformed into the frequency domain using a Fourier transform. The square root of the power spectrum was calculated and averaged across 0.01\u20130.1\u2009Hz within each voxel to obtain a raw ALFF map. The global mean ALFF value was calculated from all voxels across the whole brain. Finally, ALFF values for each voxel were divided by the global mean ALFF value for standardization. Group comparisons were made for both peak ALFF at specific coordinates and mean ALFF in each brain region.\nReHo analysis was conducted in a similar manner to ALFF.\n28\nBriefly, after band-pass filtering was performed, ReHo maps were produced by calculating the concordance of the Kendall coefficient of the resting-state time-series of a given voxel with its 26 nearest neighbors. The ReHo value of each voxel was standardized by the global mean ReHo value, followed by smoothing using a 3D Gaussian kernel of 6\u2009mm FWHM for further statistical analysis. Just as in ALFF, group comparisons were made for both peak ReHo at specific coordinates and mean ReHo in each brain region.\n\nPreprocessing for seed-based static and dynamic rs-FC analysis\nPreprocessing for both static and dynamic rs-FC was performed through the Data Processing and Analysis of Brain Imaging (DPABI) toolbox (version 6.0;\nhttp://rfmri.org/dpabi\n), which includes Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI advanced edition (DPARSFA V4.5,\nhttp://rfmri.org/DPARSF\n).\n29\n,\n30\nFirst, the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files were arranged, and the first five volumes were discarded to allow the magnetization to approach a dynamic equilibrium, followed by setting up the parameters, such as repeating time, time-points, slice number, and voxel size. Preprocessing steps included slice timing and realignment, followed by regressing out head motion parameters with Friston 24-parameter model regression.\n31\nThe spatial normalization was applied to each image based on the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template (resampling voxel size of 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm), followed by band-pass filtering with a frequency of 0.01\u20130.1\u2009Hz to reduce the effects of low-frequency drift and high-frequency physiological noise. For static rs-FC analysis, the smoothing step used the spatial Gaussian filter of 4\u2009mm FWHM. For dynamic rs-FC analysis, we did not perform any smoothing before the group connectivity analysis because performing spatial smoothing before network construction artificially increases correlations among nearby voxels.\n32\u201335\nA priori\nROIs for the connectivity analysis were set to the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), angular gyrus, and posterior cingulate cortex on the basis of previous research in brain trauma. Specifically, the DLPFC plays a central role in diverse cognitive functions\n36\nand together with the cingulate cortex regulates emotions, including sensation and pleasure.\n37\nThe angular gyrus is a hub of brain networks connecting the visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices and is involved in attention, self-processing, semantic information processing, and mentalizing.\n38\nThe effects of brain trauma and strangulation are often diffusive in nature, affecting various parts of the brain, especially the hubs of cognitive processing and emotional regulations, such as the DLPFC, cingulate gyrus, and angular gyrus. Significant cortical thinning, brain atrophy, and altered functional connectivity, and the emergence of compulsive behaviors, have been observed in patients with various severities of brain trauma.\n39\u201342\nTo account for multiple comparisons (\nn\n=\u20096: bilateral of 3 ROIs), the level of statistical significance was corrected to \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.008. ROIs were identified using the atlas of Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL).\nStatic rs-FC analysis\nAfter the preprocessing, the static rs-FC analysis for each participant was performed using DPABI V6.0. A Pearson correlation coefficient was determined between each ROI and the whole brain as a measure of the strength of regional functional connectivity at rest. The correlation coefficients were then transformed into Fisher\nz\n-scores for statistical analysis.\nDynamic rs-FC analysis\nAfter the preprocessing, the dynamic rs-FC analysis for each participant was performed using the Temporal Dynamic Analysis (TDA) toolkit that was included in DPABI V6.0. Sliding window analysis, which is sensitive to time-dependent variations,\n43\u201345\nwas applied to examine the seed-based BOLD signal over the whole brain. In the sliding window analysis, a temporal window of a certain size and shape was chosen, and functional connectivity within that window was calculated. In the current study, a moderate-length sliding Hamming window of 32 TR (64\u2009sec) and a shifting step size of 1 TR (2\u2009sec) were used to maximize statistical power within the window and across levels of analyses. The linear de-trending processing was conducted to remove the linear signal drift. The dynamic rs-FC analysis with each seed region was calculated as the Fisher\nz\n-transformed Pearson correlation coefficient for each participant, and the smoothing was performed for group analysis.\n46\nDynamic rs-FC analysis enhances the validity of our overall findings, given that the functional networks of the brain fluctuate during resting-state data acquisition. This temporal variability in functional connectivity can be accounted for in the dynamic rs-FC analysis.\n47\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe focus of this work was to characterize between-group differences in neurophysiological signals, as reflected in cortical surface functioning (ALFF and ReHo) and rs-FC (dynamic and static). Demographic differences between the choking and choking-na\u00efve groups were assessed by\nt\n-tests and chi-square tests. The two-sample\nt\n-tests were performed in the DPABISurf toolkit to compare differences in mean and peak ALFF and ReHo. For ALFF and ReHo, the statistical significance threshold was set at\np\n<\u20090.05. We used familywise error correction (clusters with a voxel-level\np\n<\u20090.01 and cluster-level\np\n<\u20090.05) to obtain a significant group difference. Because of statistically significant group differences in age, race, and AUDIT, these demographic factors were controlled as covariates. Additionally, because depression and anxiety have been shown to be associated with repetitive sexual choking, we also included scores on the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 in the model.\nSimilarly, the two-sample\nt\n-tests were used to compare rs-FC strengths between groups in both static and dynamic analyses within the DPABI V6.0. Because we had 6 ROIs for rs-FC analyses, multiple comparisons were corrected by threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE), and the level of statistical significance was set at two-tailed\np\n<\u20090.008. Demographic factors (age, race, AUDIT, PHQ-9, and GAD-7) were included in the model as covariates, and the number of permutations was set at 1000."

It should be noted that while\nSarm1\nKO mice have been backcrossed to the C57BL/6 strain, recent analysis revealed that they may have genetic variations in neighboring genes belonging to the original 129 strain.\n31\nHowever, the specific effect of\nSarm1\nKO on axon degeneration\nin vivo\nhas been confirmed by CRISPR/Cas9 editing\n31\nand the expression of dominant negative constructs.\n32\nMice were subjected to IA-TBI or sham injury (\nTable 1\n) as described with slight modifications.\n12\n,\n22\n,\n33\nBriefly, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of isoflurane, oxygen and nitrous oxide, the cranium was exposed, and a 5\u2009mm-thick stainless-steel disc was glued onto the skull midway between bregma and lambda sutures. Then, a 50\u2009g weight was dropped from 85\u2009cm on the metal disk, while the mouse was placed on a foam mattress (4\u20130 spring constant foam; Foam to Size Inc., Ashland, VA), with the body immobilized with tape. Immediately after injury, the disc was removed and the skull was examined for skull fractures; the rare animals with fractures (< 2%) were excluded. The scalp incision was closed with surgical staples. Sham animals underwent the same procedure without the weight drop component. Neurological recovery was assessed by the presence and duration of apnea or irregular breathing and the revival of the righting reflex. Subjects with apnea/irregular breathing >150\u2009sec and time-to-righting reflex <50\u2009sec or >550\u2009sec were excluded (< 5%). After recovery, animals were returned to their vivarium with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and\nad libitum\naccess to food and water. Surgical procedures and injuries were performed under aseptic conditions and all animal handling and postoperative procedures were carried according to protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions (Protocol Number: MO19M458).\nTable 1.\nSummary of Experimental Groups and Histological Procedures\nExperiment\nMouse cohorts\nMethods\nBlood\u2013brain barrier assessment\nYFP-H (\nn\n=\u20096); survival 15\u2009min or 4\u2009h post IA-TBI or sham injury.\nTissue clearing and confocal imaging\nAssessment of acute disconnection\nYFP-H and YFP-H/\nSarm1\nKO (\nn\n=\u200910); survival 24\u2009h post IA-TBI.\nTissue clearing and confocal imaging\nUltrastructural assessment of traumatic\nC57BL/6 (\nn\n=\u20096); survival 15\u2009min or 4\u2009h.\nElectron microscopy\naxonal injury Ultrastructural and stereological assessment of traumatic axonopathy\nC57BL/6 ;\nSarm1\nKO (\nn\n=\u200992);\nsurvival 3, 7, 14, and 21 days post IA-TBI or sham injury.\nAdditional wt and SKO mice at 3, 7, and 21 days were also prepared for further ultrastructural analyses (\nn\n=\u200913).\nElectron microscopy,\nstereology on toluidine blue stained semithin sections.\nAssessment of neuroinflammation\nC57BL/6,\nSarm1\nKO (\nn\n=\u200933);\nsurvival 7 and 28 days post IA-TBI or sham injury.\nTissue clearing and confocal imaging\nOpen in a separate window\nIA-TBI, impact acceleration traumatic brain injury; wt, wild type; SKO,\nSarm1 knockout.\n\nBlood\u2013brain barrier assessment\nFor the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) disruption studies, YFP-H mice (\nn\n=\u20092 per time-point) received IA-TBI or sham injury and were injected intraperitoneally with 400\u2009\u03bcL of 20\u2009mg/mL EZ-Link\u2122 Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. #21335), 20\u2009min before perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Formaldehyde fixed optic nerves were processed with the SHIELD protocol\n34\nfor tissue clearing as per manufacture instructions (LifeCanvas Technologies, MA; Cat.# C-PCK-250-1.52). For the visualization of EZ-Biotin, ONs were incubated with Streptavidin, Alexa Fluor\u2122 594 conjugate (1:1000; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. #S32356), before washing and index matching. Optic nerves were then imaged with a ZEISS 880 Airyscan microscope using 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009, 25\u2009\u00d7\u2009and 40\u2009\u00d7\u2009objectives.\n\nTissue clearing for optic nerve anatomy\nTo assess the three-dimensional anatomy of ON axons and its alteration shortly after injury in the presence or absence of\nSarm1\n, we crossed YFP-H mice with\nSarm1\nKO mice and subjected them to IA-TBI. After perfusion fixation, one of the two ONs was selected at random and processed for clearing and for imaging at 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009with a ZEISS 880 Airyscan microscope as described above (\nn\n=\u20095 per genotype). An investigator blinded to group designation counted axons manually. The total number of axons per ON was estimated by counting manually the number of axons in the proximal ON segment (at three levels) and then the fraction of non-disconnected axons was estimated from the number of axons passing through the injury front with no interruption in YFP-H signal.\n\nTissue preparation for semithin section analysis and transmission electron microscopy\nWild-type C57BL/6 and\nSarm1\nKO mice were randomly allocated to sham or IA-TBI condition, and to different survival end-points (3, 7, 14, and 21 days;\nn\n=\u20098-10 per time-point, per genotype). Mice were transcardially perfused with 2% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde in 50\u2009mM sodium cacodylate, 50\u2009mM phosphate and 3\u2009mM magnesium chloride buffer (pH\u2009=\u20097.4) for 30\u2009min. Tissues were left in situ at room temperature for 2\u2009h before dissection and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in the same fixative. Tissues were rinsed (5\u2009\u00d7\u200915\u2009min) in 75\u2009mM sodium cacodylate, 75\u2009mM phosphate, and 3\u2009mM magnesium chloride (pH\u2009=\u20097.4) on a rotator. To adjust osmolarity, the first two rinsing steps included 2:1 and 1:1 mixture of fixative solution and buffer at 4\u00b0C, respectively. Tissues were then incubated in freshly prepared 2% osmium tetroxide with 1.6% potassium ferrocyanide in the same buffer for 2\u2009h at room temperature in the dark.\nFollowing osmication, tissues were rinsed three times in 100\u2009mM maleate, 3.5% sucrose buffer (pH\u2009=\u20096.2) for 10\u2009min and incubated with 2% uranyl acetate in maleate-sucrose buffer for 1\u2009h followed by step-wise rinsing steps in maleate buffer, 1:1 maleate buffer with distilled water, and finally distilled water for 5\u2009min each. Tissue blocks were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, transferred in propylene oxide and incubated in 50% embedded in EMbed 812 resin (EMS14120, Electron Microscope Sciences, Hatfield, PA). Semithin (1\u2009\u03bcm) and thin (60\u2009nm) sections were sectioned in a Leica UC7 ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Deerfield, IL). Sections were obtained through the transverse and longitudinal planes to sample the injury front as well as segments distal and proximal to it. \u201cDistal\u201d sections were obtained at a pre-chiasmatic ON level where all myelinated fibers are visible at cross-section and \u201cproximal\u201d sections immediately distal to the exit of the ON from the optic foramen. Transverse semithin sections were stained with 1% toluidine blue. Thin sections were mounted on square mess copper grids (EMS300-Cu, Electron Microscope Sciences, Hatfield, PA), stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined and photographed on a Hitachi H7600 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).\n\nStereological quantitation of intact and abnormal myelinated axons\nTransverse semithin sections distal and proximal to the site of traumatic biomechanical disruption were stained with toluidine blue. Sections were prepared from one ON per subject that was selected randomly and stereological analysis was performed by two separate investigators blinded to experimental history. Interrater reliability was very high with Pearson's r of 0.997. Analysis was performed at 100\u2009\u00d7\u2009using systematic random sampling and the optical fractionator probe, with the aid of a motorized stage Axioplan microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc.) and Stereo Investigator\u00ae software (Microbrightfield Inc., Williston, VT). Parameters were selected based on empirically determined sampling methods\n35\nand were as follows: counting frame size of 4\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u2009\u03bcm, grid size of 17.89\u2009\u00d7\u200917.89\u2009\u03bcm and sampling fraction of 4%. Pathological profiles included fibers with condensed (dark) or hydropic axoplasm and pathological sheaths with myelin thinning, excess myelin figures, and collapsed myelin.\n\nProcessing of retinas and quantitation of retinal ganglion cell bodies\nBecause glutaraldehyde fixation poses challenges in immunohistochemistry for RGC markers, we estimated RGC densities using hematoxylin-stained sections. Briefly, eyes were embedded in paraffin after removal of the cornea and sectioned at 10\u2009\u03bcm. Sections through the optic nerve head were stained with hematoxylin, mounted with DPX and examined for the identification of RGCs in the ganglion cell layer based on nuclear histology.\n36\n,\n37\nRetinal ganglion cells are characterized by a large, round, lightly stained nucleus and prominent central nucleolus. Cells with elongated nuclei were deemed to be epithelial cells, while cells with small, dense, and uniformly stained round nuclei were identified as amacrine cells.\n36\n,\n37\nCell counts were performed by an investigator blinded to experimental history. Using the optical fractionator stereological probe, the retinal ganglion cell layer was traced at 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009and individual RGC profiles were counted under 40\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification. For each mouse, RGC count was determined as the mean count of three sections.\n\nAssessment of neuroinflammation in cleared optic nerves\nTo assess activation of microglia and phagocytosis in ONs after IA-TBI, wild-type, and\nSarm1\nKO mice were randomly allocated to sham or IA-TBI condition, and left to survive for 7 or 28 days (\nn\n=\u20095-6 per time-point\u2009\u00d7\u2009per genotype). Mice were transcardially perfused with 4% PFA in PBS as in a previous section. Optic nerves were processed with the SHIELD protocol as above with the following change: before, refractive index matching, optic nerves were incubated with a monoclonal rabbit antibody (E4O4W) against IBA1 (1:50; Cell Signaling Technology, Cat# 17198; RRID:AB_2820254) and a rat monoclonal antibody (clone FA-11) against CD 68 (1:100; Bio-Rad Cat# MCA1957GA, RRID:AB_324217) for 4 days at 37\u00b0C in PBS with 0.1% Triton (PBST) and 0.1% NaN\n3.\nThen they were washed three times in PBST over 8\u2009h and further incubated with secondary goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor Plus 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# A48265, RRID:AB_2895299) and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor Plus 594 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# A48284, RRID:AB_2896348) for 2.5 days at 37\u00b0C, then washed again in PBST and PBS. Z-stack images (60\u2009\u03bcm) through the center of the most distal 1-mm segment were captured at 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009with a ZEISS 880 Airyscan microscope. The signal of the CD 68 channel was quantified in FIJI (NIH, RRID:SCR_002285) as areal density: z-stack images were converted to binary masks with adaptive thresholding after background subtraction, Gaussian blur and sum Z-projection, and the fraction of signal coverage (areal density) was measured.\n\nStatistical analysis\nGraphpad Prism 9.1 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, Ca, USA; RRID:SCR_002798) was used for statistical analysis and plotting of figures. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or mixed effect models (\nF\ndf,df\n,\nwhere\ndf\nis degrees of freedom) were used for the assessment of genotype, time and/or location effects with adjustment for multiple independent or pairwise comparisons (\nt\ndf\n) as indicated. For the statistical analysis of CD 68 signal, two-way ANOVA was performed after log-transformation of the data to account for heteroskedasticity. Significance threshold (\np\n) was set at 0.05."

    "Methods": "This was a multi-center retrospective cohort study designed with the goals of evaluating the performance of the McGovern score, and describing and comparing BCVI incidence and management at multiple Level 1 pediatric trauma centers across the country. For each institution, approval was obtained from the institutional review board. All institutions signed a dual-data transfer agreement and all information shared between the institutions was de-identified. The RedCAP data collection tool was utilized to collect and share data between institutions.\n\nPatient population\nThis multi-center, retrospective, hospital-based, cohort study involved data collected from six Level 1 pediatric trauma centers. A trauma registry was compiled at each institution containing all pediatric trauma patients who presented to the ED between 2003 and 2017. The trauma registries used as inclusion criteria the National Trauma Data Standard (NTDS) Data Dictionary, which includes presence of\nInternational Classification of Diseases\n, 9th Revision (ICD9)/ICD10 codable injury presenting within 14 days of the injury (and excludes patients whose injuries were only isolated superficial, such as abrasions and soft-tissue contusions). In addition, patients had to meet one of the following criteria: admitted patients (observation or inpatient), dead on arrival/died in the ED, transferred out of the ED for higher level of care, or transferred in from an acute care ED/hospital regardless of whether they were discharged from the ED or admitted to the hospital.\nThis trauma registry was then queried for patients who received a CTA as a screening method for BCVI. Any patients with penetrating injuries (i.e., gunshot or stab wounds) to the head or neck were excluded from this study.\n\nData collection\nAmong the patients who underwent CTA (\nn\n=\u20091012), patient age, arrival date, length of follow-up, and MOI were recorded. The MOI was categorized as either blunt high energy (motor vehicle accident, automobile-pedestrian accident, bicycle accident, or fall >1 story), or low energy (fall <1 story, struck with object, etc.). The clinical information recorded for each patient who underwent CTA included GCS score on arrival and the presence or absence of a focal neurological deficit. The obtained radiological variables included the presence or absence of a carotid canal fracture, petrous temporal bone fracture, and cerebral infarction as determined on CT scanning. Patients who underwent CTA were then individually evaluated. Records of those found to have BCVI (\nn\n=\u200972) were queried for mode of treatment, type of intracranial injury, artery damaged, and BCVI injury grade, in addition to the aforementioned clinical and radiological variables. Additionally, Le Fort fractures, cervical spine fractures, cervical spine subluxation, and neck soft-tissue injuries (e.g., seatbelt sign, hanging, hematoma) were noted in the BCVI cohort.\nThe mode of treatment was characterized as observation, antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation therapy, endovascular stenting, or open surgery. The type of intracranial injury was characterized as epidural, subdural, subarachnoid, or contusion. The artery damaged was characterized as intracranial carotid, extracranial carotid, intracranial vertebral, or extracranial vertebral. Lastly, the BCVI injury grade was classified according to the Biffl grading scale\n1\u20132\nas follows: a grade 1 injury involved intimal irregularity with <25% narrowing; grade 2 injury involved dissection of a vessel or the presence of an intramural hematoma with >25% narrowing; grade 3 injury involved the presence of pseudoaneurysm; grade 4 injury was characterized by complete occlusion; and a grade 5 injury involved the transection of the vessel with extravasation.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe data collected were summarized using the means and standard deviations for continuous variables and counts and frequencies for categorical variables. The recorded categorical variables were compared using Fisher's exact test or chi-square test.\nTo assess the McGovern score's ability to predict BCVI incidence in this study's multi-center cohort, the McGovern score was calculated for all patients who underwent CTA (\nn\n=\u20091012). The variables involved in the McGovern score included the Utah score variables with the addition of MOI: GCS score \u22648, focal neurological deficit, carotid canal fracture as seen on CT, petrous temporal bone fracture as seen on CT, and cerebral infarction as seen on CT as well as a high-speed MOI. Each of the variables was weighted as 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, and 2 points, respectively (\nTable 1\n). A cumulative score of 3 classified patients as high risk according to the McGovern score and merited the need for vessel imaging (CTA) to confirm or rule out a diagnosis of BCVI. Once these six variables were evaluated in the imaging cohort (\nn\n=\u20091012), patients were categorized into a 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 table (positive/negative McGovern test vs. the presence/absence of BCVI) and the SN, SP, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV)were then calculated and the results were compared for the patient population at Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital (CMHH) as compared with those at other institutions (\nTable 3\n). Additionally, in the cohort of patients with BCVI (\nn\n=\u200972), MOI, injury severity, and injury location were included (\nTable 4\n). Lastly, those patients with BCVI were evaluated for treatment (observation, antiplatelet agent, anticoagulation, endovascular intervention, or open surgery) relative to severity/grade of injury (\nTable 5\n). Results obtained from CMHH were compared with the results obtained from the other institutions. All statistical testing was performed with the R software package (v3.1.2) (MASS).\nTable 3.\nCalculation of the Validity of the McGovern Score\nNo. of patients\nData set\nBCVI\nNo BCVI\nPPV/NPV\nSensitivity/Specificity\nChildren's Memorial Hermann Hospital\nPositive McGovern test\n17\n105\n13.9%/98.5%\n81.0%/71.4%\nNegative McGovern test\n4\n262\nNot Including Hermann Data Set\nPositive McGovern test\n47\n206\n18.6%/98.9%\n92.2%/64.0%\nNegative McGovern test\n4\n367\nAll Data Sets\nPositive McGovern test\n64\n311\n17.1%/98.7%\n88.9%/66.9%\nNegative McGovern test\n8\n629\nOpen in a separate window\nSummarizes the PPV, NPV, sensitivity, and specificity for three different data sets.

In grade 2 injuries, blood thinners were contraindicated in 4 patients (treated with observation) and 1 patient was anticoagulated for concurrent venous sinus thrombosis. In grade 3 injuries, blood thinners were contraindicated in 1 patient. In grade 5 injuries, blood thinners were contraindicated in 1 patient due to concurrent, large intracranial hemorrhage.\nASA, aspirin; BCVI, blunt cerebrovascular injury.\nIt should also be noted that in our previous publication (Herbert and associates\n13\n), receiver operator curves (ROCs) were generated to evaluate the SN and SP of the McGovern score at varying thresholds as well as to determine which discrimination point would be most appropriate. The most predictive threshold was determined by calculating the area under the curve. A sample ROC was published in our previous publication.\n13\nBased on this statistical analysis, we assigned MOI a point value of 2 and determined a threshold of 3 as high risk for BCVI, warranting angiographic imaging (such as CTA). We kept a dichotomous score (high or low risk) to facilitate ease of use and more streamlined clinical decision-making."

Slices were maintained for at least 10 days prior to experimentation.\n\nPrimary blast injury exposure\nBlast injury methods have been previously described in detail.\n7\n,\n8\n,\n32\n,\n33\nIndividual culture inserts were sealed in sterile polyethylene bags (Whirl-Pak, Fort Atkins, WI) filled with serum-free medium (75% minimum essential medium, 25% Hank's balanced salt solution, 2\u2009mM GlutaMAX, 25\u2009mM D-glucose, and 10\u2009mM HEPES; Life Technologies) and positioned 85\u2009mm into the fluid-filled receiver, maintained at 37\u02daC. The receiver was sealed with a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane and placed directly at the shock tube exit, with a 5-mm gap. Either compressed helium or nitrogen was used as the driver gas for specific exposures.\nOHSCs were exposed to multiple level 1, 2, or 3 injuries (\nTable 1\n) as per our previous publication\n8\nwith inter-blast intervals of 1, 3, or 6 days. For comparisons, samples in the sham group were prepared and placed in the receiver, but did not receive a shockwave exposure. Slices were maintained for 4 days following the last of the repeated blast injuries and interrogated for LTP. OHSCs that were partially depleted of microglia and those that were treated with MW-189 were exposed to two repeated level 3 blast injuries with a 1-day inter-blast interval.\nTable 1.\nBlast Characteristics and Injury Protocol\nOverpressure|duration|impulse\nInter-blast interval\nPost-blast recovery\nLevel 1- 106\u2009kPa | 0.25\u2009msec | 9.2\u2009kPa\u2022msec\nLevel 2- 93\u2009kPa | 1.4\u2009msec | 39\u2009kPa\u2022msec\nLevel 3- 190\u2009kPa | 1.2\u2009msec | 73\u2009kPa\u2022msec\n1 day\n3 days\n6 days\n4 days\nOpen in a separate window\nBlast exposure levels and injury protocol tested in this study (as reported earlier).\n8\n\nCell death measurement\nAt Day 10 prior to blast injury and immediately before electrophysiology experiments and use in any biochemical assays, OHSCs were incubated in 2.5\u2009\u03bcM propidium iodide (PI; Life Technologies) in serum-free medium for 1\u2009h before imaging. Images were acquired using an Olympus IX81 microscope (Olympus America, Center Valley, PA) with 568/24\u2009nm (peak/width) excitation and 610/40\u2009nm emission filters. Cell death was quantified as the percent area of PI staining above a predetermined threshold immediately prior to injury and immediately prior to electrophysiological studies or use in biochemical assays. OHSCs were deemed healthy if there was less than 5% PI staining.\n\nElectrophysiological recordings\nElectrophysiological activity was recorded using 60-channel microelectrode arrays (MEAs, 8\u2009\u00d7\u20098 electrode grid without the corners, 30-\u03bcm electrode diameter, 200-\u03bcm electrode spacing, 60MEA200/30iR-Ti-gr, Multi-Channel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany). The OHSCs were perfused with artificial cerebral spinal fluid (aCSF) containing 125.0\u2009mM NaCl, 3.5\u2009mM KCl, 26.0\u2009mM NaHCO\n3\n, 1.2\u2009mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 2.4\u2009mM CaCl\n2\n, 1.3\u2009mM MgCl\n2\n, 10.0\u2009mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), and 10.0\u2009mM D-glucose (pH\u2009=\u20097.4), which was bubbled with 5% CO\n2\n/95% O\n2\nwarmed to 37\u00b0C.\n34\nRecordings were acquired at 20\u2009kHz with a 6\u2009kHz analog, anti-aliasing filter and further filtered in MATLAB\u2122 (Mathworks, Natick, MA) using an eighth-order, digital, low-pass (1000\u2009Hz) and a fourth-order, digital, high-pass (0.2\u2009Hz) Butterworth filter.\nTo induce LTP, the OHSCs were stimulated in the Schaffer Collateral (SC). First, stimulus-response curves were generated by applying a constant current, biphasic, bipolar stimulus of increasing magnitude (0-100\u2009\u03bcA in 10\u2009\u03bcA increments). Peak-to-peak evoked responses were fit to a sigmoidal curve, and three parameters were quantified: R\nmax\n, the maximum amplitude of the evoked response; m, the slope of the sigmoidal fit; and I\n50\n, the current needed to elicit a half maximal response.\n7\nThis I\n50\nwas used to stimulate the electrodes in the SC pathway once a minute for 30\u2009min to establish baseline recordings. LTP was induced by stimulating the same electrodes in the SC pathway with a high frequency stimulus train (three trains of 100\u2009Hz applied for 1\u2009sec with each train separated by 10\u2009sec). Post-LTP responses were evoked by stimulating at I\n50\nevery minute for 60\u2009min. LTP induction was calculated as the percent change between the average peak-to-peak responses in the last 10\u2009min of the baseline and post-LTP recordings of the electrodes in the CA1 region, normalized to the baseline response.\nTo ensure stable responses were included for analysis, electrodes were discounted if the coefficient of variance (in the average of the peak-to-peak responses of the last 10\u2009min of either baseline or post-LTP signals) was greater than 20%. Electrodes were also discounted if the average of the peak-to-peak responses in the last 10\u2009min of the baseline response was not within the range of 35-65% of the Rmax. This range was chosen to accommodate the electrodes that would approximately lie in the linear range of the sigmoidal stimulus-response curve. After applying these criteria, slices were also excluded if there were less than five electrodes to average in the CA1 region.\n\nDrug treatment\nTo determine the role of microglia in contributing to LTP deficits following repeated bTBI, a group of OHSCs were treated with liposomal clodronate (Clodrosome, Encapsula NanoSciences, Brentwood, TN) or PLX3397 (pexidartinib, Selleckchem, Houston, TX) to deplete microglia from the slices. Immediately after culturing the OHSCs, the slices were treated with either 25\u2009\u03bcg/mL of Encapsome (the liposomal constructs without the encapsulated clodronate) or either 10 or 25\u2009\u03bcg/mL of Clodrosome in Neurobasal medium. After 24\u2009h of exposure, the culture medium was replaced with fresh Neurobasal medium. The OHSCs were then maintained with the same feeding protocol as described above. A subset of OHSCs was treated with either 1\u2009\u03bcM pexidartinib (dissolved in 0.05% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]) or vehicle (DMSO, 0.05%) from Days\nin vitro\n(DIV) 6-10. As a positive control for microglial activation, OHSCs were treated with 100\u2009ng/mL of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, L4516, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) following PI imaging on DIV 10. Stock solution of MW-189 (dissolved in 0.9% saline), kindly gifted by Dr. Linda Van Eldik (University of Kentucky), was diluted to 30\u2009\u03bcM in fresh, full serum medium.\n\nMultiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\nOHSCs exposed to a single level 3 blast, two repeated level 3 blasts, or two repeated sham injuries were collected 3\u2009h and 24\u2009h after the final blast or sham exposure. On ice, four OHSCs were lysed in Milliplex MAP Lysis Buffer (Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 2\u2009mM PMSF, 1\u2009mM sodium orthovanadate, and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Dallas, TX). The tissue was mechanically lysed with a 27-gauge needle and syringe 20 times, centrifuged for 15\u2009min at 13,000\u2009rpm, and the supernatant collected. The concentration of protein in the collected supernatant was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). All samples were standardized to the same concentration of total protein.\nThe levels of cytokines and chemokines from the brain tissue supernatant were measured by multiplex immunoassay using Milliplex MAP Rat Cytokine/Chemokine magnetic panel according to the manufacturer's instructions (Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Analytes included interleukin (IL)-2, IL-5, IL-18, IL-12 (p70), IL1-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-17A, IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, granulocyte colony stimulating factor, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b1, LPS-induced CXC chemokine (LIX), fractalkine, vascular endothelial growth factor, regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, eotaxin, MIP-2, leptin, epidermal growth factor, interferon \u03b3, GRO/KC/CINC-1, and interferon gamma-inducible protein (IP)-10.\n\nWestern blotting\nFollowing injury or microglial depletion, six OHSCs were pooled together, flash frozen, and stored at -80\u00b0C until tissue lysis. On ice, the pooled tissues were lysed with a standard radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Dallas, TX), supplemented with 2\u2009mM PMSF, 1\u2009mM sodium orthovanadate, and a protease inhibitor cocktail. The tissue was mechanically lysed with a 27-gauge needle and syringe 20 times, sonicated (Misonix XL 2000 Ultrasonic Cell Disruptor, IL, USA), and centrifuged for 15\u2009min at 13,000\u2009rpm. The concentration of protein in the collected supernatant was determined by the BCA assay. Samples probed for Iba1 were denatured and reduced with NuPAGE\u2122 LDS Sample Buffer (4\u2009\u00d7) (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) and NuPAGE\u2122 Reducing Agent (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) and boiled at 95\u00b0C for 15\u2009min. Samples probed for CD68 and CD206 were only denatured with NuPAGE\u2122 LDS Sample Buffer (4\u2009\u00d7\u2009) and boiled at 95\u00b0C for 15\u2009min. A total of 50\u2009\u03bcg protein of each sample was loaded onto a 4-12% Bis-Tris gel (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and separated at 150\u2009V for 60\u2009min using mPAGE\u2122 MES SDS running buffer (EMD Millipore, Burlington, MA).\nProteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Life Technologies), blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; pH 7.4) with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 3% donkey serum for 1\u2009h. Blots were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies (Iba1 [Abcam, #ab5076, 1:1000], \u03b2-tubulin [Invitrogen, #32-2600, 1:2000], CD68 [Abcam, #ab125212, 1:1000], CD206 [Abcam, #ab64693, 1:500]) in TBS with Tween (TBS-T, 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.4) with 1% BSA and 1% donkey serum. Membranes were washed and then incubated with corresponding secondary antibodies (donkey anti-goat Alexa Fluor 647 [Abcam, #ab150131, 1:1000], donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 [Abcam, #ab150073, 1:1000], and donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 [Abcam, ab150105, 1:2000]) at room temperature for 2\u2009h. After washing, the blot was imaged using a CRi Maestro 2 Imaging System (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nOHSCs that were sham or blast injured and OHSCs that were depleted of microglia using either Clodronate or pexidartinib were fixed in 10% formalin, incubated with primary antibodies (Iba1 [Abcam, #ab5076, 1:1000], CD68 [Abcam, #ab125212, 1:1000], or CD206 [Abcam, #ab64693, 1:1000]) at room temperature for 1\u2009h, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies (donkey anti-goat Alexa Fluor 647 [Abcam, #ab150131, 1:1000], donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 [Abcam, #ab150073, 1:1000]) at room temperature for 1\u2009h. Hoechst (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to label the nuclei. At the completion of staining, OHSCs were cleared with the CUBIC (Clear, Unobstructed Brain/Body Imaging Cocktails and Computational) method.\n35\nOHSCs were imaged with a Zeiss LS700 confocal microscope (Oberkochen, Germany).\n\nStatistical analysis\nLong-term potentiation deficits following repeated mild bTBI and Western blots evaluating microglial activation and microglial depletion were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by a Dunnett\npost hoc\nanalysis. For the studies with Clodrosome, an ANOVA was performed with a Bonferroni\npost hoc\ntest. For pexidartinib and MW-189 studies, treated groups were compared with control groups with a Student's t-test. Statistical significance was set as\np\n<\u20090.05 for all of these studies. For multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) studies, to correct for the large number of measurements,\np\nvalues were adjusted with the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure and a false discovery rate determined to yield less than one false positive result.\n36\n,\n37\nBlast injured groups that were deemed to be statistically significant following the BH procedure were analyzed by a Tukey\npost hoc\ntest with statistical significance set as\np\n<\u20090.05. Groups treated with MW-189 were analyzed with a Student's t-test followed by the BH procedure."

    "Methods": "The study was approved by the University of Washington Institutional Review Board. All participants provided informed consent, and parents provided consent for the participants under the age of 18 years. Participants received $25 for completing baseline surveys and $75 for completing the driving simulation.\n\nDrivers with concussion\nParticipants were eligible if they were 16 to 25 years of age, had a valid driver's license, had regular access to a passenger vehicle, regularly drove at least twice per week, and had been diagnosed with a concussion by a health care provider within 1 week of being contacted by study personnel. We enrolled participants who could read and write in English in order to complete the testing protocol and driving tasks. Individuals with TBI who had neurologic abnormalities on imaging, prior moderate-severe TBI, or other neurological disorders such as seizures were excluded. Concussed participants were recruited by screening emergency department logs at the three University of Washington hospitals (University of Washington Medical Center, Harborview Medical Center, and Valley Medical Center) and outpatient visits to concussion specialty clinics between November 14, 2019, and February 4, 2022. Potentially eligible patients were contacted by letter, phone and text, the study was explained to them, and consented participants were brought to the driving lab for assessment. The study coordinator explained the study and obtained informed consent. Participants were invited to the driving lab for assessment within 2-3 weeks of the concussion event.\n\nComparison participants\nParticipants were eligible for the comparison group if they were 16 to 25 years of age, had a valid driver's license, had a smart phone, had regular access to a passenger vehicle and regularly drove at least twice per week, and could read and write in English in order to complete test instruments and driving tasks. Comparison participants were recruited through word of mouth by patients with concussion and were also recruited through advertisements on the University of Washington campus. They were frequency matched to concussed participants on age, sex, and years of education.\n\nBaseline surveys\nBaseline demographics, socio-economic data, and health risk behaviors were collected for each participant at the baseline visit. We used neurocognitive measures from the Common Data Elements toolkit.\n18\nWe also asked if they have ever been diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, or anxiety by a physician or psychologist, and whether they have ever taken medication for these conditions.\n\nCore driving factors\nWe collected baseline measures from all participants to examine outcome measures and participant risk characteristics. Driving experience was measured by years since full licensure as well as number of miles driven per week in the week before injury, or the index date for the comparison group. Seat belt use was assessed using a standardized question from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey.\n19\n\nNeuropsychological assessment\nParticipants in both groups completed the following validated neuropsychological assessments:\nNIH Toolbox Cognition Battery\nThe NIH Toolbox is a multi-dimensional set of brief, easy to administer measures for assessment of neurological and behavioral function of individuals 3-85 years of age. It has been normed and validated in a broad sample of the U.S. population and used in over 600 research studies, including studies on traumatic brain injury.\n20-22\nAvailable measures include assessment of motor, emotional, sensory, and cognitive function. This study utilized the cognition battery,\n23\nwhich can be administered via tablet and requires minimal examiner training. The cognition battery consists of the following core subtests designed to assess executive function, memory, and language: 1) picture vocabulary; 2) oral reading recognition; 3) Flanker inhibitory control and attention; 4) dimensional change card sort; 5) list sorting working memory; 6) picture sequence memory; and 7) pattern comparison. Participants also completed the oral symbol digit test, which is a supplemental subtest designed to assess cognitive processing speed. The language tests, which make up a Crystallized Composite,\n24\ncan be used as a proxy for educational attainment, intellectual functioning, and pre-morbid functioning.\n23\nThe other subtests, which make up a Fluid Composite, assess executive function and memory, skills important for driving,\n25\u201328\nwhich may be impacted in the acute phase following concussion. The NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery subtests have strong psychometric properties including test\u2013retest reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity in children\n29\nand adults.\n23\nTrail Making Test (TMT)\nThe TMT is a measure of attention, processing speed, and mental flexibility. Part A assesses visual attention, scanning, numeric sequencing, and visual-motor speed. Part B assesses divided attention, mental flexibility, and ability to inhibit competing stimuli. TMT is highly sensitive to effects of brain injury.\n30\nIt has been used extensively in the driving research with consistent relationships found between performance on TMT Part B and driving performance.\n31\nThe Sport Concussion Assessment Tool-5 (SCAT-5)\nThe SCAT-5 is a standardized tool developed by the Concussion in Sport Group to assist in assessment of sports-related concussion.\n32\nThe SCAT-5 concussion symptoms checklist is commonly administered in clinical settings as a self-report measure to patients by physicians and other healthcare professionals. It consists of 22 questions on symptoms such as headache, dizziness, and difficulty remembering; the severity of each symptom is scored on a scale from 1 (none) to 6 (severe).\n\nSimulated driving assessment\nWe used a fixed-base driving simulator (National Advanced Driving Simulator - mMiniSim). This simulator has three 48\u2033 monitors (Sony displays, 1920\u2009\u00d7\u20091080 resolution) that were placed approximately 2\u2009m from the driver's eye point. It consists of an actual vehicle steering wheel, brake pedals, and accelerator pedals. The steering wheel has a semi-active controller that is driven by a DC motor and microcontroller. The steering column has a functional turn signal indicator, and the accelerator pedal is a commercial drive-by-wire pedal identical to those used in on-road vehicles. The brake and the accelerator pedals are designed to provide a realistic feel. The accelerator pedal force is approximately linear to the displacement response. Similar to a normal pedal, the brake pedal force is non-linear to the displacement response. The simulator also has a 7\u2033 touchscreen display mounted to the right of the steering wheel which was used for the secondary task.\nDriving scenarios\nTwo drives were developed using the National Advanced Driving Simulator (NADS) Interactive Scenario Authoring Tool (ISAT). The first drive was based in an urban setting and the second drive based in a highway or rural setting. Using ISAT, the researchers could control the design and placement of the road scene, traffic, and weather environment and the structures and people in the environment (buildings, trees, pedestrians, bicyclists, road signs). The urban drive included a near-miss scenario towards the end of the drive. The near-miss included a second vehicle turning right at a crosswalk. The timing of this maneuver was adjusted to ensure a near-miss encounter between the vehicle and the simulator driver. In the highway/rural drive, the simulator driver was asked to follow a lead vehicle, without overtaking it at any point during the drive.\n\nSimulated driving performance measures\nWe used simulator driving tasks developed by the investigators for use in prior studies for individuals with TBI.\n33\u201336\nAs above, the simulator tasks included urban and rural driving scenarios. In the urban scenario, we examined the driver's ability to steer and brake as needed during lane changing, braking, and turning. In the rural scenario, we tested the driver's ability to maintain lane position and maintain a reasonable distance from a leading vehicle. Both scenarios included the TDRT cognitive tasks described below.\nTactile Detection Response Task (TDRT)\nA validated method in testing cognitive load during simulated driving is the tactile detection response task (TDRT).\n37\nThis task refers to the detection of a small tactile stimulus. In our study, the tactile stimulus was vibratory, delivered from a device secured to the back of the participant's left hand. During the experiment, each participant was asked to press a button in response to a tactile vibration stimulus. Response times and miss rates were measured. A valid response refers to a single response that was initiated between 100 and 2500\u2009msec from the onset of the stimulus. A miss refers to the invalid response or no response after the stimulus onset and miss rate is the ratio of the number of misses to the total number of stimuli for a data segment. One study found that TDRT testing may be most sensitive to the attentional effects on cognitive loads.\n38\nA 2015 study of simulated and on-road driving also found the TDRT to be a sensitive and reliable method of testing the effects of a secondary task on driver attention and cognitive load.\n39\nTexting-based secondary task\nDuring the rural drive, participants were asked to engage in a texting-based secondary task alongside the driving and TDRT task. This task required each participant to type in a word that appeared on the touchscreen next to the steering wheel. The words appeared on the touchscreen with a \u201cping\u201d sound and when the participant clicked on \u201cSubmit\u201d the next word would appear. Between submitting the answer and appearance of the next word on the touch screen, there was a delay of between 1 to 2\u2009sec.\nSimulator and TDRT data processing\nEach simulator drive generated a Data Acquisition File (DAQ), which contained the vehicle kinematics-related information. This file was generated by the NADS mMiniSim software and was converted into a comma separated time-series file format using Python 3.8. There were two DAQ files for each participant for the baseline visit, (s) processed into comma separated file format. Variables extracted from the DAQ files include: vehicle distance; accelerator pedal position; vehicle acceleration; brake pedal position; steering wheel angle; deviation from the center of the lane; following distance; vehicle position (x, y, and z coordinates); location of environment factors such as pedestrian and bicyclists; and collision with a vehicle during the drive. All variables were sampled at a rate of 60\u2009Hz (60 times each sec) and included the timestamp. TDRT data was generated in comma separated file format and consisted of the timestamps for each click, each miss, and the calculated response time. TDRT data was merged with the simulated driving data, based on the timestamps.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAnalyses were completed using SAS Software Version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and R (Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Australia).\nDemographic characteristics, baseline symptoms and driving behaviors of concussed and comparison participants were described using means and frequencies. Neurocognitive test performance between drivers with concussion and comparison drivers was compared using independent samples t-tests.\nTo determine if concussed and comparison participants had different performance in simulating driving, regressions were separately examined for urban and rural drives. As shown in\nTable 1\n, age, gender, race, ethnicity, proportion working and/or in school, past history of motor vehicle collision, number and severity of concussion-related symptoms, and prior citations or warnings were compared to determine whether they significantly differed between concussion and comparison groups. History of driving citations was significantly different between groups and was therefore included as a covariate. No other variables were significantly different.\nTable 1.\nCharacteristics of Study Participants\nCharacteristic\nConcussed\nn\n(%) n\u2009=\u200951\nControls\nn\n(%)\nn\n=\u200951\np\nGender\n0.83\nFemale\n29(56.9)\n30(60.0)\nMale\n20(39.2)\n19(38.0)\nNon-binary\n2(3.9)\n1(2.0)\nAge, mean(SD)\n22.3(2.4)\n22.1(2.7)\n0.69\nSelf-reported race\n0.22\nAIAN\n1(2.0)\n0(0.0)\nAsian/Pacific Islander\n11(21.6)\n18(35.3)\nBlack\n2(3.9)\n1(2.0)\nWhite\n28(54.9)\n27(52.9)\nOther\n4(7.8)\n0(0.0)\nTwo or more races\n5(9.8)\n5(9.8)\nSelf-reported ethnicity\n0.11\nHispanic\n6(11.8)\n1(2.0)\nNon-Hispanic\n45(88.2)\n50(98.0)\nCurrently in school\n27(52.9)\n33(64.7)\n0.23\nCurrently working\n37(72.6)\n33(64.7)\n0.39\nInjury-to-assessment days, mean(SD)\n19.2(15.6)\n\u2013\nPast history of collision\n25(49.0)\n20(39.2)\n0.32\nPrior driving citations\n25(49.0)\n15(29.4)\n0.04\nSCAT5 first visit, mean(SD)\nNumber of symptoms (out of 22)\n12.6(6.9)\n4.1(4.9)\n<0.0001\nSeverity of symptoms (out of 132)\n32.2(27.1)\n7.3(10.4)\n<0.0001\nIf 100% is feeling perfectly normal, what % of normal do you feel?\n81.0(14.5)\n93.8(8.1)\n<0.0001\nOpen in a separate window\nSD, standard deviation.\nThe outcomes of interest associated with the simulating driving performance included the corrected TDRT response time (linear regression) and the TDRT miss count (Poisson regression). These outcome measures reflect driving tasks under the greatest cognitive load. For those who missed a particular TDRT stimulus, the response time was set at 2500\u2009msec, as is standard for missing response time with TDRT. For each set of analyses, we first ran a baseline model that included participant group (concussion or comparison) and driving citations. We ran a second model that included SCAT-5 Total score in addition to the baseline variables. Finally, we ran a model that added in the following neurocognitive variables: NIH Toolbox Fluid Composite uncorrected standard score, trail making test B raw score, and oral symbol digit test raw score. These tests were selected because they measure executive functions, which are skills that can be impacted by concussion and can be associated with driving performance. Log likelihood comparisons were run for each model step. The regressions were done separately for the urban and rural drives. Finally, we ran individual post-hoc correlations between individual neurocognitive variables and TDRT outcomes to examine which neurocognitive tests were most strongly associated with driving performance."

    "Methods": "We conducted secondary analyses using data collected through the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR)-funded TBI Model Systems (TBIMS) program. The TBIMS National Database is a multi-center, prospective cohort study enrolling participants from U.S. civilian inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, and following them into the community. Inclusion criteria for the TBIMS National Database included a moderate-to-severe TBI, as defined by either: posttraumatic amnesia greater than 24\u2009h, loss of consciousness greater than 30\u2009min, Glasgow Coma Scale in the emergency department (ED) less than 13, or any intracranial neuroimaging abnormalities from computed tomography imaging. Included participants were admitted to the ED within 72\u2009h of injury and were at least age 16 at time of injury. Participants in the present study were injured between April 1st, 2010, and November 19th, 2020. We provide a flow diagram of the derivation of our analytic sample (n=\u20097797) inFigure 1.\n\nProcedure\nParticipants were enrolled in the NIDILRR TBI Model Systems study after admission to inpatient rehabilitation for TBI. Following completion of informed or proxy consent, trained research assistants obtained pre-TBI information via interview with the patient and/or family. Acute care and rehabilitation records were abstracted to characterize the TBI (cause of injury, severity) and rehabilitation outcomes (e.g., insurance status, Functional Independence Measure\nTM\non admission and discharge).\n46\nDetailed TBIMS methodology is described elsewhere.\n47\nFollow-up interviews occurred predominantly via telephone. Reliability of TBI Model Systems telephone-based self-report data collection methods is well demonstrated.\n48\nFollow-up interviews are anchored to time of injury and occur 1, 2, and 5 years post-TBI, and every 5 years thereafter. For this study, analyses were constrained to the first 5 years post-injury.\n\nMeasures\nMilitary service exposure\nThe study included participants who sought their clinical care in civilian acute and rehabilitation centers; however, our sample included civilian, veteran, and active-duty military participants. Military service exposure was gathered through three questions: \u201c1) Have you ever served in the military? If yes, 2) how many years of active duty did you serve? 3) Were you ever deployed in a combat zone?\u201d The military variables were added to the TBIMS National Database on April 1, 2010 for new participants enrolled. Participants enrolled prior to that date were not included in the sample. We descriptively characterized those who were current military service members through self-reported pre-injury occupation in the military.\nComorbid health conditions\nParticipants were asked whether they were ever told by a doctor or health professional that they have any of 25 physical and mental conditions that were adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\n49\nFor this study, because of the high number of conditions evaluated, we only included health condition data collected at 1 year post-injury.\nCognition\nCognitive performance was measured using the Brief Test of Adult Cognition over Telephone (BTACT), a validated measure to assess episodic verbal memory, working memory span, verbal fluency, inductive reasoning, and speed of processing. The BTACT has demonstrated feasibility and validity of use in moderate-to-severe TBI populations.\n50\n,\n51\nThe BTACT adapts widely-used neuropsychological measures for use by telephone,\n50\n,\n51\nincluding: Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) immediate and delayed recall,\n52\nDigits Backward,\n53\nCategory Fluency,\n54\nNumber Reasoning,\n55\nand Backward Counting Task.\n55\nStandardized scores were calculated for each of the six individual measures by age, sex, and education relative to a community sample from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) II and Refresher studies,\n56\nand we calculated an overall cognitive composite score and executive function and episodic memory factor scores. BTACT data collected at 1, 2, and 5 years post-injury were used in analyses.\nPsychological health\nDepressive symptom severity (over the past 2 weeks) was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 item (PHQ-9) questionnaire at 1, 2, and 5 years post-TBI. PHQ-9 total scores were calculated by summing each of the PHQ-9 items (range 0-27) with higher scores indicating greater depressive symptoms. Anxiety symptoms were measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7). A GAD-7 total score was calculated by summing each of the GAD-7 items (range 0-21) with higher scores indicating the presence of greater anxiety. Previous studies have documented the validity of the PHQ-9\n6\n,\n57\n,\n58\nand GAD-7\n59\n,\n60\nin TBI populations.\nSuicidal ideation was characterized with the PHQ-9 item which asked participants how often they have \u201cthoughts that you would be better off dead or hurting yourself in some way.\u201d We categorized participants as having current suicidal ideation if they reported having suicidal thoughts at least \u201cSeveral days.\u201d Participants were also asked whether they ever had a suicide attempt in the last year.\n\nCovariates\nSociodemographic factors included age at injury, sex, race (White, Black, Hispanic, Other), education (less than high school [HS], HS+), and primary rehabilitation payor. We considered the following injury characteristics: mechanism of injury, Glasgow Coma Scale score, time to follow motor commands from injury, duration of post-traumatic amnesia (in days), and pre-index TBI (e.g., incident TBI before National Database study enrollment). Finally, we included the following inpatient clinical variables: acute care and inpatient rehabilitation length of stay, cranial surgery status, Functional Independence Measure Motor and Cognitive subscales at inpatient rehabilitation discharge, and residence after rehabilitation discharge.\n\nStatistical analysis\nWe first described our sample by military service history using means and standard deviation (or median and interquartile range as indicated by the skewness of the distribution) for continuous variables, and frequency and percentages for categorical variables.\nFor analyses of health condition data at 1 year post-injury, we conducted a series of multi-variable logistic regression models (i.e., each condition was analyzed separately) evaluating associations between military service history and the prevalence of self-reported health conditions. We adjusted all models for covariates (age at injury, sex, race, education, and time to follow commands) and reported adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each condition comparing those with versus without military service history. Because we conducted separate models for 25 health conditions, we adjusted health condition analyses for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 0.1, calculated using the Benjamini and Hochberg\n61\nmethod from the\np.adjust\nR function.\nFor cognitive and psychological health analyses, we conducted serial cross-sectional analyses of BTACT performance at 1, 2, and 5 years. For each follow-up year, we conducted multi-variable linear regression models for continuous outcomes (overall cognition and factor scores; depressive and anxiety symptom severity) and multi-variable logistic regression for binary outcomes (suicidal ideation and attempt). We adjusted all models for age at injury, sex, race, education, and time to follow commands.\nSensitivity analyses: evaluating features of military exposure\nTo further interrogate the features of military exposure related to health outcomes among persons with TBI, we evaluated the following exposures: 1) military exposure with and without combat deployment; 2) era of military service defined as draft era (before 1973) or post-draft era (1973+); and 3) > 4 years of active-duty military service. A detailed description of methods defining sensitivity analysis variables is provided in the Supplementary Methods. For health conditions, we also reported model-based (e.g., conditional) predicted probabilities by the three military exposures evaluated in the sensitivity analysis. This method, recommended in a recent review on the topic by Johfre and Freese 2022,\n62\ndoes not require the researcher to choose a reference group because predictions are calculated for all exposure categories. This translates to an absolute interpretation of probability of comorbidities by exposure, rather than an odds ratio (i.e., a relative measure compared with no military exposure)."

Children were eligible if they were injured in a vehicular collision causing acceleration-deceleration or blunt impact injuries (passenger in auto, auto and pedestrian, auto and bicycle, all terrain vehicle (ATV), or golf cart accidents).\nChildren with EI with no evidence of concussion were included to assess whether the observed outcomes in the TBI group could be because of pre-injury characteristics or the experience of injury and hospitalization instead of the head injury itself. The control group of healthy typically developing peers was recruited from the community. They were excluded if review of their lifetime medical history indicated a previous serious injury, involvement in a vehicle collision, or a previous head injury.\nParticipants met the following inclusion criteria: (1) proficiency in English or Spanish, (2) no previous history of major neuropsychiatric disorder (intellectual deficiency or low functioning autism spectrum disorder) that would impact the reporting of behavioral outcomes, (3) no metabolic disorders, (4) no previous medically attended TBI, and (5) residence within a 125-mile catchment radius. Criteria 2\u20134 were assessed during screening through a brief interview of the parent.\nBetween September 2014 and June 2016, 241 patients with TBI and 292 with EI were screened for eligibility; 144 and 76 met entry criteria, respectively.\nFigure 1\nshows the patient flow and exclusions through the 7-month follow-up.

The modified ISS (MISS) excludes AIS for head injuries of participants with TBI.\n40\nThese scores were obtained from the hospital trauma registry. Severity of brain injury was measured using the lowest post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores, which measure acute eye, verbal, and motor function.\n41\nThe TBI group was split into mild (\nn\n=\u200947), moderate (\nn\n=\u20096), and severe (\nn\n=\u200921) categories based on GCS scores of 3\u20138, 9\u201312, and 13\u201315, respectively. EI and control participants had no concussive symptoms or history of blunt head trauma.\n\nProcedures\nThis project is part of a larger longitudinal study assessing traumatic stress outcome after pediatric injury. At the baseline visit four to seven weeks after injury, parents completed retrospective ratings to reflect the functioning of the child and family previous to the injury. Parents of children in the control group assessed functioning just previous to study enrollment.\nRetrospective ratings of pre-injury status are standard procedure in studies of outcome after pediatric injury.\n42\nAt the seven-month follow-up, stress reactivity and pubertal development were assessed in the laboratory as detailed below. Both parent- and child-reported psychological health outcomes were obtained to assess post-acute functioning in relation to salivary markers of stress reactivity.\nBefore stress induction, participants completed a neuropsychological test battery for 1.5\u2009h and, apart from water, did not eat, drink, or exercise. Pre- and post-stressor time periods were spent completing questionnaires and resting in a quiet room.\n\nMeasures\nPre-injury covariates.\nMcMaster Family Assessment Device (FAD)\n43\nwas used to assess family functioning in the pre-injury period. The FAD contains 12 items, scored 1\u20134, with a higher cumulative score representing worse family functioning.\nPsychosocial adversity was assessed by trained interviewers and measured the child's pre-injury exposure to specific stressors: (1) divorce or separation of parents, (2) Hollingshead Index score\u2009=\u20094 or 5, (3) three or more children in the child's home, (4) history of abuse or neglect identified by child protective services, (5) criminal conviction of a parent, and (6) parental mental health problems receiving treatment\n44\n. Each item was scored as present or absent and summed.\n\nPsychological health: Parent-report\u2014Baseline and 7-month\nChild Behavior Checklist (CBCL).\n45\nThis was used to characterize externalizing and internalizing behavior using\nt-\nscores normalized for sex and age; higher scores indicate greater symptoms.\nBehavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF).\n46\nEmotional Control subtest evaluated children's ability to regulate emotions and manage behavioral reactivity. Higher scores indicate more symptoms.\n\nPsychological health: Self-report\u2014seven-month\nWe selected child-reported subtests that evaluated self-perceived anxiety, depression, and emotional problems to align with parent-reported outcomes.\nScreen for Child Anxiety and Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED).\nGeneral Anxiety and Social Phobia subtests were selected because they discriminate between children with other anxiety disorders.\n47\nChildren's Depression Inventory (CDI).\n48\nThe Negative Mood with Physical Symptoms and Emotional Problems factors were selected to provide measures of depressed mood with associated somatic symptoms and more generalized mood and self-esteem problems.\nPubertal Development Scale.\n49\nCompleted by children and parents to assess pubertal status at seven months to rate changes in height, body hair, and skin. Each item scale was converted into a five-point scale like Tanner staging.\n50\nThese converted items were then averaged to obtain a consensus score for pubertal status ranging from pre-pubertal (1) to post-pubertal (5).\n\nPsychosocial stress reactivity and salivary analytes\nTrier Social Stress Test for Children (TSST-C).\n51\n,\n52\nThe TSST-C is a well- established measure of reactivity to psychosocial evaluative stress in children and was administered using standard procedures (see description in\n30\n).\nChildren performed oral speaking and serial subtraction tasks while being videotaped in front of an expert panel wearing white coats. They were given no feedback on oral speaking and were instructed to try to perform better than other children. If they made an error on serial subtraction, they were corrected and asked to begin again.\nSaliva samples were collected at four time intervals after established procedures.\n53\nSaliva was collected with 1\n\u00d7\n4\u2009cm polyolefin swabs that were placed under the tongue for 2\u2009min. Two pre-stressor samples were collected 20 minutes before and immediately before the TSST-C.\nBecause of differing kinetic response profiles of the analytes, post-stressor samples were collected directly after the task (sAA only), 20\u2009min after (both analytes), and 40\u2009min after (cortisol only). The samples were then frozen at -20\u00b0C and then transported to the Institute for Interdisciplinary Salivary Bioscience.\nThe samples were assayed in duplicate for cortisol using an enzyme immunoassay (Salimetrics, LLC, Carlsbad, CA), without modification to the manufacturer's protocol. The test volume was 25\u2009\u03bcL, range of calibrators from 0.01 to 3.0\u2009\u03bcg/dL, and lower limit of sensitivity was 0.007\u2009\u03bcg/dL. Samples were assayed for sAA using a commercially available assay enzyme kit (Salimetrics LLC, Carlsbad, CA). Cortisol was expressed in units of \u03bcg/dL, and sAA was expressed in units of U/mL. The intraassay coefficient of variation was on average 10%, and the inter-assay coefficient of variation was on average 15%.\nCortisol and sAA raw value distribution were examined at each time interval. Extreme values that were 2.5 standard deviations (SDs) above the mean were winsorized, and reassigned at 2.5 SD. From each of the four collection times, area under the curve (AUC) values were calculated in relation to ground (AUCg) to measure the total secretion and in relation to increase (AUCinc) to assess change associated with the stressor.\n54\n\nStatistical approach\nAnalyses included participants with pre-injury parent ratings and seven-month follow-up salivary samples and parent-reported and child self-reported outcomes. After inspection of distributions, demographic characteristics, candidate predictor variables, and psychosocial outcomes were examined by group using parametric or nonparametric tests with Bonferroni\npost hoc\ncomparisons across the TBI, EI, and control groups.\nPost hoc\nchi square analyses were completed for the difference of seven month\u2014baseline scores of CBCL and BRIEF measures to assess changes in distribution of\nt-\nscores. Difference scores were categorized as decreased (\u00b1 .5 SD), no change (-.5 to .5 SD), and increased (> 3 SD). The cut point of .5 SD was selected to reflect a small to moderate effect size.\nPre-injury and follow-up behavioral and executive functioning outcomes, and cortisol and sAA AUCinc values, were compared across groups using either general linear models or nonparametric tests depending on normality and unequal variances.\nBecause of extreme outliers, the following data points were winsorized at 2.5 standard deviations: salivary raw data (cortisol; 9 points/8 patients; sAA 11 points/5 patients). Spearman correlation analysis examined the relation of demographic, family functioning, and salivary AUCinc values with seven-month outcomes.\nMulti-variable general linear models were used to evaluate main effects of age at injury, pubertal status, sex, pre-injury family functioning, group (TBI, EI, control), and salivary AUCinc values for cortisol and sAA on parent- and child-reported outcomes.\nPotential two-way and three-way interactions of group, sex, and pubertal status with AUCinc values were examined and non-significant interaction terms were trimmed from each model. Main effects were retained irrespective of significance. Models testing parent-reported outcomes controlled for pre-injury parent ratings.\nAll tests were two-tailed with significance of alpha\u2009=\u20090.05. Significant interaction effects including group were followed by planned comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure with \u03b1\u2009=\u2009.005/3. For analyses yielding significant group\n\u00d7\nsex interaction effects, the correction was applied separately for each sex."

    "Methods": "Study and group design\nThe study was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (Baltimore, MD) and in compliance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines. Surgeries were conducted at the postnatal Days 10-11 (PND) in Sprague Dawley rats. Only male pups were used in this study. Rats were randomly assigned to four different treatment groups: Na\u00efve controls (\nn\n=\u200914), Anesthesia only group (\nn\n=\u200912), Craniotomy only group (\nn\n=\u200917), and TBI (\nn\n=\u200917). The study design is shown in\nFigure 1\n. After weaning from dams, rats were housed in standard rat cages and kept in groups of three per cage for up to 2 months of age, and, later, in groups of two per cage. After the end of behavioral testing, rats were anesthetized, sacrificed and their brains harvested. Detailed methods and procedures can be found in the Supplementary Methods.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nTimeline of experimental procedures. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) was performed on the left hemisphere (see details in the \u201cMethods\u201d section) at post-natal Day 10 (PND 10). To assess for possible TBI induced motor deficits, Foot Fault and Gait Analysis tests were performed at PND 25-26 and PND 27-P30, respectively. Novel object recognition was conducted at PND 40-50 to test recognition memory. Then, a number of water maze protocols were employed to test for spatial reference memory as well as episodic-like and working memory at PND 65-100. Finally, possible alterations in social interactions were tested at PND 120-140 using social recognition and social motivation tasks. Color image is available online.\n\nControlled cortical impact (CCI) injury\nTBI was performed using a controlled cortical impact (CCI) device, as previously described.\n10-12\nInjury was produced using a 3-mm metal impactor tip with a depth of penetration of 1.5\u2009mm, at velocity of 5.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\u2009m/sec, and a duration of deformation of 50\u2009msec. At the completion of surgery, isoflurane was discontinued. When the rats emerged from anesthesia, they were returned to their cages with their littermates and mother.\nThe rats assigned to the Craniotomy group underwent identical surgeries, with the exclusion of the CCI. The rats assigned to the Anesthesia group received isoflurane for the same length of time as the TBI and Craniotomy groups (30\u2009min) without any surgical interventions. Representative brain images from each of the groups are presented in\nSupplementary Figure S1\ndemonstrating the extent of brain damage in the TBI group and preserved brain tissue in the Craniotomy group, as expected from our previous studies.\n10-12\n\nBehavioral testing\nBehavioral testing started when rats reached 25 days of age in the order described below (\nFig. 1\n). The battery of tasks included tests to access multiple domains affected in children with TBI: locomotor function and coordination, different types of learning and memory, and social interactions (social recognition and social motivation). ANY-maze software (Stoelting Co, Wood Dale, IL) was used to record data in all tasks unless noted otherwise.\n\nFoot fault test\nThe test was conducted at PND 25-26, 2 weeks after surgery. Animals were placed on an elevated, horizontal metal grid with a mirror underneath for video recording of the paw placement. The number of foot slips for each limb over 5\u2009min was analyzed during video playback.\n\nGait analysis\nA runway test was conducted at PND 27-33 using a 1\u2009m long enclosed glass runway using Gait Scan software (Clever Sys, Reston, VA). The following parameters were analyzed: foot pressure, foot angles, run speed and distance, step base, step length, and whole-body length.\n\nNovel object recognition (NOR)\nNOR test was conducted at PND 40-50. Rats were habituated to the box (60\u2009\u00d7\u200960\u2009cm) twice a day 10\u2009min each for 2 consecutive days. In Session 1, two similar objects from LEGO\n\u00ae\nwere placed in the box and rats were allowed to investigate the objects for 5\u2009min. On the next day, session 2 was conducted when one of the objects was replaced with a new one, and rats were allowed to investigate the objects for 5\u2009min.\n\nMorris water maze\nMorris water maze tasks were performed at PND 65-100 as described before\n13\nwith modifications (see the Supplementary Methods for detailed descriptions of the protocols).\nPlatform and straight swim pre-training\nRats were first pre-trained in a straight swim task to familiarize them with procedural aspects of testing in the water maze, to decrease effects of stress from swimming and to reveal possible changes in motor abilities that could interfere with cognitive testing. One rat from the Anesthesia group was excluded due to slow swimming related to a recent leg injury. The physical health of this rat was normal for all preceding tasks; therefore, it was not excluded from the analyses of those tasks. No treatment-related differences were observed in this task (data not shown).\nClassic Morris water maze (MWM) protocol\nLearning in this task results in formation of long-lasting spatial reference memory.\n13\n,\n14\nThe duration of the task was 2 days. For each trial, the rat was placed in a 200-cm pool in a randomly predetermined quadrant other than the quadrant containing the platform. Inter-trial intervals were approximately 20\u2009min. Training trials were 60\u2009sec long and probe trials were 35-45\u2009sec long. At the end of the probe trials, the collapsed platform was returned to its raised position to maintain the same response-reinforcement contingency as in the platform trials.\n15\n,\n16\nThe probe trials conducted at the beginning and the end of a daily session were used to assess memory following short (30\u2009min) and long delays (\u223c24\u2009h).\nRepeated reversals in water maze (MWM-Reversals)\nIn contrast to the reference memory task (MWM), the reversal task challenged episodic-like memory as rats need to keep changing their memory representation for the environment by discriminating the information by \u201cwhat,\u201d \u201cwhere,\u201d and \u201cwhen\u201d categories.\n14\n,\n17\n,\n18\nThis task was performed similarly to the MWM except the platform location was changed daily for three consecutive days.\nRadial Water Maze (RWM)\nAfter completion of the MWM-Reversals task, a radial maze enclosure was placed into the same pool and the rats were required to find the hidden platform in one of the eight arms of the Radial Water Maze. Similar to the repeated reversals, the position of the platform was changed daily. For 4 days, each rat performed six 90\u2009sec-long trials started in a randomly predetermined arm.\nRadial Water Maze with cued and hidden platform\nAfter the RWM task, rats were trained for 2 additional days in a more challenging protocol. In addition to trials with a hidden platform (as in the previous stage of RWM), trials in which the position of platform was prompted by a highly visible cue were introduced. Positions of the cued platform were changed between each trial. Eight daily trials switched between two types of trials: from a trial with the cued platform to a trial with the hidden platform. The position of a hidden platform was changed daily.\n\nSocial interaction testing\nSocial recognition\nAt PND 120-130, social recognition memory was tested based on the habituation-dishabituation protocol.\n19\n,\n20\nIn an orientation trial, rats were placed in an open field (40\u2009\u00d7\u200960\u2009cm) and allowed to explore the new environment for 5\u2009min. Then, three habituation trials were conducted in which the test rat was introduced to the same young male pup (PND 25) and allowed to interact for 2\u2009min per trial. In the fourth dishabituation trial, the test rat was introduced to a novel PND 25 male rat pup with an expectation of activation in social interactions.\nThree-chamber social motivation test\nSocial motivation\n20\n,\n21\nwas tested at PND 130-140. In an orientation trial, a test rat was placed in the middle part of a social motivation chamber (50\u2009\u00d7\u200980\u2009cm) and allowed to explore the new environment for 10\u2009min. Trial 1 and 2 represented the stage of habituation when a new rat pup (PND 25) was placed in one of the containers repeatedly, and the test rat was allowed to investigate for 5\u2009min per trial. Trial 3 represented the stage of discrimination when yet another pup was placed in the second container, and the test rat could explore both pups simultaneously for another 5\u2009min.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe data were analyzed using the statistical package STATISTICA 13 (TIBCO Software Inc., Palo Alto, CA) and a minimal level of significance\np\n<\u20090.05. The data were analyzed using mixed design analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Treatment (Na\u00efve, Anesthesia, Craniotomy, TBI) as an independent factor and repeated measure(s) (RM; trials, blocks, arms, etc.). The least significant difference\npost hoc\ntest was applied to significant Treatment or Treatment\u2009\u00d7\u2009RM interactions to evaluate differences between four sets of means: Na\u00efve versus Anesthesia; Na\u00efve versus Craniotomy; Na\u00efve versus TBI; and Craniotomy versus TBI. Two-tailed t-test was used to analyze differences from chance levels. The details of statistical results including F, df, and\npost hoc\ntests are presented in\nSupplementary Tables S1\n-\nS6\n. Data in figures represent means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the means unless otherwise noted."

    "Methods": "This is a retrospective pre-clinical study. The data set used consisted of 1203 mice retrieved from 58 different experiments conducted at the Mannix-Meehan Lab at Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts, USA, some of which have been previously published independently.10\u201318All animals were C57BL male mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, USA). They were housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room with a 12\u2009h light\u2013dark cycle and fedad libitum. All experiments were approved by the Boston Children's Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and complied with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\nTBI weight drop model\nA modified weight drop model featuring rotational acceleration, which has been described previously for a subgroup of the data set,\n13\nwas used in this study. All animals were anesthetized for 45\u2009sec with 4% isoflurane in oxygen until fully unconscious. The mice were placed on a delicate tissue (Kimwipe; Kimberly-Clark, Irving, Texas, USA) and grasped by the tail. The heads of the mice were then placed underneath tubes of varying heights such that the end of the tube was centered between and slightly in front of the ears, which approximates bregma. Finally, a 54\u2009g metal bolt was dropped through the tube to injure the TBI mice (\nn\n=\u2009675), while the sham (\nn\n=\u2009528) group received comparable isoflurane exposure but did not receive the injury. The impact resulted in rotational acceleration of the animal through the Kimwipe, generating various degrees of diffuse axonal injury. In the data set analyzed in this study, a variety of injury paradigms were used, based on the height of the weight drop, and number of injuries (ranging from 0 to 13, including 1) over a given time period and age at injury (\nTable 1\n). The injury severity was assessed using the time of loss of consciousness.\nTable 1.\nCharacteristics of the Mice\nCharacteristic\nTBI (\nn\n=\u2009675)\nSham (\nn\n=\u2009528)\nAll (\nn\n=\u20091203)\nHeight of weight drop [inch]\n0\n0\n528\n528\n28\n218\n0\n218\n42\n319\n0\n319\n46\n35\n0\n35\n50\n63\n0\n63\n60\n40\n0\n40\nNumber of TBI/shams over given time period\n1 TBI/sham\n116\n76\n192\n2 TBI/shams during 1 day\n28\n6\n34\n4 TBI/shams during 4 days\n56\n24\n80\n5 TBI/shams, total\n373\n338\n711\n5 TBI/shams during 5 days\n301\n266\n567\n5 TBI/shams during 5 weeks\n24\n24\n48\n5 TBI/shams during 10 weeks\n24\n24\n48\n5 TBI/shams during 5 months\n24\n24\n48\n7 TBI/shams during 9 days\n102\n76\n178\n6-13 TBI/shams during 5 days\n0\n8\n8\nAge at TBI/sham [weeks]\n5\n54\n47\n101\n8\n563\n445\n1008\n12\n35\n12\n47\n28\n23\n24\n47\nTreatment and method of delivery\nExternal stimulus: Flicker\n30\n30\n60\nGenetic:\n26\n26\n52\nTau heterozygous knockout\n14\n14\n28\nTau homozygous knockout\n12\n12\n24\nHousing\n100\n61\n161\nEnrichment\n88\n61\n149\nSingle housing\n12\n0\n12\nIntraperitoneal injection\n181\n55\n236\nCis\nP-tau\n38\n9\n47\nCRP\n6\n0\n6\nMemantine\n46\n19\n65\nIgG\n33\n10\n43\nSaline\n58\n17\n75\nIntranasal delivery\n35\n12\n47\nAnti-CD3\n17\n6\n23\nIgG\n18\n6\n24\nOral (via water)\n48\n49\n97\nMemantine\n25\n24\n49\nSaline\n23\n25\n48\nNo treatment\n255\n295\n550\nOpen in a separate window\nCD3, cluster of differentiation 3; CRP, C-reactive protein; IgG, immunoglobulin G; TBI/sham, either a traumatic brain injury (TBI) or a sham injury (anesthesia without TBI).\n\nA note on terminology: \u201cTBI\u201d and \u201csham\u201d\nIn subsequent text, figures, and tables, the terms \u201cTBI\u201d and \u201csham\u201d are used as group terms for the action of either only anesthetizing (sham) or both anesthetizing and administering a TBI (TBI) to a mouse.\n\nTreatments\nMice were either exposed to a treatment (\nn\n=\u2009463), to vehicle control (\nn\n=\u2009190), or to no treatment (\nn\n=\u2009550).

Notably, no mouse was exposed to all behavioral tests, and no behavioral test was measured in all mice. The fraction of available data for each behavioral outcome, as well as the cumulative fraction, defined as the fraction of mice that were tested both for the specified behavioral outcome and for all outcomes with higher availability, is presented in\nFigure 1B\n. The combination with most variables (15 behavioral outcomes; 180 TBI and 121 sham mice) was subsequently used when complete-case data were required.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nDistribution of available behavioral outcome data.\n(A)\nTile plot of missing and available data. Each behavioral outcome measured at a particular time point for every mouse was plotted as \u201cmissing\u201d or \u201cavailable,\u201d depending on whether the behavioral outcome had been tested on the mouse. The majority of tiles were missing, indicating that the data were sparse. No behavioral outcome was tested on all mice, and no mouse was tested for all behavioral outcomes. Some mice, but not all, were tested for certain outcomes at multiple time points.\n(B)\nPoint plot of available fractions, sorted in decreasing order. For each behavioral outcome, the number of mice and the fraction of mice tested was plotted (\u201cavailable fraction\u201d). After they were ordered in decreasing order, the number of mice and fraction of mice tested for the cumulative set of behavioral outcomes up until the particular outcome were plotted (\u201ccumulative fraction\u201d). The behavioral outcomes with highest fractions were tested on approximately half of the mice, whereas most outcomes were tested on <10% of mice. Only 15 behavioral outcomes had a cumulative fraction >0 (vertical dashed line).

For week 0, loss of consciousness was recorded directly after injury, whereas other behavioral outcomes were recorded later during the week.\nb\nRedundant variables, with no degree of freedom.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll analyses were performed in R, version 4.0.3.\n23\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA). In order to visualize several behavioral outcomes simultaneously, PCA was used. PCA can reduce the number of dimensions (i.e., behavioral outcomes) to a smaller set of dimensions that account for a large fraction of explained variance. The package FactoMineR\n24\nwas used for calculations and plotting. All variables were scaled to unit variance, and outliers more than five standard deviations from the mean were omitted. Because PCA requires complete-case data, all analyses were performed on the first 15 behavioral outcomes in\nFigure 1B\n. First, PCA was used to visualize differences in experiments by plotting mice with no TBI and no treatment, and then coloring the mice in the new dimensions after either their experiment or total period of administered anesthesia. Ellipses of one standard deviation (68%) confidence intervals were drawn for all color groups as orientation. This could show whether inter-experiment variability could be attributed to differences in number of anesthetic events. Second, PCA was used to visualize the information content of behavioral tests. This was done by first calculating the principal components of all mice, and then plotting the correlations between the behavioral outcomes and the principal components in a heatmap. The package pheatmap\n25\nwas used for visualization. Dendrograms were calculated using complete-linkage clustering. In order to visualize the inter-relation of behavioral tests and their information content, behavioral outcomes were categorized according to whether higher values represent good or bad outcomes as well as whether the test group was anxiety/depression, cognitive deficit, or motor deficit.\nLogistical model\nIn order to determine how well behavioral tests can discriminate between injured and uninjured animals, logistical regression was used as a supervised classifier. Because the accuracy of classification depends on a threshold value, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used as the performance measure because of its independence of the threshold.\n9\nA performance measure is a quantification of the ability of a model to predict a response correctly.\n9\nThe AUC is an aggregated measure of the sensitivity and specificity for all thresholds.\n9\nHigher AUC indicates that the model predicts injury well.\n9\nThe range of AUC is from 0 to 1, where AUC\u2009=\u20090.5 when the model is equivalent to random chance.\n9\nBootstrapping with 25 iterations was used to generate multiple data sets, from which the mean AUC and its standard deviation were recorded. This maximized use of the limited data points, while still allowing for validation across the iterations. For completeness, the data were also run using 10-fold cross- validation, with the results displayed in the accompanying Shiny\n26\napplication. In order to avoid overfitting, a minimum of 10 mice per variable were required for each model to be run. To account for inter-experiment variability, all models were adjusted for number of TBI/shams. Calculations were done using the package caret.\n27\nBest model selection algorithm\nTo find the best model, the following algorithm was used: All behavioral outcomes at level 3 were grouped by week of testing (\nTable 4\n). For each group of level 3 behavioral outcomes at a certain week (e.g. Morris water maze: hidden trials 1\u20135: week 17 [MWM:H1:W17\u2013MWM:H5:W17]), AUC was computed for all possible combinations of behavioral tests. The best combination was recorded. If the best AUC minus one standard deviation of AUC of this group was >0.75, the best combination qualified for further analysis in step 2. Qualified combinations were labeled as the best models for level 3. All qualified models from best models for level 3 were candidates to be included at level 2. For each level 2 behavioral outcome (e.g,. all MWMs), all qualified variables from level 3 were selected from the data. Because of the high degree of missingness, where there were no mice undergoing all tests, all variables could not be included simultaneously. Therefore, the combination with the highest possible number of variables was included and labeled as the maximum model. From the maximum models, the best combinations were recorded as the best models for level 2. All qualified models from best models for level 2 were candidates to be included at level 1. The selection algorithm for best models for level 1 was analogous to that previously explained for level 2.\nTable 4.\nOverview of the Behavioral Outcomes\nBehavioral outcome\nDetails\nPrevious publications of this data\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nCognitive\nMorris water maze (MWM)\nHidden (H)\nMice were placed in a water tank with a hidden platform that they could mount to rest.

Much time spent at the novel object or location is associated with good working memory.\n29\n16\nLocation (L)\nY-maze (YM)\nMice were placed in the center of a Y-shaped container with three identical arms oriented at 120 degree angles. A large alternation between arms is associated with good spatial working memory.\n30\n\u2014\nAnxiety/\ndepression\nElevated plus maze (EPM)\nMice were placed in the center of a platform with two open and two closed (walled) arms. More time spent in the open arms is associated with lower levels of anxiety.\n31\n11\n,\n12\n,\n15\n,\n17\n,\n18\nOpen field test (OF)\nSquare \u2014 position (SP)\nMice were placed in either circular (C) or square (S) opaque containers, facing a wall. Position (P) and distance (D) travelled were recorded. More time spent in the central areas of the open field is associated with low levels of anxiety.\n32\n11\n,\n15\n,\n18\nSquare \u2014 distance (SD)\nCircle \u2014 position (C)\nForced swim test (FST)\nMice were placed in a water-filled glass container (\u00d8 18\u2009cm). More time spent immobile is associated with depressant-like behavior.\n33\n15\nLight-dark box (LDB)\nMice were placed in a dark chamber, connected to a brightly lit box. Less locomotor activity is associated with anxiety-like behavior.\n34\n\u2014\nTail suspension test (TST)\nMice were suspended by the tail. More time spent immobile is associated with depressant-like behavior.\n35\n\u2014\nSucrose preference test (SPT)\nMice were placed in a cage with two sipper tubes, one of which contained normal drinking water and the other with 2% sucrose added. Lower intake of sucrose solution is associated with depressant-like behavior.\n36\n\u2014\nMotor\nRotarod (Rota)\nMice were trained by being placed on the rotating drum (4\u2009rpm). Testing was performed the following days. Mice were placed on the rotating drum (4\u2009rpm) for 10\u2009sec to acclimate, after which the rod was accelerated by 0.1\u2009rpm/sec. Shorter latency to fall is associated with greater neurological deficit.\n37\n11\n,\n15\n,\n16\n,\n18\nOpen in a separate window\nk-means clustering\nTo explore the data structure of combinations of behavioral outcomes, k-means clustering was used. Compared with the supervised learning of logistical regression, k-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm.\n9\nTherefore, it finds clusters in the data, entirely based on the behavioral outcomes (without training on injury data). The algorithm partitions the data into k non-overlapping clusters.\n9\nThe adjusted Rand index (ARI), which is an adjusted fraction of correct clustering, was used as the performance measure.\n38\nIf the clusters are more similar to the true division between injured and uninjured animals, the ARI is higher. The ARI is bounded above at 1, and an ARI of 0 occurs at random chance.\n38\nThe same complete-case data set as in the aforementioned PCA was used. All combinations of behavioral outcomes included were run through the algorithm, with from 1 to 15 variables in each model. All variables were scaled to unit variance, and outliers more than five standard deviations from the mean were omitted. Calculations were done using the stats package in base R.\n39\nThe Euclidean metric and the algorithm of Hartigan and Wong\n40\nwas used. Visual analysis of the feature distribution showed generally convex distributions (\nSupplementary Figures\n).\nLinear model\nTo determine whether multiple heterogeneous experiments can predict outcome better than single homogenous experiments, linear regression, a supervised learning algorithm, was used. The performance measure was the root-mean-square error (RMSE) divided by the standard deviation of the behavioral outcome data (standardized RMSE). If the model predicts outcome well, the RMSE is lower. The dependent variable chosen to investigate was MWM:H4:W2; a pilot study not shown indicated a similar pattern for most behavioral outcomes. Independent variables were loss of consciousness after the first TBI/sham, number of TBIs/sham exposures, and treatment. For each number of studies to be included (ranging from 1 to 32), 25 random combinations of studies were selected, and for each of these, bootstrapping was used with 10 iterations. Calculations were done using the package caret.\n27\nAll outliers more than five standard deviations from the mean were omitted prior to calculations.\n\nEthical approval\nAll experiments were approved by the Boston Children's Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and complied with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Ethical permit has been approved under the following review numbers: 17-09-3532R, 18-07-2754R, 18-12-3851R, 19-12-4110R*, 20-04-4163R, and 20-08-4251R. The experiments presented have not primarily been used for the outlined analysis, but rather were retrospectively collected from materials that have been or will be published separately. In terms of the 3R principle\n41\n\u2013 replace, refine, and reduce animal experiments \u2013 this study is a way to refine the original data by maximizing output of already recorded data. Its results might be used to refine future animal experiments."

    "Methods": "Participants\nIn this single-center observational study, we recruited adult (age 18 or older) patients with non-penetrating TBI who required hospitalization post-injury. Patients were enrolled at the time of hospital admission. Patients were excluded for a history of pre-existing serious neurological or psychiatric disorder, comorbid disabling condition limiting outcome assessment, current pregnancy, if they were incarcerated, had low MRI image quality, or were under the age of 18. Patients with focal intraparenchymal lesions exceeding 50\u2009cm\n3\nwere also excluded.\n11\n,\n12\nPatients underwent brain MRI at 2 weeks and 6 months post-injury. We also enrolled healthy control subjects recruited from the general population via local advertisement with no history of TBI, pre-existing disabling neurological or psychiatric disorder, or current pregnancy.\nHealthy controls underwent a single brain MRI. Demographic information, medical history, admission injury characteristics, and other clinical information were collected from the medical record. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nNeuropsychological assessment\nPatients underwent neuropsychological assessment by trained research personnel, who were blind to imaging findings. Assessments were performed on the same day as the MRI at approximately 2 weeks and 6 months post-injury. Neuropsychological function was assessed across three domains: processing speed assessed with the Processing Speed Index from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV\n13\n; verbal learning by Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT)\n14\n; and executive functioning by the Trail Making Test-Parts A and B.\n15\nThe assessment of neuropsychological outcome mirrored those of the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) study.\n\nImage acquisition\nBrain MRIs were performed on a 3 Tesla scanner (Siemens Prisma) using a product 32-channel head coil. Structural imaging included a sagittal T1-weighted magnetization-prepared 180 degrees radio-frequency pulses and rapid gradient-echo (repetition time [TR]\u2009=\u20092.3\u2009sec, echo time [TE]\u2009=\u20092.94\u2009msec, inversion time [TI]\u2009=\u2009900\u2009msec, FA\u2009=\u20099\u00b0, resolution\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm). Whole brain diffusion MRI (dMRI) was performed with an echo planar sequence with FA 90\u00b0 and resolution\u2009=\u20092.4\u2009\u00d7\u20092.4\u2009\u00d7\u20092.4\u2009mm (b-value\u2009=\u20091000\u2009sec/mm\n2\n, 64 diffusion directions, TR 2.9\u2009sec, TE 94\u2009msec). Separately, 14 images with b-value\u2009=\u20090\u2009sec/mm\n2\nwith reverse phase encoding were acquired.\n\nImage processing\nStructural MRI and dMRI data were visually inspected for artifacts before preprocessing. T1-weighted images were bias corrected using the N4BiasCorrection tool from ANTs,\n16\nfollowed by brain extraction using a multi-atlas segmentation tool, MUSE.\n17\nDiffusion MRI data was preprocessed in three steps. First, local-PCA denoising\n18\nas implemented in MATLAB 2021a (MathWorks, Natick, MA); followed by motion and distortion correction using the topup and eddy tools in FSL\n19\n; then, bias field correction using N4BiasCorrection from ANTs. A tensor model\n4\nwas fit to the data in DIPY.\n20\nWe used FERNET (Freewater EstimatoR using iNtErpolated iniTialization),\n8\na recent method for free water correction in clinically acquired DTI data, to estimate the free water-volume fraction or VF and free water-corrected FA (fw-FA). FERNET has been validated using simulated data, healthy control data, and clinical data from patients with TBI and brain tumors.\n8\n,\n11\nUsing the deformable SyN registration algorithm from ANTs,\n21\nthe data were registered to the JHU-MNI-ss (Eve) template.\n22\nTwo example cases are shown in\nFigure 1\n. Mean values of VF and fw-FA were calculated in 90 ROIs of the Eve white matter parcellation. Fornix and tapetum were excluded because of their small size and proximity to the ventricles. For each of the 90 ROIs, we then regressed out age from the mean value of VF and fw-FA in each ROI using the following method: Using linear regression we fit a model using only observations from controls with age as the independent variable and the mean of the respective DTI variable (e.g., VF) as the dependent variable. Age was then regressed out for both patients and controls using the residuals (X\nr\ni\n) from the above regression.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nRepresentative cases (\nA\nand\nB\n) showing the white matter free water volume fraction (VF) map overlaid on the T1-weighted image of two participants with TBI (A: 60-year-old man; B: 58-year-old man) scanned 2 weeks post-injury. The T1-weighted images are registered to the JHU-MNI-ss (Eve) template. The color bar shows the free water VF ranging from 0-1 with warmer colors corresponding to high free water VF. Note the areas of high VF around areas bordered by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; i.e., ventricles, CSF cisterns) where partial volume effects are expected.\n\nPatient-specific summary anomaly score of white matter microstructure\nWe next derived a patient-specific summary anomaly score (SAS). SAS is an age-corrected measure of whole brain white matter microstructural anomaly referenced to a cohort of healthy controls. SAS was derived separately for VF and fw-FA for each control (from our cohort) and at each time-point for each patient using the Mahalanobis distance, a multi-variate generalization of the z-score:\nM\n=\ns\n\u2212\n\u03bc\nT\n\u00d7\nC\n\u2212\n1\n\u00d7\ns\n\u2212\n\u03bc\nwhere s\u2009=\u2009[X\nr\n1\n, X\nr\n2\n\u2026 X\nr\n90\n] is a 90x1 vector containing the residuals of the age-regressed DTI variable (X\nr\ni\n) for each ROI for the participant; \u03bc is a 90x1 vector of mean X\nr\nof each ROI in the healthy controls; and C is the covariance matrix between ROIs across the control population. Thus, for each patient and control we calculated M, the Mahalanobis distance-based SAS for each dMRI measure: VF and fw-FA. This is a validated method for describing whole brain abnormalities in TBI and is described in more detail elsewhere.\n9\n,\n11\nCalculation of Mahalanobis distance requires that the number of reference observations (i.e., control subjects) exceed the number of variables (i.e., ROIs). Since the number of ROIs in the Eve white matter parcellation (90) is larger than the number of controls in our cohort (36), we additionally used DTI data from 77 control subjects enrolled in the TRACK-TBI study [mean age (standard deviation) of 39 (15.0); 51 men (66%)] to increase the size of the reference cohort used for calculation of SAS to 113. The TRACK-TBI controls were used only as a reference for calculation of SAS for patients and controls enrolled at our center and we did not calculate SAS for participants from TRACK-TBI nor conduct any subsequent analyses using their data. To mitigate potential confounds from use of multi-site data, dMRI data from TRACK-TBI were harmonized with our cohort using ComBat,\n23\na batch effect removal technique that removes acquisition and processing differences while retaining the effects of biology (e.g., age, sex, group). To assess the effectiveness of ComBat, we fit linear mixed effects models separately using unharmonized (pre-ComBat) and harmonized (post-ComBat) DTI data. We modeled the mean DTI measurement (VF and fw-FA separately in different models) in each ROI as the dependent variable with fixed effects for study site, age, sex, and group (i.e., TBI vs. control) with a random intercept for participant. We compared this model to one without a term for site effects and assessed its significance by calculating the\nF\n-statistic. Further details on the comparison between pre- and post-ComBat harmonized DTI variables are presented in\nSupplementary Figure S1\n.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData was assessed visually and via the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality. As SAS was not normally distributed, we utilized the nonparametric Mann Whitney U test for comparisons between patients and controls and the Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for comparison of SAS from 2 weeks to 6 months post-injury. Chi-squared or Fisher's exact test were used for categorical data where appropriate. We assessed the relationship between neuropsychological functioning and SAS using Spearman's rank correlation. Our primary hypothesis was that 2-week SAS is associated with 6-month neuropsychological outcomes. Significance for these comparisons was set at\np\n=\u20090.01 (0.05/5) after Bonferroni correction for five comparisons. Our secondary hypothesis was that SAS correlated with neuropsychological outcomes, cross-sectionally. These results are presented without correction for multiple comparisons (i.e.,\np\n<\u20090.05 is considered statistically significant). We repeated the above analyses including only patients with mild TBI (i.e., Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score 13-15) to ensure that findings were not driven by patients with more severe injury (i.e., those with moderate or severe TBI). To determine if results were robust to outliers, we fit robust linear models using bisquare regression. All analyses were carried out using MATLAB 2022a (MathWorks, Natick, MA)."

    "Methods": "Rigorous experimental design in animal research\nThe protocol for use of animals was approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Henry Ford Health. We applied the rigorous experimental design to this pre-clinical study as described in our previous TBI studies.\n13\n,\n14\nTBI animals were randomized to receive different treatments with vehicle as a treatment control. The investigators were blinded to perform functional tests and collect histological data in this study.\n\nIsolation and characterization of Ago2 KD MSC-sEVs\nThe method of human bone marrow MSC (hMSC) culture and sEV isolation was employed according to our published protocol (see detailed methods in\nSupplementary Appendix S1\n).\n15\nBriefly, to examine the role of Ago2 in the therapeutic beneficial effects of MSC-sEVs in TBI, we generated sEVs from hMSCs (Theradigm, Bethesda, MD, USA) with Ago2-KD at the fifth passage. hMSCs were transfected with a lentiviral vector-based short hair RNA (shRNA) against Ago2 (shAgo2-MSC, V3SH11240-224948440, Horizon) or a vector carrying scramble control shRNA (Scr-MSC, VSH11583, Horizon) by means of electroporation.\n16\nWhen the hMSCs reached 80% confluence, sEV-depleted medium was used to replace conventional culture medium and the hMSCs were cultured for 2 days.\n9\nThe culture medium (CM) was collected from cultured hMSCs and passed through a 0.22-\u03bcm filter (Millipore, CA, USA) to remove large cellular debris and floating/dead cells. The filtered medium was centrifuged at 10,000\u2009\u00d7\ng\nfor 30\u2009min. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000\u2009\u00d7\ng\nfor 3\u2009h and the pellet was collected as sEVs.\n16\nThe pellet was diluted with sterilized phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) for characterization and experimental use.\nTo verify the particles we collected from MSC CM were sEVs, we characterized them by means of nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and western blots including sEV-contained proteins (Alix, Hsp70, actin, CD63) according to MISEV2018,\n17\nand endoplasmic reticulum marker protein calnexin according to our published method.\n18\nsEV protein levels were measured with the Bicinchoninic Acid Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Total RNAs were isolated with the Qiagen Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). miRNAs after reverse transcription were amplified with the TaqMan miRNA Assay (Applied Biosystems), which is specific for mature miRNA sequences. sEV miRNAs were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase reaction (RT-PCR) according to our previous protocol (see detailed methods in\nSupplementary Appendix S1\n).\n16\nAnalysis of gene expression was carried out by the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method.\n19\n\nExperimental TBI model\nThe TBI model used in the this study is a controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury,\n20\nas described in our previous study.\n21\nIn brief, young rats (Wistar, male, 2\u20133 months of age) purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, USA) were anesthetized intraperitoneally (ip) with ketamine (100\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg) and secured in a stereotaxic frame. A craniotomy (8-mm in diameter) was performed over the left parietal cortex. The dura mater was kept intact. A moderate TBI was induced by a pneumatic impact (tip diameter: 6\u2009mm; velocity: 4\u2009m/sec; and penetration depth: 2.5\u2009mm) as described in our previous studies.\n9\n,\n21\n\nTreatment assignments\nRandomized TBI rats received one of following treatments: 1) PBS (Vehicle group,\nn\n=\u20098); 2) sEVs from na\u00efve MSCs (Na\u00efve-sEV group,\nn\n=\u20098); 3) sEVs from MSCs transfected with a vector carrying scramble control shRNA (Vector-sEV group,\nn\n=\u20098); and 4) sEVs from MSCs transfected with a lentiviral vector-based shRNA against Ago2 to knock down Ago2 (Ago2-KD-sEV group,\nn\n=\u20098). TBI rats received sEVs (na\u00efve-sEV, vector-sEV, or Ago2-KD-sEV: 100-\u03bcg protein, approximately 3.75\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n11\nparticles in 0.5\u2009mL PBS/rat) or vehicle as treatment control (0.5\u2009mL PBS, Vehicle group) via tail vein 24\u2009h PI. Sham rats as a TBI control (Sham group) underwent identical surgery without TBI or treatment. The dose and injection time of sEVs were determined in our previous study of sEV treatment for TBI.\n21\nTo detect cell proliferation in the brain, rats received bromodeoxyuridine at a dose of 100\u2009mg/kg in saline ip for 7 consecutive days starting 1 day PI.\n21\n\nFunctional outcome tests\nThe primary end-points included: 1) sensorimotor tests including footfault, adhesive removal, and modified neurological severity score (mNSS), which were performed at 1 day and once weekly for 5 weeks PI; and 2) the Morris water maze (MWM) test, which was employed to assess spatial learning and memory 31\u201335 days PI.\n22\nThe detailed procedures of these well-established tests were described in our published protocol\n9\n,\n21\n(see detailed methods in\nSupplementary Appendix S1\n).\n\nHistological analyses\nRats anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine were transcardially perfused with saline followed by paraformaldehyde (4%) 35 days PI. Collected brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 days. A series of 6-\u03bcm-thick slides were cut from 2-mm paraffin-embedded brain sections and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Lesion sizes (mm\n3\n) were determined by multiplying the area measurements (mm\n2\n) made on each section by distance (mm) between brain sections and expressed as a percentage of the uninjured right side.\n21\nImmunostaining was performed for identifying astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP), microglia/macrophages (CD68), and neurons (neuronal nuclei, NeuN) and immunoreactive cells and areas were estimated\n15\n,\n21\n(see detailed methods in\nSupplementary Appendix S1\n).\n\nMeasurement of angiogenesis and neurogenesis\nFor measurement of newly generated endothelial cells and neurons, immunofluorescence staining of BrdU with endothelial barrier antigen (EBA) and NeuN was performed, respectively.\n9\n,\n21\nNewborn endothelial cells were identified by measuring EBA+/BrdU+ cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) and lesion boundary zone (LBZ).\n9\nThe LBZ is demarcated as the brain area between intact tissue and lesion (see Fig. S2 in\nSupplementary Appendix S1\n).\n21\nThe images were acquired at 200\u2009\u00d7\u2009or 400\u2009\u00d7\u2009under the microscope according to our published method.\n21\nFor analysis of neurogenesis, NeuN/BrdU-co-labeled cells were counted in the subgranular zone and granular cell layer of the DG. Co-localization of NeuN+ cells with BrdU staining in the DG was verified by confocal microscope image acquisition (Zeiss LSM 510 META). See detailed methods of cell quantitation in Supplementary Appendix S1and in our previous studies.\n23\n,\n24\n\nStatistical analysis\nResults are expressed as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD). An analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's post hoc test for pairwise comparisons was used to test the statistical significance in the lesion size and immunoreactive cells among different groups. Spatial performance and sensorimotor functions at multiple time-points were analyzed by a repeated measures ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test for pairwise comparisons. A\np\n-value less than 0.05 demonstrates statistical significance."

Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants before enrollment.\n\nStudy design and participants\nParticipants were recruited as part of the Injury and Traumatic Stress (INTRuST) Clinical Consortium (W81XWH-08-2-0159,\nintrust.sdsc.edu\n), which was funded by the Department of Defense and consists of 10 sites across the United States. The overarching aim of the consortium was to improve both understanding and treatment of PTSD and mTBI.\n23\n,\n45\n,\n46\n,\n64\n,\n70\u201375\nTo be included in the INTRuST study, participants had to be between 18 and 70 years old and have English as their primary language. Exclusion criteria were English as a second language acquired after the age of 5 years; history of a learning disability; uncontrolled hypertension; taking more than one antihypertensive medication; diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, psychotic, delirium, or dementing disorders; uncontrolled chronic disease; history of moderate to severe TBI; oral or intramuscular steroid use within the last 4 months; or currently taking medication affecting brain function (other than psychotropic medications). Exclusion criteria specific to participants who underwent MRI included general MRI contraindications, disorders of the central nervous system affecting the brain, and pregnancy/lactation.\nStudy enrollment was open from 2008 to 2013, and a total of 771 participants (both with and without military affiliation) were included. Four hundred and twenty-six participants underwent cranial MRI at 6 of the 10 study sites. In the present study, we included participants with both available MRI and serum neurosteroid data, resulting in a sample of 205 participants. MRI data was excluded from another 42 participants because of insufficient MRI data quality, yielding a final sample of 163 participants. Participants were to complete self-report questionnaires and imaging as well as blood draw within 30 days. The final sample did not differ significantly from the excluded participants in demographics (age, sex, race, education, income, employment status), PTSD and mTBI diagnosis, and psychological functioning (PTSD and depressive symptoms, insomnia, alcohol and drug use, functional disability, and health-related quality of life).\n\nClinical assessments and questionnaires\nAssessment of PTSD\nPTSD diagnosis was based on the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)\n76\nin 22 subjects, the PTSD Checklist (PCL)\n77\nin 21 subjects, the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS)\n78\nin 9 subjects, and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-4 (SCID)\n79\nin 1 subject.\nAssessment of mTBI\nHistory of mTBI was assessed with a self-report mTBI screening instrument consisting of three items assessing (1) past brain injury, (2) immediate loss or alteration of consciousness or unawareness of the event, and (3) amnesia before or after the event. The INTRuST mTBI Screening Instrument was developed following the diagnostic criteria by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine\n80\nand has been used in previous publications of the INTRuST Clinical Consortium.\n46\n,\n64\n,\n71\n,\n74\n,\n75\nAssessment of addiction\nAlcohol or drug addiction was assessed according to the Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-20)\n81\nand the Alcohol Use Identification Test (AUDIT-10).\n82\nAssessment of psychological functioning\nFrom the comprehensive INTRuST Clinical Consortium psychological test battery, questionnaires assessing psychiatric symptoms, functional impairment, and health-related quality of life were chosen in the present study (\nTable 1\n).\nTable 1.\nPsychological Functioning\nPCL-C\nAssessing the presence and severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms within the last month\nPHQ-9\nAssessing depressive symptoms\nBSI-18\nAssessing psychological distress\nISI\nAssessing nature, severity, and impact of insomnia\nSDS\nAssessing functional impairment in work, social and family life\nSF-12\nAssessing health-related quality of life\nOpen in a separate window\nPCL-C, PTSD Checklist Civilian;\n83\nPHQ-9, 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire;\n84\nBSI-18, Brief Symptom Inventory;\n85\nISI, Insomnia Severity Index;\n86\nSDS, Sheehan Disability Scale;\n87\nSF-12, Short Form Health Survey.\n88\n\nNeurosteroid quantification\nSerum neurosteroid quantifications were performed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) preceded by high-performance liquid chromatography\n(\nHPLC) as reported elsewhere.\n46\nNeurosteroids were run in one batch and quantified blind to condition. Serum samples had been frozen between 6 and 42 months prior to neurosteroid quantification. One milliliter of serum was extracted three times in ethyl acetate prior to HPLC purification using tetrahydrofuran, ethanol, and hexane in the mobile phase. Heptafluorobutyric acid anhydride (HFBA) was used to derivatize the samples. The samples were injected onto an Agilent 5973 MS coupled to an Agilent 6890N GC equipped with an Agilent HP-5MS 30\u2009m\u2009\u00d7\u20090.250\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20090.25\u2009\u03bcm capillary column, and analyzed in the positive ion-electron impact ionization mode with helium as the carrier gas. The definitive structural identification of each neurosteroid was provided by both its GC/MS retention time and unique mass fragmentation pattern. MS single ion monitoring was used to focus on the most abundant ion fragment for each HFBA derivative (ALLO 496.2, PREGNE 298.2). Twenty percent of serum samples were run in duplicate. Intra-assay coefficients of variation were 4.4% for ALLO and 2.0% for PREGNE. The inter-assay coefficient of variation (CV) for batch-to-batch runs was 14.0% for ALLO and 13.9% for PREGNE. Deuterated internal standards were utilized: D4-allopregnanolone for ALLO and D4-pregnenolonenolone for PREGNE.\nA constant amount of deuterated internal standard was combined with varying known quantities of steroids (Steraloids) to prepare the standard curve for the steroid of interest. Identical to the experimental samples, each standard curve sample was extracted three times in ethyl acetate prior to HPLC purification and GC/MS injection; standard curve\nr\n2\n=\u20090.99 for each neurosteroid. The area under the peak of a known quantity of each steroid was divided by the area under the peak of the internal standard. The resulting ratio was plotted on the y-axis against known quantities of each steroid, generating a standard curve. Only integrated peaks with a signal-to-noise ratio \u22655:1 were integrated. The limit of neurosteroid quantification with this methodology is 1\u2009pg for ALLO and PREGNE (femtomolar sensitivity).\n\nMRI\nImage acquisition\nThe current study used dMRI sequences acquired on three different types of 3-Tesla scanners (Tim Trio, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; GE 750, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA; or Achieva, Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands) at 6 out of the 10 INTRuST acquisition sites (for imaging sequence details for each MRI system see\nTable 2\n).\nTable 2.\nAcquisition Parameters for Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI)\nGE\nSiemens\nPhilips\nOrientation\nAxial\nAxial\nAxial\nPhase encoding direction\nLeft/right\nAnterior/posterior\nPosterior/anterior\nField of view (in mm)\n256\n256\n256\nTE\n83ms\n87ms\n73\u2009ms\nTR\n10s\n10s\n10\u2009sec\nNumber of directions\n64\n64\n64\nb-value\n900\n900\n900\nNumber of b0\n7\n7\n7\nResolution matrix\n128x128\n128x128\n128x128\nVoxel size (in mm\n3\n)\n2x2x2\n2x2x2\n2x2x2\nNumber of slices\n73\n73\n73\nAcquisition time (in min)\n14:40\n14:08\n14:21\nOpen in a separate window\nMulti-site study; dMRI data acquisition on Tim Trio, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany; GE 750, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA; Achieva, Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands.\nTE, echo time; TR, repetition time.\nImage processing\nImage harmonization and pre-processing\nData harmonization is indispensable when attempting to accurately analyze a large data sample acquired through different types of MRI scanners. Therefore, dMRI data were harmonized across the six data acquisition sites using a validated harmonization algorithm.\n72\nThe harmonization approach accounts for scanner-specific differences such as spatial variability of the diffusion signal in different brain areas, while at the same time, the inter-subject variability is maintained at each site and scanner.\n72\nPre-processing of the harmonized dMRI data was performed using scripts of our in-house image processing pipeline (\nhttps://github.com/pnlbwh/pnlutil/blob/master/pipeline/README.md\n). First, the images were axis-aligned, centered, and motion-corrected. Next, eddy current correction was applied with an affine registration of each gradient-weighted image to the baseline using FMRIB Software Library, version 5.1 (FSL; The Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain, Oxford, UK;\nhttp://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk\n). Images were visually inspected for artifacts, such as motion artifacts, ringing, or ghosting of the skull or eyeballs, using 3D Slicer (version 4.5,\nhttp://www.slicer.org\n),\n89\nleading to the exclusion of 42 participants. Diffusion masks covering the entire brain were created from the dMRI data and manually corrected in 3D Slicer where necessary (e.g., in case of incomplete coverage of the brain) by a trained PhD level researcher.\nWhite matter fiber clustering\nWhite matter fiber clustering was conducted according to an open-source pipeline of the whitematteranalysis software (\nhttps://github.com/SlicerDMRI/whitematteranalysis\n). The white matter fiber clustering groups fibers according to their anatomical shape and spatial position and extracts a large number of fiber tracts from the entire brain. This is a major advantage over previous automated fiber tracking approaches, which are limited to the extraction of only the major fiber tracts, thereby failing to cover the entire brain's white matter (including the cerebellum, brainstem, and superficial tracts).\n90\nThe white matter fiber clustering bases the white matter parcellation of each subject on a pre-provided fiber clustering atlas: a neuroanatomist-curated set of tracts covering the white matter (\nhttp://dmri.slicer.org/atlases/\n).\n90\nFirst, unscented Kalman filter (UKF) tractography (\nhttps://github.com/pnlbwh/ukftractography\n)\n91\nwas performed in all subjects using established fiber tracking parameters as follows. Fiber tracking was seeded in all voxels within the brain mask where FA was >0.18 (default). Tracking stopped in voxels where the FA value fell <0.15 (default) or the sum of the normalized signal across all gradient directions fell <0.1 (default) (a parameter to distinguish between white/gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] regions). In addition to these major parameters, the UKF method uses other parameters to fine tune the fiber tracking result, including: Qm to control process noise for angles/direction, Ql to control process noise for eigenvalues, and Rs to control for expected noise in the diffusion signal. These three parameters were well adjusted according to the dMRI data properties under study and set to 70, 0.001, and 0.015, respectively. Visual and quantitative quality control of the generated tractography data for all subjects under study was performed using a semi-automated quality control tool in the whitematteranalysis software (\nhttps://github.com/SlicerDMRI/whitematteranalysis\n).\nNext, each subject's tractography was registered with the pre-provided atlas tractography. By following up with this step we were able to largely reduce the known tractography issue of false-positive tracking.\n92\nFalse-positive fiber tracking is a contributing factor affecting white matter parcellation reproducibility.\n92\nWith our approach, false positive fibers in the atlas have been annotated and rejected via expert judgment.\n90\nUsage of the atlas therefore can ameliorate potential subject-specific false-positive fibers that are inconsistent with respect to known neuroanatomical knowledge. In this study, subject-specific fibers that had improbable fiber geometric trajectories were automatically removed.\nFor each subject, we performed atlas-based white matter parcellation\n90\n,\n93\n,\n94\nusing a robust machine learning approach that has been shown to consistently identify white matter tracts across the full human lifespan, across health conditions including brain tumors, and across different image acquisitions.\n90\nThis approach produces consistent tracts across subjects,\n95\nis reproducible in test-retest data sets\n96\nand is robust to anatomical variability.\n94\nThe approach has also been employed for quantitative tractography analyses\n97\nin many recent studies.\n98\u2013105\nSubject-specific anatomical fiber tract identification was conducted for both hemispheres by linking the registered tractography to the annotated atlas clusters for each tract. Fiber tracts of the entire brain (\nFig. 1\n) were combined into one whole-brain white matter variable, given that we aimed to investigate global white matter effects in association with neuroactive steroids and psychological functioning and did not specify hypothesis for individual tracts. A quantitative quality assessment of the number of streamlines (NoS) and FA was performed to make sure that there were not individual subjects with outlier values. A visual quality assessment of each subject's whole-brain white matter tracts was also performed to ensure anatomical correctness. These quality check processes follow best practices in recent studies.\n98\n,\n102\n,\n106\u2013109\nAll data passed quality checks.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nWhole-brain white matter tractography. This figure shows the whole-brain white matter of one participant derived from the fiber clustering output (in the sagittal and coronal plane).\nDiffusion parameter extraction\nDiffusivity of the extracted whole-brain white matter tracts was calculated and corrected for the relative contribution of extracellular free water in each voxel using free-water modeling.\n110\nThe resulting diffusivity represents the tissue compartment in each voxel from which the tissue's free-water-corrected FA (FA\nTissue\n, i.e., FA\nT\n) was calculated. Compared with FA, FA\nT\nserves as a more accurate marker for cellular white matter microstructure that is less susceptible to partial volume effects with CSF, and is thus more sensitive to the degree of myelinization of fiber tracts, axonal density, and fiber orientation.\n111\nSubject-specific average whole-brain FA\nT\nvalues were extracted from the whole brain's white matter fiber clustering output.\n\nStatistical analysis\nSPSS software (version 25.0; IBM Statistics for Mac, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for all statistical analyses. A Bonferroni-corrected\np\nvalue of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nPsychological functioning\nGiven the variety of psychological symptoms among veterans, we investigated whether a common psychological functioning construct was underlying the different psychological dimensions present in the current sample (assessed with the questionnaires presented in\nTable 1\n). A factor analysis using the Anderson\u2013Rubin method to extract one or more underlying psychological functioning factors was performed. Varimax rotation was applied to ensure the orthogonality of the estimated factors. Only factors with an eigenvalue >1 were extracted. The assumptions for the conduction of a factor analysis were investigated using Bartlett's tests of sphericity.\n\nAssociation between serum neuroactive steroids and psychological functioning\nThe association between serum neurosteroid levels and psychological functioning was assessed using two multiple regression models with independent variable serum ALLO/PREGNE and dependent variable psychological functioning (\np\n<\u20090.025, Bonferroni-corrected for two tests). Age, sex, and alcohol and drug use were included as covariates. In case of a statistically significant association, we additionally assessed the effect of mTBI and PTSD+mTBI comorbidity on the association between serum neurosteroid levels and psychological functioning using Hayes PROCESS\n112\n(double moderation model \u2013 Model 2). Bonferroni correction was applied for two tests (\np\n<\u20090.025). PTSD diagnosis without mTBI comorbidity was not investigated as an individual effect because of the small number of participants with PTSD only (\nn\n=\u200910).\n\nAssociation between serum neuroactive steroids and whole-brain FA\nT\nThe association between serum neurosteroid levels and whole-brain FA\nT\nwas analyzed by conducting two multiple regression models with independent variable serum ALLO/PREGNE and dependent variable whole-brain FA\nT\n(\np\n<\u20090.025, Bonferroni-corrected for two tests).

    "Methods": "Study design\nThe study included a cohort of 90 former NFL players from the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded Diagnosing and Evaluating Traumatic Encephalopathy using Clinical Tests (DETECT) study. Eligibility criteria were male, ages 40-69, a minimum of two NFL seasons and 12 years of organized tackle football, and self-reported cognitive, behavioral, and/or mood symptoms. Also recruited was a same-age unexposed group of men (\nn\n=\u200925) who had no history of contact sport participation, service in the military, or self-reported TBI, and denied symptoms (at telephone screen). Exclusion criteria for the DETECT study included MRI or lumbar puncture contraindications, presence of another central nervous system disease, and/or non-English speaking. Participants completed a 2- to 3-day visit involving multiple assessments, including EEG.\nData from an additional 44 healthy volunteers, matched for age and gender to the former NFL players in this study, were obtained from a concussion assessment study (under a contract to BrainScope from the Department of Defense; #W81XWH-14-C-1405). All participants had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15 and were not under duress. Exclusion criteria included history of neurological disorder, brain surgery, TBI, or reporting any \u201cconcussion\u201d symptoms at time of the evaluation. The EEG assessment for this subgroup was conducted separately from the DETECT study. EEG data from these participants was verified to be statistically equivalent to the unexposed group of men in the DETECT study with hierarchical clustering analysis and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, allowing merging of both control groups for the analyses. Both study protocols were approved by the local institutional review boards (IRB) and all participants provided written informed consent.\n\nMeasures\nSelf-reported athletic history\nAFE to American football, total years of American football play, and number of seasons and position played in the NFL were collected through self-report. The AFE was determined as the age when participant began to play organized American football.\nNeuropsychological and neuropsychiatric measures\nA neuropsychological battery was administered to evaluate attention, executive function, verbal and visual episodic memory, language, and visuospatial function, and semi-structured interviews and self-report measures to evaluate neuropsychiatric function (e.g., depression, behavioral dysregulation, aggression).\n54\nNeuropsychological test raw scores were converted to standard scores that account for age, gender, and/or education. Principal component analysis generated four composite factors measuring the following domains: behavioral/mood, psychomotor speed/executive function, verbal memory, and visual memory.\n54\nEEG data acquisition and processing\nTen minutes of eyes closed resting EEG was acquired using BrainScope's investigational device (BrainScope Food and Drug Administration [FDA]-cleared device, which does not provide a result to the blind investigators). Data was recorded from a frontal electrode montage including Fp1, Fp2, F7, F8, AFz, A1, and A2 locations of the expanded International 10-20 Electrode Placement System, re-referenced to linked ears. A technician observed the participants throughout data acquisition for vigilance and drowsiness. Data was acquired at a sampling rate of 1\u2009kHz and all electrode impedances were below 10 k\u03a9.\nUsing BrainScope's real-time artifact detection algorithms,\n45\nphysiologic and non-physiologic contamination (e.g., lateral and horizontal eye movement, electromyography muscle activity) was identified for removal, assuring quality of EEG data. Only cases with 1-2\u2009min of artifact-free data were selected for further analyses. Sufficient data was available in all but four subjects, which represented <3.5% of all samples.\nA set of qEEG features was extracted from the artifact-free data and z-transformed relative to age expected normal values.\n45\n,\n55\nFeature sets characterizing the EEG signal included measures of power (absolute and relative), mean frequency, connectivity (asymmetry, coherence, phase lag, phase synchrony), complexity (fractal dimension and scale-free activity), and information theory (entropy) across and within frequency bands. A multi-variate EEG marker of brain function impairment\n53\n(Brain Function Index, BFI) also was computed.\n\nClassifier development and evaluation\nTwo qEEG-based binary supervised classification algorithms were derived to optimize separations between: 1) former NFL players and the age-matched comparison group and 2) within the former NFL player group, between those with AFE <12 and those with AFE \u226512. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression method\n56\n,\n57\nwas used to derive these algorithms in the following steps:\nStep 1: Informed feature reduction\nA challenge to the development of a stable, replicable machine learning classification model is the relationship between the number of participants and the number of input features. If not addressed, the solution may converge to a local optimal solution (overtraining) instead of the global optimum.\n58\nTo minimize overtraining and maximize the likelihood of prospective independent replication, the first step was to perform an informed feature reduction, described in detail elsewhere.\n45\nStep 2: Recursive feature elimination\nFurther data reduction and feature selection was achieved through the recursive feature elimination (RFE) algorithm, a stepwise feature elimination method that finds the optimal set of features for a classification using a pre-defined kernel function.\n59\nIn this study, RFE was configured with a linear support vector machine (SVM)\n60\n,\n61\nas the kernel function, and the feature selection process was repeated 30 times on a 3-fold cross-validation (CV)\n62\nschema. The top 50 qEEG features selected most frequently from the total of 90 runs (30 repetitions\u2009\u00d7\u20093-fold CV) constituted the feature set input to the LASSO model development.\nStep 3: Classifier development\nCross-validation (CV) strategy also was used to train the LASSO model. For the classification between former NFL players and the age-matched comparison group, data was randomly split into five folds of approximately equal size, keeping the overall group ratios, with one-fold reserved for testing and the remaining four folds used for training the model. This training and testing process was repeated five times until all folds had been used for testing. For the classification between AFE <12 and AFE \u226512 within the former NFL players group, due to the limited number of former NFL players in both classes, a leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation strategy\n62\nwas adopted. In this case, a single sample was left out each time for testing, while the remaining samples formed the training set for model building. This process was repeated until all samples had been used for testing once.\nStep 4: Classifier evaluation\nThe metrics used to estimate model performance were the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of all normalized discriminant scores from testing sets. For the classification between former NFL players and age-matched participants, the cross-validation classifier development was repeated 20 times for a stable assessment on the algorithm performance. The overall ROC performance of the LASSO algorithm was evaluated by pooling the 100 sets of testing results (20 repetitions\u2009\u00d7\u20095 folds). For the classification within the former NFL players, the ROC performance was assessed using the LOO cross-validation testing results."

    "Methods": "Study setting and population\nThis prospective cross-sectional study was conducted at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Kigali (CHUK) in Kigali, Rwanda.\n22\nCHUK is Rwanda's primary national referral hospital, with approximately 500 inpatient beds and a 50-bed emergency department (ED) providing 24-h daily care, and the only neurosurgery service supported by the Rwanda Ministry of Health nationwide.\n24\n,\n25\nUnder the provisions of an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol developed before the COVID-19 pandemic focused on general trauma epidemiology at CHUK, all adult injury patients presenting to the CHUK ED were screened for enrollment. Adult injury patients presenting with neurotrauma who were not deceased on arrival, a prisoner of the state, or pregnant and who provided consent were included for analysis. A legally authorized patient representative provided informed consent for patients unable to consent due to incapacity. The present CNS-trauma-focused analysis is a subpopulation analysis of a previously published study for the general trauma population at CHUK, as described earlier, which did not analyze the CNS trauma in isolation.\n22\nPatients were enrolled from January 27, 2020 to June 28, 2020 excluding a cessation of research activities from March 22, 2020 to May 31, 2020 during Rwanda's first national lockdown.\n22\nConsequently, the study population was stratified by date of presentation into groups: \u201cbefore COVID-19\u201d (January 27, 2020 to March 21, 2020) and \u201cduring COVID-19\u201d (June 1, 2020 to June 28, 2020). Exclusion criteria are visualized in\nFigure 1\n, with the most common reasons for exclusion being not having CNS trauma (\nn\n=\u2009364) and being <18 years of age (\nn\n=\u2009199).

CHUK, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Kigali; CNS, central nervous system; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019.\n\nData management\nFollowing patient enrollment, trained research personnel collected data continuously using structured case reporting forms on an hourly basis during the first 6\u2009h of ED care. Variables prospectively collected included patient demographics, mechanism of injury, time from injury to presentation, injury acuity, acute interventions during the first 6\u2009h of care, imaging findings, and disposition. Injury severity was quantified by the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and Kampala Trauma Score (KTS). The KTS is a previously validated trauma prognostication score designed specifically for use in LMIC and ranges continuously from 5 to 16, with lower scores denoting higher acuity.\n26\u201328\nFollowing earlier studies, the shock index was calculated as the quotient of heart rate over systolic blood pressure on ED arrival and dichotomized at a threshold of \u22650.9 to indicate hemodynamic instability.\n29\nTo identify additional clinical variables of interest not captured by standardized screening forms, a retrospective chart review was conducted to record symptoms on presentation, serial neurological examinations, neurological intensive care unit (neuro-ICU) admission and length of stay (LOS), pharmacological agents administered, overall LOS, and extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) score at discharge, reflecting functional status.\n30\n,\n31\nGCS score (mild\u2009=\u200913\u201315, moderate\u2009=\u20099\u201312, severe\u2009=\u20093\u20138) and GOSE score (7\u20138\u2009=\u2009good recovery vs. 1\u20136\u2009=\u2009death, vegetative state, or disability) were categorized following earlier methods.\n28\n,\n32\nThe outcome of neurological decline was defined as a composite variable encapsulating GCS score decline of \u22652 points, new-onset unconsciousness, or new-onset sensorimotor deficit documented on serial exams.\n33\n,\n34\nStudy enrollment and standardized data collection were performed by a team of seven research personnel who remained constant through the study period, all native to Rwanda, fluent in the three local languages (Kinyarwanda, French, and English), and with experience in clinical research and health care provision. Research personnel were trained in operating procedures by via didactic sessions and interactive role playing over a 2-day seminar. Data were collected on standardized hard-copy case reporting forms and entered daily into a password-protected online database. Data were checked weekly by the study team for validation and any data collection personnel having >5% missingness in their data were given focused assistance and retraining to improve data capture.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analysis was performed via Stata 17 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Data visualization of end-points of clinical interest chosen\na priori\nwas conducted using the\nmatplotlib\npackage on Python (Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Descriptive statistics calculated for the study population included frequencies with percentages for categorical variables and means with standard deviations (SDs) or medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs) for continuous variables. Differences in patient ED volume, presenting characteristics, management, and outcomes for patients treated before compared with during the COVID-19 pandemic were queried by chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables and the non-parametric Mann-Whitney\nU\ntest for continuous variables. Missing data that were not collected prospectively via standardized study forms or could not be abstracted from chart review were included as a discrete category during analysis of categorical variables.

    "Methods": "Animal assurance\nAnimal use procedures were reviewed and approved by the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. These procedures comply with the Guidelines for the care and Use of Laboratory Animals by the National Research Council. The investigators abided by the laws of the U. S. and by the regulations put forth by the Department of Agriculture while conducting research using animals.\n\nAnimals\nThis study used juvenile male Long Evans rats (Envigo, Indianapolis, IN). They were group housed in the UMMC vivarium under a 12-h/12-h light/dark cycle with 50-60% humidity at 25\u00b0C. During this study, the animals were placed on one of two diets: 1) standard chow (#8640, Envigo; 3.0 kcal/g; 17% fat, 54% carbohydrate, 29% protein) + water; or 2) HFD (#D03082706, Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ; 4.54 kCal/g; 40% fat, 45% carbohydrate, 15% protein) + a 10% HFCS solution. All animals used throughout this study arrived in the vivarium on post-natal day (PND) 20. The animals were weighed regularly five times per week.\n\nCHIMERA procedures\nThe rats in both studies were anesthetized in an induction chamber using 3.5% isoflurane in 100% oxygen. All rats received subcutaneous injections of carprofen at 5\u2009mg/mL before being placed on the CHIMERA device. When the subjects were fully anesthetized, they were placed on the CHIMERA device in the animal holder at an angle of 45\u00b0. While on the CHIMERA device, anesthesia was maintained via nose cone. The rats' bodies were stabilized on the animal holder with Velcro straps. The heads of the subjects were aligned such that the piston struck in the center of the head midway between the ears and the eyes. Directly before the vertical hit was delivered, the nose cone was removed. Sham animals were treated the same in all respects. However, the Sham animals were placed beside the animal holder on the device so that they would avoid impact by the vertical hit but would experience the noise from the hit. Immediately after the vertical hit was delivered, the subjects were placed in a supine position in a recovery chamber. The latency to return to the prone position from the supine position was recorded as the time to righting. In addition, the time between being placed in the recovery chamber and using all four limbs to walk was recorded as the time to walking.\n\nExperimental groups\nFor all cohorts of animals used in the current study, there were four experimental groups. These groups were Chow Sham, Chow TBI, HFD Sham, and HFD TBI.\nCohort 1\nThe subjects (\nN\n=\u200925; 6-7 per group) arrived on PND 20 in the UMMC vivarium. On PND 21, the subjects were randomized to either receive the standard chow diet + water or the HFD + HFCS. On PND 30, the subjects sustained either a Sham TBI or a 0.6\u2009J vertical hit via the CHIMERA. On PND 37, the rats underwent the acute restraint stress paradigm described below. The animals were euthanized 2\u2009h after the stress paradigm was completed using a single injection of Fatal-Plus (#07-806-9782, Patterson Veterinary), along with intracardiac perfusion with saline and paraformaldehyde (PFA) in order to preserve the brain.\nCohort 2\nThe subjects (\nN\n=\u200928; 6-8 per group) were randomly assigned to either receive the standard chow diet + water or HFD + HFCS on PND 21. On PND 30, the subjects sustained either a Sham TBI or a 0.6\u2009J vertical hit via the CHIMERA device. On PND 36, the subjects performed in the open field test (OFT). On PND 37, animals were food-deprived for 8\u2009h prior to euthanasia via conscious decapitation to collect fasting blood glucose levels. The adrenal and pituitary glands were removed and weighed. The brains, adrenal glands, and pituitary glands were flash-frozen in methylbutane to be used in RNA extraction.\n\nOpen field test\nThe OFT is a sensory-motor test used to examine locomotor activity and exploratory behavior. Analysis of time spent in the exterior quadrants versus the interior quadrants indicates the level of anxiety. On PND 36, subjects from Cohort 2 participated in a trial of the OFT. The OFT apparatus consisted of six 40\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u200940\u2009cm Plexiglas chambers. Each chamber was in its own cubicle that was 60\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u200950\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u200975\u2009cm and was open at the front. The testing took place under low light conditions. Subjects were placed in the center of each chamber and allowed to explore for 20\u2009min. The animals' activity was tracked via infrared beam breaks using the Opto-Varimex software (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, Ohio). Beams were arranged to create a 4\u2009\u00d7\u20094 grid, and activity was collated in 1-min bins. Post-test analysis was performed by aggregating the perimeter area and center area, as shown in\nFigure 2A\n. Total number of entries into the center field, total number of entries into the center as a function of the total number of entries, and the total amount of time spent in the center over the first 10\u2009min were calculated from the collected data. During the second 10\u2009min, the animals exhibited low-mobility behavior. Further analysis of the raw data autogenerated by the Opto-Varimex software provided information concerning total distance traveled, time spent ambulating, ambulatory counts, horizontal counts, bursts of stereotypic movements, and resting time in a minute-by-minute fashion.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nOpen field test (OFT) arena layout and center activity.\n(A)\nOFT arena layout with gray squares designated as perimeter and white squares designated as center.\n(B)\nTotal number of entries into all squares.\n(C)\nTotal number of entries to the center squares of the OFT.\n(D)\nTime spent in the center squares.\n(E)\nPercent of total entries to the center squares out of the total number of entries.\n(F)\nThe percent of the total time spent in the center out of the total time spent in the OFT;\nn\n=\u20096-8 males per group.

Injury group differences were determined by Student's t test. Statistical significance was determined as *\np\n<\u20090.05, **\np\n<\u20090.01.\n\nAcute restraint stress test\nOn PND 37, animals from Cohort 1 were transferred to a procedure room and allowed to acclimate. Three hours after the start of the light cycle, a pre-stress blood sample was collected by clipping the tail (T\u2009=\u20090). Immediately after, the animals were placed in an EchoMRI rodent tube and restrained for 2\u2009min. Fifteen minutes following this stress exposure, post-stress tail blood samples were collected (T\u2009=\u200915). Blood samples were placed on wet ice immediately after sampling until analysis. The rats were euthanized 120\u2009min after the pre-stress tail bleed through intracardiac saline and PFA perfusion.\n\nPlasma analyses of glucose, corticosterone, and ACTH\nBlood glucose levels were measured during the tail bleeds of the acute restraint stress test using a hand-held glucometer (On Call Glucose Monitoring). To measure T\u2009=\u20090 and T\u2009=\u200915 corticosterone levels by ELISA (#ab108821, Abcam), plasma samples were diluted 1:100 in the diluent. For ACTH determination (#ab263880, Abcam), samples were diluted 1:5.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nBrains from Cohort 1 were post-fixed in PFA, and the brains were transferred to a 30% sucrose solution in PBS. The tissues were sectioned at a 30-\u03bcm thickness using a sliding microtome after the brains were flash-frozen via methylbutane on dry ice. The sections were blocked with 2% donkey serum in triton X 100 in KPBS. After blocking, the sections were incubated in cFos primary antibody (1:2500, #ab190289; Abcam) overnight at 4\u00b0C. After incubating overnight, the sections were incubated in an anti-rabbit biotinylated secondary antibody (1:600, #BA1100; Vector Laboratories). They were incubated in the secondary antibody for 1\u2009h at room temperature before being incubated using the Vectastain peroxidase kit (1:600, #PK-6100; Vector Laboratories) for 1\u2009h. Next, the sections were incubated in 0.2\u2009mg/mL 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate (D5905; Sigma) for approximately 10\u2009min. Following incubation in the DAB substrate, the sections were mounted using gelatin and were cover-slipped using Permount. Images were taken by a blinded investigator using an Olympus BX60 F5 light microscope with an Olympus DP28 camera. The PVN-matched images were obtained from\nn\n=\u20094 samplings (right and left side). Image J (v1.51t) was used to analyze photomicrographs.\n\nReal-time polymerase chain reaction\nRNA from the adrenal glands was extracted via a QIAGEN miniprep RNA kit. The total RNA concentration extracted from the hypothalamus, adrenal glands, and pituitary glands was quantified by a NanoDrop Lite. An iScript cDNA synthesis kit was used to make complementary DNA for real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Quantitative PCR was performed on a Step-One Plus Real-Time PCR machine, which had StepOne Version 2.3 software. Real-time PCR was performed using TaqMan gene expression assays. Rpl32 was used as the internal control for the other genes of interest. The probes that were used for real-time PCR are as follows: arginine vasopressin (Avp, Rn00690189_g1), corticotropin-releasing hormone (Crh, Rn01462137_m1 ), corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 (Crhr1, Rn00578611_m1), corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2 (Crhr2, Rn00575617_m1), nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 1/ glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1, Rn01405582_m1), nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 2/ mineralocorticoid receptor (Nr3c2, Rn00565562_m1), oxytocin/neurophysin 1 prepropeptide (Oxt, Rn00564446_g1), and proopiomelanocortin (Pomc, Rn00595020_m1).\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism Version 9.1.2. Statistical significance was calculated using either two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Tukey's post hoc test with factors of Diet and Injury.\nA priori\nStudent's t test was used to determine differences between Sham and TBI within the Chow and HFD groups and HFD TBI and Chow TBI. In addition, body weight change was analyzed by three-way ANOVA with factors of Diet, Injury, and Time with repeated measures. Main effects were considered significant when\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Animals\nSwiss Webster mice were purchased from Charles River (Wilmington, MA) and bred at West Virginia University (WVU). Swiss Webster mice were used because their skulls are much less likely to fracture with our injury device than other strains. Pups were weaned at 21 days of age and were housed in a 12:12 light cycle with\nad libitum\naccess to food (HarlanTeklad #8640) and filtered tap water. All procedures were approved by the WVU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were conducted in accordance with National Institute of Health guidelines.\nA total of 272 mice were utilized in this study, and a total of 19 deaths occurred across all experiments, including one non-stroke mouse and 18 middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mice. The mortality rate in our study is consistent with a 10-15% published mortality rate for MCAO in mice.\n35\n,\n36\nIn all experiments, animals were randomly assigned to groups (injury, time after injury, and ischemia) and all observations were conducted by researchers blind to experimental conditions.\n\nSurgical procedures\nA single closed-head mTBI was conducted on post-pubertal male and female mice (6\u20138 weeks of age) as previously reported.\n37\nBeginning 7 or 28 days after mTBI, some cohorts underwent a single transient unilateral MCAO, while others were processed for histological markers of neuropathology (see\nFig. 1\nfor experimental timeline). All mice experienced similar total amount of time under anesthesia, thus controlling for any potential neuroprotective effects of repeated isoflurane exposure.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExperimental timeline. Cohort 1: Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was conducted 7 or 28 days after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and tissue collected for 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining 5 days later. Cohort 2: intravenous dextran was injected 7 or 28 days following mTBI and tissue was immediately collected for blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) permeability analysis. Cohort 3: mice were transcardially perfused 7 or 28 days following mTBI for immunohistochemistry analyses. Cohort 4: MCAO was conducted 7 or 28 days following mTBI and mice were perfused 1 hour later for immunohistochemistry analyses.\n\nTraumatic brain injury\nMice were randomly assigned to an experimental group and then placed into a stereotaxic frame under inhaled isoflurane anesthesia (3% induction, 1.5% maintenance). The injury was induced with an Impact One device (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). A 3-mm diameter impactor tip was retracted and driven into the skull along the midline (\u22122\u2009mm AP relative to bregma) to a depth of 1.2\u2009mm at a rate of 3\u2009mm/sec (dwell time: 30\u2009msec). Local analgesia was provided with subcutaneous bupivacaine (1.5\u2009mg/kg) at the incision site. The skin was sutured with 6/0 nylon suture and mice were returned to their cages. The control procedure was performed identically but the impactor was not driven into the skull (just placed on the surface and retracted). This mTBI procedure is highly reproducible and does not produce skull fracture or ear damage.\n6\n,\n38\n,\n39\n\nMiddle cerebral artery occlusion\nBriefly, following a 7-day or 28-day recovery period after TBI, mice in cohorts 1 and 4 (\nFig. 1\n) were reanesthetized with inhaled isoflurane (3% induction, 1.5% maintenance) and a unilateral MCAO was achieved by insertion of a 0.23\u2009mm occluder (Doccol) into the right middle cerebral artery via the internal carotid artery and extending 6\u2009mm beyond the internal carotid-pterygopalatine artery bifurcation. The occluder was secured and the mouse was returned to its home cage for 1\u2009h. Following the 1-h occlusion period, the mouse was re-anesthetized, and reperfusion initiated by removal of the occluder. Local analgesia was provided with subcutaneous bupivacaine (1.5\u2009mg/kg) at the incision site. MCAO mice were included in the study if a measurable infarct was present.\n\nDetermination of infarct volume\nFive days after MCAO, mice were euthanized by rapid decapitation; brains were sectioned into four 2-mm thick coronal sections through the forebrain and incubated in 1% TTC (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride in saline) for 10\u2009min at 37\u00b0C. TTC produces a pink formazan product in the presence of live mitochondria, thus ischemic lesions are visualized as unstained white tissue. Slices were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, photographed, and infarct area was outlined on both sides of each slice using Fiji imaging software.\n40\nInfarct size was determined after correcting for edema and reported as percent of the contralateral hemisphere using the formula: (1-(total ipsilateral hemisphere \u2013 infarct)/total contralateral hemisphere) *100.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nFollowing tissue imaging for TTC in cohort 1, the paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue slices were cryopreserved, frozen, and further sectioned coronally on a cryostat at 40\u2009\u03bcm throughout the forebrain. Mice in cohorts 3 and 4 were transcardially perfused and the brains were post-fixed, cryoprotected, and frozen before being cut on a cryostat at 40\u2009\u03bcm.\nFor immunofluorescent staining, slices were washed with phosphate-buffered saline with 0.01% Triton-X (PBS-T) and blocked in 1% normal horse serum. After blocking, slices were incubated overnight in primary antibodies for each stain: CD31 (1:200; RNDSystems, Minneapolis, MN) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:250; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), CD31 and IBA1 (1:250; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), or vascular endothelial growth factor A (1:300; VEGF-A; Abcam), fibrin(ogen) (1:100; Agilent), tomato lectin (1:200; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), GFAP (1:200; Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA), and aquaporin-4 (AQP4; 1:200; Cell Signaling Technologies) at room temperature. The next day, sections were washed with PBS-T and incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies and mounted with Fluoromount mounting medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).\n\nImaging and analysis\nAll immunohistochemistry (between bregma -1.5 and -2.0) was imaged and stitched on an Olympus VS-120 microscope with a 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009Plan S Apo/0.40 NA objective using a Monochrome XM10 camera (1376\u2009\u00d7\u20091032 imaging array, 6.45\u2009\u00d7\u20096.45-\u03bcm pixel size, and 14-bit digitization). Unless otherwise noted, all images and subsequent analyses were performed in the corticostriatal region (representative of the middle cerebral artery territory) using Nikon Elements software. Three images were taken from adjacent brain slices and data were averaged across all three images unless otherwise indicated. For immunoglobulin G (IgG)/CD31/GFAP histology, we assessed total accumulation of IgG within the CD31+ cell area.\nAQP4 expression on GFAP-positive astrocytes was assessed by measuring the area and intensity of the pixels expressing AQP4 in a standardized region of interest (ROI; 2880\u2009\u00d7\u20092470 pixels). Colocalization of fibrinogen and tomato lectin is reported as a percent of colocalization normalized to total expression of tomato lectin. IBA1 and CD31 stains were used to measure the total amount of microglia and vasculature in the corticostriatal region, as well as the area of vascular associated microglia (VAM) and vascular contacting microglia.\nVEGF-A and tomato lectin immunohistochemistry was assessed in the corticostriatal region (averaged two images for analysis) and corpus callosum (averaged two images for analysis) by identifying and thresholding the vessel positive area and the VEGF positive area. Once thresholding was conducted, we measured the total levels of VEGF in standardized ROIs (3800\u2009\u00d7\u20092575 pixels in corticostriatal, 2800\u2009\u00d7\u20092200 pixels in corpus callosum) in each set of images, as well as the amount of VEGF expression both in colocalization with the vasculature and separately from the vasculature.\n\nBlood\u2013brain barrier breakdown assessment\nMice in cohort 2 underwent an mTBI or control procedure, then 7 or 28 days later were injected intraperitoneally with 200\u2009\u03bcL of a fluorescent tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)-coupled dextran (Life Technologies Corporation, Eugene, OR) in 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Twelve minutes post-injection, mice were perfused transcardially with 20\u2009mL of 0.1\u2009M PBS and one hemisphere was extracted and flash-frozen in Tissue-Tek OCT Compound for later slicing and immunohistochemical staining. Hemispheres were sliced on a cryostat at 10\u2009\u03bcm and mounted on gelatin-coated slides, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10\u2009min, rinsed with PBS, and the fluorescent dye was immunohistochemically co-labeled with CD31 as described above. Images were obtained as described above and permeability was assessed by analyzing colocalization of the TMR-dextran and CD31 as normalized to total dextran expression.\n\nStatistical analysis\nSample sizes were formulated from power analyses based on the magnitude of differences detected in preliminary studies and from previous literature. Effect sizes were >0.45, with biochemical and histological changes being larger than behavioral effects. Thus, we powered the study to detect differences with a \u03b2 > 0.8. Behavioral outcomes, infarct size, blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown assays, and immunohistochemical results were assessed via a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA; injury condition\u2009\u00d7\u2009ischemia condition, or injury condition\u2009\u00d7\u2009treatment). All significant overall results (\np\n<\u20090.05) were followed up with a Tukey honestly significant difference\npost hoc\nanalysis."

    "Methods": "Participants\nThe patients with MTBI were part of the Trondheim MTBI follow-up study (total\nn\n=\u2009378), recruited in 2014 and 2015.\n33\nA total of 199 patients, aged 16 to 59, participated in an extended follow-up study including MRI at 3T. All had experienced a TBI defined as a physical trauma to the head or high energy trauma followed by witnessed loss of consciousness (LOC) or confusion and/or PTA for the event or the time period after the event, and/or traumatic brain lesions on CT. The TBI was further defined as mild per the World Health Organization Collaborating Center Task Force on Mild Traumatic Brain Injury criteria: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13-15 at presentation to the emergency department, LOC <30\u2009min, and PTA <24\u2009h.\n34\nExclusion criteria were: non-fluency in the Norwegian language; pre-existing severe neurological, psychiatric, somatic, or substance use disorder (i.e., determined to be severe enough to likely interfere with follow-up); a prior history of a complicated mild (i.e., self-reported CT findings), moderate, or severe TBI; or other major trauma. The exclusion criteria were evaluated with a structured interview. Previous TBI was evaluated with the Ohio State University TBI Identification Method Short Form (\nhttps://wexnermedical.osu.edu/neurological-institute/neuroscience-research-institute/research-centers/ohio-valley-center-for-brain-injury-prevention-and-rehabilitation/for-professionals/screening-for-tbi\n). Recruitment took place at two emergency departments: a level 1 trauma center in Trondheim, Norway; and at the Trondheim Municipal Emergency clinic, a general practitioner-run, out-patient clinic.\nA group of 83 age-, sex-, and education-matched community controls was recruited among hospital and university staff, students, and acquaintances of staff, students, and patients. The exclusion criteria applied in the MTBI group were used for the controls, but in addition, the controls should not be receiving treatment for psychiatric disorders.\nThe study was approved by the regional committee for research ethics (REK 2013/754) and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants, and caregivers of participants younger than 18 years, gave informed consent.\n\nClinical and demographic variables\nThe GCS score was assessed by study personnel or obtained from the patient's medical records. LOC was defined as present only if it was witnessed. PTA was defined as the time after the injury for which the patient had no continuous memory and dichotomized into <1\u2009h (short) and 1-24\u2009h (long). From a pilot study, we experienced that many patients could not report a valid estimate in minutes; therefore, PTA was recorded as either less than 1\u2009h or 1-24\u2009h. Other concurrent injuries (i.e., fractures and soft-tissue injuries) were recorded. Pre-injury intelligence was estimated with the Vocabulary subtest from Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence.\n35\nThe matched control group has been found to be very similar to the MTBI group also on a range of personal factors (e.g., intelligence, personality, psychological resilience, alcohol use), although the MTBI group had a higher frequency of previous uncomplicated MTBI (22% vs 10%).\n36\n,\n37\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging\nPatients with MTBI and controls underwent MRI on a 3T Siemens Skyra scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) with a 32-channel head coil within 72\u2009h, at 3 months, and at 12 months after the injury. A neuroradiologist (K.A.K) and a resident in radiology (J.X) read the following MRI sequences: 1) three-dimensional (3D) T1 Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo Imaging (MPRAGE); 2) two-dimensional axial diffusion-weighted imaging; (3) 3D T2 space; 4) 3D fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR); and 5) 3D susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI).\n38\nPatients with visible traumatic intracranial lesions on clinical MRI were considered complicated MTBI, while those without, uncomplicated MTBI. The type of abnormalities found on clinical MRI in patients with complicated MTBI (\nn\n=\u200922), and how these were defined, have been reported in detail elsewhere.\n38\nNone of the patients had an intracranial injury requiring surgery and patients with complicated MTBI presented with the following findings: traumatic axonal injury\nn\n=\u200911 (depicted as either microbleeds on SWI or hyperintensities on FLAIR, located in the typical locations in white matter); contusions\nn\n=\u200912 (defined as superficial cortical lesions); epidural hematoma\nn\n=\u20093; subdural hematoma\nn\n=\u20093; traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage\nn\n=\u20093.\n\nDTI and DKI data processing\nThe DTI/DKI sequence was a single-shot balanced-echo echo-planar imaging sequence acquired in 30 non-collinear directions per b-value with the following parameters: three b-values (b\u2009=\u20090, five averages; b\u2009=\u20091000; b\u2009=\u20092000\u2009sec/mm\n2\n, average signal-to-noise ratio at b0\u2009=\u2009158); repetition time\u2009=\u20098800\u2009msec; echo time\u2009=\u200995\u2009msec; field of view\u2009=\u2009240\u2009\u00d7\u2009240\u2009mm; slice thickness\u2009=\u20092.5\u2009mm; acquisition matrix 96\u2009\u00d7\u200996; 60 transversal slices, no gaps, were acquired. To correct for image distortion, two additional b\u2009=\u20090 images were acquired with opposite phase encoding polarity.\n39\nImages were analyzed with the fMRIB Software Library (FSL) v. 6.0.4 and the Diffusion Kurtosis Estimator (DKE). Non-brain tissue was removed with the Brain Extraction Tool (FSL). Artifacts due to eddy currents and movements were corrected with eddy (FSL), which included b-matrix rotation. Correction of the susceptibility induced off-resonance field artifacts was done with topup (FSL). DKI and DTI model fitting was performed with DKE, which formulate the tensor estimation problem as linearly constrained linear least squares, and parametric maps were calculated for the two most studied DTI metrics and their kurtosis equivalents: FA, MD, KFA, and Kmean.\n40\nVoxel-wise statistical analysis was performed using TBSS.\n41\nAll subjects' FA data were aligned in a common space using the nonlinear registration tool FNIRT.\n42\n,\n43\nA mean FA image was created from all FA images and thinned to create a skeletonized mean FA representing the centers of all tracts common to all the subjects in the analysis. The mean FA skeleton was thresholded at FA 0.2 to include major white matter tracts but exclude peripheral tracts and grey matter. Each subject's aligned FA data were then projected onto this skeleton. The skeletonization process was also applied to MD, KFA, and Kmean, and the statistical comparisons of these data were then restricted to voxels in the FA-based white matter skeleton. The resulting skeletonized data were used in the statistical analysis.\n\nStatistical analysis\nGroup differences in demographic variables were examined with t-tests, Mann-Whitney U-tests, and chi-squared tests. We analyzed the DTI/DKI data in three steps. In step 1, Randomise\n44\nin FSL was used to perform voxel-wise analyses on the white matter skeleton to identify differences in diffusion metrics between the MTBI and control group separately at the three time-points (cross-sectional comparisons). Randomise is a non-parametric, permutation-based method using threshold-free cluster enhancement with correction for multiple comparisons (family-wise error rate). A\np\nvalue <0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons, was considered statistically significant. Analyses were controlled for age, age*age,\n45\nsex, and scanner upgrade (due to scanner upgrade from version D13 to E11 during the inclusion period), and 5000 permutations were used.\nIn step 2, change over time in the clusters of voxels identified in step 1 as significant was investigated with linear mixed-effect models. For example, if Randomise identified 1000 voxels with significantly lower FA in corona radiata at 72\u2009h, we extracted the mean FA of these 1000 voxels at the 72\u2009h and the 3- and 12-month MRI. We then evaluated change over time in mean FA in this cluster of voxels with a mixed-effect model. As in step 1, analyses were controlled for age, age*age, sex and scanner upgrade. The main effects of interest in these models were the group*time interaction (i.e., testing whether diffusion metrics developed differently in patients with MTBI compared with controls).\nTo restrict the number of comparisons and thereby reduce the risk of sporadic findings, these analyzes were only performed in tracts where 100 or more voxels differed significantly between the MTBI and control group. The JHU ICBM-DTI-81 white-matter labels atlas was used to identify the tract of the significant voxels identified in step 1 and mean diffusion values were extracted and analyzed from significant voxels within a JHU-defined tract (i.e., we did not extract mean diffusion values from the whole tract, only from the significant voxels identified in step 1). Thus, the voxels identified in step 1 were analyzed longitudinally, tract by tract, and they were analyzed both prospectively (e.g., how voxels that differed significantly between patients with MTBI and controls at the 72-h scan evolved over time) and retrospectively (e.g., how voxels that differed significantly between patients with MTBI and controls at the 12 months scan appeared at 72\u2009h and 3 months).\nThe estimated means of the diffusion metrics with corresponding 95% confidence intervals are presented in figures. Mean differences, standardized mean differences, and\np\nvalues (unadjusted for multiple comparisons, but marked with an * if still significant after Bonferroni correction) from the statistical models are reported in\nsupplementary tables\n. Standardized mean differences were obtained by first dividing the original diffusion values with the standard deviation of the control group at 72\u2009h and then re-do the analyses. Traditionally, standardized mean differences of 0.2 are considered small, 0.5 moderate, and 0.8 large.\n46\nIn the mixed-effect models, the within-subject correlation was modeled by a random, subject-specific intercept and the parameters of the model were estimated by restricted maximum likelihood. Normality of the data was inspected with histograms and QQ-plots and was considered satisfactory. Importantly, in mixed-effect models, a participant is included in the model even if he or she did not complete all assessments (i.e., no listwise deletion is carried out because of missing outcome data).\n47\nAnalyses were performed with Stata v. 17.\nIn step 3, to investigate whether the group differences identified in step 1 were driven mainly by deviating diffusion in patients with a more severe injury, we divided the MTBI group into (A) complicated versus uncomplicated MTBI; (B) long versus short PTA; and (C) other versus no other concurrent injuries. The mixed-effect models described in step 2 were re-run, but the groups compared were patients divided according to A, B and C. To investigate possible differences in diffusion metrics between the injury severity groups outside the clusters identified in step 1, we also performed voxel-wise comparisons with Randomise across the entire skeleton between these groups.\nIn addition to presenting standardized mean differences for each comparison, we also present them combined across diffusion metrics. In this case, the direction was transformed so that a positive effect size equaled higher FA, KFA, and Kmean, and lower MD values in the control group, the uncomplicated group, the short PTA group, and the group with no other injuries.\nData availability\nAnonymized data is available upon reasonable request from any qualified investigator."

    "Methods": "A decision-analytic model was developed in Microsoft Excel to examine costs and health outcomes associated with the use of blood-based brain biomarker tests and CT scanning for screening patients presenting to the ED with suspected mTBI. The model was developed from a French health care perspective with a lifetime time horizon. Costs are presented in 2020 euros. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 2.5% up to 30 years and 1.5% thereafter.13Details are available inSupplementary Appendix S1.\n\nAll data used to populate the model are publicly available, and no patient-level data were used in this model. Thus, review/approval by an institutional review board was not required.\n\nPatient population\nThe target patient population was adults age \u226518 years who presented to the ED with suspected mTBI (GCS score of 13\u201315) within 12\u2009h of injury.\n7\n,\n14\n\nComparators\nBiomarkers in this analysis included S100B or GFAP+UCH-L1 along with standard clinical assessment for mTBI. GFAP and UCH-L1 are two different brain-specific protein biomarkers approved by the FDA for use within 12\u2009h of injury in patients age \u226518 years with suspected mTBI.\n15\nS100B has high clinical sensitivity for abnormal head CT scans in patients with isolated head trauma when measured within 6\u2009h of head injury.\n7\n,\n16\nIn real-world practice, patients exhibiting symptoms of mTBI may arrive at the ED within 6\u2009h of injury or later. Thus, the proportion of patients arriving during the first hours following injury will vary in different hospital settings. When using biomarkers with time window restrictions, hospitals need to revert to using CT scanning as the primary evaluation method when patients arrive outside the approved time window. As such, we evaluated a number of hospital scenarios in which all patients with mTBI arrive at the ED within 12\u2009h of injury and are eligible for screening with one of the biomarkers, CT, or a combination of one of the biomarkers and CT.\nThree comparisons were performed (\nFig. 1\n):\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nScreening comparisons.\n(A)\nGFAP+UCH-L1 versus CT scan.\n(B)\nGFAP+UCH-L1 versus S100B.\n(C)\nHospital A with GFAP+UCH-L1 versus Hospital B with S100B and CT Scan.

Jehl\u00e9 and colleagues\n17\nreported in an expert consensus that even though approved for use within 6\u2009h of injury, an S100B test performed within 3\u2009h allows for maximal sensitivity (close to 100%).\n\nModel structure\nThe model is a decision tree structure (\nFig. 2\n) to simulate short- and long-term costs and outcomes. Patients enter the model by presenting to the ED with a suspected mTBI. At this visit, after clinical examination, patients are screened with a head CT or one of the biomarker tests to evaluate the presence or absence of lesions (i.e., non-neurosurgical lesions or lesions requiring surgical evacuation). Diagnostic performance of the CT scan and biomarker tests (i.e., sensitivity and specificity) is used to evaluate this presence. In patients who have a positive biomarker test result, a CT scan is performed to confirm the presence of ICLs. Depending on the biomarker test outcome and/or the CT results, patients may be discharged immediately from the ED, kept for <24-h observation, or admitted to a short-stay general ward or neurosurgery ward. Patients without lesions may be discharged immediately or kept for short-term observation.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nModel structure.\na\nValue in parentheses represents probability of proceeding through this branch and varies by model comparator. CCU, critical care unit; ED, emergency department; GP, general practitioner; mTBI , mild traumatic brain injury.\nPatients with lesions receiving a correct diagnosis (true-positive) are assumed to receive appropriate care and have optimal outcomes. Patients with lesions who are misdiagnosed (false-negative) may be treated properly based on clinical judgment. However, a small portion of these patients may be discharged, further deteriorate, and require readmission for further evaluation. For these patients, delays in appropriate treatment may lead to suboptimal health outcomes and increased costs. Patients requiring neurosurgical intervention may receive additional (follow-up) CT scans. Patients with false-positive biomarker test results are likely to get a head CT and thus incur additional costs. Patient flow within the decision tree is presented in\nFigure 2\nand is based on clinical opinion of French health professionals (ED physicians, neurosurgeons, and intensivists) involved in the care of mTBI patients.\nLesion presence and appropriate and timely patient management will affect patient outcomes as measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Post-discharge, patients are assumed to remain in their resulting GOS health state for the remainder of their lifetime. Costs and outcomes are accrued specific to these GOS health states and the resulting resource use incurred in the initial admission and/or readmission.\n\nLesion prevalence\nThe prevalence of ICL types in patients with mTBI was obtained from the ALERT-TBI pivotal trial (\nTable 1\n).\n14\nThis prevalence was found to be similar to the prevalence reported by Smits and associates.\n18\nTable 1.\nPrevalence, Sensitivity, and Specificity\nModel parameter\nBase-case estimate (range)\nPrevalence in GCS score 13\u201315\nBase-case values\n14\nAlternative values\n18\nNo lesion\n93.84% (97.06%-93.84%)\n92.36% (84.64%-100.00%)\nNon-neurosurgical lesion\n5.91% (2.81%-5.91%)\n7.10% (6.26%-8.05%)\nNeurosurgical lesion\n0.26% (0.12%-0.26%)\n0.53% (0.33%-0.85%)\nOpen in a separate window\nBiomarker sensitivity/specificity\nGFAP+UCH-L1 (GCS score 13-15)\n19\nGFAP+UCH-L1 (GCS score 13-15) alternative values\n20\nGFAP+UCH-L1 (GCS score 14-15)\n14\nGFAP+UCH-L1 (GCS score 15)\n20\nGFAP+UCH-L1 (real world)\n21\nS100B\n22\nS100B alternative values\n16\nSpecificity (no lesion)\n0.365 (0.342-0.387)\n0.404 (0382-0.427)\n0.367 (0.345-0.390)\n0.411 (0.387-0.434)\n0.250 (0.200-0.300)\n0.310 (0.270-0.360)\n0.300 (0.290-0.310)\nSensitivity (non-neurosurgical lesion)\n0.975 (0.929-0.995)\n0.958 (0.906-0.982)\n0.973 (0.924-0.994)\n0.957 (0.896-0.983)\n1.000 (0.820-1.000)\n0.960 (0.920-0.980)\n0.990 (0.960-1.000)\nSensitivity (neurosurgical lesion)\n1.000 (0.800-1.000)\n1.000 (0.800-1.000)\n1.000 (0.631-1.000)\n1.000 (0.800-1.000)\n1.000 (0.820-1.000)\n1.000 (0.800-1.000)\n1.000 (0.800-1.000)\nOpen in a separate window\nGCS, Glasgow Coma Scale; GFAP+UCH-L1, glial fibrillary acidic protein and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1.\n\nSensitivity and specificity\nSensitivity and specificity for GFAP+UCH-L1 was obtained from the prospective clinical study ALERT-TBI upon which the U.S. FDA's approval decision was based.\n19\nAnalyses using another diagnostic platform to measure GFAP+UCH-L1 in slightly reduced ALERT-TBI populations resulted in alternative sets of sensitivity and specificity values that were examined in sensitivity analysis.\n14\n,\n20\nIn addition, sensitivity and specificity values for the GFAP+UCH-L1 combination, using alternative GFAP and UCH-L1 cutoff values in a cohort of 349 adult patients with mTBI in a Level 1 U.S. trauma center, were examined for completeness.\n21\nThe sensitivity and specificity of S100B was obtained from a meta-analysis performed to examine the efficacy of various blood-based protein biomarkers for diagnosing TBI.\n22\nThe data from that study are similar to the sensitivity and specificity of S100B reported in the S100B product characteristics,\n16\nwhich are examined in a sensitivity analysis.

However, consistent with an analysis by Pandor and colleagues,\n23\nwe allowed patients to move between health states after year 6 in sensitivity analysis. The percentage of patients moving from their resultant health state after the index event to a GOS 3, 4, or 5 health state is presented in\nTable 2\n. Owing to the absence of data on long-term follow-up of patients with a GOS 2, we conservatively assumed these individuals would stay in GOS 2 unless they died because of all-cause mortality.\n\nRadiation-induced cancer\nAfter a scan, patients were assumed to have an increased lifetime risk of radiation-induced cancer. Stein and associates\n24\nreported an increased lifetime risk of cancer in patients after exposure. We fit an exponential distribution to project risk by age and assumed that the risk increased after every additional scan. As some of the risk data were measured in children and brain biomarkers are approved for use only in adult patients with mTBI, sensitivity analysis was performed in which lifetime risk was projected based on only the last 2 risk data points among individuals who received CT scans at ages 15 and 20 years.\n\nResource use and costs\nPatients progressed through the model using various resources.

In the same study in which Stein and associates\n24\nexamined the risk of radiation-induced cancer, the authors also reported a lifetime risk of mortality due to the occurrence of radiation cancer. An exponential distribution was fit to predict age-specific increased risk of mortality. All-cause mortality was then adjusted in these patients by increasing their risk. As with the radiation-induced cancer incidence, sensitivity analysis was performed in which risk was projected based on only the last 2 risk data points in individuals at ages 15 and 20 years.\n\nModel analysis\nFor each test, lifetime costs and outcomes were derived.

    "Methods": "Only cells expressing opsin on the cell membrane could successfully receive light stimulation. The commonly used methods in the laboratory are: 1) breeding transgenic animal models; 2) virus transfecting targeted cells; and 3) Cre-dependent gene expression.\n\nConstructing a corresponding transgenic animal model is a direct method.33,34In theory, all targeted cells could stably express opsins. But this way has some drawbacks. The generation of transgenic lines is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and specific technical difficulties lead to high costs.33In addition, the low transcriptional activity of endogenous promoters would result in insufficient expression of opsin genes in target cells.34Nevertheless, many researchers still advocate this method because it can produce stable strains and needs no redundant operations on experimental animals.\n\nTransfecting the constructed genome into targeted cells to express specific opsins through viral vectors is also popular33(Fig. 1). Common viral vectors include lentiviruses and recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs). Lentivirus integrates the genome into the host genome and eventually expresses foreign genes.35,36The large size and capacity of lentiviruses are suitable for expressing genes <9\u2009kb in length.35The genome carried by AAV is free from the host genome and can express genes permanently in cells that are not vigorously dividing.35The rAAVs product is high titer and suitable for expressing gene fragments not exceeding 5\u2009kb, which make them far more diffused in the brain injection area than lentivirus.35,37\u201339The properties of AAVs include extremely low immunogenicity, high safety, high stability, and a broad spectrum of infection (almost all major cellsin vivo).35,37These promote the application of AAVs in optogenetics. However, AAVs are limited by low cell infection efficiencyin vitroof most AAV serotypes and the long time (1\u20132 weeks) of exogenous gene expression.39\u201341\n\nInjecting recombinase-dependent (e.g., Cre-dependent) virus or secondary virus containing a targeted recombinase in transgenic recombinase-driven animals can also make targeted cells to express specific opsins.42This method is especially suitable for expressing opsins in cell types without defined promotor sequences, complements the way of AAVs carrying specific promters to infect targeted cells.33Cre-dependent promoters also overcome the low transcriptional activity of some cell-type-specific promoters.33This gene expression method combines transgenic animals with virus injection and is more convenient than only transgenic technology."

    "Methods": "Literature search\nWe followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. We added articles published before March 2015 based on the previous meta-analysis of risk of all-cause dementia after all-severity TBI by Li and colleagues that covered the period from January 1, 1990 to March 31, 2015.\n2\nAdditional primary articles were identified through a systematic search of manuscripts published in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from March 2015 to January 2019. We used a combined text and MeSH heading search strategy including several terms for TBI/brain injury and dementia. The protocol for the meta-analysis was registered on the international prospective register of systematic reviews (Prospero ID CRD42020162106).\n\nInclusion criteria and study selection\nWe first applied broad inclusion criteria to select articles for full-text review based on initial title and abstract review by two independent reviewers. Discrepancies were resolved by a third independent reviewer. We selected studies for full-text review if they were original case control or cohort studies published in peer reviewed journals and if they assessed the association between any severity of TBI and any type of clinical diagnosis of dementia. Studies were excluded if they were book chapters, reviews, or conference abstracts.\nArticles that met broad inclusion criteria underwent full-text review by two independent reviewers who applied detailed inclusion criteria to determine inclusion in the meta-analysis (RCG, AB). Discrepancies were resolved via discussion with a third reviewer (KY). Detailed inclusion criteria were: 1) study assessed all cause TBI as the exposure (which we defined broadly so as to include the many high quality studies published pre-2010 that universally defined the exposure as \u201chead injury/trauma\u201d and not as \u201cTBI\u201d specifically); 2) compared participants without TBI to participants with TBI; 3) ascertained TBI using a TBI screen/interview or International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision or Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9 or 10-CM) codes; 4) evaluated dementia as the outcome; 5) compared participants without dementia to participants who developed dementia; 6) reported at least age-adjusted relative risk estimates or odds ratios with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (Cis; or the corresponding author was able to provide an age-adjusted estimate upon request); 7) reported a mean age of at least 40 years during the study; 8) included sufficient TBI-exposed participants (e.g., for small case-control studies, at least five exposed participants in each group); and 9) included a sufficiently generalizable population (e.g., not restricted to a narrow population of participants with a specific, relatively rare, pre-existing condition such as type-1 diabetes or thalassemia).\n\nData extraction and quality scoring\nThe following data fields were extracted for each study by a single reviewer and then validated by a second reviewer: publication year, study design (cohort or case-control), region, U.S. military veteran status of cohort, sample size, age, TBI ascertainment method, TBI definition/severity, required lag from TBI to dementia diagnosis, dementia ascertainment method, dementia definition, the maximally-adjusted dementia risk estimate reported, adjustment/matching variables applied to reported risk estimate. When possible, mean age of the entire study cohort was extracted. When this was not available, mean age was calculated based on reported mean or median age of cases, controls, or other reported sub-groups within each study.\nQuality scoring was performed by a single reviewer using a modified Newcastle Ottawa Quality Scoring system\n10\ntailored for case-control or cohort studies assessing risk of dementia after TBI. While the Prospero protocol originally stated that we would use the QUADAS tool for quality scoring, the QUADAS tool was designed for diagnostic accuracy studies and was deemed less appropriate for the studies in this meta-analysis. For case control studies, the quality scoring system assessed adequacy of the dementia definition, representativeness of the dementia cases, selection of controls, definition of controls, comparability of cases and controls, and quality and comparability of the TBI exposure ascertainment. For cohort studies, the quality scoring system assessed representativeness of the TBI-exposed cohort, selection of the no TBI cohort, ascertainment of the TBI exposure, demonstration that the dementia outcome was not present at the start of the study, comparability of the TBI and no TBI cohorts, and quality of assessment of dementia outcome. Itemized scores for each study are reported in the\nSupplementary Data\n.\n\nStatistical analysis\nBecause prevalence of dementia is low, odds ratios (ORs) were considered an approximation of risk ratios (RRs), per the rare disease assumption.\n11\n,\n12\nBecause studies reporting hazard ratios (HRs) used incidence for an overall time period, then HRs were considered equivalent to RRs.\n11\nData were pooled using random effects models. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using the I\n2\nstatistic and Q test. RRs for dementia associated with TBI were calculated with a 95% CI and the individual and pooled RRs were visualized using a forest plot. Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot with Hedges G\n13\nand Egger and Begg statistics.\n14\nAll analyses were performed using R version 4.0.2.\nHeterogeneity was analyzed using several statistical approaches, sub-group analyses, and meta-regression analyses. See the\nSupplementary Data\nfor a detailed description of these methods.\nWe calculated population attributable risk (PAR) of dementia due to TBI in the U.S. among relevant sub-populations, including U.S. veterans versus civilians, using the following formula: PAF\u2009=\u2009[P\u2009\u00d7\u2009(HR \u2013 1)] / [1 + P\u2009\u00d7\u2009(HR-1)], where P\u2009=\u2009lifetime prevalence of TBI in the sub-population and HR is the pooled risk estimate in the sub-population. We used the pooled risk estimate, including both cohort and case-control studies, because the pooled risk estimates ultimately were identical for pooled cohort and pooled case-control studies (see the\nResults\nsection).\nFor TBI prevalence, we used the U.S. national prevalence of lifetime TBI exposure derived from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) 2014 TBI module survey, which administered the Ohio State TBI Identification Method (OSU TBI-ID) to a random sub-set of respondents to the 2014 core HRS survey (\nn\n=\u20091489 of the 16,642 non-proxy HRS respondents). The OSU TBI-ID is an NINDS TBI Common Data Element\n15\nand is currently considered a gold standard for self-reported lifetime history of TBI. TBI was defined as any prior history of head injury that resulted in loss of consciousness or peri/post-traumatic amnesia or feeling dazed. Using raking and weight trimming, HRS sampling weights were applied to derive nationally representative prevalence of TBI for the entire community-dwelling older adult population as well as sub-groups identified in the 2000 US Census and 2004 Current Population Survey: males, females, veterans, civilians.\n16\nAdditional background, analysis, and discussion of the unexpectedly lower lifetime prevalence of TBI among U.S. male veterans versus male civilians identified in the Health and Retirement 2014 survey was reported previously.\n9\nPrevalence of TBI reported in this HRS survey is within the range of estimates reported previously by other large population-based surveys among civilian adults of all ages.\n17"

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll studies involving animals were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR)/Naval Medical Research Center and the James J. Peters VA Medical Center. Studies were conducted in compliance with Public Health Service policy on the humane care and use of laboratory animals, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and all applicable federal regulations governing the protection of animals in research.\nAdult male Long Evans rats (250\u2013350\u2009g, 8 weeks of age) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories International (Wilmington, MA). Blast or sham exposures were delivered at 10 weeks of age. All animals were received from the vendor at the same time; blast and sham exposures were performed at the same time and animals were transported together in a single shipment from the Naval Medical Research Center to the Bronx VA. At the Bronx VA they were single housed in the same room under similar housing conditions, and underwent behavioral testing together, which was previously reported.\n17\nAll animals used in this study came from what was referred to as cohort 2 in the study by Perez Garcia and coworkers.\n17\n\nExposure to BOP\nAnesthetized male rats were exposed to overpressure injury using the WRAIR shock tube, which simulates the effects of air-blast exposure under experimental conditions.\n18\n,\n19\nThe steel shock tube has a circular diameter of 30.48\u2009cm and a length of 5.94\u2009m. The tube is divided into a 77.4\u2009cm compression chamber separated from the 5.18\u2009m expansion chamber by polyethylene Mylar\nTM\nsheets (Du Pont, Wilmington, DE, USA) that control the peak pressure generated. The peak pressure at the end of the expansion chamber was determined by piezoresistive gauges specifically designed for pressure-time (impulse) measurements (Model 102M152, PCB, Piezotronics, Depew, NY, USA).\nSubjects were anesthetized with isoflurane and placed in the shock tube lying prone, with the plane representing a line from the tail to the nose directly in line with the longitudinal axis of the shock tube, and the head placed more upstream. To prevent movement during the blast exposure, 1.5\u2009cm diameter flattened rubber tourniquets were used to restrain the animals. Subjects were randomly assigned to sham or blast conditions and were placed in the shock tube. Additional details of the physical characteristics of the blast wave were previously described.\n18\nBlast-exposed animals received 74.5\u2009kPa exposures (equivalent to 10.8 psi, duration 4.8\u2009ms, impulse 175.8\u2009kPa/ms) delivered once a day for 3 consecutive days. Sham-exposed (control) animals received anesthesia and were placed in the blast tube but did not receive a blast exposure. Within 10 days after the last blast or sham exposure, animals were transported in a climate-controlled van from the WRAIR to the James J. Peters VA Medical Center (Bronx, NY, USA) where all other procedures were performed.\n\nAnimal housing\nAnimals were housed at a constant 70\u201372\no\nF temperature with rooms on a 12:12\u2009h light cycle with lights on at 7 a.m. All animals were individually housed in standard clear plastic cages equipped with Bed-O'Cobs laboratory animal bedding (The Andersons, Maumee, OH, USA) and EnviroDri nesting paper (Sheppard Specialty Papers, Milford, NJ, USA). Access to food and water was\nad libitum\n.\n\nTissue collection\nAnimals were euthanized at 6 weeks and 12 months after the last blast exposure by CO\n2\ninhalation. Prior to tissue collection, the animals were subjected to extensive behavioral testing; the results of this analysis have been published previously.\n17\nAfter euthanasia, the brain was extracted and regionally dissected as previously described.\n20\nBriefly after the removal of the cerebellum, the brain was placed ventral side up and a coronal cut was made anterior to the optic chiasm and anterior commissure. Cortical tissue surrounding this area (including somatosensory, motor, and frontal cortical regions) was designated as the anterior cortex. The amygdala was obtained by dissecting all tissue lateral to the hypothalamus between its rostral and caudal borders to the rhinal sulcus. The tissue was then placed dorsal side up, the hemisphere reflected out, and the hippocampus dissected based on its typical morphology. The posterior cortex (mainly posterior somatosensory, insular, auditory, and visual cortex) was included in the remainder of the hemispheres after dissection of the thalamus and caudate-putamen. All tissue was flash frozen and maintained at -80\u00b0C until processed. Regions from the right and left hemispheres were collected separately, and for this study all tissue analyzed came from the right hemisphere. The amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cortex, and cerebellum regions were analyzed.\n\nRNA isolation, library construction, sequencing, and data analysis\nTissues were homogenized with the Qiazol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) and the RNA was further purified with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA quality and integrity was assessed with the RNA Nano 6000 assay kit of the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). All RNAs used for library generation had an integrity number (RIN) >8 and an A\n260\n/\n280\nratio \u22652. Library construction and sequencing were performed by Novogene Corporation (Durham, SC, USA). Libraries were constructed from 1\u2009\u03bcg of total RNA using the NEBNextUltraRNA Library Prep kit from Illumina (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, sequenced on an Illumina Platform, and 125/150\u2009bp reads were generated. Raw reads were cleaned by removing reads containing adapters, poly-N, and low-quality reads. Paired-end clean reads were aligned to the reference rat genome using HISAT2.\n21\nFeatureCounts v1.5.0-p3 was used to count the read number to each gene.\n22\nDifferential expression analysis was performed using the DESeq2 R package (1.14.1).\n23\nThe resulting\np\nvalues were adjusted with the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg procedure to control for false discovery rate (FDR) and genes with adjusted\np\nvalue (\np\nadj\n) < 0.05 were considered to be differentially expressed. Ingenuity pathway (IPA, Qiagen) core analysis was used to search for gene enrichment, canonical pathways, genetic networks, and upstream regulatory genes. Longitudinal comparisons were made between (1) sham at 12 months versus sham at 6 weeks and (2) blast at 12 months versus blast at 6 weeks. There were no cross comparisons between blast and sham animals. In the longitudinal studies, adjusted\np\nvalues were not further corrected for the independent sham and blast comparisons.\n\nQuantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)\nTotal RNA was reverse transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The resulting cDNA was diluted 1:20 and used for qPCR analysis. qPCR was performed using 2\u2009\u03bcl of diluted cDNA with the TaqMan Gene Expression mastermix (ThermoFisher) in a 10\u2009\u03bcl reaction. The following TaqMan assays (ThermoFisher) were used: Slc1a2 (Rn00691548_m1), P2ry12 (Rn02133262_s1), Ctsb (Rn00575030_m1), Sorbs1 (Rn01538740_m1), Hapln1 (Rn00569884_m1), Sqstm1 (Rn00709977_m1), Gapdh (Rn01775763_g1), GusB (Rn00566655_m1), Ppia (Rn00690933_m1) and Ywhaz (Rn00755072_m1). Relative gene expression was calculated with the 2\n-\u25b3\u25b3Ct\nmethod using the geometric mean of Gapdh, GusB, Ppia and Ywhaz (housekeeping genes not found to be altered in the RNA-sequencing analysis) to normalize expression. Samples from animals at 6 weeks post-blast exposure were used as the reference condition. Data were analyzed by two-tailed\nt\ntests using GraphPad Prism 9.0 with\np\n<\u20090.05 considered significant."

    "Methods": "Participants\nThis single-site, prospective observational study included active members of a National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I women's water polo team. Exclusion criteria included a history of neurological conditions (e.g., seizures/epilepsy, stroke, closed head injuries with loss of consciousness greater than 15\u2009min, brain tumor, multiple sclerosis), a history of vestibular, ocular, or vision dysfunction (e.g., macular degeneration), any head, neck, or face injury in the three months before the study (e.g., concussion, eye injury), and self-reported pregnancy or possibility of being pregnant.\nOne participant left the team during the second week of the eight-week head impact monitoring period and was excluded thereafter. One participant received a diagnosis of a concussion during the sixth week of the eight-week head impact monitoring period and was excluded thereafter. See\nFigure 1\nfor the study flow. All data collection activities were approved by the Institutional Review Board at Indiana University, and all participants gave written informed consent before participation.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nStudy design and sampling time points.\n\nHead impact monitoring\nAll participants were fitted with Impact Monitoring Mouthguards (firmware v2.0.17, Prevent Biometrics Inc., Minneapolis, MN). Embedded within the mouthguard, a triaxial accelerometer (ADXL372, Analog Devices, Boston, MA) and gyroscope (BMG250, Bosch, Gerlingen, Germany) captures six-degrees-of-freedom spatial and temporal estimates of linear and rotational head acceleration during impacts. When one axis of acceleration exceeds a threshold of 5\ng\n, impact data are collected for 50\u2009msec at a sampling rate of 3.2\u2009kHz.\nThe impact data are processed using firmware within the mouthguard and are stored until a Bluetooth low-energy connection is established with the Prevent iOS application (v1.1.11). A proximity sensor within the mouthguard ensures data are only captured when the mouthguard is in contact with the upper dentition. In accordance with manufacturer recommendations, research personnel synced the mouthguards with the Prevent iOS application before and after every training session. Participants could opt to wear their mouthguards for a one-week familiarization period immediately before the head impact monitoring period. Impact data were collected across the eight-week head impact monitoring period during fall pre-season training, for a total of 38 training sessions, one intrateam scrimmage, one friendly scrimmage against team alumni, and two intercollegiate scrimmages.\nFor all training sessions and scrimmages during the head impact monitoring period, mouthguards were distributed at the end of the swimming warm-up period. Participants wore their mouthguards through the conclusion of the training session/scrimmage. Research personnel collected the mouthguards, placed them in the solo charging cases, and then placed the solo charging cases in the team case for charging until the next session. During all training sessions, research personnel visually monitored the athletes and noted session start and end times. Impacts with PLA \u226510\ng\nwere retained for analysis. The outcome measures for head impact exposure as detected by the Impact Monitoring Mouthguards included frequency of impacts, PLA (\ng\n), and peak rotational acceleration (PRA, krad/s\n2\n).\nVideo validation of head impact measurements\nTen training sessions (eight practices and the two scrimmages) were recorded. Three research personnel independently categorized the impacts sustained during the recorded sessions as either true positives (defined as an observable impact to the head) or false positives (no impact observed in the recording). The positive predictive value (PPV) was calculated using the following formula.\nP\nP\nV\n=\nT\nr\nu\ne\nP\no\ns\ni\nt\ni\nv\ne\ns\nT\nr\nu\ne\np\no\ns\ni\nt\ni\nv\ne\ns\n+\nF\na\nl\ns\ne\nP\no\ns\ni\nt\ni\nv\ne\ns\n\nDaily menstrual cycle and hormonal contraceptive use reporting\nParticipants completed daily surveys (Qualtrics, Provo, UT) to confirm they were still taking/using their prescribed hormonal contraceptive, if applicable, and to record any menstrual bleeding.\n\nSerum sample collection and analysis\nAt each of the six time points involving a blood sample collection (\nFig. 1\n), a trained phlebotomist collected up to 6\u2009mL of venous blood from the antecubital region into a sterile serum vacutainer tube (BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ). One participant reported a severe fear of needles during enrollment; therefore, all six of her samples were collected using Tasso-SST devices (Tasso, Inc., Seattle, WA). Both venous and capillary samples were allowed to clot at room temperature for a minimum of 30\u2009min and then were centrifuged at 1500\u2009g for 15\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. Serum was aliquoted into 1.5\u2009mL Eppendorf tubes and stored at -80\u00b0C until analysis. One serum sample from the post2 time point was missing because of phlebotomy difficulty; however, it should be noted that this participant did not play in the intercollegiate scrimmage because of an injury.\nSerum NfL and GFAP concentrations were measured using Simoa\n\u00ae\nHuman Neurology 2-Plex B assay (N2PB) kits and the Simoa\n\u00ae\nSR-X Biomarker Detection System (Quanterix\u2122, Lexington, MA). The limits of detection (LOD) for the SR-X N2PB kit are 0.071\u2009pg/mL and 0.410\u2009pg/mL for NfL and GFAP, respectively. The functional lower limits of quantification (LLOQ) are 1.60\u2009pg/mL and 16.6\u2009pg/mL for NfL and GFAP, respectively. The concentration of NfL and GFAP in the samples were interpolated from a calibration curve fit with a four-parameter logistic equation (1/y\n2\nweighting). Twenty percent of the serum samples were assayed in duplicate. All samples from each participant were assayed on the same plate to minimize intrasubject variation. To minimize interplate variation, the same researcher performed all assays.\n\nSaliva sample collection and hormone assays\nSaliva samples were collected at four time points: (1) at baseline, before the start of the eight-week head impact monitoring period, (2) the day of Scrimmage I, (3) the day of Scrimmage II, and (4) at the final, follow-up time point (\nFig. 1\n). For all sample collections, participants were instructed to passively drool into the provided, labeled conical tube immediately on waking and before eating, drinking, or brushing teeth. Participants collected at least 2\u2009mL of saliva and brought the samples with them to the pool in the morning. Samples were separated into 500\u20131000\u2009\u03bcL aliquots and stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis.\nOn the day of analysis, samples were thawed in a warm water bath for 60\u2009min and centrifuged at 1500\ng\nfor 15\u2009min. Salivary progesterone was measured using Progesterone Saliva ELISA kits (PRG32-K01, Eagle Biosciences, Inc., Nashua, NH). Salivary estradiol was quantified using Salivary 17\u03b2-Estradiol EIA kits (1-3702, Salimetrics, State College, PA). The assay range for the progesterone assay was 20\u20135000\u2009pg/mL with a lower limit of sensitivity of 20\u2009pg/mL; the dynamic assay range for the estradiol assay was 1\u201332\u2009pg/mL with a lower limit of sensitivity of 0.1\u2009pg/mL. Eighty-eight (88) percent and 81% of samples were assayed in duplicate with mean coefficients of variations (CV) of 1.8% and 3.1% for the progesterone and estradiol assays, respectively.\nFor both assays, absorbance was measured by a microplate reader (BioTek PowerWave XS, Winooski, VT) with Gen5\u2122 Reader Control Software. Salivary hormone concentrations were interpolated from concentrations on a standard curve. To minimize intraparticipant variance, all samples from each participant were tested on the same plate. To minimize interplate variance, one researcher performed all hormone assays. Three samples from the follow-up time point were unusable because of high viscosity.\n\nStatistical analysis\nTo test the first hypothesis, we fit linear mixed effects models with blood biomarker concentrations (NfL or GFAP) at baseline, pre1, pre2, and follow-up time points as the outcome variable with fixed effects for time (a continuous variable, defined as the number of days from the first day of the head impact monitoring period), hormonal contraceptive use (a binary variable), salivary estradiol concentration, and salivary progesterone concentration. A random intercept was set for each participant to account for baseline differences in NfL and GFAP concentrations. Models were estimated using the Restricted Maximum Likelihood method. Variance inflation factors (VIF) were calculated and examined to check for multi-collinearity.\nBiomarker concentrations from the two post-scrimmage time points (post1 and post2) were not included in the mixed effects regression models because of the potential acute effect of participating in the scrimmages, as suggested by previous reports that NfL and GFAP peak 20\u201324\u2009h after subconcussive head impact exposure.\n19\n,\n22\nNext, the relationship between change in biomarker concentration from baseline to follow-up and head impact kinematics was examined by fitting three linear regression models per biomarker with either total number of impacts, cumulative PLA, or cumulative PRA as the predictor and hormonal contraceptive use included as a covariate. The level of significance was adjusted by Bonferroni correction to account for the three comparisons per biomarker (i.e., adjusted\np\n=\u20090.05/3\u2009=\u20090.017).\nNext, we examined the relationship between acute exposure and acute changes in serum NfL and GFAP using two sets of linear regression models. The change in serum biomarker concentration from pre- to post-scrimmage was the outcome variable, and acute head impact exposure (number of hits, cumulative PLA, or cumulative PRA) was the predictor. The model was adjusted for cumulative head impact exposure before the scrimmage (number of hits, cumulative PLA, or cumulative PRA). For each set of three linear regression models per biomarker, the level of significance was adjusted by Bonferroni correction (i.e.,\np\n=\u20090.05/3\u2009=\u20090.017) to account for multiple comparisons.\nAll analyses were performed using R (version 4.1.2). Mixed effects models were fit using \u201clme4\u201d and \u201clmerTest\u201d packages.\n34\n,\n35\nAll tests were two-sided, and the level of significance was set to\np\n=\u20090.05 unless otherwise specified."

    "Methods": "Search strategy\nA literature search was conducted to extract articles with neuroimaging and NPS components among human TBI patients. PubMed (MEDLINE\n\u00ae\n), PsycINFO, Embase, and Scopus databases were used to obtain relevant articles. Boolean searches were kept broad in the interest of reflecting all neuroimaging modalities and to capture broad domains of neuropsychiatric symptomatology. TBI literature takes many different approaches to definition, severity, population, and timing of assessment, necessitating a relatively general approach to the literature search. We employed 41 imaging-, 35 NPS-, and 15 TBI-related keywords. Exact search phrases and MeSH search field qualifiers are outlined in\nSupplementary Appendix SA1\n.\n\nReview protocol\nThis review adhered to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA) guidelines for implementation and reporting of systematic reviews.\n37\nA summary of the review protocol, including the number of articles included and excluded in each step, can be found in\nFigure 1\n. In the first level of the screening process, titles and abstracts were reviewed in parallel for determination of inclusion or exclusion. Individuals in dyads were blind to each other's determinations, and an identical data extraction sheet was utilized by all reviewers. Discrepancies and cases in which a reviewer was unsure were routed to a third-party reviewer for a final decision. All included articles were then subjected to a full-text review by dyads, again followed by a reappraisal if necessary. The resulting article cohort was then divided into six NPS domains: PTSD, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, behavior/personality change, and psychosis. The present review focuses on the NPS domain of PTSD. A series of subsequent reviews focused on the other NPS domains will be published from these same efforts.\n38\n,\n39\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nArticle selection process.\n\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nFor both title/abstract and full-text reviews, a standardized set of inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. Articles were excluded if they: (1) lacked any one of the three key elements (i.e., neuroimaging, NPS, and TBI), (2) Were of an undesirable study type (i.e., case reports/case series with\nn\n<\u20095, editorials, commentary letters, replies to editor, book reviews, non-peer-reviewed articles, conference proceedings, poster abstracts, dissertations), (3) were not written in English, and/or (4) the study population had no human participants or adult (\u226518 years) data. Articles were\nnot\nexcluded on the basis of TBI severity, singularity, or reoccurrence of TBI, acuity or chronicity of NPS, neuroimaging modality, or whether neuroimaging was conducted in the acute (\u226448\u2009h), subacute (2 days \u2013 2 weeks), or chronic (\u22656 months) time span post-TBI. This information was, however, collected for all articles for exploratory purposes.\nThe final articles selected for the present review focusing on PTSD met all of the following additional criteria: they (1) statistically analyzed the relationship between neuroimaging findings and either a diagnosis of PTSD or PTSD symptom severity in individuals with clearly defined TBI, (2) Included a group of participants with clinician-diagnosed PTSD, (3) had a clear TBI definition for participants included in the study (formalized or study-specific criteria with any combination of Glasgow Coma Scale score, loss/alteration in consciousness, and/or post-traumatic amnesia), and (4) quantified the time interval between TBI occurrence and acquisition of neuroimaging. Articles that fulfilled these criteria were then organized based on imaging modality. Originally, we planned to include only studies that conducted neuroimaging in participants with both clinician-diagnosed TBI and clinician-diagnosed PTSD; as no studies met both criteria, clinician-diagnosed TBI was not used as an inclusion criterion for this review.\n\nArticle quality\nAll of the articles included in this study were reviewed for sources of potential bias and methodological quality using the Newcastle\u2013Ottawa Scale.\n40\nThe Newcastle\u2013Ottawa Scale helps evaluate risks associated with selection bias, comparability of comparison groups (e.g., risk of potential confounders), and the validity of outcome/exposure ascertainment for observational, non-randomized investigation. The scale has distinct evaluation criteria for case-control and cohort studies. In this review, articles were determined to be case-control or cohort studies based on the outcome of interest to the present systematic review, not necessarily the article's primary outcome. Each article was independently scored by a dyad of reviewers (A.I.E. and B.R.B. or D.A.S.) followed by a consensus process to address any differences. For each item scale, bias was scored as high, low, or unclear."

    "Methods": "Animals\nGF C57BL/6J and SPF C57BL/6J 8-week-old male mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) weighing 20\u201325\u2009g were used. Animals were housed five per cage and had free access to water and food with a 12-h light/dark cycle. GF mice were housed in the Gnotobiotic Core Facility at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, including during the period of fecal microbiota transplant, until controlled cortical impact. Thereafter, GF mouse cages were sealed shut and not opened until the mice were euthanized.\n\nControlled cortical impact (CCI)\nAll procedures were approved by the Washington University Animal Studies Committee (Protocol 19-0864) and are consistent with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of animals. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane at induction, followed by maintenance at 2% isoflurane for the procedure's duration. Buprenorphine sustained release (0.5\u2009mg/kg subcutaneously) was administered before scalp incision. The head was shaved and ear bars were used to stabilize the head within the stereotaxic frame (MyNeurolab, St. Louis, MO). Then, a single 5-mm craniectomy was performed using an electric drill on the left lateral side of the skull centered 2.7\u2009mm lateral from the midline and 3\u2009mm anterior to lambda. A 3-mm electromagnetic impactor tip was aligned with the craniectomy site at 1.2\u2009mm left of midline and 1.5\u2009mm anterior to the lambda suture. The impact was delivered at 2\u2009mm depth (velocity 5\u2009m/sec, dwell time 100\u2009ms) inducing CCI. The ears bars were released immediately after the injury. All animals then received a loose-fitting plastic cap secured over the craniectomy with Vetbond (3M, St. Paul, MN). The skin was closed with interrupted sutures and was treated with antibiotic ointment before the mouse recovered from anesthesia on a warming pad.\n\nAntibiotic-induced depletion of the microbiota\nTo deplete the bacterial microbiota, we used broad-spectrum antibiotics in the drinking water: 250\u2009mg vancomycin, 500\u2009mg neomycin-sulfate, 500\u2009mg ampicillin, 500\u2009mg metronidazole (VNAM), and 10\u2009g grape Kool-Aid (Kraft Heinz, IL, Chicago) in 500\u2009mL water, which was sterile filtered through a 0.22\u2009\u03bcm filter as previously described.\n12\n\nFecal microbiota transplantation\nWe performed two FMTs of the gut microbiota from VNAM- or Kool-Aid-treated uninjured animals into GF mice at Day 0 and Day 7 prior to injury (\nFig. 1A\n). After 7 days of VNAM and Kool-Aid treatment, we extracted 10 pellets from each group right before Day 0 and Day 7 to make a fresh fecal slurry. We used a different cohort of VNAM mice (5 mice each) for each extraction. Briefly, four to five mouse fecal pellets were collected 7 days after VNAM or Kool-Aid treatment. The pellets were mixed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and after 5\u2009min, the sample was vortexed to break up the fecal matter and allowed to sit for \u223c5\u2009min to allow for debris to settle. The supernatant was then removed with an uncut P1000 pipette tip into a sterile 5\u2009mL tube to avoid material clogging the gavage needle. Mice were gavaged with a sample volume of 250\u2009\u03bcL. Ten days after the last FMT, we performed CCI in all the mice and they remained in sealed cages in the animal facility for 7 days before being euthanized.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nFecal microbiota transplantation from antibiotic-treated mice induces gut microbial dysbiosis in germ-free (GF) mice over time.\n(A)\nExperimental design; GF mice were gavaged with two fecal microbiota transplants (FMT) of the gut microbiota from mice treated with vancomycin, neomycin, ampicillin, and metronidazole (VNAM) (GF-VNAM) or Kool-Aid (GF-Kool-Aid) uninjured animals on Day 0 and Day 7. Ten days after the second FMT, we then performed controlled cortical impact (CCI) on the fecal transplant recipient GF mice.\n(B)\nCeca from GF-Kool-Aid (control) and GF-VNAM mice.\n(C)\nGraph depicts of richness and Shannon \u03b1-diversity index of grouped data.

Adonis (PERMANOVA) analysis (***\np\n<\u20090.001).\n\nFecal bacterial 16S rRNA gene analysis\nFecal pellets were collected into sterile 1.7\u2009mL tubes. Phenol:chloroform-extracted DNA from fecal pellets was used for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. For 16S sequencing, primer selection and polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were performed as described previously.\n14\nBriefly, each sample was amplified in triplicate with Golay-bar coded primers specific for the V4 region (F515/R806), combined, and confirmed by gel electrophoresis. PCR reactions contained 18.8\u2009\u03bcL RNase/DNase-free water, 2.5\u2009\u03bcL 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009High Fidelity PCR Buffer (Invitrogen, 11304\u2013102), 0.5\u2009\u03bcL 10\u2009mM deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), 1\u2009\u03bcL 50\u2009mM MgSO\n4\n, 0.5\u2009\u03bcL each of the forward and reverse primers (10\u2009\u03bcM final concentration), 0.1\u2009\u03bcL Platinum High Fidelity Taq (Invitrogen, 11304\u2013102), and 1.0\u2009\u03bcL genomic DNA. Reactions were held at 94\u00b0C for 2\u2009min to denature the DNA, with amplification proceeding for 26 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 15\u2009sec, 50\u00b0C for 30\u2009sec, and 68\u00b0C for 30\u2009sec; a final extension of 2\u2009min at 68\u00b0C was added to ensure complete amplification. Amplicons were pooled and purified with 0.6\u2009\u00d7\u2009Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman-Coulter, A63882) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The final pooled samples, along with aliquots of the three sequencing primers, were sent to the DNA Sequencing Innovation Lab (Washington University School of Medicine) for sequencing by the 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009250\u2009bp protocol with the Illumina MiSeq platform.\nRead quality control and the resolution of amplicon sequence variants were performed with the dada2 R package.\n15\nAmplicon sequence variants that were not assigned to the kingdom bacteria were filtered out. The remaining reads were assigned taxonomy using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP trainset 16/release 11.5) 16S rRNA gene sequence database.\n16\nEcological analyses, such as alpha-diversity (richness, Faith's phylogenetic diversity) and beta-diversity analyses (weighted UniFrac distances), were performed using PhyloSeq and additional R packages.\n17\n\nCell isolation from brain and blood samples\nThe blood and the regions of interest in the ipsilateral brain (hippocampus and cortex) were harvested 7 days after injury. Five animals (from all conditions) were processed per day with a total of 20 samples at the time. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and blood samples were taken in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes immediately before transcardial perfusion with ice-cold 0.1\u2009M heparinized PBS. The brain regions of interest were dissected out on ice and digested at 37\u00b0C for 15\u2009min with collagenase D (400 units/mL, Roche) in Dulbecco's PBS (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland), each containing 50\u2009\u03bcg/mL of DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich). The tissue was then mechanically dissociated with a glass Pasteur pipette, filtered through a 70-\u03bcm nylon cell strainer, and centrifuged at 950\u2009rpm for 15\u2009min. A 25% Percoll (Sigma-Aldrich) column was used to remove cell debris and myelin, followed by centrifugation at 1700\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min. A 25\u2009\u03bcL-blood sample was mixed with 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009Red Blood Lysis Buffer (Roche) and incubated in rotation for 15\u2009min at room temperature (RT). Samples were then centrifuged at 3500\u2009rpm for 5\u2009min at RT. The supernatant was discarded, and cells were washed and resuspended in 1\u2009mL of cytometer buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin [Sigma-Aldrich], 5\u2009mM EDTA (Millipore, Burlington, MA) in PBS). Then, the cells were resuspended in 100\u2009\u03bcL of cytometer buffer and stained.\n\nCell isolation of lamina propia (LP) immune cells\nThe small intestines were removed and separated. Peyer's patches were excised, and intestines were cleaned of mesenteric fat and intestinal contents with PBS. Then intestines were opened longitudinally, washed with Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS)/HEPES, cut into 1-cm pieces and placed into 20\u2009ml of HBSS/HEPES 10% bovine calf serum (BCS) and 5\u2009mM EDTA for 20\u2009min at 37\u00b0C. During this period, tissue suspensions were vortexed for 15\u2009sec each 5\u2009min. Tissue pieces were washed with HBSS/HEPES to remove EDTA, minced thoroughly, and placed into 10\u2009mL RMPI with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.01M HEPES, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009kanamycin, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009GlutaMAX\u2122, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009sodium pyruvate, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009non-essential amino acids, 10\u2009mg/mL DNAase I (Roche) and 100\u2009U/mL collagenase IV (Sigma). Tissues were digested at 37\u00b0C for 50\u2009min with constant agitation (250\u2009rpm). The resulting LP cell suspensions were filtered through a 70-\u03bcm nylon cell strainer and washed with 10\u2009mL HBSS/HEPES. LP cell suspensions were collected at 2000\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 4\u2009mL 40% Percoll (GE Healthcare) and overlaid over 3\u2009mL of 80% Percoll. Gradients were centrifuged at 2000\u2009rpm for 20\u2009min at 4\u00b0C, and cells at the interface were collected and washed with 50\u2009mL PBS. Cells were stained for flow cytometric analysis.\n\nFlow cytometry analysis\nCells were incubated for 5\u2009min at room temperature (RT) with Zombie NIR Dye (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) to assess their viability. The Zombie NIR Dye was quenched, and cells were washed with cytometry buffer and blocked with FcR blocking reagent (1:50, Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Then, the samples were washed with cytometry buffer, stained with antibodies (\nTable 1\n) for 15\u2009min at RT, and analyzed on a BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) using the Software v10.6.1 (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Microglial cells were defined as CD45\nlow\nCD11b\n+\nand T cells were defined as CD45\nhigh\nCD11b\n\u2212\nCD3\n+\n. Fluorescence minus one (FMO) and isotype control antibodies were used as negative controls for each marker.\nTable 1.\nOverview of the Primary Antibodies Used in the Present Study\nAntibody\nFluorophore\nClone\nSpecies\nSource\nProduct number\nCD45\nBV425\n30-F11\nRat monoclonal\nBioLegend\n103134\nCD3\u025b\nAF700\n500-A2\nArmenian Hamster monoclonal\nBioLegend\n100320\nCD4\nBUV395\nGK1.5\nRat monoclonal\nBD Biosciences\n565974\nCD8a\nPerCP-Cy5.5\n53-6.7\nRat monoclonal\nBioLegend\n100733\nCD11b\nBV510\nM1/70\nRat monoclonal\nBioLegend\n101263\nTCR \u03b3\u03b4\nFITC\nGL3\nArmenian Hamster monoclonal\nBioLegend\n118105\nCD25\nPE\nPC61\nRat monoclonal\nBioLegend\n102007\nMHC-II\nPerCP-710\nAF6-120.1\nMouse monoclonal\neBioscience\n46-5320-80\nTLR4\nPE-Cy7\nSA15-21\nRat monoclonal\nBioLegend\n145407\nLy6C\nBV785\nHK1.4\nRat monoclonal\nBioLegend\n128041\nLy6G\nAF700\n1A8\nRat monoclonal\nBioLegend\n127622\nNeuN\nA60\nMouse monoclonal\nMillipore\nMAB377\nDCX\nRabbit polyclonal\nAbcam\nAb18723\nBrdU\nBU1/75\nRat monoclonal\nAbcam\nAb6326\nIba1\nNCNP24\nRabbit polyclonal\nWako\n019-19741\nSecondary\nantibody\nAF594\nDonkey anti-rat\nThermo\nFisher\nA-21209\nSecondary\nantibody\nAF647\nDonkey anti-mouse\nThermo\nFisher\nA-31571\nSecondary\nantibody\nAF488\nDonkey anti-rabbit\nThermo\nFisher\nA-21206\nOpen in a separate window\n\nBrdU treatment\nFor the analysis of neurogenesis, the animals received intraperitoneal injections of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU, Sigma-Aldrich) 50\u2009mg/g of body weight at a concentration of 10\u2009mg/mL in sterile saline daily, starting on post-injury Days 3\u20136.\n\nTissue processing\nMice were anesthetized by isoflurane followed by cervical dislocation and transcardial perfusion with ice-cold 0.1\u2009M heparinized PBS (pH 7.4) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). Perfused brains were kept in 4% PFA at 4\u00b0C overnight, followed by equilibration in 30% sucrose for at least 48\u2009h before sectioning.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nHistological sections were examined to assess microglia and neurogenesis alteration in the hippocampus. Immunofluorescence staining was performed on free-floating sections (50-\u03bcm thick). The serial sections were cut on a freezing microtome starting with the appearance of a complete corpus callosum and caudally to bregma -3.08\u2009mm. Sets of 12 sections spaced every 300\u2009\u03bcm were mounted on glass slides and used for immunohistochemical studies. Staining was performed on free-floating sections washed in PBS between applications of primary and secondary antibodies. For BrdU immunostaining, a widely used procedure is to perform an incubation in 1\u2009N HCl (30\u2009min at 45\u00b0C) to denature the DNA after the PBS washes. Normal donkey serum (NDS) (20%) in PBS was used to block non-specific staining for all antibodies. Slices were then incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with the primary antibodies (\nTable 1\n). The following day, antibody binding was detected by incubating sections with Alexa fluorescence secondary antibody (\nTable 1\n) for 2\u2009h. Sections were mounted on glass slides in PBS, dried, and cover-slipped with mounting medium for fluorescence with DAPI.\n\nThree-dimensional reconstruction of microglia\nWe followed a published protocol for microglia morphology analysis:\n6\n50-\u03bcm thick sections were stained with ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) (\nTable 1\n) 4\u00b0C overnight, followed by Alexa Fluor 488\u2013conjugated secondary antibody (\nTable 1\n) staining for 2\u2009h. Sections were mounted on glass slides in tris-buffered saline (TBS)-X, dried, and cover-slipped with mounting medium for fluorescence with DAPI VECTOR Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Imaging was performed on a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss, White Plains, NY) using a 20\u2009\u00d7\u20090.8 NA objective. Z-stacks were done with 1.00-\u03bcm steps in z direction; 1024\u2009\u00d7\u20091024 pixel resolution was recorded and analyzed using IMARIS software (Bitplane, Concord, MA). From each image, three hippocampal microglia that were completely within the z-stack image from the ipsilateral cornu Ammonis (CA)3 striatum radiatum were selected by a blinded observer. The filament tracer function was utilized in IMARIS to quantify branch length, volume, number of branch points, and terminal points. A total of three microglia were analyzed from each mouse.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 9 (La Jolla, CA). Data results are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean. There was no evidence for significant deviations from normal distribution (\np\n>\u20090.05 by Shapiro\u2013Wilk tests). Data were analyzed with student\nt\ntest. All analysis was performed blinded to group assignment."

    "Methods": "The study design and analysis plan were pre-registered with the Open Science Framework Preregister (https://osf.io/3edwq) prior to data analysis, including details about exclusion criteria and blinding. A power analysis was performed to justify the sample sizea priori. A previous study demonstrated a correlation ofR=\u2009-0.41 between fDWI lesion size and the forelimb locomotor assessment scale (FLAS) 28 days after cervical SCI, with a single injury severity.12A broader range of injury severities in this study was expected to result in a larger correlation coefficient than the restricted range, given the same true underlying relationship,13although the extent of the change could not be estimated with certainty. With a power of 0.80 and an \u03b1 of 0.05, 30 animals were used, which was sufficient to detect a correlation ofR=\u20090.437 between MRI markers and functional outcomes.\n\nAnimals\nAll animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at the Medical College of Wisconsin and the Clement J. Zablocki Veterans' Affairs Medical Center in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act and the Health Research Extension Act. All studies were conducted and reported in accordance with the Animal Research: Reporting of\nIn Vivo\nExperiments (ARRIVE) guidelines.\n14\nThis study used a total of 42 Sprague\u2013Dawley (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) adult rats ranging in age from 8 to 10 weeks and weighing 250\u2013300\u2009g, of which 10 were sham and 32 had cervical spinal cord contusion injuries. An equal number of males and females were included in each group. Animals were housed at our facility for 1 week prior to surgery and underwent handling and acclimation to behavioral apparatuses, with supplemental nutritional care to minimize complications or early end-points.\n15\nAnimals were on study for a total of 12 weeks following SCI, with MRI time points at 4\u2009h (3:57\u2009\u00b1\u20090:37), 48\u2009h (48:12\u2009\u00b1\u20090:39), and 12 weeks post-injury. Behavioral testing was performed between 1 and 90 days post-injury (\nFig. 1A\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSummary data for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and behavioral metrics.\n(A)\nStudy timeline including spinal cord injury (SCI) surgery (red), MRI (blue), behavioral tests (green and purple), and euthanasia time points.\n(B)\nSignificant association between prescribed impact height and measured cord compression (\np\n<\u20090.01).\n(C)\nRats were grouped for display purposes: sham, mild (5\u201311\u2009mm), moderate (12\u201318\u2009mm), and severe (19\u201325\u2009mm).

Animals were block randomized to injury severity to ensure equal distributions across all injury severities and to balance the effects of sex.\nAnimals were anesthetized with 4\u20135% inhaled isoflurane and maintained with 1.5\u20133% inhaled isoflurane while respiration was monitored. Animals were placed on a heating pad set at 37\u00b0C. Subcutaneous analgesic and fluids were administered before the start of surgery (carprofen:1.25\u2009mg, lactated Ringer's solution: 5\u2009mL). Their backs were shaved and cleaned with betadine and alcohol. Using aseptic techniques, an incision was made through the skin and the muscle was separated from the spinal column. A dorsal laminectomy was performed at C5, leaving the dura intact. The spine was held in a customized holder for stability, and a contusion injury was performed at the midline with the Multicenter Animal Spinal Cord Injury Study Impactor\n16\nusing a 10\u2009g rod with a 2.5\u2009mm diameter tip. Drop height varied uniformly between 5 and 25\u2009mm, and cord compression was recorded from the impactor software as the distance from the pre-injury spinal cord surface to the point of maximal compression measured during the impact. Sham animals underwent the same laminectomy procedure, but without an impact. The incision site was sutured, and animals recovered under supervision. Post-operative care of analgesic (carprofen: 1.25\u2009mg) and fluids (lactated Ringer's solution: 5\u2009mL) was administered twice a day for a minimum of 3 days. Supplemental nutrition of Ensure, trail mix, or Nutella was provided as needed to prevent excess weight loss. Animals were housed in pairs except for the first 24\u201348\u2009h after surgery, when they were housed singly.\n\nMRI acquisition\nMRI was performed on a 9.4T Bruker Biospec (Paravision 6.0.1, Billerica, MA). At 4 and 48\u2009h post-injury, rats were placed in a prone position inside a 38\u2009mm diameter Litz coil (Doty Scientific, Inc., Columbia, SC). Animals were anesthetized with 4\u20135% inhaled isoflurane and maintained at 2% inhaled isoflurane for the duration of the MRI, adjusted to maintain stable respiration of 30\u201350 breaths per min. Body temperature was maintained within 1\u00b0 of 37\u00b0C with heated air and recorded every 10\u2009min.\nAutomated, fieldmap-based B\n0\nshimming was performed to minimize magnetic field inhomogeneity. T\n1\n-weighted sagittal images were used to position slices over the injury epicenter. Axial and sagittal, multi-echo T\n2\n-weighted rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) images were collected with 8 or 12 slices, respectively, centered around the injury site (repetition time [TR]: 2000\u2009ms; echo time [TE]: 20, 59, and 99\u2009ms; two repetitions; 0.16\u2009mm\n2\nin-plane resolution; 1\u2009mm slice thickness).\nA multi-delay pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) was used to obtain perfusion-weighted images, as previously detailed.\n10\nThe label plane was positioned perpendicular to the vertebral arteries at C7 with a labeling duration of 1100\u2009ms, 400\u2009\u03bcs Hanning pulses, 1\u2009ms pulse repeat, 5\u2009\u03bcT average B1, and 45/5 mT/m G\nmax\n/G\nmean\n). A slice-selective inversion pulse 1555\u2009ms before imaging nulled the signal from cerebral spinal fluid. Four post-label delay times (100, 200, 300, and 400\u2009ms) were collected to minimize the effect of transit time. For sagittal imaging, a single-slice RARE readout with TR/TE\u2009=\u20094000/5\u2009ms, RARE factor\u2009=\u200916, repetitions\u2009=\u20093, in-plane resolution\u2009=\u20090.20\u2009mm\n2\n, slice thickness\u2009=\u20092\u2009mm. For axial imaging, a four-segment echo planar readout was used with eight slices positioned superior to the labeling plane and TR/TE\u2009=\u20094000/13.6\u2009ms, repetitions\u2009=\u20094, in-plane resolution\u2009=\u20090.23\u2009mm\n2\n, slice thickness\u2009=\u20091.25\u2009mm. A proton density-weighted image and images with inversion times of 200, 1500, 3000, and 6000\u2009ms were collected at the end of each pCASL scan. To quantify pCASL inversion efficiency, a flow-compensated gradient-echo axial image was acquired 4\u2009mm superior to the label plane with a short label duration (200\u2009ms) and post-label delay (10\u2009ms), with TR/TE\u2009=\u2009225/3.5\u2009ms, averages\u2009=\u20094, in-plane resolution\u2009=\u20090.28\u2009mm\n2\n, and slice thickness\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm.\nAn fDWI protocol was acquired with separate acquisitions for either sagittal and axial using RARE and echo planar imaging (EPI) readouts, respectively. The diffusion preparations used the same parameters including a high-strength (b\u2009=\u20092000\u2009sec/mm\n2\n) diffusion gradient perpendicular to the cord (filter) with an additional 20 diffusion vectors (b\u2009=\u2009800\u2009sec/mm\n2\n) orthogonal to the first. For RARE imaging, the diffusion preparation preceded the excitation to maintain phase stability and has been described in detail previously\n8\nThe EPI readout used conventional Stejskal\u2013Tanner diffusion gradients with a four-shot echo planar imaging readout and TR/TE\u2009=\u20091800/32\u2009ms, repetitions\u2009=\u20093, slice thickness\u2009=\u20091.25\u2009mm, number of slices\u2009=\u200912. The total protocol duration was \u223c1.5\u2009h.\nAt 12 weeks, an abbreviated MRI protocol was used to image the spinal cord lesions using T\n2\n-weighted imaging, previously shown to correlate with histology of spared tissue.\n12\nRats were placed in a 72\u2009mm diameter quadrature volume coil (Bruker Biospin). Axial and sagittal, multi-echo T\n2\n-weighted RARE images were collected with 12 or 14 slices, respectively, centered around the injury site: TR: 2000/20\u2009ms; TE: 20, 59, and 99\u2009ms; six repetitions, 0.16\u2009mm\n2\nin-plane resolution, 0.6\u2009mm thick thickness. The total protocol duration was \u223c1\u2009h. All MRI sequences are available at\nhttps://osf.io/ngu4a/\n.\n\nImage processing\nA processing pipeline was integrated into Nipype\n17\nand consisted of calculation of quantitative maps followed by spatial registration, available at\nhttps://osf.io/mesz4/\n. Maps of T\n2\nand T\n1\nwere computed using the qMRILab routines implemented in MATLAB as previously described.\n8\nMaps of filtered apparent diffusion coefficient (fADC\n||\n) and SCBF were computed using custom MATLAB routines. fADC\n||\nwas defined as the largest eigenvalue from the estimated 2-dimensional tensor.\n8\nPrevious work has shown that fADC\n||\nis most strongly correlated with long-term functional outcome\n12\n,\n18\nand therefore it was selected as the diffusion metric for this analysis. SCBF was estimated using the weighted delay method for multi-post-label delay acquisition\n19\nusing the T\n1\ntissue map, inversion efficiency, and proton density-weighted image for each data set,\n10\nwith T\n1\nof blood and blood-tissue partition coefficient using literature values of 2380\u2009ms\n20\nand 0.9, respectively.\nTo segment lesions at 12-weeks post-injury, spinal cord masks were initially drawn on T\n2\nmaps in native space, to include both the lesion cavity and the bordering spinal cord tissue. The manual regions of interest (ROIs) were necessary to avoid including surrounding cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the lesion mask. To ensure objectivity, these masks were subsequently thresholded with T\n2\nvalues of 120\u2009ms to generate final lesion-only masks. The threshold of 120\u2009ms was 2 standard deviations above the sham animal mean T\n2\nvalue.\nQuantitative maps and binary masks were spatially registered to a custom template space. Briefly, the\nAtlas of the Rat Spinal Cord\n21\nwas digitized and manually segmented into white and gray matter, noting that each spinal cord level contains a coronal section from a single animal. To enforce symmetry, images and their left\u2013right mirrored versions were iteratively averaged and aligned using a non-linear registration in advanced normalization tools (ANTs). Each image was expanded to a thickness of 3\u2009mm and stacked along the longitudinal axis with the central canal aligned across all levels. The final image was resampled at a resolution of 50\u2009\u00d7\u200950\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u2009mm\n3\n. A CSF region was added as a border region of 2 voxels. All template image files were created to be compatible with the Spinal Cord Toolbox, including maps of segmental levels, centerline, and images to mimic T\n1\nand T\n2\ncontrast. The template is available at\nhttps://osf.io/mesz4/\n. The only manual step was placement of landmarks in the cord at each vertebral level. Automated cord straightening, rigid alignment, and non-linear warping to the template used the Spinal Cord Toolbox.\n22\nLesion volume and minimal cross-sectional area of spared tissue were calculated from the final spinal cord masks. Masks were unwarped into native space but retained the straightening step to ensure that cross-sections were perpendicular to the spinal cord main axis.\n\nBehavioral testing\nA comprehensive behavioral testing protocol was implemented to include measures of locomotion and sensory function. Measures of locomotion included the Basso, Bresnahan, and Beattie (BBB) Scale Test,\n23\nthe forelimb locomotor assessment score (FLAS),\n24\nand the Irvine, Beattie, and Bresnahan (IBB) Forelimb Recovery Scale.\n25\nBBB and FLAS were conducted weekly for the first month and monthly thereafter. The IBB, a manual Von Frey filament test, and a forelimb grip strength test (Bioseb)\n26\nwere conducted at 4, 8, and 12 weeks by the same individual. Behavioral tests were scored from video recordings, and study personnel were blinded to injury severity for all tests and scoring.\n\nStatistical and data analysis\nVoxelwise comparisons between sham and SCI rats for each contrast were evaluated with a two-sample unpaired\nt\ntest and non-parametric permutation inference, based multi-comparison correction of the familywise error rate implemented in FSLrandomise.\n27\nImpact height was used as a covariate to account for within-group variability.\nAn unbiased approach was used to determine the ability of each acute MRI quantitative metric to predict final tissue fate and derive an optimal threshold for differentiating abnormal values. Final tissue fate was defined as the binary lesion from the 12-week MRI. To account for differences between white and gray matter, particularly for fADC\n||\nand SCBF, maps were converted to z scores using the voxelwise mean and standard deviation of the sham group, which included both 4- and 48-h time points. Because the relative percentage of lesion or non-lesion voxels was highly imbalanced, a precision-recall analysis was used in which the area under the curve (AUC) and the optimal threshold were derived from the analysis for each MRI contrast (\nFig. 2\n). Acute MRI quantitative maps were subsequently masked based on the optimal threshold for each metric, to quantify the volume of abnormality in each of the acute contrasts.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nMethods to establish data-derived thresholds\n.\nIndividual registered quantitative metrics (maps of T\n1\n, T\n2\n, filtered apparent diffusion coefficient [fADC\n||\n], and spinal cord blood flow [SCBF]) were transformed into z score maps. Individual 12-week T\n2\nmaps were converted into binary masks of lesion and tissue using a semi-automated process. Precision-recall analysis was performed using the z score maps as the predictor, and binary masks as the predictive outcome. The optimal threshold from the precision-recall was then used to define the lesion mask for each of the individual quantitative metrics.\nLinear regressions were used to evaluate associations between impact height and either 12-week behavioral or MRI metrics. Linear regression was used to determine the predicative value of acute lesion volume from each MRI metric on 12-week functional outcomes. Within-analysis multiple comparisons were accounted for by controlling the false discovery rate,\n28\nand adjusted\np\n-values are reported. To aid visualization, injuries were additionally grouped by impactor drop height into mild (5\u201311\u2009mm), moderate (12\u201318\u2009mm), and severe (19\u201325\u2009mm) ranges, but all quantitative analysis used continuous variables."

    "Methods": "Study design\nWe conducted a prospective observational study of 30 collegiate football players before and after a single team workout session during the non-competitive spring season. Blood was collected immediately before (T0) and at two time-points after the session: immediately (T1) and 45\u2009min (T2) post exertion. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scanning was performed 24\u2009h before (T-1) and 48\u2009h after (T3) the workout session. (\nFig. 1\n) All subjects wore a body-mounted sensor to measure several aspects of physical exertion during the workout session. Subjects were recruited from members of the University of Rochester (UR) Division III football team during the 2018-2019 academic year (\nn\n=\u200915), and the 2019-20 academic year (\nn\n=\u200915). Subjects were eligible for inclusion if they were >18 years old at the time of consent, an active member of the varsity football team, and expected to play in at least one football game over the course of the fall season. Subjects were excluded if they were diagnosed with a concussion within the month prior to study activities or if they had any contraindications to MRI scanning (e.g., dental braces, retained metallic foreign bodies, claustrophobia, etc.). The study protocol and the process of informed consent was reviewed and approved by the University of Rochester Research Subjects Review Board. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to study activities.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nStudy overview. In all subjects (\nn\n=\u200930), blood samples were obtained immediately before (T0) and at two time-points after a workout session; immediately (T1) and 45\u2009min (T2) after. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and concussion symptom inventory were obtained in half the cohort (\nn\n=\u200915) 24\u2009h before (T-1) and 48\u2009h after (T3) the workout.\n\nWorkout session\nThe exertional protocol consisted of a mix of aerobic and resistance training. Athletes were instructed to perform a fixed series of exercises from a comprehensive list but were free to choose specific exercises within series. (\nTable 1\n) Workout sessions occurred in six groups of five subjects approximately 3 months after the last football game of the fall season. Each session took place in the same workout space (62\u2032\u2009\u00d7\u200946\u2032) within the UR varsity training facilities and supervised by research study personnel. This space was temperature-controlled at 70\u00b0F for all sessions.\nTable 1.\nExertional Workout Protocol\nWarm up (all)\nBurpees\u2009\u00d7\u200915\u2009sec\nRussian Hops\u2009\u00d7\u200915\u2009sec\nMountain Climbers\u2009\u00d7\u200915\u2009sec\nOpen in a separate window\nCorrectives (3-4 of the following)\nGoblet Squats\u2009\u00d7\u200910\nBand pull-throughs\u2009\u00d7\u200910\nSingle leg glute bridge\u2009\u00d7\u20096 each\nProne shoulder mobility Prone back and scapula (Y-T-W)\u2009\u00d7\u20095 each DB\nc\n5-10 lbs\nStanding pushups\u2009\u00d7\u200910\nLaying shoulder press\u2009\u00d7\u200910\nOpen in a separate window\nCore lift (3)\nSquat 3 sets of 10-12 reps\nClean Pull 4 sets of 3-5 reps\nRDL\na\nBarbell 3 sets of 10 reps\nDynamic Bench 8 sets of 3 reps\nDynamic Squat 8 sets of 3 reps Bench press 3 sets of 10-12 reps\nBB\nb\nOverhead Press 3 sets of 6 reps BB\nb\nPower Shrugs 3 sets of 6 reps\nSeated Cable Row 3 sets of 8-12 reps\nTriceps Cable push-down 3 sets of 6-10 reps\nSkater Jumps 3 sets of 20-30 secs\nDB\nc\nIncline Press 3 sets of 6 reps\nOpen in a separate window\nMain accessory lifts (2-3)\nOR\nClean progression (all)\nDB\nc\nlunge 3 sets of 8 reps\nDB\nc\nShrug 3 sets of 12 reps\nPull-ups 3 sets of 8-10 reps\nBent over BB row 3 sets of 10 reps\nLandmines 1 set of 8 reps\nNegative Pull-ups 3 sets of 6 reps\nDB\nc\nShoulder Side raises 3 sets of 8-12 reps\nClean pulls\nFront squat\nHang clean\nOpen in a separate window\nTriceps circuit (all)\nOR\nAccessory circuits (2-3)\nOR\nBicep/deltoid circuit (all)\nHalf\nFull\nSkull crushers\nHammer Curls\nFarmer Walk\nRear foot elevated split squats\nMedicine Ball good mornings\nFarmer Plate carry\nUpright row\nOverhead press\nBicep curl\nOpen in a separate window\na\nRomanian dead lift;\nb\nBarbell;\nc\nDumbbell.\nReps, repetitions.\n\nSensor-based measures of physical exertion\nTo capture the intensity and duration of physical exertion, each subject was outfitted with PlayerTek Wearable GPS Tracker (Catapult Sports, Melbourne, Australia) over the upper back, held securely within a lightweight vest fitted to each individual. This device is composed of a 10Hz Global Positioning/Global Navigation Satellite System, a 400\u2009Hz triaxial accelerometer, gyroscope, and a 10\u2009Hz triaxial magnetometer to track player movement and the intensity of physical exertion. Repeat measurements on the same device (intra-unit reliability) vary by 0.01% to <3.0%, with the majority of measurements varying by <1.0%. Within device (inter-unit) test-retest reliability revealed intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.77 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62\u20130.89) to 1.0 (95% CI: 0.99\u20131.0).\n43\nInformation from these four sensors wirelessly uploads to cloud-based software. When combined with manually input data on each subject's body weight, the software calculates total duration of exertion, distance traveled (km), energy expenditure (kilocalories), power score (watts/kg), player load (sum of all accelerations across all axes of the triaxial accelerometer), and work ratio (percentage of activity time during which player was moving at speeds >1.5\u2009m/sec).\n44-46\nIt also detects body impacts >3 Gs,\n47\u201350\nalthough the workout session did not involve any contact between athletes. Data collected by the PlayerTek device was downloaded from the cloud using the PlayerTek Sync Tool (version 5.68).\n\nBlood sampling and analysis\nApproximately 500\u2009\u03bcL of capillary whole blood was obtained from each subject's fingertip using 14-gauge 2-mm incision depth BD Microtainer\n\u00ae\ncontact-activated lancets (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) directly into red stopper BD Microtainer non-sterile tubes (BD Biosciences). Samples were collected immediately prior to the workout session (T0), immediately following the workout session (T1), and 45\u2009min following the workout session (T2). Samples were immediately placed on ice until centrifuged at 12,000 RPM for 7\u2009min at room temperature within 1\u2009h of collection. Aliquoted serum was immediately frozen and stored at -80\u00b0C until analysis.\nSerum levels of NF-L, tau, UCH-L1, and GFAP were measured using a SIMOA\n\u00ae\n4-plex assay kit (Quanterix Corp, Billerica, MA), which is a magnetic bead-based digital enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that allows detection of biomarkers in femtomolar concentrations.\n51\n,\n52\nAll four biomarkers were measured from the same blood sample. Fifty microliters of serum were mixed with either anti-NF-L, anti-tau, anti-UCH-L1, or anti-GFAP antibody-coated paramagnetic capture beads and biotinylated detector antibody. Lower limits of detection were 0.104\u2009pg/mL (NF-L), 0.024\u2009pg/mL (tau), 0.221\u2009pg/mL (GFAP), and 1.74\u2009pg/mL (UCH-L1), and their respective intra-assay coefficients of variation are 5.4%, 6.7%, 3.7%, and 11.3%.\nAssays were batched to minimize variability and technicians were blinded to clinical data and groups, with each batch run with appropriate standards and controls to ensure reliability. Longitudinal samples from the same individual were run on the same plate to reduce potential batch effects. Possible batch effects were minimized by including a standard case and control on all plates that are analyzed. All samples were analyzed in duplicate but could not be re-run in some instances due to the limited amount of serum derived from capillary whole blood. In cases where the analytical coefficient of variation (CV) exceeded 20%, values were included in our analysis if the CV for average enzyme per bead was less than 20%.\n52\nSamples in which the analytical CV and bead count CV both exceeded 20% were excluded from further analysis. These results were considered missing at random and not imputed.\n\nNeuroimaging\nFifteen of the 30 participating subjects were selected at random to undergo DTI neuroimaging 24\u2009h before and 48\u2009h after the workout session (T3). All images were obtained on a Siemens 3T MRI MAGNETOM PrismaFit whole-body scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) running on software version VE11c, using a 64-channel phased array head coil. The imaging sequence consisted of a single-shot spin-echo echo planar imaging sequence with repetition time/echo time\u2009=\u20098000/89\u2009msec, isotropic voxel 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009mm, iPAT (Generalized Autocalibrating Partially Parallel Acquisition) acceleration factor\u2009=\u20092, 60 directions of diffusion weighting, b\u2009=\u20091200\u2009sec/mm\n2\n, one non-diffusion-weighted image (b\u2009=\u20090, denoted B0) with 10 averages. Three images at b\u2009=\u20090\u2009sec/mm were acquired with reversed phase encoding to assist with distortion correction. Pre-processing included motion correction using rigid registration with the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTS) software package,\n53\nwith adjustments to the gradient table performed based on patient position. Distortion correction with the Topup algorithm,\n54\nas implemented in FSL (Functional MRI Brain Software Library),\n55\nwas performed using the b\u2009=\u20090 images with reverse phase encoding and the resulting transformation was applied to each gradient direction.\nAfter distortion correction, robust estimation of tensors by outlier rejection (RESTORE) within the TORTOISE software package was performed,\n56\nfollowed by computation of fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and mean diffusivity (MD). For cross-sectional analyses, measurements were averaged across voxels within 39 white matter regions of interest, defined automatically using the Diffusion-Oriented Tract Segmentation (DOTS) tract segmentation algorithm.\nFor longitudinal analyses, images were initially processed in the original acquisition space. Regions of interest were defined automatically using the DOTS tract segmentation on only the baseline image.\n57\nTo align longitudinal images across time-points, the baseline T\n1\n-w image for each subject was rigidly registered to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. The baseline motion and distortion corrected B0 image was then rigidly registered to the T\n1\n-w image, and the B0 images of each subsequent time-point were registered to the baseline B0 in MNI space. Finally, diffusion measurements and tract labels were transformed into MNI space for each time-point using concatenated spatial transformations where appropriate. Measurements were averaged across voxels within the 39 regions of interest for each subject.\n\nSymptoms\nSubjects were asked to self-report concussion-related symptoms at the time of DTI scanning 24\u2009h before and 48\u2009h after the workout session using the 22-item checklist in the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT5)\n58\nThis checklist asks subjects to rate each symptom on a scale from 0 (none) to 6 (severe); thus, the total symptom score could range from 0-132. Because symptoms were assessed at the time of DTI, they were only obtained in the subset (\nn\n=\u200915) randomly selected for neuroimaging.\n\nStatistical analysis\nBiomarker changes (both absolute and relative) were described using means, standard deviations, medians, and interquartile ranges. Dependent sample t-tests were used to evaluate the statistical significance of longitudinal biomarker changes. Associations between exertional metrics and changes in biomarkers were evaluated Pearson's correlation coefficient\nr.\nThe coefficient of determination (R\n2\n) was used to estimate the proportion of variation in biomarker changes explained by significant exertion. Changes in DTI metrics (i.e., regional FA and MD values) were evaluated using dependent sample t-tests, and these changes were associated with biomarker changes using Spearman correlation coefficients. Bonferroni corrections were made to limit inflation of the Type I error rates associated with multiple comparisons. This correction moved the\np\nvalue indicating significance from\np\n<\u20090.05 to <0.0063 for analyses involving the eight exertional metrics, and to <0.0013 for analyses involving the 39 brain white matter regions. We used SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) for all statistical analyses."

    "Methods": "Spinal cord injury and sham surgery\nAll procedures complied with guidelines of the International Association for the Study of Pain and were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee. Male rats (200-300\u2009g) were maintained under a 12:12\u2009h reversed light/dark cycle, and all experiments were performed during the dark phase.\n17\nSpinal contusion injury was produced as described previously.\n17\n,\n18\nBriefly, rats receiving SCI were anesthetized with ketamine (80\u2009mg/kg), xylazine (20\u2009mg/kg), and acepromazine (0.75\u2009mg/kg) before laminectomy of T10 vertebrae followed by an impact to the center of the cord at spinal T11 using an Infinite Horizon impactor (150 kdyne, 1-sec dwell time). The muscle layer was then sutured with 4.0 Vicryl and the skin closed with stainless steel wound clips. This injury produces equivalent effects on DRGs on both sides of the cord.\n17\nAll SCI animals exhibited Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) hindlimb motor scores of 0\u20131\n22\n1 day after injury. Hindlimb motor function showed partial recovery when examined 1 month after SCI, as reported previously.\n17\n,\n18\nWe define SCI as injury to the spinal cord itself, produced in our studies by controlled impact to the cord as part of the SCI procedure (SCI\np\n). Data are reported for the SCI\np\ngroup, which necessarily included surgical injury to skin, muscle, and bone as well as cord injury from the spinal impact. The SCI component of SCI\np\nis inferred from differences between the SCI\np\ngroup (\nn\n=\u20094) and the sham surgery control group (Sham\nSCI\n;\nn\n=\u20094). Post-operative effects of Sham\nSCI\nare inferred from differences between the Sham\nSCI\nand Na\u00efve\nSCI\n(\nn\n=\u20094). groups run at the same time.\nThe methods used for our SCI\np\ngroup differed from the SCI\np\nmethods used by another group for transcriptomic profiling of DRGs after SCI,\n23\nthe results of which we use for comparisons. Their SCI\np\nrats were injured at spinal level T2 by either contusion with an NYU impactor or complete transection with a scalpel. Other differences are described in the \u201cResults\u201d section.\n\nDRG excision, RNA isolation, library preparation, and sequencing\nRats (four per group) were anesthetized 1 month after injury with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital/phenytoin (390\u2009mg/kg) in the mid-morning, prior to cardiac perfusion with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Thoracic and lumbar DRGs were excised bilaterally below spinal level T11, yielding 16 DRGs per rat. DRGs from each rat were pooled and put into RNAlater reagent (Sigma Aldrich) for RNase-free homogenization on ice using a tissue homogenizer (OMNI International TH). Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). RNA was eluted with RNase-free water and its quality validated using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer RNA 6000 Nano kit.\n\nRat neuropathic pain models and RNA-seq datasets\nWe combined our rat SCI RNA-seq data with datasets from three unilateral PNI models: spinal nerve transection (SpNT),\n24\n,\n25\nchronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve,\n26\nand partial sciatic nerve ligation (pScNL).\n27\nRat strain, age, and sex, site of DRG sample isolation, number of days post-injury, and the type of control used (sham surgery and/or uninjured na\u00efve) differed across studies (\nTable 1\n).

Plots of principal components 1 and 2 of the normalized batch effect-adjusted count matrixes revealed clustered samples and outliers. Pearson correlation coefficients from the gene expression matrixes were used for hierarchical clustering utilizing complete linkage. Clustering of the Pearson correlation coefficient matrixes validated the classification method and identified outlier samples, which were excluded from further analysis.\nTable 2.\nScores on Two 5-Point Scales Assigned to Datasets according to the Fraction of Sensory Neurons Likely to Have Had Their Peripheral Axons Transected (DRG Peripheral Axotomy Score) and Reports of Inflammatory Effects Likely to Influence DRG Cells (DRG Inflammation Score) by Each Treatment\nOpen in a separate window\nColors show the groupings of treatment conditions based upon overall similarities of DRG peripheral axotomy scores and DRG inflammation scores.\nDRG, dorsal root ganglia; pScNL, partial sciatic nerve ligation; SpNT, spinal nerve transection; SCI, spinal cord injury; Sham\nSCI\n, sham surgery control group; SCI\np\n, spinal cord injury procedure; CCI, chronic constriction injury of sciatic nerve; PNI, peripheral nerve injury.\n\nAnalysis of differential gene expression\nBatch effect-adjusted gene expression matrixes were used for finding differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the limma R package.\n30\nGroups clustered by injury type were compared with groups with little or no injury. DEGs were defined by absolute value of log2 fold-change >0.5, false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05, and normalized gene expression >1.0 in at least one sample. DEGs are listed in\nSupplementary Table S4\n.\n\nGene set enrichment analysis\nLists of DEGs corresponding to samples in each principal component analysis (PCA) cluster were used to define significantly over-represented gene sets. The enriched gene sets are listed in\nSupplementary Table S5\n.\n\nPain protein\u2013protein interaction networks\nTo understand the molecular mechanisms associated with neuropathic pain we built a protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) network based on a curated list of 1002 protein-protein interactions of 611 proteins associated with pain.\n31\n\nGene set variation analysis\nTo compare rat pain datasets with single-cell RNA-seq gene signatures representing the cellular diversity underlying the DRG with and without injury, we adopted the gene set variation analysis approach.\n32\nGene signatures were obtained from a recent study in which authors performed single-nucleus RNA-seq over multiple time-points on lumbar DRG cells from adult mice in na\u00efve conditions, and after three PNI conditions: sciatic nerve transection + ligation (ScNT), spinal nerve transection (SpNT), and sciatic nerve crush.\n13\nEnrichment scores with FDR <0.05 were considered significant and were grouped through hierarchical clustering (see heatmaps in figures).\n\nGuilt-by-association analysis\nTo infer potential functions of differentially expressed lncRNAs, we adopted the guilt-by-association approach.\n33\nThis widely used approach to inferring gene function assumes that genes that are highly correlated will share some biological function. Thus, potential lncRNA functions were predicted to overlap with those of protein-coding genes having highly similar expression patterns and published functional annotation. For each differentially expressed lncRNA, a ranked list of protein-coding genes was obtained by ordering the Pearson correlation coefficient between the lncRNA and protein-coding genes using their gene expression in all datasets. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)\n34\nwas performed to identify significantly enriched gene sets for each lncRNA. Additional information is provided in the Supplementary Methods."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nThirty-eight male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (Envigo, Houston, TX, USA) \u223c90\u2013110 days old (300\u2013350\u2009g) served as subjects. Seven rats were subsequently removed from the study based on\na priori\nexclusion criteria. Subjects were excluded from the study if their (1) average Day 1 Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) score was >6.0, and (2) the jugular catheter was not patent for all 7 days of intravenous administration. Data for one rat treated with norBNI only was not completely recorded, and therefore was removed during analysis, and five rats died prior to the end of the experiment. Mortality was distributed across groups; one rat from the vehicle group, three treated with only morphine, and one treated with only norBNI. In total, therefore, 31 subjects completed the study (\nn\n=\u20098 vehicle controls, 8 morphine only, 6 norBNI only, and 9 norBNI + morphine).\nThe rats were individually housed in Plexiglas bins (45.7 [length]\u2009\u00d7\u200923.5 [width]\u2009\u00d7\u200920.3 [height] cm), with a fixed 12-h light/dark cycle, and access to both food and water\nad libitum\n. All testing and surgeries occurred during the light cycle. Following the contusion injury, subjects' bladders were expressed manually every morning (between 7:00 and 9:00 a.m.) and evening (between 4:30 and 6:30 p.m). This schedule was maintained until subjects regained bladder function (operationally defined as voiding on their own for 3 consecutive days). All of the experiments reported here were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee at Texas A&M University, and were consistent with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines for animal care and use. The experimental design is outlined graphically in\nFigure 1\nand described in further detail in the following sections.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nGraphical representation of experimental timeline.\n\nIntravenous jugular catheter implantation\nFive days prior to a contusion injury, rats were implanted with a jugular catheter. They were anesthetized with isoflurane anesthesia (2\u20133% gas), and their back and chest were shaved and disinfected with alcohol and iodine. Next, a 3\u2009cm horizontal incision was made below the shoulders, and a 1\u2009cm superficial incision was made above the jugular vein. The jugular vein was isolated from the surrounding connective tissue. Placing the rat on its right side, a subcutaneous tunnel beginning at the incision on the back, traveling over the shoulder and ending at the neck, was made by carefully separating the skin from the muscle. A catheter, consisting of Silastic tubing (0.025-mm ID), was passed through this tunnel. The catheter was attached to a syringe and flushed with sterile saline. Then using an 18-G needle as a guide, the Silastic tubing was inserted into the vein and secured with sutures and Vetbond. Successful insertion of the catheter was tested by drawing blood back into the tubing. Once placement was confirmed, a back mount pedestal (model 313-00BM-10-SPC; Plastics Inc., Roanoke, VA, USA) was connected to the catheter and implanted subcutaneously. All incisions were then closed with Michel clips. Finally, the catheter was flushed with 150 uL of heparin-saline (1000 units/mL), to prevent blood from clotting inside the tubing, and capped. Subjects were also given 3\u2009mL of saline subcutaneously to compensate for fluid loss. The rats were kept in a recovery room maintained at 26.6\u00b0C for the first 12\u201316\u2009h following catheter implantation.\n\nSpinal contusion injury\nFive days after the implantation of the jugular catheter, the rats underwent a moderate contusion injury using the Infinite Horizon (IH) spinal cord impactor (PSI, Fairfax Station, VA, USA) as previously described.\n18\nBriefly, subjects were anesthetized using isoflurane (2\u20133% gas). Once a stable level of anesthesia was reached, the dorsal spinous process at T12 was removed and the spinal cord was exposed. The vertebral column was fixed within the IH device using two Adson forceps, and a moderate, midline contusion injury was produced by applying an impact force (150 kdyn with a 1\u2009sec dwell time) onto the exposed spinal cord. Following injury, the rats were removed from the impactor device and the incision was closed with Michel clips. To compensate for fluid loss, subjects were given 3\u2009mL of saline subcutaneously after surgery. The rats were kept in a recovery room maintained at 26.6\u00b0C for the first 24\u2009h post-injury.\n\nEpidural catheter implantation\nAll rats were implanted with an epidural catheter immediately following the contusion injury and prior to closing the incision site. This 15\u2009cm catheter consisted of polyethylene tubing (model 51150, Stoelting, Co., Wood Dale, IL, USA) and a silicone ball positioned 4\u2009cm from the end of the tubing. The catheter was inserted into the epidural space, with the end positioned 2\u2009cm caudal to the spinal injury. To prevent cannula movement, Vetbond was used to adhere the silicone ball to the subcutaneous connective tissue above the exposed spinal cord. The skin incision above the laminectomy was then closed with Michel clips. The externally exposed end of the catheter was further secured within the wound clips. The end of the exposed catheter was also sealed with heat to prevent any contaminates from being introduced directly to the spinal cord. The catheter was removed on Day 7 post-injury, following the end of post-administration pain testing, to prevent any confounding effects of inflammation with chronic implantation.\n19\nWith minimal pressure, the catheter slowly slid out of the epidural space.\n\nDrug administration\nTwenty-four hours following the contusion injury, half of the rats received intravenous morphine (10\u2009mg/mL) on an escalating dose schedule, and the other half received an equivalent volume of intravenous saline (0.9%). On Days 1\u20132, the subjects were treated with 10\u2009mg of morphine, on Days 3\u20134 they were treated with 20\u2009mg, and on days 5\u20137 they were treated with 30\u2009mg. Morphine was administered in 5\u2009mg doses and doses were separated by 1\u2009h up to the daily dose, to prevent overdose. This dosing schedule was derived from previous experiments assessing analgesia, self-administration, and cell expression following SCI.\n5\n,\n20\nHeparin-saline (1000\u2009U/mL) was used to flush catheters following drug administration.\nPrior to the first administration of morphine on Day 1, subjects were also pre-treated with 0.32 \u03bcmol (dissolved for a final volume of 8 \u03bcL in ultra-purified water) of norBNI via the epidural catheter, or the equivalent volume of 0.9% saline. NorBNI was administered 2\u2009h prior to morphine administration, to account for the slow onset of its antagonistic action at the KOR.\n21\u201323\nFollowing administration of norBNI, catheters were flushed with 10 \u03bcL saline. Subjects were re-treated with norBNI (0.32 \u03bcmol) or saline on Day 3 post-injury, prior to the initiation of the daily morphine administrations, to prevent morphine-induced KOR activation during the remaining days of administration.\n24\u201326\n\nAssessment of sensory reactivity\nThermal reactivity\nThermal reactivity was assessed with the tail-flick test immediately before and 30\u2009min after final drug treatment on Days 1, 3, and 7 post-injury. Rats were placed in restraining tubes (6\u2009cm in diameter, 23\u2009cm in length) and acclimated to the tail flick apparatus for 15\u2009min (IITC Life Science Inc., Woodland Hills, CA, USA). Prior to testing, the intensity of the light was set to elicit a baseline tail-flick response in \u223c3\u20134\u2009sec in an intact rat. For test trials, a hot light of the same temperature was focused onto the rat's tail and the latency to flick the tail away from the stimulus was recorded. If a subject failed to respond, the test trial was automatically terminated after 8\u2009sec of heat exposure. Two tests were conducted at 2\u2009min intervals, and the second tail-flick latency was recorded. This test was used to assess both OIH (immediately before) and tolerance (30\u2009min following) after repeated drug administration, on Days 1, 3, and 7 post-injury. The tail-flick test was also used to assess long-term sensory reactivity thresholds on days 14, 28, and 42 post-injury.\nTactile reactivity\nMechanical reactivity was measured using von Frey filaments (Semmes-Weinstein Aesthesiometer, Stoelting Co., Chicago, IL, USA) prior to and 30\u2009min after final drug administration on Days 1, 3, and 7 post-injury. Mechanical reactivity was also assessed on Days 14, 28, and 42 to test for the development of long-term pain. Filaments of increasing diameter (correlating with the target force delivered) were applied to the L4 dermatome on the plantar surface of the hind paw for 2\u2009sec. The force applied was increased until the rats exhibited both a motor (hind paw withdrawal) and vocal response.\n27\nThe force (g) of the stimulus that produced a response was calculated using the formula provided by Semmes-Weinstein: Intensity\u2009=\u2009log10 (10,000\ng\nforce). If a motor and/or vocal response was not observed, testing was terminated at a force of 300\ng\n.\nVon Frey filaments were also used to assess at-level pain with the girdle test on Days 14, 28, and 42 post-injury. In this test, the filament corresponding to 26\ng\nof force was applied to 44 points across the subjects' back in a grid-like pattern. As rats do not normally vocalize in response to this stimulus, vocalizations indicated that rats experienced a noxious event. The number of vocalizations was recorded and normalized by the following formula: (Nv\u2009\u00d7\u2009100)/total number of applications.\n\nAssessment of locomotor recovery\nLocomotor recovery was assessed using the BBB scale.\n28\n,\n29\nThe BBB scale is locomotor rating scale used to characterize the hindlimb function of rats following SCI. This scale rates movement of the three major hindlimb joints (hip, knee, and ankle), plantar stepping, and coordination between paws. BBB scores were collected daily for the first 7 days post-injury, then every other day from Day 9 to Day15, every third day from Days 18 to Day 30, and every fourth day from Day 34 to Day 42. For this assessment, rats were placed in an open enclosure (99\u2009cm in diameter, 23\u2009cm deep) and observed for 4\u2009min. Investigators were blind to a subject's experimental treatment, and care was taken to ensure that all investigators had high intra- and inter- observer reliability (all\nr\ns\u2009>\u20090.89).\nMotor function was also assessed on Day 42 post-injury using the beam and ladder walk tests.\n29\nPrior to testing, subjects were habituated to both the beam and ladder apparatus for 3 consecutive days (8\u2009min per habituation). The tapered beam walk task provides an index of postural stability, and a gross measure of paw placement. The tapered beam is 17.14\u2009cm wide at the beginning and 0.95\u2009cm wide at the end. On this test, the width at which each foot failed to plantar place on the beam was recorded, and the scores for the left and right legs were averaged to provide a score for beam walk performance. The ladder task requires subjects to cross a horizontal ladder (20\u2009cm wide; 37 rungs at 2.5\u2009cm intervals), providing a measure of the fine motor abilities of the hind paws. Using\npost hoc\nframe-by-frame video analysis, the number of times that subjects did not successfully place their hind paws on a rung (their paw slipped between rungs) was recorded.\n\nLesion Analysis\nOn Day 43 post-injury, subjects were deeply anesthetized (100\u2009mg/kg of Beuthanasia, i.p.) and perfused intracardially with phosphate-buffered saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Following perfusion, a 1.5\u2009cm spinal segment around the lesion site was extracted and prepared for cryostat sectioning. Tissue was embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound. Then, during sectioning, every 10th transverse slice (20\u2009\u03bcm width) was collected and mounted directly onto Superfrost Plus slides. The mounted tissue was stained with cresyl violet for Nissl substance and Luxol fast blue for myelin.\n28\nSections \u00b10, 600, 1200, 1800, and 2400\u2009\u03bcm rostral and caudal from the lesion center were analyzed using Stereo Investigator software (MFB Bioscience, Williston, VT, USA). Three indices of lesion magnitude were derived for each section: lesion, residual gray matter, and residual white matter. The lesion was defined by identifying and tracing around the areas of cystic formations. Residual gray matter was identified by Nissl-stained areas containing neurons and glia. Areas lacking gliosis denoted spared white matter.\n28\nThe total area of each cross section was determined by summing the lesion, residual gray matter, and residual white matter.\nA correction factor was used to control for variability in the section area across subjects. This correction factor was derived from age-matched, undamaged cord sections.\n30\nStandardizing the area across sections allowed us to estimate the degree to which tissue was \u201cmissing\u201d (i.e., atrophy, necrosis, or apoptosis). An accurate assessment of the degree to which a treatment has impacted the spinal cord includes both the remaining \u201cdamaged\u201d tissue, and resolved lesioned areas. Summing the amount of \u201cmissing\u201d tissue and the measured \u201cdamaged\u201d area allowed us to derive an index of the relative lesion percent relative lesion) in each section that was comparable across sections. We also computed the relative percent of gray and white matter remaining in each section, relative to intact controls. Previously, using this method, we have found a high correlation between relative lesion and measures of behavioral recovery including BBB locomotor scores and recovery of bladder function.\n30\n,\n31\n\nStatistical analysis\nThree-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), with day post-injury, morphine, and norBNI treatment as independent variables, were used to analyze the sensory reactivity data. When analyses revealed significant main effects or interactions (\np\n<\u20090.05), Tukey's multiple comparison tests were used for\npost-hoc\nanalysis.\nThe effects of morphine and norBNI on locomotor recovery across days were assessed with an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Day 1 BBB scores collected prior to drug treatment were used as the covariates. Use of the Day 1 covariate considerably reduces unexplained variance between groups and, as a result, increases statistical power. Additional tests of motor function, including data collected for the beam and ladder walk tasks, were analyzed with two-way (morphine and norBNI) ANOVAs. Finally, two- and three-way ANOVAs with independent variables of distance from the center of the lesion, morphine, and norBNI treatment were used to analyze data for lesion size and tissue sparing. Tukey's multiple comparison tests were used for\npost-hoc\nanalyses."

    "Methods": "Animals\nThirty-four adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Envigo, Indianapolis, IN) were housed in commercially available clear Plexiglas\n\u00ae\nindividually ventilated cages (Allentown LLC, Allentown, NJ) under a regulated light-controlled cycle (12/12-h light/dark; lights on at 7:00\nam\n) and kept at a constant temperature (21\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C) with food and water\nad libitum\n. After a week of acclimation to the housing environment, experimental manipulations began during the light phase of the cycle. All procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, PA) and were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All efforts were made to minimize pain and discomfort and to minimize the number of rats used.\n\nOperant attentional set-shifting task (oAST)\nRats were food-restricted to 13\u2009g/rat/day with free access to water to maintain 80\u201385% of their free-feeding weight and to ensure adequate motivation for food reward incentives. Six controlled environment standard operant test chambers (Coulbourn Instruments, Allentown, PA) measuring 12 in (l)\u2009\u00d7\u200910 in (w)\u2009\u00d7\u200912 in (h) were used for oAST testing with procedures comparable to those of previous publications.\n60\n,\n61\nBriefly, rats were sequentially acclimatized to computer-controlled stainless steel operant test chambers (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA), which displayed a reward pellet dispenser and food trough on one wall and three identical integrated, infrared sensor-sensitive nose-poke modules on the opposing wall. Only the left and right nose-poke modules were actively used in this task (\nFig. 1\n). The front and back walls of the chamber were constructed of clear Plexiglas. A house light placed above the food trough provided illumination for the boxes, and the floor was made of a steel-wire mesh grid. The operant boxes were housed in sound-dampening and lightproof wood cubicles, to reduce outside light and noise.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nThe operant-based set-shifting task. Instrumental behavior was guided based on two rules within distinct perceptual dimensions that shifted between each other based on reward delivery or omission feedback. In the \u2018\u2018Light rule,\u201d a nose poke to the illuminated port was correct (\nA\n), leading to food reward, whereas a nose poke to the non-illuminated port was incorrect (\nB\n), leading to no reward. In the \u201cSide rule,\u201d depicted here on the left side, a nose poke to the valid location (e.g., left port) was correct, regardless of illumination (\nC\n). Poking into the illuminated port on the right side, in this case, was incorrect (\nD\n), leading to no reward.\nA small video camera was mounted inside the cubicle so that the rats' performance could be monitored live by experimenters on a video screen. Rats were first habituated to operant chambers (i.e., 20\u2009min) and reward retrieval (i.e., dispensed at 30-sec intervals into the food trough), which consisted of 45\u2009mg sucrose dustless precision pellets (Bio-Serv, Flemington, NJ), before progressing to set-shifting training.\nSubsequently, during training and testing sessions on oAST, rats were challenged to choose correctly between two nose-poke holes according to two discrimination rules (i.e., Light or Side), each incorporating a distinct perceptual dimension, spatial position, and a light cue presented pseudorandomly at one of the two peripheral cue ports (\nFig. 2\n). Pseudorandomization was used to ensure that the same cue light was not illuminated more than twice in a row. For the Light discrimination rule, correct performance for a reward pellet was achieved by a nose poke in the illuminated port, independent of its spatial location (\nFig. 2A,B\n). For the Side rule, a nose poke in the respective valid side (left or right) regardless of illumination location was recorded as correct and rewarded accordingly (\nFig. 2C,D\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nRats were trained on operant attentional set-shifting tasks (oAST), before surgery and group assignment, for at least 17 days to achieve performance baseline stability (i.e., three consecutive days with <10% variability) as seen via total trials to criterion, total errors, and perseverative errors (daily sets 2\u20134), which were summed for each rat. Data are expressed as mean (\u00b1 standard error of the mean). No statistical analyses were necessary prior to group designations, N\u2009=\u200932.\nDaily testing consisted of four sets completed in 90\u2009min, with three extradimensional (ED) shifts changing reward contingency with a pseudorandom rule start and counterbalanced set sequence. A rat advanced through dimensional sets by completing a performance criterion of 10 consecutive correct responses. Each daily session included two side rules using left and right cue ports as the correct side, such that left- and right-poking trials were equivalently mixed. After each response, the food trough in the opposite wall of the chamber was illuminated, regardless of the accuracy of response, until rats poked into the trough to end the trial. After a 10-sec intertrial interval, the next trial was initiated as the respective light cue was turned on.\n60\n,\n61\nRats were trained in oAST before surgery to reach stable pre-injury performance baselines (total of 17\u201321 days; three consecutive days with <10% variability). After 10 days of recovery from surgery and reinstatement of mild food restriction, rats were tested in oAST for 10 days (post-surgical days 11\u201321, with a break at day 16), followed by training and testing on digging AST (dAST). Total trials to reach performance criterion (10 consecutive correct choices), total errors, and perseverative errors (daily on sets 2\u20134; choice consistent with immediately preceding set rule) were recorded. Any rats failing to complete four consecutive sets in their entirety during a 3\u2009h allotment on more than three sessions were excluded from the study.\n\nSurgery, drug treatment, and acute neurological evaluation\nAfter pre-surgery operant AST behavioral baselines were reached, rats weighing between 300\u2013325\u2009g were randomly assigned to injury (TBI or Sham) and treatment groups (MLN or vehicle [VEH]). Isoflurane anesthesia was induced and maintained using a 2:1\u2009N\n2\nO/O\n2\ngas mixture at concentrations of 4% and 2%, respectively. Rats were intubated endotracheally and placed on mechanical ventilation for anesthesia maintenance.\nOsmotic minipumps were implanted intraperitoneally after they were pre-filled with VEH (10% ethanol in saline) or MLN (AK Scientific, Inc., Union City, CA) at concentrations calculated to deliver 30\u2009mg/kg/day (continuous infusion post-surgery, 60\u2009\u03bcL/h) of drug freebase via continuous infusion for the duration of the study until sacrifice after dAST. This dose was selected based on previously published work showing that it increases norepinephrine and serotonin in the prefrontal cortex in rats\n62\n,\n63\nand has beneficial effects on dAST performance.\n43\nAfter mini-pump placement, rats were affixed into a stereotaxic frame, and a 6\u2009mm craniectomy was performed over the right hemisphere rostral to bregma and right of midline, overlying the prefrontal cortex.\n64\nA controlled cortical impact (CCI) was performed with a 3\u2009mm impactor diameter, at 2.4\u2009mm injury depth, 4\u2009m/sec impact velocity, and 100\u2009msec dwell time similar to previous publications involving similar surgical procedures over the parietal cortex.\n32\n,\n33\n,\n35\n,\n65\nSham control rats underwent anesthesia and craniectomy, except for the final impact.\nAnesthesia was then discontinued, and the scalp incision was closed with sutures. Rats were extubated, and time to return of hindlimb flexion paw withdrawal (i.e., paw pinch) and righting reflexes (i.e., turn from supine to prone) were assessed every 5\u2009sec. Post-operatively, rats were weighed daily on post-injury days (PID) 1\u20135 to ensure steady recovery and given\nad libitum\naccess to food and water, after which food restriction was resumed from PID 6 onward as above.\n\ndAST\nRats were habituated, trained, and tested in the dAST from PID 23\u201327. Procedures for AST were adapted from Birrell and Brown\n26\nand have been described previously.\n28-33\n,\n35\n,\n66\nBriefly, testing occurred in a custom-built, rectangular Plexiglas arena that utilized a discrimination choice of two Terracotta digging pots (internal rim diameter, 7\u2009cm; depth, 6\u2009cm) to present salient and irrelevant stimulus cues across two dimensions (i.e., medium and odor) to signal which pot contained a food reward buried 2\u2009cm below the surface of the digging medium (one quarter of a Honey Nut Cheerio, General Mills Cereals, Minneapolis, MS).\nDigging was defined as a vigorous displacement of the medium to retrieve the reward buried in the pot, during which rats explored using their somatosensory, olfactory, and visual senses. The behavioral assessment took place over three consecutive days. Rats were first trained to dig reliably in pots with incrementally larger amounts of sawdust to retrieve the rewards. Subsequently, they were trained to complete simple rule-based discriminations for both odor (e.g., lemon vs. eucalyptus) or media (e.g., felt vs. paper strips) contingencies to a criterion of six consecutive correct responses. The positive and negative cues for each rat were pseudorandomly determined and equally represented. The stimuli implemented during training were not used during testing. Any rat that failed to complete the training procedures was eliminated from further testing.\nUltimately, rats were progressed through a series of seven rule-shifting stages of progressive complexity aiming to measure aspects of cognitive flexibility, specifically via stimulus reversals and an ED shift, and again six consecutive correct trials were required to move from one stage to the next. Each testing stage included a variation between the discriminative stimulus dimension and the positive cue.\nStage 1 involved a single stimulus dimension (odor or medium) and stages 2\u20137 involved both overlapping dimensions, although only one dimension was relevant in any stage, while the other acted as a distractor. The stages included: (1) simple discrimination (SD); (2) compound discrimination (CD); (3) the first reversal (R1); (4) intradimensional shift (ID); (5) the second reversal (R2); (6) ED shift; and (7) the third reversal (R3). Total trials to reach criterion, total errors, and set loss errors (incorrect choice after \u22653 correct choices) for each stage were recorded. Trials longer than 10\u2009min without choosing a pot were marked as \u201cno choice\u201d and counted as an error. Six consecutive no choice trials or failing to complete a stage within 50 trials resulted in exclusion from the study.\n\nSacrifice and histology\nAt five weeks post-surgery after the completion of behavioral testing, using a similar timeline with previous studies,\n32\n,\n33\n,\n35\nrats were intraperitoneally administered 0.3\u2009mL Fatal-Plus\n\u00ae\n(Henry Schein Animal Health, Columbus, OH) and transcardially perfused with 200\u2009mL of 0.1\u2009M of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), followed by 300\u2009mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were extracted, post-fixed in 4% PFA for one week, dehydrated with alcohols, and embedded in paraffin. Seven-micrometer-thick coronal sections were cut at 1-mm intervals through the lesion on a rotary microtome and mounted on Superfrost\n\u00ae\n/Plus glass microscope slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). After drying at room temperature, sections were deparaffinized in xylenes, rehydrated, and stained with cresyl violet.\nCortical lesion volumes (mm\n3\n) were assessed by an observer blinded to experimental conditions using a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The area of the lesion (mm\n2\n) was first calculated by outlining the inferred area of missing cortical tissue for each section (typically 5\u20137; Nikon NIS-Elements AR 3.22.14 software; Nikon) and then by summing the lesions obtained, as reported previously.\n32\n,\n33\n,\n35\n,\n67\u201369\n\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical analyses were performed on data collected by observers blinded to treatment conditions using Statistica 64 version 13 Academic software (Dell Inc., Tulsa, OK). Righting reflex, hindlimb reflexive ability, and histological data were analyzed by an unpaired Student\nt\ntest.\nFor oAST post-surgery behavior, the total trials to criterion, total errors, and perseverative errors were analyzed by two-way repeated measures ANOVA (Group\u2009\u00d7\u2009Day, with Day as the repeated measure). When significant main effects or interactions were indicated,\npost hoc\ncomparisons using the Fisher least significant difference (LSD) were implemented. Results from dAST involved total trials to criterion, total response errors, and set loss errors that were recorded for each test stage and analyzed by two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Group\u2009\u00d7\u2009Stage, with Stage as the repeated measure). Where necessary after significant main effects of interactions were indicated,\npost hoc\none-way ANOVA analyses were performed for each stage followed by further\npost hoc\ncomparison within Stage using Fisher LSD tests.\nFor both oAST and dAST behaviors, the Sham groups (Sham+MLN and Sham+VEH) were not significantly different from each other and were pooled into one Sham group. Results are expressed as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM), and significance for all analyses was set at\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Study design and setting\nThe primary cohort of clinical data of 50 patients with TBI from the department of neurosurgery, Shanghai General Hospital, from January 2020 to December 2021 were collected and analyzed. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients admitted to the emergency department for acute closed TBI; (2) received invasive ICP monitoring according to the guidelines for the management of severe TBI; (3) received emergency cranial CT scan within 60\u2009min of ICP monitoring. Exclusion criteria included: patients with previous intracranial anatomical structural changes caused by TBI, cerebral infarction, brain tumors, or other neurological diseases or cranial surgical intervention.\nThe study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki, and this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. The participants' right to know was fully guaranteed and indicated in the ethical approval document.\nThe external cohort of 20 patients was selected following the same criteria mentioned above from January 2021 to December 2021 at the department of neurosurgery of Qian nan People's Hospital.\n\nData sources and measurements\nThis study included age, sex, midline shift, basilar cistern, and ventriculocranial ratio as clinical features. With regard to midline shift, basilar cistern, and ventriculocranial ratio, two clinicians extracted these data from the CT images independently, and their average measurements were used as the final results. The slice with the maximum midline shift was selected to examine the midline shift by measuring the perpendicular distance between the septum pellucidum and cranial midline (the median ridge of the frontoparietal bone).\nThe lateral ventricle width between the heads of the caudate nuclei and the width of the same horizontal cranial cavity were measured at the slice with the body of the lateral ventricle, which was 5\u2009cm above the orbitomeatal plane; the ratio of the two widths was the ventriculocranial ratio. The status of the basilar cistern was observed in the slice of the basilar cistern plane, and we used 0, 1, and 2 scores to represent normality, compression, and obliteration, respectively. These five clinical features were then included in the multi-variate logistic regression model as the clinical features model (CF model) to evaluate the probability of intracranial hypertension (ICP >22\u2009mm Hg).\nAll the included patients underwent ICP monitoring using an ICP sensor (Integra LifeSciences, Princeton, NJ) placed in the frontal corner of the ventricle before performing craniotomy. We collected the patients' initial ICP values immediately after the ICP sensor insertion.\nApart from the clinical features, we collected and analyzed the patients' most recent pre-operative cranial CT images. The CT radiological features were acquired from the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) file of the most recent cranial CT before ICP monitoring, using a 64-slice spiral CT machine (General Electric Medical System, Shanghai, China). As per the routine protocol of a CT scan, the CT slices were parallel to the orbitomeatal plane from the foramen magnum to the vertex. The scanning slice thickness was 5\u2009mm.\nWe chose the slice with the body of the lateral ventricle to extract CT radiomic features. The DICOM files of the CT were imported into the three dimensional slicer (3.6.0,\nwww.slicer.org\n) to segment one rectangular region of interest (ROI) of size 20\n\u00d7\n20 pixels from the brain tissue near the anterior horn of the lateral ventricle on the side of the major lesion (ROI is shown in\nFig. 1\n), and resampled to 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm voxels; the intensity was normalized using histogram matching to eliminate differences in imaging parameters.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSelection of a rectangular region of interest (ROI) with size of 20 pixels. *20 pixels.\nPyRadiomics module was used to extract 18 first-order features of the grayscale frequency distribution of the pixel intensity histograms and 40 second-order features involving gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM, 24 features) and gray-level run-length matrix (GLRLM, 16 features) from the ROI. The first-order group and second-order group data were then standardized. The minimum of 50 each feature data is subtracted from corresponding feature data and divided by the difference between the maximum and minimum of the respective feature. The standardization formula is expressed as:\nR\nn\ne\nw\n=\nR\n\u2212\nR\nm\ni\nn\nR\nm\na\nx\n\u2212\nR\nm\ni\nn\nThe least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method, applicable for the high-dimensional data,\n15\nwas used to select the most significant features in the two groups. To avoid overfitting, the optimal \u03bb value was determined by the mean squared error (MSE) based on the 5-fold cross-validation. According to the features selected for the two groups, two logistic models were established to evaluate the probability of intracranial hypertension (ICP >22\u2009mm Hg), which contains first-order features model (FO model) and second-order features model (SO model). The development and analysis process of the above models are shown in\nFigure 2\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nModel establishment and analysis process.

Data manipulation and sorting were performed using NumPy and pandas modules, and the logistic regression module of SPSS for model building and mapping. Continuous variables subject to normal distribution were expressed as mean (M)\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD), continuous variables not subject to normal distribution were expressed as the median and interquartile range (IQR), and categorical variables were expressed as frequency and percentage.\nAccuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were used to evaluate the performance of each model. All three models used the area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve to assess the discriminative power. The Hosmer Lemeshow test was used to determine whether the calibration curve varies from the ideal curve and to measure the accuracy of the model prediction.\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered a statistically significant difference."

    "Methods": "Participants and study design\nTRACK-TBI (\nclinicaltrials.gov\nNCT02119182) enrolled 2697 adult and pediatric patients with TBI at 18 level I trauma centers between February 26, 2014, and August 8, 2018. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in\nSupplementary Table S2\n. Briefly, inclusion criteria were: (1) presentation to a participating study site within 24\u2009h post-injury, (2) documented acute TBI as defined by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine criteria, and (3) order placed for cranial CT scan. Exclusion criteria were: (1) polytrauma, including spinal cord injury, that could interfere with outcome assessment, and (2) pre-injury debilitating psychiatric disorder or neurological disease. Data collected include clinical indicators, imaging, proteomic and genomic biomarkers, and multi-dimensional outcome data.\nFor the current study, we excluded participants who were under 18 years of age at enrollment (\nn\n=\u2009145), withdrew consent (\nn\n=\u200997), died before the 2w follow-up (\nn\n=\u200987), missed all four follow-up assessments (\nn\n=\u2009158), or were never assigned to a battery group (\nn\n=\u20091) (\nFig. 2\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nParticipant flow diagram. Of 2551 adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI), 2209 (87%) were followed (i.e., completed at least the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended [GOSE]) at one or more time points. FAB, Flexible Assessment Battery; CAB, Comprehensive Assessment Battery; AAB, Abbreviated Assessment Battery.\nThe study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of each enrolling institution and was led by the University of California, San Francisco. Participants or their legally authorized representatives provided written informed consent.\n\nDescription of the FAB\nTo accommodate participants enrolled in TRACK-TBI across all levels of function, we designed the FAB to include two batteries: the AAB for those who cannot complete standardized neuropsychological assessment because of disturbance in consciousness or confusion and the CAB for those able to complete standardized neuropsychological assessment.\nThe AAB and CAB components of the FAB include different measures to address these differences in level of function. The AAB incorporates two performance-based standardized measures that quantitatively assess level of consciousness and basic elements of cognition. The CAB is composed of performance-based tests of cognition (i.e., attention, memory, information processing speed, executive function), and patient-reported assessment of mood (i.e., depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress), social participation, and subjective well-being.\nDetails about administration and scoring of each measure are available by accessing the online TRACK-TBI Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Manual for Outcome Assessment.\n17\nA decision tree (\nFig. 1\n) that relies on cut-scores is used to assign participants to either the AAB or CAB (see Supplementary Methods) and to guide battery and test selection when follow-up assessments are conducted. The decision tree also includes skip and stop rules to improve battery efficiency and provides a systematic approach to transitioning from the AAB to the CAB for participants who demonstrate basic cognitive function.\nThe TRACK-TBI outcome examiners completed extensive in person and virtual training on administration of each measure, as well as use of the decision tree. After data collection, all data forms were curated by a central site, and queries were sent to individual sites to complete missing data or reconcile data inconsistencies\n18\n(see Supplementary Methods for details). The GOSE served as the primary outcome measure in TRACK-TBI. For purposes of this study, we used the \u201cGOSE-TBI\u201d scoring method, which reflects disability specifically caused by the effects of the TBI.\n19\n\nData analysis\nFAB feasibility\nIn Aim 1, we calculated the proportion of participants who were followed and received a valid score on each CAB or AAB measure at the 2w, 3m, 6m, and 12m follow-up visits. Examiners applied Test Completion Codes (TCC, see\nSupplementary Table S3\n), adapted from a previous clinical trial,\n20\nto each measure in the battery to indicate whether the measure was completed and valid, completed but invalid, attempted but not completed, or not attempted. The TCCs specify the reason(s) individual tests were not attempted or not completed according to standard procedures (i.e., invalid) and enable analysis of data that are missing for non-random reasons.\n8\n,\n21\nWe operationally defined participants as \u201cfollowed\u201d when the primary outcome measure, the GOSE, was attempted, regardless of whether it was completed. For participants who died, a GOSE score of \u201c1\u2009=\u2009Dead\u201d was assigned. At each time point, we divided the number of participants who received a valid score on each measure by the number of participants who were followed at that time point. For example, if the GOSE was attempted by 2000 participants at the 2w visit and 1990 participants received a valid score in person or by telephone, the proportion of valid test completions would equal 99.5%.\nFinally, we calculated the proportion of participants who received valid scores on all FAB measures and the proportion of measures that were assigned valid scores at each time point. The formulas used to calculate these metrics and additional analytic details are provided in the Supplementary Methods. In Aim 2, we used the TCCs to identify factors contributing to incomplete or invalid assessments. For each measure, and each TCC, we calculated the proportion of participants for whom the measure was either attempted but not completed, or not attempted.\nFAB utility\nWe investigated the utility of the FAB by examining whether the FAB-enabled approach to outcome assessment applied at 2w identifies subgroups of participants with distinct GOSE outcomes at 6m and 12m that would not otherwise be detectable through traditional outcome assessment. To reflect the traditional approach to assessment, we assigned participants to the AAB or CAB groups based on ability to undergo standardized neuropsychological testing. Participants who were too impaired for standardized testing based on results of the screening examination at 2w were assigned to the AAB and the remainder to the CAB.\nEmploying the FAB-enabled assessment approach at 2w allowed us to test all traditionally \u201cuntestable\u201d participants using either the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R)\n22\nor Confusion Assessment Protocol Cognitive Impairment Subscale (CAP-Cog).\n23\n,\n24\nThe findings from these measures provided diagnostic information, revealing four subgroups with distinct levels of function within the AAB group (\nTable 1\n).\nTable 1.\nDescription of Participants in the Traditional and Flexible Outcome Assessment Battery-Enabled Outcome Assessment Groups\nAssessment approach\nGroup name\nDescription\nTraditional\nAAB\nToo impaired to undergo standardized neuropsychological testing and assigned to the AAB, based on results of the screening examination\nCAB\nAble to undergo standardized neuropsychological testing and assigned to the CAB, based on results of the screening examination\nGroup name\nDescription\nFAB-enabled\nComaVS\nAAB\nUnconscious (criteria for coma or vegetative state [VS]\n22\nmet on CRS-R)\nMCS-\nAAB\nConscious with no evidence of language function (criteria for minimally conscious state\nminus\n[MCS-]\n21\nmet on CRS-R\n23\n)\nMCS+\nAAB\nConscious with evidence of language function (criteria for MCS\nplus\n[MCS+]\n21\nmet on the CRS-R)\n23\nPTCS\nAAB\nConscious with evidence of language function but confused (criteria for post-traumatic confusional state [PTCS] met on CAP-Cog)\nCAB\nConscious, able to undergo standardized neuropsychological testing and assigned to the CAB, based on results of the screening examination\nOpen in a separate window\nAAB, Abbreviated Assessment Battery; CAB, Comprehensive Assessment Battery; VS, vegetative state; CRS-R, Coma Recovery Scale-Revised; MCS-, minimally conscious state minus (MCS without evidence of language function); MCS+, minimally conscious state plus (MCS with evidence of language function; FAB, Flexible Outcome Assessment Battery; PTCS, post-traumatic confusional state; CAP-Cog, Confusion Assessment Protocol-Cognitive Impairment Subscale.\nWe compared the median GOSE scores at 6m and 12m between participants assigned to subgroups using the FAB-enabled versus traditional approach to outcome assessment at 2w.

    "Methods": "Study design and setting\nThis prospective monocentric longitudinal, observational cohort study was approved by the ethics committee of Heidelberg University (S-516-2011) and registered in the German Clinical Trials Registry (Registry-no. DRKS00006258). Before enrollment, written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. Patients were recruited from 2012 to 2016. The time schedule for clinical examinations was derived from the European Multicenter Study about SCI (EMSCI).\n28\nAn illustration of the course of the study and related examinations is given in\nFigure 1\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nStudy timeline. Red boxes denote medical diagnostics and the clinical assessment as performed according to the International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI (ISNCSCI). Blue boxes denote the scheduled visits (acute stage\u2009=\u2009inpatient treatment; chronic stage\u2009=\u2009outpatient care). While for the needle electromyography (nEMG) at the acute stage, pathological spontaneous activity at rest (PSA) and increased discharge rates (DR) were assessed, the nEMG at the chronic stage aimed to analyze PSA and motor unit action potential (MUAP) amplitudes. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) were only performed at the acute stage. Color image is available online.\n\nParticipants\nIndividuals with traumatic or ischemic SCI of any severity (AIS A\u2013D) were identified by consecutive sampling and considered eligible primarily if they presented a neurological level of injury (NLI) between C3\u2013C8. Because of a high number of screening failures (\nFig. 2\n), patients presenting with a NLI above C3 were also considered for inclusion if they had stable spontaneous respiration. Sample size was thus based on the average number of admissions. The detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria included the EMSCI and other additional parameters, all of which are listed in\nSupplementary Table S1\n.\n28\nAdministered medication that could potentially interfere with motor recovery was recorded. Three individuals received baclofen, another three received opioids, and none received benzodiazepines.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nRecruitment flow chart. EMSCI, European Multicenter Study about Spinal Cord Injury; SCI, spinal cord injury; ISNCSCI, International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury; nEMG, needle electromyography.\n\nStandardized clinical assessment\nNeurological condition was assessed by trained ISNCSCI assessors to ensure high quality standards.\n29\n,\n30\nParticipants were examined in accordance with the EMSCI time schedule at least once in the acute stage (16\u201340 days)\nand\nonce in the chronic stage (150\u2013186 or 300\u2013546 days) after SCI (\nFig. 1\n).\n31\nMotor function of the upper extremity key muscles was assessed as muscle strength graded on a six-level scale.\n32\nAccording to the ISNCSCI rules, the motor level follows the sensory level rostral to C5, which is the most rostral myotome represented by a key upper extremity muscle.\nFindings at the motor level and one segment caudal to it are referred to as \u201cat-level.\u201d Segments rostral to the motor level are termed \u201cabove-level,\u201d while those more than one segment caudal to the defined motor level are considered as \u201cbelow-level.\u201d\n\nCalculation of relative loss of motor function in the upper extremities\nThe relative loss of motor function in the upper extremities was based on the maximum achievable sum scores below the level of injury and the examined sum scores. It was determined according to the following formula:\nU\nE\nM\nS\nM\nA\nX\n\u2212\nU\nE\nM\nS\nE\nX\nA\nM\nU\nE\nM\nS\nM\nA\nX\nx\n100\n=\nL\no\nM\nF\nUEMS_MAX stands for the total maximum below-(motor) level upper extremity sum motor score on both sides of the body, UEMS_EXAM for the actual examined below-(motor) level upper extremity sum motor score on both sides of the body at the acute stage, and LoMF for the relative loss of motor function.\n\nAssessment of LMN integrity\nNeedle EMG was chosen to detect signs of LMN dysfunction and performed in five defined key muscles of the dominant arm (C5 to T1) at three different examination sites by two board-certified neurologists.\n33\nWith one exception, only upper extremity key muscles according to ISNCSCI were chosen.\n9\nInstead of the flexor digitorum profundus muscle, the abductor pollicis brevis muscle, representing the spinal segment C8, was investigated because of better accessibility for nEMG.\n34\nThe biceps brachii muscle (C5), the extensor carpi radialis longus muscle (C6), the triceps brachii muscle (C7), and the abductor digiti minimi muscle (T1) were additionally examined to provide a comprehensive mapping of the segmental innervation in the cervical spinal cord.\nCare was taken to rule out other causes of nEMG abnormalities such as neuromuscular diseases, polyneuropathy, brachial plexus injury, and any other known lesion of the peripheral nervous system (\nSupplementary Table 1\n): (a) past medical history, (b) early MRI to determine apparent cervical nerve root compression (please see next section \u201cMRI processing\u201d), (c) motor nerve conduction studies of the ulnar nerve (EMSCI protocol). In case of pathological findings, sensory nerve conduction studies of the ulnar nerve were added to exclude a subclinical peripheral nerve lesion (\nSupplementary Table S2\n).\nTo assess dysfunction of LMNs, PSA and discharge rates of MUAPs were determined and evaluated as described previously (\nFig. 3A\n).\n21\u201323\nTo eliminate false positives, amplitudes of action potentials below 20\u2009\u03bcV were excluded to minimize the risk of mistaking artifacts or other volume-conducted activity for PSA. Analysis and interpretation of both PSA and MUAP were based on a decomposed train of five matching potentials in accordance with published standards.\n22\n,\n35\u201337\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nRostrocaudal distribution of lower motoneuron (LMN) dysfunction. (\nA\n) Representative data acquired by needle electromyography (nEMG) comprising normal findings (blue box) and evidence of LMN dysfunction (red box). Evidence of LMN dysfunction is depicted by the detection of pathological spontaneous activity (PSA) or increased discharge rates (DR). (\nB\n) Needle-EMG findings of all examined muscles (\nn\n=\u200985) are illustrated in relation to the motor level (x-axis), which is defined as the most caudal myotome with at least antigravity strength and normal motor function rostral to it according to the International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI. \u201cAbove\u201d summarizes all segments at least one level rostral to the motor level. \u201cAt\u201d stands for those segments that are located at or no more than one segment below the motor level, while \u201cBelow\u201d is defined by all the segments that are more than one level below the motor level. The relative distribution of muscles with (red) and without (blue) LMN dysfunction as percentage of all examined muscles is shown in each of the three bars (y-axis). Absolute numbers (\nn\n) of muscles are given in respective sections of the bars. Color image is available online.\nThe PSA represent discharges of denervated or damaged (e.g., myopathy) single muscle fibers.\n21\n,\n23\nIncreased discharge rates are caused by a loss of motor units.\n22\nBoth PSA and increased discharge rates indicate LMN dysfunction but may occur independently. Therefore, LMN dysfunction was assumed when PSA and/or discharge rates of MUAPs >20\u2009Hz were detectable. Discharge rates of MUAPs were handled as a binary classifier (\u226420\u2009Hz/>20\u2009Hz). The severity of PSA was graded semi-quantitatively on a four-level ordinal scale from 0 to 3 as described previously.\n38\nThe PSA was correlated with the six-level ordinal-scaled motor function of the five key muscles (C5 to T1) defined by ISNCSCI.\n9\nBased on relevant literature and broadly accepted routine practice, muscles displaying MUAP amplitudes \u22652\u2009mV (observed in three different MUAPS per muscle; rise time >0.1\u2009msec) were considered to have undergone reinnervation by collateral sprouting as a compensatory mechanism at the chronic stage nEMG.\n39\n,\n40\nNeedle EMGs were sampled with 10\u2009kHz and decompositioned in a nEMG recording device (Schwarzer Topas, Natus, Munich, Germany). Recordings were done under acoustic control with the following settings: skin temperature >30\u00b0C, (bandpass) filter 5\u2009Hz to 5\u2009kHz, amplification 50\u2009\u03bcV/Div (PSA)/0.1\u20135.0\u2009mV/Div (MUAP), and sweep speed to 10\u2009msec/Div.\n\nMRI processing\nThe anatomical T2-weighted MRIs were acquired on 1.5T and 3T scanners (Siemens: 1xAera, 2xAvanto, 2xEspree, 8xSymphony, 2xTrio, 2xVerio) immediately after admission to the primary care hospital and\u2014if applicable\u2014before spine surgery. The MRI parameters were as follows (see also\nSupplementary Table S3\n): slice thickness for the sagittal plane 17x 3.0\u2009mm (turbo spin echo sequence), and for the axial plane 1x 2.0\u2009mm (gradient echo sequence), 11x 3.0\u2009mm (10x turbo spin echo and 1x gradient echo sequence), and 5x 4.0\u2009mm (turbo spin echo sequence).\nThe T2-weighted hyperintense MRI signal changes at the spinal cord lesion site were considered indicative of myelopathy and associated structural damage. Subsequently, the extent of myelopathy was compared with the nEMG findings (\nFig. 4\n) and evaluated for its value in estimating motor recovery. The extent of myelopathy detected by MRI was expressed as percentage of the cross-sectional area of the spinal cord in each segment.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 4.\nTypical findings of needle electromyography (nEMG) and routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (\nA\n) Needle-EMG shows severe (grade 3) pathological spontaneous activity (PSA) in the biceps muscle\u2014the key muscle for segment C5 according to the International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI in an individual with a C4 lesion level. The PSA was characterized by a full interference pattern of abundant PSA in all examined areas. The MRI shows marked myelopathy at the corresponding segmental level of vertebral body C5. (\nB\n) At C7 level of the same individual\u2014three segments caudal to the lesion level (C4)\u2014nEMG and MRI are normal. (\nC\n) The lower motoneuron (LMN) dysfunction (severe PSA and increased discharge rates [DR] of motor unit action potentials) identified four segments caudal (biceps muscle) to the lesion level C1 in an individual with longitudinally extensive myelopathy at the corresponding level of vertebra C5. Extensive myelopathy was likely caused by an intraspinal hematoma, which compressed the spinal cord beyond the lesion level. Color image is available online.\nThe MRI analysis was performed by a board-certified neuroradiologist and a board-certified neurologist using conventional open-source processing software (DICOM viewer OsiriX Lite, Pixmeo SARL, Bernex, Switzerland). Cervical neuroforamina were analyzed to exclude compression of nerve roots. The spinal cord segmental level (C1-T1) was assigned as a reference to the respective vertebral body\n25\n,\n41\n: three T2-weighted MRI axial scans per cervical segment were analyzed as a percentage of the cross-sectional area of the spinal cord. For this, the relevant sections of each cervical segment were derived from the scan closest to the cover plate, the mid-level, and the base plate of the respective vertebral body.\nThe area showing hyperintense signal changes representing myelopathy of the spinal cord was marked and normalized by the total cross-sectional area of the spinal cord (\nFig. 4\n). Subsequently, a mean value was calculated from the three obtained percentages of myelopathy for each segment.\nFinally, the extent of myelopathy for each segment was averaged over both examiners. The following formula summarizes the workflow:\nm\ny\ne\nl\no\np\na\nt\nh\ny\ns\ne\ng\nm\ne\nn\nt\n=\n1\n2\n\u2211\ne\nx\na\nm\ni\nn\ne\nr\nS\nF\n,\nM\nW\n1\n3\n\u2211\nl\no\nc\na\nt\ni\no\nn\nc\no\nv\ne\nr\n,\nm\ni\nd\nd\nl\ne\n,\nb\na\ns\ne\nm\ny\ne\nl\no\np\na\nt\nh\ny\ne\nx\na\nm\ni\nn\ne\nr\n,\nl\no\nc\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n,\ns\ne\ng\nm\ne\nn\nt\nc\nr\no\ns\ns\ns\ne\nc\nt\ni\no\nn\ne\nx\na\nm\ni\nn\ne\nr\n,\nl\no\nc\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n,\ns\ne\ng\nm\ne\nn\nt\n.\n\nQuantitative variables and grouping\nThe presence of LMN dysfunction was classified with a binary variable as either\nnegative\nor\npositive\n. It was considered\npositive\nin case of PSA >0 and/or discharge rates of single MUAP >20\u2009Hz were detected. For semiquantitative evaluation of PSA, a grading of 2 and 3 reflected moderate to severe LMN dysfunction, whereas a grade of 1 was considered mild LMN dysfunction. Needle EMG findings were grouped by the segmental distance from the ISNCSCI motor level. Negative numbers represent segments rostral to the lesion, whereas positive numbers stand for segments caudal to the lesion.\n\nStatistical analyses\nData were processed, analyzed, and visualized using the Python Data Science Stack, i.e., pandas (data processing),\n42\nmatplotlib (visualization),\n43\nand scipy (statistics).\n44\nThe \u03a7\n2\n-test was used to test the distribution of LMN dysfunction in the above-level, at-level, and below-level grouping, the association of LMN dysfunction with high amplitudes of MUAPS and motor recovery, as well as subgroup analysis (AIS A/B versus AIS C/D).\nSpearman's \u03c1 rank correlation coefficient was used to test the association between ordinally distributed variables such as the ISNCSCI motor score or the PSA. Association was interpreted as slight (r\u2009\u2265\u20090.1), moderate (r\u2009\u2265\u20090.3), or strong (r\u2009\u2265\u20090.5).\n45\nCategorical data are presented as median and related interquartile range (IQR) or both 25\nth\nand 75\nth\npercentiles.

Patients presenting with AIS grades A, B, and C were included. The extent of the posterior cervical decompression was based on the intramedullary lesion length (IMLL)\u2014one level of laminectomy was prescribed for each 15\u2009mm (the height of a single vertebral body) of IMLL. Laminectomy was performed in addition to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) or anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion. Decompression was judged adequate if, on post-operative MRI or computed tomography (CT) myelogram, CSF was visualized ventral or dorsal or both ventral and dorsal to the spinal cord.\nSubjects were excluded if they had only anterior surgery without laminectomy (21 patients) or if they had inadequate laminectomy\u2014i.e., continued compression of the spinal cord at the rostral and/or caudal skeletal segments (10 patients). In addition, patients were excluded if tCSCI was because of penetrating injury (13 patients) and if the level of injury was restricted to upper cervical spine segments (C1/C2, 10 patients). No contrast or MRI studies, spinal epidural hematoma, SCI without radiological abnormality, and non-operative management were other reasons for exclusion (six patients). Post-operative CT myelogram (in three patients) and MRI confirmed adequate laminectomy in 104 patients.

    "Methods": "Study design, setting, and participants\nParticipants, 11\u201318 years, were enrolled between 8/18/2017\u201310/26/2020 as part of a prospective observational cohort study approved by the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Institutional Review Board. Participants and/or their parents/legal guardians provided written assent/written informed consent. Uninjured athletes were recruited from a suburban middle and high school and were offered an opportunity to participate in clinical assessments at the beginning of and immediately after their sport season. A single uninjured participant could have multiple assessments across multiple sport seasons and across multiple academic years; all assessments for a given participant were included.\nConcussed participants were recruited from the CHOP Minds Matter Concussion Program as well as the suburban school. Youth from the participating school originally enrolled in the uninjured cohort who subsequently sustained a concussion were only included in the concussed cohort. If a participant sustained multiple injuries during the enrollment period, only the first was included. The diagnosis of concussion was made by a trained sports medicine pediatrician according to the most recent Consensus Statement on Concussion.\n31\nAll concussed individuals had initial clinical assessments within 28 days of injury and assessments were repeated through recovery as part of standard clinical care.\nIn this study, recovery was defined as the time when the clinician determined the course of care was complete, and that the participant was cleared to return to previous activities, based on symptom trajectory, physical examination findings, and cognitive functioning. Participants were excluded from enrollment if they were still recovering from a previous concussion (or within 30 days of clearance from a previous concussion) or if they sustained lower extremity injury preventing the assessment of gait. Trained research staff conducted clinical assessments in either the school athletic training room or the sports medicine office.\n\nClinical assessments\nDemographics\nAge, sex, race, ethnicity, and concussion history were self-reported for healthy participants and abstracted from the medical record for concussion cases.\nVVE\nThe VVE is a battery of nine maneuvers (\nTable 1\n) that has been implemented and shown reliable across multiple specialties.\n16\u201318\nIts elements include:\nTable 1.\nVisio-Vestibular Examination Elements\nExamination element\nDescription\nAbnormalities\n1\nSmooth pursuit\nExaminer stands approximately 30\u2009cm in front of patient.

All subjects completed the PCSI self-report form electronically.\n37\n\nModeling and statistical analyses\nSee\nSupplementary Appendix SA1\nfor a complete description of our modeling approach. Briefly, to model how the VVE changes with time after injury, we introduced two sets of binary variables for each observation to denote the presence of an abnormal VVE and concussed status. Given that some VVE examination abnormalities could worsen after injury before plateauing,\n15\nwe modeled the logit of probability of an abnormal VVE score at a specific assessment time point as a cubic polynomial of the number of days post-injury to allow for potential non-linear trends. We then defined a variable for the number of days after injury when the outcome probability plateaued and no longer improved.\nTo account for differential follow-up, we included all individuals in the modeling, even for times taking place after their final observation date, by carrying their last observed VVE score forward, operating under the assumption that the date of late observation corresponded to recovery or near recovery. Because fewer than 5% of the total patients were lost to follow-up before being determined as recovered, the assumption to carry the last observation forward is well justified. To fit this model, we performed likelihood maximization via grid search to obtain estimates for the outcome measure of an abnormal VVE.\nData were examined first for the overall study sample and then by the following stratifications: days from injury to last assessment (\u226428 days vs. 29+ days, a proxy for differentiating recovery times, chosen based on the definition of persistent post-concussion symptoms (PPCS)\n38\n); age (<14 years vs. 14+ years, because this generally marks the division between middle and high school); sex (male vs. female); and concussion history (0 versus 1+).\nHypothesis tests were based on permutation of strata labels; large differences relative to the null distribution represent significant differences in VVE scores between strata. In addition, we compared demographics for concussed participants to uninjured participants using chi-square statistics for categorical variables (sex, race/ethnicity, age group, and concussion history) and F-tests for continuous age. In some instances, uninjured participants contributed more than one observation. To determine whether these repeated measurements biased our stratified comparisons, we applied an outputation procedure,\n39\nwhere independent random subsamples of the data were used to calculate differences between strata, and we found no significant effect of repeated observations from the same individuals (\np\n=\u20090.759). All analyses were conducted using R (RStudio, Inc)."

    "Methods": "Surgical procedures\nTwelve female pigs at four weeks of age, weighing 7\u201310\u2009kg were used for this study. The experimenters were blinded to the analysis of these data, and each animal was identified by a numerical code that did not reveal the group assignment until the analysis was completed. As shown in\nFigure 1\n, there were five animals in the Sham group and seven animals in the TBI group. Both groups received identical preparation using intramuscular injection of ketamine (20\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (2\u2009mg/kg). They were then intubated with 4% inhaled isoflurane for induction, then 2% isoflurane for maintenance. Pigs then received central venous catheter placement into cephalic veins, followed by tunneling between the animals' scapula to preserve their function for 30 days.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSchematic of the study. The Sham group and traumatic brain injury (TBI) group received the same dose of anesthesia and housing treatment. The study coordinators and researchers were blinded to the group assignments of each animal for the analysis. MR, magnetic resonance; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging.\nPigs assigned into TBI group had right frontoparietal craniotomy approximately 2.5\u20133\u2009cm in diameter. Then, CCI at 0.7\u2009cm depth over the rostral gyrus was delivered using a 1\u2009cm diameter indentor tip as described previously.\n24\nThis was considered a moderate severity injury for pigs. Pigs that were randomized into the Sham group had skin incision only without craniotomy. After the injury, pigs were monitored for 24\u2009h to ensure normal recovery before transferring them to normal housing.\n\nPlasma based biomarkers\nBlood samples were collected at one day, five days, and 30 days from the time of injury before sacrifice. After collection, blood samples were immediately centrifuged at 4400\u2009\u00d7\ng\nfor 5\u2009min. Plasma aliquots were stored at -80\u00b0C until analysis using single molecule array (Simoa). Using a custom-made Simoa 2-plex assay for GFAP and NFL developed by Quanterix Corporation, plasma samples were analyzed on an HD-1 Analyzer.\n\nTissue extraction and preparation (isolated cortical mitochondria)\nOn completion of the protocol described above, animals were euthanized with intracardiac injection of pentobarbital (150\u2009mg/kg) before brain tissue collection. Brain tissue then immediately underwent rapid but gentle dissection (pericontusional cortical tissue) to specifically obtain isolated mitochondria and was then transferred into ice-cold isolation buffer solution (320\u2009mM sucrose, 2\u2009mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid [EGTA], 10\u2009mM Trizma base, pH 7.4). Brain tissue was then transferred into ice-cold 1X brain buffer (made from 0.5\u2009L of 2X buffer: 225\u2009mM D-mannitol, 75\u2009mM sucrose, 5\u2009mM HEPES, 1\u2009mM EGTA, and 0.5\u2009L of double deionized water, pH 7.4), manually homogenized in 0.2% BSA buffer (catalog A6003), and centrifuged at 1300\ng\nand 4\u00b0C to separate the fatty pellet from supernatant.\nConsequently, the supernatant was centrifuged for 10\u2009min at 21,000\u2009\u00d7\ng\nto extract pellet. Brain mitochondria were isolated from the derived pellet by differential centrifugation and application of density gradients using 15%, 23%, and 40% Percoll (GE Healthcare cat. no. 17089101). Protein count for isolated mitochondria was obtained with a Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (catalog 23227) from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA).\n\nMeasurement of mitochondrial respiration in isolated brain mitochondria\nMitochondrial respiratory function was analyzed using Oroboros O2k-FluoRespirometers (Oroboros Instruments, Innsbruck, Austria). The substrate\u2013uncoupler\u2013inhibitor titration (SUIT) protocol measures oxidative phosphorylation capacity with electron flow through both Complex I and the convergent electron input of Complex I and II (CI and CII, respectively) using the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-linked substrates malate, pyruvate and glutamate as well as the flavin adenine dinucleotide-linked substrate succinate, both in the presence of adenosine diphosphate. Oligomycin was used to assess leak respiration.\nMaximal convergent non-phosphorylating respiration of CI and CII of the electron transport system (ETS\nCI+CII\n) is evaluated by titrating the protonophore, carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone. The complex III (CIII) inhibitor antimycin A is added to measure the residual non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption, and this value was subtracted from each of the measured respiratory states to provide only mitochondrial respiration. Complex IV-linked respiration was measured by the addition of N,N,N,N-tetramethyl-phenylenediamine together with ascorbate. Further details such as chamber final concentration can be found in our previous works.\n25\n,\n26\nAll data were acquired using DatLab 7 (Oroboros Instruments, Innsbruck, Austria), and respiration value was normalized to protein count for the brain.\n\nLongitudinal differential tractography\nThe animals underwent diffusion imaging on a 3T Tim Trio whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner (Siemens, Germany) with 12-channel phased array head coil at 24\u2009h and 30 days. This scanner and coil were used for all imaging sequences in the study, including MRS. At the time of the diffusion MRI, pigs were anesthetized in the same way as described for surgical procedures. Physiological monitoring including pulse oximetry and vital signs (oxygen saturation and heart rate) were recorded before and during the entire scanning period.\nThe following parameters were used for imaging: echo time (TE): 103\u2009msec, repetition time (TR): 4200\u2009msec, resolution: 2\n\u00d7\n2\n\u00d7\n2\u2009mm, sampling directions: 64, b-values: 0, 1000, 2000\u2009s/mm\n2\n. Using FSL software, Eddy current distortions and susceptibility induced distortions were corrected. Further processing of data was performed using DSI Studio, by automatic quality control. B-table was verified to ensure good quality of individual diffusion images. Diffusion imaging data were reconstructed in PNI50 space,\n347\na T1 weighted volumetric template based on 50 pigs. Q-space diffeomorphic reconstruction was performed. Differential tractography of five TBI pigs was generated between 30-day diffusion imaging and 24-h diffusion imaging using 5,000,000 seeding points, angular threshold between 15 to 90\u00b0, 1\u2009mm step size, with automatic threshold for anisotropy.\nTo quantify the progression of white matter injury, we performed differential tractography as described previously.\n28\nTo track pathways with decrease in anisotropy, criteria of greater than 20% change were set. Similarly, to track pathways with increase in anisotropy, greater than 20% criteria were also set.\nDifferential tractography with different values of change and length threshold have been tested and displayed on\nSupplementary Table S1\n. As described previously,\n28\nthe optimal percentage change and length threshold can be estimated by testing the number of fiber tracks generated at various settings comparing decreased and increased anisotropic diffusion. Briefly, because pigs with TBI undergo progressive loss of white matter over time, differential fiber tracks generated for decreased QA setting would be considered true positive findings. Differential fiber tracks generated for increased QA setting, however, would be considered false positive findings. The ratio of the fiber tracks at these two settings (track number for decreased QA/track number for increased QA) would be the false discovery rate (FDR). Low FDR (less than 0.05) would be considered highly specific, and this table shows that percentage change and length values (20%, 40\u2009mm) previously described in the original manuscript\n28\nalso yielded very low FDR for our dataset (FDR <0.00001).\n\nCorrelational tractography\nCorrelational tractography was performed by the connectometry function in DSI Studio, as detailed previously.\n29\nWe first reconstructed diffusion MRI data into PNI50 space\n27\nusing q-space diffeomorphic reconstruction (QSDR), and spin distribution function (SDF) was calculated.\n30\nThe SDFs of uninjured pigs from our laboratory database were averaged to create a common diffusion atlas. This atlas then provided the principal directions to sample each pig's SDFs for each voxel to create local connectome vectors. Each subject pig's local connectome vectors were compiled into a single local connectome matrix.\nThere were 11 pigs (\nn\n=\u20095 Sham,\nn\n=\u20096 TBI) that had data on NFL, GFAP, mitochondrial Complex I, Complexes I and II, Complex IV, and leak respiration data. As part of the quality control for correlational tractography, individual pig's QA map and the template's QA map were compared using automated function of DSI Studio to generate the mean Pearson correlation coefficient. This showed R\n2\nvalue ranging from 0.64\u20130.73 indicating sufficient quality registration. Local connectome matrix was then positively and negatively correlated with these biological parameters.\nThe details of the mathematical basis of this algorithm have been outlined previously.\n29\nBriefly, pre-defined thresholds were automatically generated by using the Otsu threshold\n31\nbefore making positive or negative association analysis. Positive associations were analyzed by including local connectomes with coefficients greater than this pre-defined threshold. Negative associations were analyzed by including local connectomes with coefficients less than a pre-defined threshold. Then the fiber tracking algorithm connected these local connectomes into tracks for negative or positive associations. Associations were then statistically tested by a permutation test, where both permuted and non-permuted local connectome matrices are associated with the physiological parameter such as NFL. The FDR was then calculated as a ratio of track count between a non-permuted and permuted condition.\nAs shown in\nSupplementary Figure S1\n, when correlational tractography was performed for NFL levels, there is large discrepancy between the histogram of tracks that express negative association (non-permuted) compared with the null distribution (permuted), and FDR\u2009=\u20090.05 was set for fiber track generation. In contrast, there is only a small difference between tracks that express positive association (non-permuted) compared with the null distribution (permuted). Using the DTI data from 11 animals (5 Sham, 6 TBI), T score threshold of 2 was assigned and deterministic fiber tracking algorithm was used.\n32\nFalse connections were removed by topology-informed pruning by two iterations. Seeding number used for each permutation was 50,000. To estimate the FDR, 2000 randomized permutations were applied to the group label to obtain the null distribution of the tract length.\n\nMRS Imaging (MRSI)\nAll MRSI sequences were obtained during the same sessions as diffusion MRI.\n1\nH MRSI from one animal with TBI was lost in data handling. Moreover,\n1\nH MRSI data were excluded from two other TBI cases because of poor spectral quality secondary to lipid contamination and/or incomplete suppression of water signal. The spectral quality was assessed by visual inspection, and Cramer Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) values as obtained from LC model software were also used to evaluate the spectral quality.\nSingle slice two-dimensional multi-voxel proton MR spectroscopic imaging (\n1\nH MRSI) was performed using a spin echo (point resolved spectroscopy) sequence with water suppression by means of a chemical shift selective saturation (CHESS) pulse. The\n1\nH MRSI sequence was acquired twice to cover almost the entire supratentorial brain region. Sequence parameters included: TR/TE\u2009=\u20092500/30\u2009msec, number of excitations\u2009=\u200916, field of view\u2009=\u200955\u2009\u00d7\u200955\u2009mm\n2\n, matrix size\u2009=\u200916\u2009\u00d7\u200916, slice thickness\u2009=\u20099mm resulting in a voxel size of 3.4\u2009\u00d7\u20093.4\u2009\u00d7\u20099.0mm\n3\n, bandwidth\u2009=\u20091500\u2009Hz, flip angle\u2009=\u200990\u00b0, and vector size\u2009=\u20091024.\nThe volumes of interest (VOIs) were selected to include regions of injury and multiple gray-matter and white-matter regions avoiding the scalp, skull base, or sinuses. Outer volume saturation slabs (30\u2009mm thick) were placed outside the VOIs to suppress lipid signals from the scalp. The data sets were acquired using elliptical k-space sampling with weighted phase encoding to reduce the acquisition time. Manual shimming was performed to achieve an optimal full width half maximum of <20\u2009Hz (magnitude spectrum) of the water signal. Water unsuppressed\n1\nH MRSI spectra were also acquired to use the water signal for correcting eddy current induced distortions.\nThe\n1\nH MRSI data were analyzed using a user-independent spectral fit program (Linear Combination [LC] Model)\n33\n,\n34\nfrom animals (\nn\n=\u20099) scanned at day 30. The region between 0.2 and 4.0\u2009ppm of the spectrum were analyzed, and the following metabolites were evaluated: NAA, Cr, Cho, myo-inositol (Ins), Glx (glutamate + glutamine), lipid + lactate (Lip+Lac). The error in the spectral fitting routine (LC Model) were used to assess the spectral quality for a particular voxel; metabolite concentrations from only those voxels were used that had the value of Cramer-Rao lower bounds/standard deviations (SD) less than 20%.\nThe metabolite ratios (NAA/Cr; Cho/Cr; Glx/Cr, and Lip+Lac/Cr) were computed from multiple gray-matter and white-matter regions covering right and left cerebral hemispheres independently and together. The number of voxels (\nn\n) encompassing these regions were cortical regions (\nn\n=\u20098\u201312); subcortical white-matter regions (\nn\n=\u20098\u201312); thalamus (\nn\n=\u20093\u20134); basal ganglia (\nn\n=\u20094); internal capsule (\nn\n=\u20098); genu of corpus callosum (\nn\n=\u20092); and selenium of corpus callosum (\nn\n=\u20092). These voxels' metabolite levels were averaged for each animal, and Sham animals were compared with TBI animals for ipsilateral and contralateral sides.\n\nStatistical analysis\nOnce differential tracks were generated, the fiber track volume estimations were collected from DSI Studio. These volumes from corona radiata, fornix, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus were compared between ipsilateral and contralateral sides using the Mann-Whitney\nU\ntest. For mitochondrial function data, with O\n2\nconsumption differences between Sham and TBI groups for Complex I, Complex I and II, Complex IV, and leak respiration were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney\nU\ntest. The\n1\nH MRSI data were analyzed for NAA/Cr ratio and Cho/Cr ratio as major variables. These parameters were compared between Sham and TBI groups using the Mann-Whitney\nU\ntest. Throughout all the statistical analysis,\np\n<\u20090.05 was used as a threshold for significance."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll experiments were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Uniformed Services University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. C57BL/6 male mice (Charles River) were acquired at \u223cpostnatal Day 35-49 (PN35-P49) and allowed at least 72\u2009h of acclimation before the initiation of any experimental procedures. Mice were group housed in standard cages under a 12\u2009h/12\u2009h light-dark cycle with standard laboratory lighting conditions (lights on, 0600-1800, \u223c200 lux), with ad libitum access to food and water. All procedures were conducted beginning 2-4\u2009h after the start of the light-cycle, unless otherwise noted. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and reduce the number of animals used throughout this study.\n\nRepetitive mild traumatic brain injury model\nBeginning at \u223cPN56, mice were subjected to either repeated sham or repeated closed-head injury (CHI) delivered by the Impact One, Controlled Cortical Impact (CCI) Device (Leica; Wetzler, Germany) utilizing parameters which were previously described.\n27\nMice were anesthetized with isoflurane (3.5% induction/2% maintenance) and fixed into a stereotaxic frame. Specifically, repeated CHI-CCI (mTBI group) consists of five discrete concussive impacts to the head delivered at 24\u2009h intervals generated by an electromagnetically driven piston (4.0\u2009m/sec velocity, 3\u2009mm impact tip diameter, a beveled flat tip, 1.0\u2009mm depth; 200\u2009msec dwell time) targeted to bregma as visualized through the skin overlying the skull following depilation. Sham surgery consisted of identical procedures without delivery of impact. Body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C throughout by a warming pad and isoflurane exposure and surgery duration was limited to no more than 5\u2009min. Following sham or CHI-CCI surgery completion, mice were immediately placed in a supine position in a clean cage on a warming pad and the latency to self-right was recorded.\n\nRecombinant adeno-associated viral vector injection\nA separate set of mice were used to inject the AAV into the LHb 2 weeks prior to the CHI-CCI. Seven-week-old mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (3.5% induction and 2% maintenance) and fixed into a stereotaxic frame. Body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C throughout the procedure and during recovery with a heating pad. The scalp was shaved and depilated with Nair\n\u00a9\n, and a U-shaped incision between the ears was made on the skin overlying the skull, allowing for the visualization of bregma and lambda sutures during CHI-CCI procedure. Viral vectors were infused (50 nL/side; over 5\u2009min using a Nanoject III Injector, Drummond) using pulled glass pipettes into the LHb (coordinates from bregma: AP, -1.6\u2009mm; ML, \u00b10.5\u2009mm; DV, -3.2\u2009mm). Mice received either AAV8-CaMKII-hM4Di (Gi)-mCherry (Addgene# #50477) or control AAV8-CaMKII-EGFP (Addgene#50469) viral vector for viral expression in glutamatergic LHb neurons. Animals recovered for 10-11 days prior to the initiation of mTBI procedures. Viral expression was confirmed by fluorescence and/or immunohistochemistry at the conclusion of behavioral experiments and mice with no viral expression in the LHb were excluded from data analysis.\n\nSucrose splash test\nSucrose splash test was performed at 10-12 days following the final mTBI or sham procedure in separate cohorts of sham and mTBI with or without viral injections. For chemogenetic inhibition of LHb activity, we utilized a novel DREADD ligand, JHU37160 28 which has been shown to have high\nin vivo\npotency and no off-target effects. Mice that were injected with control or DREADD viral vectors received either 0.3\u2009mg/kg JHU37160 or equivalent volume of vehicle (0.9% saline) intraperitoneally (i.p.) 30-min prior to behavioral testing. The order of drug presentation was cross-balanced within groups across behavioral testing days such that half of a group received vehicle and the other half received JHU37160. This dosage and the timing of administration/behavioral testing was chosen based on pharmacokinetic profile of JHU37160 indicating 30-min post-injection as the optimal time-point where maximal drug concentration in brain is anticipated.\n28\nMice were video monitored throughout the sucrose splash test. Mice were individually introduced to an empty (7\u2009\u00d7\u200911.5\u2009\u00d7\u20094.5 inches) clear polycarbonate cage. Following a 10-min baseline assessment of behavioral activity the animal was gently removed from the testing arena, sprayed twice with an atomizer containing 10% sucrose solution onto the dorsal coat, returned to the test arena, and monitored for an additional 5\u2009min. The 10% sucrose solution is a sticky substance that soils the animal's coat, with the typical response being rapid initiation of vigorous grooming behaviors. Video recordings were assessed by an experimenter blinded to the condition of the subjects and scored for total grooming behavior and the latency to initiate the first bout of grooming after sucrose splash. Grooming is considered any movements involving active touching, wiping, scrubbing, or licking of the face, forelimbs, flank, or tail for greater than 3 consecutive seconds.\n\nSucrose preference test\nA separate cohort of sham and mTBI mice were tested for sucrose preference test 18 days following sham and mTBI surgeries. Mice were first single housed 7 days post-injury and left undisturbed for 5 days. Starting on 12 days post-injury, all mice were presented with\nad libitum\naccess to two bottles containing either 1% sucrose solution or water to habituate the animals to the consumption of sucrose and avoid neophobia. After 3 days of habituation, mice returned to\nad libitum\naccess to drinking water only. On 18 days post-injury, mice were presented with two bottles at 1800 (start of their dark period); one bottle containing water and the other 1% sucrose solution, and evaluated for sucrose preference. Bottle positions were switched at 2400 to reduce any confound produced by side bias. Total consumption of each fluid was measured by weight the following day at 0600 (end of the dark period) and sucrose preference was calculated as the percentage of sucrose intake over the total fluid consumption during the 12\u2009h test. Throughout habituation days, bottles were counterbalanced daily to the left/right position to avoid a side-bias.\n\nSlice preparation\nMice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and immediately transcardially perfused with ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing (in mM): 126 NaCl, 21.4 NaHCO\n3\n, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 2.4 CaCl\n2\n, 1.00 MgSO\n4\n, 11.1 glucose, 0.4 ascorbic acid; saturated with 95% O\n2\n-5% CO\n2\n. Brain tissue was kept on ice-cold aCSF and tissue sections containing LHb were sectioned at 220\u2009\u03bcm using a vibratome (Leica; Wetzler, Germany) and subsequently incubated in aCSF at 34\u00b0C for at least 1\u2009h prior to electrophysiological experiments. For patch clamp recordings, slices were then transferred to a recording chamber and perfused with ascorbic-acid free aCSF at 28-30\u00b0C.\n\nElectrophysiology\nVoltage-clamp cell-attached and voltage/current-clamp whole-cell recordings were performed from LHb neurons in sagittal slices containing LHb using patch pipettes (3-6 MOhms) and a patch amplifier (MultiClamp 700B) under infrared-differential interference contrast microscopy. Data acquisition and analysis were carried out using DigiData 1440A, pCLAMP 10 (Molecular Devices), Clampfit, Origin 2016 (OriginLab), and Mini Analysis 6.0.3 (Synaptosoft, Inc.). Signals were filtered at 3\u2009kHz and digitized at 10\u2009kHz.\nTo assess LHb spontaneous activity, cells were patch clamped with potassium gluconate-based internal solution (130\u2009mM K-gluconate, 15\u2009mM KCl, 4\u2009mM adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-Na\n+\n, 0.3\u2009mM guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-Na\n+\n, 1\u2009mM EGTA, and 5\u2009mM HEPES, pH 7.28, 275-280\u2009mOsm) in slices perfused with aCSF. Spontaneous neuronal activity and AP firing patterns (tonic, bursting) were assessed in both cell-attached recordings in voltage-clamp mode at V\u2009=\u20090 and whole-cell recording in current-clamp mode at I\u2009=\u20090 for \u223c1-min recording as previously described.\n29\n,\n30\nSpontaneous excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs and sIPSCs) were recorded within the same LHb neuron in voltage clamp mode with a cesium-methanesulfonate (CsMeS)\u2013based internal solution in intact synaptic transmission over 10 sweeps, each lasting 50\u2009sec (a total of 500\u2009sec continuous recording for either sEPSC or sIPSC). Patch pipettes were filled with CsMeS internal solution (140\u2009mM CsMeS, 5\u2009mM KCl, 2\u2009mM MgCl\n2\n, 2\u2009mM ATP-Na\n+\n, 0.2\u2009mM GTP-Na\n+\n, 0.2\u2009mM EGTA, and 10\u2009mM HEPES, pH 7.28, osmolality 275-280\u2009mOsm) as previously described.\n31\nCells were voltage-clamped at -55\u2009mV to record sEPSCs and +10\u2009mV to record spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) within the same neuron, as previously described.\n32\nThe mean excitation/inhibition (sE/I) of spontaneous synaptic activity were calculated as sEPSC/sIPSC amplitude or frequency ratios from the same recording. The mean synaptic drive ratio was calculated as (sEPSC frequency\u2009\u00d7\u2009amplitude)/(sIPSC frequency\u2009\u00d7\u2009amplitude). To create histograms and cumulative probability plots for sE/I amplitude and frequency ratios and synaptic drive ratio, we adopted a novel quantitative approach\n33\nby randomly selecting 10 sEPSC and 10 sIPSC recordings (each lasting 15\u2009sec) over each sweep of the 50s recording in each cell and calculated the ratios between sEPSC and sIPSC over 15\u2009sec recordings. Therefore, for each cell, the combination of 10 sEPSC and 10 sIPSC yielded 100 data points (100 sE/I amplitude or frequency or synaptic drive ratios as calculated for the mean ratio values).\nWhole-cell recordings of AMPAR-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) were isolated in aCSF perfused with picrotoxin (100\u2009\u03bcM), D-APV (50\u2009\u03bcM) and TTX (1\u2009\u03bcM) and internal solution containing 117\u2009mM Cs-gluconate, 2.8\u2009mM NaCl, 5\u2009mM MgCl\n2\n, 2\u2009mM ATP-Na\n+\n, 0.3\u2009mM GTP-Na\n+\n, 0.6\u2009mM EGTA, and 20\u2009mM HEPES (pH 7.28, 275-280\u2009mOsm). Whole-cell recordings of GABA\nA\nR-mediated miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) were isolated in aCSF perfused with DNQX; 10\u2009\u03bcM, strychnine (1\u2009\u03bcM) and tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1\u2009\u03bcM). Patch pipettes were filled with 125\u2009mM KCl, 2.8\u2009mM NaCl, 2\u2009mM MgCl\n2\n, 2\u2009mM ATP-Na\n+\n, 0.3\u2009mM GTP-Na\n+\n, 0.6\u2009mM EGTA, and 10\u2009mM HEPES (pH 7.28, 275-280\u2009mOsm). For both mIPSCs and mEPSCs, LHb neurons were voltage-clamped at -70\u2009mV and recorded over 10 sweeps, each lasting 50\u2009sec. The cell input resistance and series resistance were monitored through all the experiments and if these values changed by more than 10%, data were not included.\n\nStatistical analysis\nValues are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean. The threshold for significance was set at\np\n<\u20090.05 for all analyses. All statistical analyses of data were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.4.1. For detecting the difference in distribution of silent, tonic or bursting LHb neurons in sham and mTBI mice, we used chi-squared tests. For the effects of mTBI on mean values of sEPSC, sIPSC, mEPSC, mIPSC, sE/I ratios, synaptic drive ratios, and sucrose splash test without viral injections, we used unpaired Student's t test. Sucrose preference test results were analyzed by a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. Mini Analysis software was used to detect and measure sEPSC and sIPSC amplitude and frequency (inter-event interval), as well as mEPSC and mIPSC amplitude, charge transfer (area under the curve), decay time constants (Tau) and frequency (inter-event interval) using preset detection parameters of spontaneous or mini events with an amplitude cutoff of 5 pA. Effects of mTBI on the cumulative probabilities data sets were analyzed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. Effects of mTBI and JHU37160 during splash test were analyzed using two-way ANOVA tests with Sidak's\npost hoc\ntest."

    "Methods": "Pluripotent stem cell cultures\nHuman pluripotent stem cells (H9, WA09, WiCell) were cultured feeder-free and maintained on Matrigel\u2122 (BDBiosciences, 354230, growth factor reduced) coated plates in mTeSR-1 medium (Stem Cell Technologies, 05850) plus 1% penicillin and streptomycin (Life Technologies, 15070).\n\nGeneration of cerebral organoids\nCerebral organoids were generated following previously published methods.\n30\n,\n31\nBriefly, pallial and subpallial spheroids were generated from pluripotent stem (PS) cells and assembled\nin vitro\nto replicate the development of the human cerebral cortex. Pallial spheroids were generated by plating dissociated PS cells into ultra-low attachment 96 well plates to form embryoid bodies in neuro induction medium (NIM) containing 20\u2009\u03bcM ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632, Selleckchem #S1049). NIM contains: DMEM-F12 (Invitrogen) with KnockOut Serum Replacement (20%, Invitrogen), GlutaMAX (1:100, Invitrogen), MEM-NEAA (1:100, Gibco), 2-mercaptoethanol (0.1\u2009mM, Gibco), penicillin and streptomycin (1%, Sigma). Dorsomorphin (10\u2009\u03bcM, Sigma) and SB-431542 (10\u2009\u03bcM, Tocris) were added for the first 6 days for neural induction. Spheroids were transferred to neural medium (NM) containing Neurobasal A (Gibco, 10888) with B27 supplement (- Vitamin A, Invitrogen), GlutaMAX (1:100, Invitrogen), penicillin and streptomycin (1%, Sigma). For neural progenitor expansion, NM was supplemented daily with fibroblast growth factor (20\u2009ng/mL, Peprotech) and epidermal growth factor (20\u2009ng/mL, Peprotech) for 10 days, then every other day for 9 days. For neural differentiation of pallial spheroids, NM was supplemented with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (20\u2009ng/mL, Peprotech) and NT3 (20\u2009ng/mL, Peprotech) every other day until Day 43. After Day 43, all spheroids were maintained in NM without factors.\nFor development of subpallial spheroids, were prepared as above. However, beginning at Day 4, Wnt pathway was inhibited by adding IWP-2 (5\u2009\u03bcM, Selleckchem) to the NIM and NM media. On Day 12, sonic hedgehog pathway was activated by adding SAG (100\u2009nM, Selleckchem) together with IWP-2 until Day 24. After Day 24, subpallial spheroids were maintained in the same conditions as pallial spheroids.\nCerebral organoids were formed by a fusion of the pallial and subpallial spheroids to mimic development of the human cerebral cortex. On Day 43, pallial and subpallial spheroids were transferred into a single well of a 24 well plate and pushed together. The plate was tilted and placed in the incubator for 5-7 days. Media was carefully changed every 4 days. Once complete cerebral organoid fusion occurred, the 24 well plate was returned to a rotating shaker in the incubator and NM without factors was changed 3 days a week.\n\nTabletop \u201cblast\u201d device\nQuasi-hydrostatic pressure waves were delivered by a previously developed tabletop \u201cblast\u201d device.\n29\nPressure loading in this device can be considered as quasi-hydrostatic for the following reason: pressure waves travel at the speed of sound in water (\u223c1480\u2009m/sec), and the length of the pressure chamber is nearly 30\u2009mm. In consequence, any change in pressure takes around 20\u2009\u03bcs to completely homogenize inside the chamber. The characteristic frequency of an event of this speed is around 50\u2009kHz. This frequency is 10 times as fast as the fastest frequency used in this study (5\u2009kHz). To introduce high frequency pressure wave onto cerebral organoids, prewarmed and CO\n2\nbuffered NM was added to the \u201cblast\u201d chamber (3-5\u2009mL). Organoids from a single experimental group were added together into the \u201cblast\u201d chamber where it was then closed and sealed without introducing any air bubbles. The chamber was then installed into the support frame.\nA user-defined excitation voltage profile was used to drive a piezoelectric actuator and create a pressure waveform within the chamber at 500\u2009Hz, 3000\u2009Hz, or 5000\u2009Hz frequency for a duration of 8\u2009msec. For the readability, these three frequency levels will be referred hereafter simply as Low group, Mid group, and High group, with the implicit understanding that the terms refer to the abovementioned three loading frequency levels. In this study, this frequency space was examined at \u201cthreshold\u201d of 250\u2009kPa (as previously proposed)\n5\n,\n21\nor \u201csuprathreshold\u201d of 350\u2009kPa pressure wave amplitude. Because the chamber is filled with a nearly incompressible liquid (culture medium), organoids inside are equally exposed to similar over pressure profiles. For \u201cno blast\u201d controls, organoids were loaded and sealed into \u201cblast\u201d chamber, but the actuator was not activated. After exposure (\u223c30\u2009sec process to load and unload), organoids were removed and plated onto a multi-electrode array (MEA) for functional recordings. The integrated blast overpressure for each pressure wave form was calculated numerically using the trapezoidal rule (Python function\nnumpy.trapz\n).\n\nMEA recordings and custom analysis\nFused cerebral organoids were plated onto a 24-well MEA plate (24W700/100F-288, Multichannel Systems) previously coated with 10\u2009\u03bcg/mL poly-L-ornithin (Sigma, P3655) and 5\u2009\u03bcg/mL laminin (Invitrogen, 23017-015). At the bottom of each well of the MEA plate is 12 gold electrodes 100\u2009\u03bcm in diameter spaced 700\u2009\u03bcm apart. Prior to plating organoids, fresh NM was added to each well and allowed to buffer in 5% CO\n2\nfor 30\u2009min. MEA recordings were acquired with the Multiwell-Screen Acquisition software (Multichannel Systems, v1.11.7.0). For raw electrographic data, organoids were plated immediately after \u201cblast\u201d and the plate was placed on the MEA for 1\u2009h before the first recording. 37\u00b0C incubation temperature and 5% CO\n2\nwas maintained the entire time. All recordings acquired were sampled at 10\u2009kHz and filtered with a band-pass filter of 1\u2009Hz-3500\u2009Hz for 2\u2009min.\n\nEvent detection\nAutomatic event detection was performed using the Multiwell-Analyzer (Multichannel Systems, v.1.8.6.0). For single unit events, a bandpass filter from 100\u2009Hz-3500\u2009Hz with a second order Butterworth filter. Single unit events were detected based on 5 standard deviations of estimated noise from each active electrode. For population events, a bandpass filter from 1\u2009Hz-3500\u2009Hz with a second order Butterworth filter was applied and event detection criteria was based on 15 standard deviations of baseline noise. Single unit and population events are reduced in response to bath application of the voltage-gated sodium channel antagonist lithium chloride (data unpublished). For all organoids, active electrodes were defined by visual mapping of contacted channels. Electrodes without contact with organoid were not included in the data set. Event amplitude and frequency were calculated by Multiwell-Analyzer. For visualization, event data was exported to .csv files and plotted using custom Python code with\nmatplotlib, scipy,\nand\nnumpy\nlibraries.\n\nPower spectral analysis\nTo compute the power spectral density, 5-sec epochs from active channels were exported to .csv files and transformed using a discrete Fourier Transform (\nnumpy.fft\n) and averaged peak power (\nscipy.signal.find_peaks\n). Signal frequency was visualized in the time domain using the spectrogram function (\nscipy.signal.spectrogram\n). Computation and analysis were adapted from published neural data repository.\n34\nPower data was normalized to the corresponding control group.\n\nNetwork synchrony analysis\nFor network synchrony, 2-sec epochs from two selected channels of unfiltered timeseries data was exported and analyzed using Python code adapted from Mike X Cohen.\n35\nA Fourier Transform was performed on the raw data and convolved using a complex Morlet Wavelet convolution (10\u2009Hz). The phase angle was computed for both channels from the phase angle complex convolution (\nnumpy.angle\n). Phase synchronization was calculated by the difference between phase angles of the selected channels. This value is bound between 0 and 1, with values close to 1 indicating greater synchrony.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nAll organoids were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and transferred to 30% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline until sectioned. To section, organoids were embedded in tissue freezing medium and frozen. Serial sections were taken at 16\u2009\u03bcm and mounted on a glass slide. All sectioned organoids were stored at -20\u00b0C until stained. For immunohistochemistry, all slides were washed with 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and incubated for 1\u2009h at room temperature in a 3% normal goat serum blocking solution. The primary antibody was incubated on the slide overnight at 4\u00b0C. Primary antibodies used in this study include mouse anti-TUJ1 (Santa Cruz, sc-80005; 1:500) and rabbit anti-activated caspase 3 (Millipore Sigma, AB3623; 1:500). The primary antibody was washed with 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009TBS and the fluorescent secondary antibody was incubated for 1\u2009h at room temperature. The secondary antibodies used in this study were anti-mouse FITC (ThermoFisher, F-2761; 1:500) and anti-rabbit TxRed (Vector, TI-1000-1.5). After the secondary was washed, DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamindino-2-phenylindole; ThermoFisher, D1306; 1:10,000) was added for 5\u2009min to visualize nuclei. Slides were cover slipped with mounting medium and dried before imaging.\n\nMicroscopy and imaging\nFluorescent images were acquired on a widefield epifluorescence (Leica, DM2000) or confocal microscope (Nikon A1). Exposure times were consistent for each channel throughout all samples. For AC3 analysis, area of staining was measured using ImageJ software (v1.53k; National Institutes of Health). Briefly, the pixel area of each organoid was measured. Using built in threshold tools, the pixel area of AC3 staining was measured and subtracted from the total area of the organoid. This percentage is represented in the data as % AC of area.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM), unless indicated otherwise. Statistical differences comparing means were analyzed using a two-tailed Student's t-test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) for data with equal variances. Tukey's multiple comparisons test for ANOVA were used to determine difference between groups and is indicated by an asterisk and black bar. Pearson's chi-squared test (\u03a7\n2\n) was used for data sets where control data was measured at zero. For all data sets, statistical outliers were excluded using Grubbs' test for outliers. All data was collected and analyzed at one time. All statistics were performed using GraphPad with Prism 8.4.3, following Statistics Guide.\nData and code availability\nAll data supporting the findings in this study are provided within the paper. All additional information will be made available upon reasonable request to the authors. Custom MEA Analysis code was written in Python (v.3.10.1).\n36"

    "Methods": "Data sources and study design\nThe data source for this retrospective cohort study was a 5% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries obtained from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Chronic Conditions Warehouse (CCW) for years 2007\u20132015. These data contain longitudinal health encounter information on beneficiaries \u226565 years and individuals <65 years with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or recognized Social Security disabilities. There are more than 55 million beneficiaries\n27\n(>98% of adults aged 65 and over\n28\n,\n29\n) enrolled in the Medicare program today, making claims data nationally representative and one of the richest sources of utilization information in the country. It represents the Medicare-covered US population,\n28\na diverse mixture of race, ethnicities, and geographical regions across the United States.\nTo identify beneficiaries residing in NHs, Medicare Part A data were linked to the Minimum Data Set 2.0 and 3.0 (MDS 2.0 and 3.0). The MDS is a federally mandated health status assessment of all Medicare/Medicaid certified NH residents. It provides a comprehensive assessment of each resident's functional capabilities and includes clinical assessments for residents at admission, discharge, quarterly, annually, and on any significant change in health status. It also includes dates of all assessments, admissions, and discharges.\n30\nThe merged file of Medicare claims with the MDS consists of detailed date-specific information, which allows for tracking NH status monthly.\n\nCoverage criteria\nContinuous Medicare coverage was defined as having full, uninterrupted Medicare Parts A, B, but no C (health maintenance organization [HMO]) coverage. Participants were required to have 12 months of continuous coverage before the index date (the date of TBI, non-TBI trauma, or date of inpatient/outpatient visit in the uninjured group) and a minimum of three months of continuous coverage after the index date. Participant follow-up time continued if the continuous coverage criterion was met, up to five years post-index date.\n\nStudy participants\nParticipants included community-dwelling beneficiaries \u226565 years of age, meeting coverage criteria, and with a diagnosis of either a TBI, a non-TBI injury, or were uninjured between January 2008 and June 2015. Beneficiaries already living in a NH were excluded. Participants contributed follow-up time until the sooner of discontinued enrollment, NH placement, death, September 30, 2015, or five years.\n\nExposure\nThe exposure in this study was injury status, classified into three mutually exclusive levels: TBI, non-TBI trauma, and uninjured. We ensured that the injury groups were independent by excluding persons who appeared in more than one group. We chose to use only diagnoses codes in the primary position of a claim, to eliminate beneficiaries who may have had other more severe health problems that could have altered their risk of NH placement. Typically the location of claims can be indicative of the severity of injury or health problem (in the uninjured cohort).\nComparison with the non-TBI trauma beneficiaries will help disentangle the effect of an isolated TBI from the effect of traumatic injury in general while comparison with uninjured beneficiaries will provide an estimate of the overall impact of TBI on NH entry compared with the general population of Medicare beneficiaries.\nTBI\nThis exposure category consisted of beneficiaries with an isolated traumatic injury to the head. A TBI was operationalized using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case definition International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes often used in epidemiologic studies.\n31\n,\n32\nWe searched for the first claim for at least one of the following International Classification of Diseases (ICD) version 9, clinical modification (ICD-9-CM) codes for concussion (850.xx), non-specific TBIs (853.xx-854.1x), and other TBIs (800.xx, 801.xx, 803.xx, 804.xx, 851.xx-852.xx, 950.1-950.3, 959.0) between January 2008 and June 2015 in the first position of inpatient and outpatient claims.\nNon-TBI trauma\nThis exposure category consisted of comparison beneficiaries with a traumatic injury, not involving the head. Adopting codes from the Barell Injury Diagnosis Matrix,\n33\nwe searched for the first claim for at least one of the following ICD-9-CM codes for any of the four major injury diagnoses: torso fractures (807.0x-4x, 808.xx, 809.xx) upper extremity fractures (810.xx-818.xx), hip fractures (820.xx), and lower extremity fractures (821.xx-827.xx) between January 2008 and June 2015 in the first position of inpatient and outpatient claims. We randomly selected and frequency-matched with the TBI group on index dates and inpatient and outpatient claims.\nTypically, less severe injuries are diagnosed in an outpatient setting while more severe injuries are likely diagnosed in an inpatient setting. By matching on the distribution of inpatient and outpatient claims, we attempted to ensure a similar distribution of hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases and, ultimately, injury or health problem severity. Our random sampling was conducted in a stratified manner to ensure this.\nUninjured\nThe uninjured exposure category included a random sample of inpatient and outpatient claims of beneficiaries aged \u226565 years, meeting continuous coverage criteria, and without a TBI or a non-TBI injury between January 2008 and June 2015. Beneficiaries in this group were selected randomly to have a frequency-matched sample of the same size and with the same distribution of inpatient and outpatient claims as the TBI group, resulting in an equivalent distribution of index dates.\n\nOutcome\nThe primary outcome was long-term NH entry. The NH stays were identified based on the method described by Intrator and associates\n34\nand modified by Goodwin and colleagues\n35\nusing Part A claims plus the MDS. We defined long-term NH entry as the first NH admission that resulted in a stay of \u2265100 days to distinguish admissions for long-term care from admissions for short-term stays that typically occur for rehabilitation (detailed in the\nSupplementary Appendix\n). This definition is based on Medicare's policy for reimbursement (short NH stays <100 days where skilled nursing care is needed are covered by Medicare. However, Long stays \u2265100 days are not covered). Time to NH entry was calculated as the difference between the index date and the date of NH admission. Beneficiaries were right censored at the time of death, at the end of follow-up, or study termination.\n\nCovariates\nDemographic, clinical characteristics, and original reason for entitlement code were obtained from administrative claims files. The CCW data also contain information on 27 common chronic comorbid conditions, with an annual flag for each condition as well as the date of the first diagnosis for that condition, based on validated algorithms that search for specific diagnostic codes within the CMS administrative claims.\n36\nWe combined the five cancer flags to create an \u201cany cancer\u201d variable and selected to report the Alzheimer disease and related dementias flag rather than the Alzheimer disease (only) flag. We used the date of the first diagnosis to determine whether a condition was present at the index date.\n\nStatistical analysis\nWe compared the baseline distribution of demographic and clinical variables by injury status, using either chi-square goodness of fit for categorical variables and analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables, as appropriate. We excluded all individuals who were NH-dwelling pre-injury and used stabilized inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) to balance covariates between exposure groups. We used a multi-nomial logistic regression in which the outcome variable was injury group and included the following as covariates in the model: demographic variables such as age, sex, and race; 27 common chronic conditions, and other variables such as length of follow-up and original reason for Medicare entitlement.\nGiven our large sample size, all covariates differed significantly across injury groups. We examined the balance of observed covariates in the weighted sample by computing standardized mean differences (the difference in means between TBI and no-TBI (non-TBI trauma and uninjured) groups divided by the overall standard deviation) on pre- and post-matched samples, following published guidelines.\n37\nWe used a cutoff of \u00b10.03 for standardized differences to identify covariates that could be further adjusted for in the regression model as a form of doubly robust estimation.\n38\n,\n39\nWe quantified the effect of TBI on the risk of NH entry in the presence of death as a competing risk using cause-specific Cox proportional hazards models with stabilized inverse probability weights to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of entering a NH, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All analyses were performed with SAS Studio Enterprise Edition 3.71 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Maryland, Baltimore."

    "Methods": "Literature search and systematic review selection criteria\nA comprehensive literature search of five databases (MEDLINE\u00ae, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus and SportDiscus) was performed on January 31, 2020, to identify studies that met the following inclusion criteria:\nSubjects had TBI or subconcussive hits/repetitive head impacts\nAny type of MRS (single-voxel or magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging)\nAll ages, males and/or female subjects\nAny field strength\nManuscripts were in the English language\nStudies were excluded if subjects were diagnosed with traumatic encephalopathy syndrome, as this is a distinct diagnosis.\n121\nAdditionally, review articles and gray literature (e.g., conference abstracts, government publications, unpublished trial data, dissertations/theses, letters, or editorials) were excluded. For complete search details, please see\nSupplementary Tables S1\u2013S5\n.\nTwo independent reviewers (J.M.J. and P.L.L.) completed all abstract and full-text screening using the Covidence platform.\n22\nDiscrepancies were resolved by a third, independent reviewer (A.D.H.). The protocol for our systematic review was registered in the PROSPERO database (\nhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/\n; registration CRD42020167259). This article was written in accordance with the most recent 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines.\n\nMeta-analysis selection criteria\nThe meta-analyses were performed on NAA, Cho, Cr, Glx, and mI, as there is an abundance of\n1\nH MRS and\n1\nH magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) literature for these metabolites in TBI. Studies were included in the meta-analysis if they met inclusion criteria for the systematic review, had a control group, and reported either water- or creatine-referenced (Cr-referenced) metabolite levels or fully quantified metabolite levels. Details on quantification approach criteria can be found in the\nData extraction\nsection.\nStudies that examined only the less commonly studied nuclei (31P, 13C) and other metabolites available in\n1\nH spectroscopy were excluded from meta-analyses. Studies that lacked consistent, anatomically defined regions of interest for voxel placement (i.e., were placed in a lesion), case series (\nn\n<\u20095 in control or TBI group) and studies that had metabolite values that were either not reported or unextractable, were also excluded. For studies that were identifiably from the same study sample, only the study with the largest sample size was included in the meta-analysis.\n\nData extraction\nReviewers J.M.J. and P.L.L. independently extracted all data from the included studies using a customized data extraction form (see\nSupplementary Table S6\n). If studies reported metabolite values in a table or in the text, values were extracted directly. For studies that did not report metabolite values but included bar graphs that displayed the metabolite mean and standard deviation or scatter plots, WebPlotDigitizer\n23\nwas used to manually extract data. Some studies subdivided TBI groups by good and poor health outcomes or other clinical measures. In such cases, we combined the mean and standard deviation of TBI subgroups for comparison with controls using the formula described in the most recent edition of the\nCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.\n24\nA comprehensive list of all variables extracted is reported in Table S6. Often, Glu and Gln are reported as a combined Glx signal because the signals are highly overlapped, although it is known that Glu is more concentrated and dominates the Glx signal (see\nTable 1\n). The majority of studies reported Glx; however, if data were reported for Glu alone, this was included in the Glx meta-analysis.\nBrain injury severity was classified based on the severity description reported in the original research articles; subconcussive hits (subconcussive hits + repetitive head impacts), mild TBI, moderate/severe TBI, and mixed TBI (mild + moderate/severe TBI). As MRS studies often combined moderate and severe TBI data, these categories were merged into a single moderate/severe TBI group. If severity was not specifically indicated, it was defined using Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores (mild\u2009=\u2009GCS 13\u201315, moderate\u2009=\u2009GCS 9\u201312, severe TBI\u2009=\u2009GCS <9).\n8\nTime since injury was defined as the mean time since injury to MRS scan as reported by the study. We further categorized data into hyperacute (within 72\u2009h), acute (> 72\u2009h\u20132 weeks), subacute (> 2 weeks\u20133 months) and chronic (> 3 months) phases. Age was defined as the mean age of the sample. Sex was defined as the percentage of males within the study. Brain regions and tissue composition (white matter dominant, gray matter dominant, or mixed white+gray matter) were defined by the description provided in the original research articles. If no description was explicitly provided, brain regions and tissue composition were categorized by visually inspecting figures with voxel placements and comparison with similar voxel placements from other articles. Generally, one of three quantification approaches were used across the studies included in the meta-analysis including: (1) Cr-referencing, (2) water-referencing assuming constant parameters in the voxel, thus reporting metabolite levels in institutional units (i.u.), in this article, which will be referred to as relative water-referenced data, and (3) complete tissue correction, which includes accounting for differential T1, T2, and water density in white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), here referred to as absolute (Abs) quantification. Another quantification method is to use an external solution reference, in which a phantom solution that contains metabolites with known concentration is scanned and used as a reference for metabolite quantification. Because of the challenges associated with this approach,\n17\nonly one study\n54\nincluded in this review had used this approach. See the consensus paper by Near and coworkers for additional details on complete tissue correction and external solution references.\n17\n\nStatistical analysis\nOur primary analyses were quantitative comparisons of metabolite levels in brain-injured subjects relative to controls, with brain region as a subgroup. Nine brain regions were defined: frontal, frontoparietal, parietal, parietooccipital, occipital, temporal, subcortical, corpus callosum, and cerebellum. We used five distinct random-effects models (restricted maximum likelihood method) to generate the mean effect size (Hedges' g and 95% confidence interval [CI]) of brain injury on NAA, Cho, Cr, Glx, and mI levels in each brain region of interest and across all brain regions. Whole-brain MRSI metabolite measures were not evaluated as a subgroup in our regional analysis, as our primary interest was to explore whether metabolite alterations in brain injury differ by brain region.\nBetween-study heterogeneity was quantified using the\nI\n2\nstatistic. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for each metabolite using the leave-one-out method. Small study effects were examined using Egger's test and through visual inspection of funnel plots.\nUnivariate meta-regression was used to assess other potential moderators of metabolite levels including injury severity, time since injury, age, sex, tissue type (white matter dominant, gray matter dominant, mixed tissue), field strength, echo time (TE), quantification approach (absolute compared with relative water-referencing or Cr-referencing), and year of publication. Studies that did not report a moderator of interest were excluded from that specific moderator analysis. In the moderator analyses, we tested whether a moderator impacted the detection of group differences. The exception was for the quantification approach. As absolute quantification is generally recommended,\n17\nthis moderator analysis compared whether relative water- and Cr-referencing results showed different effects than absolute quantification (basis of comparison). A common study design included multiple time point measurements for the brain-injured group (i.e., longitudinal) and a single measurement for the controls. When this study design was used, we used only the time point of the brain-injured group with the largest sample size to avoid repeated sampling of the control group in moderator analyses. However, for the time since injury meta-regression, the concern of repeated sampling was outweighed by the bias toward larger sample sizes at more acute visits and the desire to have as much data across time points as possible. Therefore, we included all time points to avoid undue sampling bias toward more acute visits that were less likely to have dropouts. Following standard practice for both the primary and moderator analyses, subgroups with fewer than two metabolite measurements were excluded. All statistical analyses were performed in STATA/BE 17.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX).\n\nRisk of bias assessment\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) quality assessment tool for observational cohort and cross-sectional studies was used to assess the risk of bias of all studies included in meta-analyses. This tool is composed of 14 yes/no questions designed to assess the risk of bias. The quality rating was assigned as good/fair/poor and was completed by two independent reviewers (J.M.J. and P.L.L.) and conflicts were resolved by a third individual (A.D.H). Assessment of the quality of data was based on current standards in the field.\n17\n,\n18"

    "Methods": "Subjects and lateral fluid percussion injury (FPI)\nYoung adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Envigo, 250\u2013275\u2009g upon arrival, approximately 9\u201310 weeks old) were pair housed in standard, non-enriched sedentary housing and maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle with\nad libitum\nfood and water. All animal procedures were approved by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Animal Care and Use Committee. Young adult males were used due to epidemiological data indicating that males are at a significantly higher risk for TBI, with the highest male-to-female ratios occurring in young adulthood.\n31\nAll groups were handled for 1min/day for 4 days prior to either mild-moderate lateral FPI or sham surgery. Lateral FPI was induced using a previously published protocol\n21\n,\n22\n,\n32\u201335\nused in our laboratory. Animals were anesthetized under a 1\u20132% isoflurane-oxygen mixture.\nA midline incision was made followed by a left hemisphere 3-mm diameter craniotomy centered 3\u2009mm posterior and 6\u2009mm lateral to bregma. A plastic injury cap was adhered to the skull with silicone gel and dental cement and filled with sterile saline. The animal was removed from anesthesia and the injury cap was attached to the FPI device (Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA). Upon toe-pinch response, a brief fluid pulse (\u223c20\u2009msec) of saline was administered directly to the dura mater. Apnea and loss of consciousness (LOC; measured by toe-pinch response) were measured to determine injury severity. Rats were then placed back on anesthesia to remove the injury cap and suture the scalp. Sham animals received the same surgical procedures except fluid pulse impact. Upon completion of surgery, animals were placed in a heated recovery chamber until normal behavior resumed and then were returned to the vivarium. Injury severity was measured by toe-pinch withdrawal and was within the mild-moderate range, similar across experiments and balanced within experiments comparing different fear conditioning protocols. For experiment 1, injury severities were 31.3\u2009\u00b1\u200922.8\u2009sec (apnea) and 290.4\u2009\u00b1\u2009101.1\u2009sec (toe pinch), with injury input averaging 2.94\u2009\u00b1\u20090.36 atm. For experiment 2, injury severities averaged 19.1\u2009\u00b1\u200910.6\u2009sec (apnea) and 314.9\u2009\u00b1\u200989.9\u2009sec (toe pinch), with injury input of 1.81\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2 atm. Rats were weighed daily for one week after surgery to monitor recovery.\n\nFear conditioning and behavior\nTo determine chronic effects of TBI on fear learning and expression, behavioral testing began 4 weeks following FPI. Because of the long period between manipulations, all groups were handled daily for 4 days and received transport habituation for 2 days prior to behavioral testing to reduce the stress of leaving the vivarium prior to behavioral testing. For transport habituation, rats were transported from the vivarium to the behavioral testing room for 10\u2009min and returned to the vivarium. Training and auditory cue testing occurred in two distinct conditioning chambers (context A and context B) that differed in transport mode, location, odor, lighting, chamber shape, and flooring (Med Associates Inc., Georgia, VT, USA). For context A, animals were transported from the vivarium on a cart in their home cage, testing room and chamber lights were illuminated, and the test chamber had flat standard shock grid floors and was scented and cleaned with 50% Windex. For context B, animals were transported in an opaque black tub to a testing room and test chamber that had lights off, smooth Plexiglas floors, curved back wall inserts, and was cleaned and scented with 1% acetic acid. Percent time freezing to auditory stimuli and context were recorded as measures of auditory cued and contextual fear, respectively. Auditory stimuli were produced by Med Associates speakers mounted to the chamber. The frequency range for white noise was 10\u2009Hz to 20\u2009kHz broadband white noise. Behavioral testing protocols differed slightly depending on the goals of the experiments, as outlined below.\nExperiment 1 examined the chronic effects of FPI on fear conditioning to different auditory stimuli. Where CS refers to the conditional stimulus and US refers to the unconditional stimulus, following a 180-sec baseline period, rats received 10 CS-US pairings (30\u2009sec/75 dB CS; 2\u2009sec/0.9\u2009mA footshock US) with 210-sec fixed inter-trial-interval in context A. Auditory CSs were either white noise (Noise Shock) or 2800\u2009Hz pure tone (Tone Shock) of the same intensity (75 dB). Over the following 2 days, all groups were tested for context fear and extinction (20\u2009min/day, context A). All groups were then tested for fear expression to both their trained and untrained auditory cue in a novel context (4 trials each [30\u2009sec]; context B). Stimulus cue testing order was counterbalanced over 2 days (see\nFig. 1A\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nStimulus-specific fear conditioning leads to increased freezing to novel cue chronically after FPI.\n(A)\nExperimental design;\nn\n=\u20098\u20139/group.\n(B)\nNoise-shock or tone-shock fear conditioning 4 weeks after lateral FPI.

Both groups decreased freezing to context across 2 days of testing.\n(D)\nWhite noise cue test. Tone Shock groups showed elevated baseline freezing (***\np\n<\u20090.001 Tone Shock vs. Noise Shock). Noise Shock groups showed greater freezing to their trained white noise cue compared with Tone Shock groups, and FPI-Noise Shock animals showed significantly higher freezing to the white noise versus Sham-Noise Shock (##\np\n<\u20090.01, FPI-Noise Shock vs. Sham-Noise Shock).\n(E)\nTone cue test. Again, Tone Shock groups showed higher baseline freezing compared with Noise Shock groups (*\np\n<\u20090.05 Tone Shock vs. Noise Shock). A significant three-way interaction showed that FPI-Tone Shock animals showed greater freezing to the trained tone versus Sham-Tone Shock animals during the tone test. Also, FPI-Noise Shock animals showed robust freezing to the untrained, novel tone during the first two trials (##\np\n<\u20090.01, #\np\n<\u20090.05 FPI-Noise Shock vs. Sham-Noise Shock). All data represented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM. BL, baseline; FPI, fluid percussion injury; SEM, standard error of the mean.\nExperiment 2 Associative generalization versus non-associative sensitization\nHere we sought to determine whether FPI in the chronic phase affects fear expression as generalization to other stimuli and/or sensitization as non-associative reactivity to novel stimuli, both responses of which are reflective of heightened defense. FPI and Sham groups were fear conditioned with either white noise-shock (Noise Shock) or an unsignaled footshocks (Shock Only) training protocol. Noise-shock fear conditioning was identical to experiment 1 (10 trials; 30\u2009sec/75 dB CS; 2\u2009sec/0.9\u2009mA footshock US), and the Shock Only conditioning protocol was the same but with the auditory CSs removed. In this experiment, all groups received 4 days of 30-min context tests to produce full context extinction. Groups were then tested for percent freezing to both white noise (75 dB) and pure tone (2800\u2009Hz/75 dB) cues in a novel context (4 trials each [30\u2009sec]; context B). Therefore, the Noise Shock group was tested with their trained CS (white noise) and a generalization stimulus (tone), whereas both auditory stimuli were novel for the Shock Only group. Stimulus test order was counterbalanced across 2 days (see\nFig. 2A\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nIncreased fear generalization to novel cue chronically after FPI.\n(A)\nExperimental design;\nn\n=\u20097\u201310/group.\n(B)\nNoise shock or shock only fear conditioning 4 weeks after lateral FPI. Increased freezing in shock only versus noise-shock fear conditioning, regardless of FPI (***\np\n<\u20090.001, **\np\n<\u20090.01, *\np\n<\u20090.05 for Shock Only vs. Noise Shock group).\n(C)\nIncreased context freezing in Shock Only groups during context tests (***\np\n<\u20090.001, **\np\n<\u20090.01 Shock Only vs. Noise Shock). Both groups decreased freezing to under 10% in the conditioning context across 4 days of testing. FPI-Noise Shock groups showed increased freezing to the conditioning context on test days 2 and 3 compared with Sham-Noise Shock (#\np\n<\u20090.05 FPI-Noise Shock vs. Sham-Noise Shock).\n(D)\nWhite noise cue test. FPI-Noise Shock animals showed significantly higher freezing to their trained white noise cue on trial 1 versus Sham-Noise Shock (#\np\n<\u20090.05, FPI-Noise Shock vs. Sham-Noise Shock). Shock Only groups did not show freezing behavior to the novel white noise cue.\n(E)\nTone test. Noise Shock groups showed more freezing to the novel tone than Shock Only groups (**\np\n<\u20090.01, *\np\n<\u20090.05 Noise Shock vs. Shock Only). FPI-Noise Shock animals froze significantly more to the tone than Sham-Noise Shock (#\np\n<\u20090.05 FPI-Noise Shock vs. Sham-Noise Shock), suggesting FPI increased fear generalization in the chronic phase after injury. All data represented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM. BL, baseline; FPI, fluid percussion injury; SEM, standard error of the mean.\n\nTissue collection\nTwo days after the last auditory cue test, animals in experiment 2 were anesthetized with isoflurane and brains were rapidly removed. Basolateral amygdala (BLA) units were immediately microdissected and frozen separately on dry ice, then stored at \u221280\u00b0C until analyzed. Tissue samples were prepared using the Syn-PER Reagent (ThermoFisher) and manufacturers protocol to isolate BLA-enriched synaptic fractions. Briefly, tissue was homogenized in Syn-PER reagent with a pestle homogenizer. Samples were then spun in a refrigerated centrifuge at 1200\ng\nfor 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C to spin down large cellular debris. The supernatant was then collected in a fresh tube and spun at 15,000\ng\nfor 20\u2009min at 4C\u00b0. The supernatant was discarded, and the remaining pellet was resuspended in Syn-PER reagent and stored at \u221280\u00b0C as the enriched synaptic fraction for further analysis.\n\nWestern blot and analysis\nWestern blots were performed using a standard protocol in our laboratory.\n34\n,\n36\n,\n37\nTotal protein for each sample was determined with a Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit. Due to the limitation of lanes per gel (\nn\n=\u200924), groups were divided between two blots, whereas one control group (Sham-Shock Only) was replicated across both blots. Blot 1 was loaded with Shock Only groups (Sham-Shock Only, FPI-Shock Only), blot 2 was loaded with Noise Shock groups (Sham-Noise Shock, FPI-Noise Shock) and a replicate of Sham-Shock Only. Due to the \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAr) subunits (GluA1 and GluA2) both being near 110 kDA, this pattern was duplicated in third and fourth blots. Samples were counterbalanced across lanes. Normalized protein was pseudorandomly loaded at a concentration of 0.33\u2009mg/mL on 10% Tris-HCl gels and run at 160\u2009V for 50\u2009min. Proteins were then transferred from the gel to a nitrocellulose membrane at 0.4 amps for 120\u2009min.\nTotal protein was imaged on a Bio-Rad imager with filter using SYPRO\u2122 Ruby Protein Stain solution (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). The membrane was washed then blocked in 5% milk for 60\u2009min. Primary antibody (GluA1, 1:5000, Abcam, AB31232; GluA2, 1:5000, Millipore Sigma, MABN1189) was added and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Blots were washed and incubated in secondary antibody (1:10 k) in 1% milk buffer solution. Blots were washed and protein bands were developed using Bio-Rad ECL and exposed for 1 to 5\u2009min on a Bio-Rad MP imager. Raw values for the proteins of interest were normalized to total protein within each lane/sample. Synaptic protein enrichment and antibody specificity was validated for BLA tissue and are illustrated in\nSupplementary Figure S1\n.\n\nBehavioral measures\nFreezing behavior, an active defensive response, was measured as an index of fear and defined as complete cessation of movement except that required for respiration.\n38\u201340\nPercent time freezing to auditory stimuli and context were recorded and measured by an automated system calibrated to a highly trained observer (MSF; VideoFreeze, Med Associates).\n\nStatistical analysis\nBehavioral data (\nn\n=\u20097\u201310/group) were analyzed using mixed factors analysis of variance (ANOVA) for injury group (Sham, FPI) and training protocol (Shock Only, Noise-Shock) across trials. Western blot data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA across groups and blots. Pearson correlations were performed for western blot data and freezing during the first trials of the tone generalization test. Statistical significance was determined at a\np\n-value of 0.05 or less, and when significant interactions were detected, post hoc analyses were performed for simple main effects and multiple comparisons (western blot)."

    "Methods": "Participants\nThe participants were recruited from a multi-site study of the natural history of concussion conducted through the National Collegiate Athletic Association-Department of Defense (NCAA-DoD) CARE Consortium Advanced Research Core (ARC). All participants received baseline clinical assessments when recruited into the CARE-ARC study. Number of previous (self-report) concussions were recorded, and participants were excluded if they had previous concussions within 6 months of the baseline assessments. Concussion events were identified and diagnosed by the research and medical staff at each site based on an evidence-based guideline,\n40\nwhich decided concussion as \u201ca change in brain function following a force to the head, which may be accompanied by temporary loss of consciousness, but is identified in awake individuals with measures of neurologic and cognitive dysfunction.\u201d Throughout the post-injury process, concussed athletes also received clinical care by a site's medical team. All participants (including concussed and contact-control athletes) received the same clinical assessments, blood sample collection, and multi-modal MRI scans. The clinical and imaging assessments of the contact controls were yoked to the schedule of demographically matched injured athletes. More detailed study design and the power calculation of the CARE study can be found in the method article.\n41\nThe study sites included in this analysis are the University of North Carolina (UNC), the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), and Virginia Tech (VT). At the time (January 2019) when the data was frozen, there were 68 collegiate athletes diagnosed with acute concussion (24\u201348\u2009h post-injury) and 64 matched contact-sport controls available for analysis. All were included in the present study (\nTable 1\n). The two groups were matched with respect to age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, estimated pre-morbid level of verbal intellectual functioning (i.e., Wechsler Test of Adult Reading [WTAR\n42\n], number of prior concussions, years of participation, sport type, and position played.

The BSI score was a composite score of three subcategories: BSI-soma for somatic symptoms, and BSI-anxiety and BSI-depression for evaluating affective symptoms. Thus, a total of five clinical measures were studied for associations with white-matter abnormalities along the tracts. Both the concussed and control athletes underwent the same clinical assessments on the day the MRI scans were performed.\n\nMRI protocol\nParticipants underwent MRI on Siemens MAGNETOM 3.0 T Tim Trio (VT, UNC, and UCLA) or 3.0 T Prisma (UNC and UCLA) scanners across three ARC sites with a 12-channel (VT) or 32-channel (UNC and UCLA) receiver-only head coil. For anatomical imaging, high-resolution T1-weighted images (1\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm) were acquired on 3.0 T MRI scanners at each site. A three-dimensional (3D) magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequence was used with repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE)/inversion time (TI)\u2009=\u20092300/2.98/900\u2009msec, flip angle\u2009=\u20099 degrees, field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u2009256\u2009mm, matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, 176 slices, slice thickness\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm. For diffusion imaging, a single-shot spin-echo echo planar imaging (SS-SE-EPI) sequence with a twice-refocused spin echo was used. The diffusion-encoding scheme comprised 30 directions at a b-value of 2000\u2009sec/mm\n2\n, 30 directions at a b-value of 1000\u2009sec/mm\n2\n, and 4 b\n0\nvolumes (b-value\u2009=\u20090\u2009sec/mm\n2\n). One of the b\n0\nvolumes was acquired with a reversed phase-encoding direction. Other parameters included TE/TR\u2009=\u200998/7900\u2009msec, FOV\u2009=\u2009243\u2009mm, matrix size\u2009=\u200990\u2009\u00d7\u200990, whole-brain coverage of 60 slices with a slice thickness of 2.7\u2009mm, and an isotropic voxel size of 2.7\u2009mm.\nCare was taken to ensure the quality and stability of the diffusion MRI signal across sites. Briefly, prior to the present study, three quality assurance and control (QA/QC) related studies were performed to ensure the MRI image quality and to evaluate cross-site diffusion signal stability. These studies included physical phantom scans, traveling human phantom scans, and analyses of non-contact-sport controls across sites as described previously.\n29\n,\n31\n,\n46\n,\n47\n\nImage processing\nThe diffusion image pre-processing pipelines used were the same as those employed in a previous study.\n29\n,\n31\nBriefly, all the raw and motion-corrected diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) were inspected by a single trained researcher (SMM). Two data sets with severe motion artifacts beyond correction were excluded and not counted toward the total sample size described above. Diffusion image processing included pre-processing followed by computation of DTI metrics and streamline tractography. The DWIs were first de-noised using the local principal component analysis approach.\n48\nUnlike the conventional method of de-noising by smoothing the image, the local principal component analysis de-noising approach does not sacrifice spatial resolution. With a pair of reverse-phase encoded b\n0\nimages as reference, the DWIs were then corrected for motion, eddy current artifacts, and static-field geometric distortion using the\neddy_openmp\ncommand provided in the FMRIB Software Library (FSL).\n49\nAfter image pre-processing, DTI metrics were computed from the first shell with a b-value of 1000\u2009sec/mm\n2\nand a linear fitting algorithm using the FSL\ndtifit\ncommand. Four classic DTI metrics were computed, including FA, MD, AD, and RD.\n50\nTo prepare for statistical analyses of group differences, maps of the DTI metrics were transformed to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using Advanced Neuroimaging Tools (ANTs) non-linear registration.\n51\nWhole-brain white-matter streamline tractography was performed on all shells (b-value of 1000\u2009s/mm\n2\nand b-value of 2000\u2009s/mm\n2\n; see\nSupplementary Figure S1\n). Because only cortical-to-cortical connections were considered in this study, the white and gray matter interface was segmented to serve as starting and destination points for tractography. For each participant, the interface was derived from their T1-weighted images (see\nSupplementary Figure S2\n). Briefly, the T1-weighted images underwent brain extraction using FSL\nbet\n; gray matter and white matter were segmented using FSL\nFAST\n; the gray-matter and white-matter masks were dilated via a Gaussian kernel with a width of 1 voxel (\nfslmaths\n) prior to intersection (\nfslmaths\n) for rendering the interface; and subcortical structures were identified and removed by\nfsl_anat\n. In the native subject diffusion space, streamline tractography was performed using the\ntrack\ncommand in CAMINO software with a q-ball and spherical harmonic reconstruction for fiber orientation distribution functions.\n52\nOther tractography parameters were: maximum allowable fiber number per voxel\u2009=\u20093, anisotropy threshold\u2009=\u20090.5, curvature threshold\u2009=\u200960 degrees, step size\u2009=\u20090.5\u2009mm Euler distance, and iteration\u2009=\u200925 to reach a total whole-brain streamline count of 10\n5\nper participant.\n\nStatistical analyses\nTwo-tailed\nt\n-tests for continuous variables and Pearson's chi-square tests for categorical variables were performed to detect group differences in participants' demographics measures, previous concussion history, sport types, positions, and clinical assessments (\nTable 1\n). Affected white-matter areas were identified via tract-based spatial statistical (TBSS) analyses. These areas were defined to have significant differences in DTI microstructural metrics in the concussed athletes compared with the contact-sport controls. Briefly, in the standard MNI space, a common whole-brain white-matter skeleton was extracted using the FSL toolbox.\n53\nWithin the white-matter skeleton (\nFig. 1\n, green voxels), the non-parametric permutation-based statistics employed in TBSS (i.e., the\nrandomise\ncommand) were used for voxelwise statistical analysis to test for significant group differences. A threshold-free cluster enhancement\n54\nand 5000 permutations\n55\nwere used in the study. White-matter voxels were deemed significant if\np\n<\u20090.05 after adjusting for multiple comparisons by controlling family-wise error rate (FWER). General regression models were used in TBSS with diffusion metrics as the dependent variable and the group membership as the independent variable. Covariates of age, sex, site, and scanner were included to adjust these differences in means.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nMaps of white-matter voxels with significant group differences.\n(A)\nMaps of white-matter voxels (yellow) where the concussed athletes had significantly elevated RD compared with the contact-sport controls.\n(B)\nMaps of white-matter voxels where the concussed athletes had significantly elevated MD compared with the contact-sport controls. TBSS were used with a general linear model;\np\n<\u20090.05 adjusted for multiple comparisons with the FWER was deemed significant. The green voxels denote the white-matter skeleton where the statistical test was performed. The dark red is background enhancement for illustration purposes. FWER, family-wise error rate; MD, mean diffusivity; RD, radial diffusivity; TBSS; tract-based spatial statistics.\nSignificant white-matter voxels in the standard space were collected as regions-of-interest (ROIs) and reverse-transformed back to native subject diffusion space. These ROIs then served as a filter to identify those streamlines passing through the affected white-matter areas for each participant in the concussed group and the contact-sport controls. These filtered streamlines in the concussed athletes were referred to as \u201caffected\u201d white-matter tracts (\nFig. 2\n). Streamlines passing through the whole-brain TBSS white-matter skeleton, except the significant voxels (only the green voxels in\nFig. 1\n), were referred to as \u201cunaffected\u201d white-matter tracts. The number and length of the streamlines were summarized for affected and unaffected white-matter tracts in the concussed athletes. The DTI microstructural metrics were converted to the intrinsic coordinates of each streamline in the CAMINO software, and the diffusion metrics along streamlines were averaged.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nAffected white-matter fiber tracts in one concussed athlete. The white-matter voxels with significant group differences in MD (i.e., yellow voxels in\nFig. 1B\n) were collected to form an ROI in the MNI standard space. For each concussed participant, the ROI was transformed from the standard space back to the subject diffusion space, where streamline tractography was performed. Tractography streamlines passing through the filter ROI (yellow) are shown in the figure for one concussed athlete. Their corresponding white-matter tracts are the forceps minor, superior corona radiata, posterior corona radiata, and cingulum. MD, mean diffusivity; MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute; ROI, region of interest.\nWith respect to streamline lengths, the following comparisons were assessed: (1) the affected ratio (i.e., the ratio of affected white-matter streamlines relative to the whole distribution); (2) DTI microstructural measurements along the streamlines between affected and unaffected white-matter tracts; and (3) correlations of the DTI microstructural measurements along affected white-matter tracts with the clinical assessments. Paired\nt\n-tests were used for comparisons between affected and unaffected white-matter tracts within a participant, and partial correlation analyses were used to evaluate the correlation of the DTI metrics with the clinical assessment scores adjusted for sites and MRI scanners. Matlab (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA) and the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) were used for plotting and statistical analyses."

    "Methods": "The reporting of this study is in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR),29with an additional study screening and selection flowchart (Fig. 1) as recommended by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) and PRISMA-ScR reporting guidelines.29\u201331Unlike systematic reviews, scoping reviews do not require an antecedent protocol registration,32notwithstanding, review objectives, eligibility criteria, and preliminary study characteristics to be extracted were determineda priori.\n\nOur scoping review was guided by the comprehensive scoping review framework by Arksey and O'Malley,33with minor refinements, including those suggested by Levac and colleagues34and the JBI.30This framework includes: (1) identifying the research question; (2) identifying relevant studies; (3) study selection; (4) charting the data; (5) collating, summarizing, and reporting the results; and an optional (6) consultation exercise. This review serves as part of a wider program of work in which stakeholders (neurotrauma physicians) are formally engaged in a separate qualitative research process, examining their views, experiences, and opinions of FUTs as applied to post-TBI care provision. Prior to commencing the review, we shared similar perceptions to those of Levac and colleagues34regarding the challenges of conducting and integrating the results of stakeholder consultation within a review's findings. In light of this, and given the potential of qualitative inquiry to empower rich and in-depth investigations of the human experience,35stage 6 was not carried out within this review. Notwithstanding, the lead author (BGS) discussed findings with senior co-authors, who by their nature as LMIC neurosurgeons are stakeholders within this context.\n\nResearch question\nWhat research has been conducted to describe, examine, or assess the use of follow-up technologies in traumatic brain injury cohorts worldwide?\nTo answer this question, the following sub-questions were posed:\n1.\nWhat technologies are being used as FUTs in a global setting?\n2.\nIn what settings is FUT research being conducted?\n3.\nWhat patient cohorts (demographics, injury severity) have been included in FUT research?\n4.\nWhat factors may constitute successful implementation of FUTs?\n5.\nWhat, if any, validated outcome measures are being deployed via FUTs?\n\nSearch strategy\nThe final search strategy was determined with the assistance of an academic medical librarian following a consultation to derive keywords based on the review objective and concepts of \u201ctelemedicine,\u201d \u201ctraumatic brain injury,\u201d \u201coutcome assessment,\u201d and \u201cpatient-generated health data.\u201d The authors selected a number of \u201cindicator papers\u201d\u2014predefined articles that one would expect to appear in their final search results\u2014to test the quality and robustness of the search strategy. Several pilot searches were attempted before a final strategy was established and translated across a number of databases. The search strategy was executed on the October 1, 2021 on the following electronic databases: OVID Embase, OVID MEDLINE, OVID Global Health, OVID PsycInfo, and Scopus. An example search strategy for OVID MEDLINE can be found in\nSupplementary Table S2\n. These databases were selected owing to their sufficient coverage given the multi-disciplinary nature of TBI, outcomes, and their assessment. A limited manual search was conducted on Google Scholar and a number of technology- and head-injury focused journals (\nJournal of Neurotrauma, The Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation, World Neurosurgery, NEUROSURGERY, Journal of Medical Internet Research, Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare\n).\nFollowing a pre-protocol pilot gray literature search, it became apparent that, of the limited materials retrieved, most were unsuitable for a number of reasons, including: insufficient indication of external peer review (of particular importance in commercial reports); a lack of FUT description or elucidation of the methods of their use; and description or evaluation of the FUT was not perceived to be the primary focus of the resource. Compounded by the resource- and time-intensive nature of conducting a gray literature search in this context, gray literature sources were omitted in the final search strategy. Finally, backward citation searching was undertaken, whereby the reference lists of articles deemed eligible for inclusion, and review articles that were not eligible for inclusion, were screened for relevant studies. Searching for additional sources was completed on April 25, 2022.\n\nEligibility criteria\nScientific articles reporting original research of the application of technology written in English were included. All databases were searched from inception to achieve the largest scope possible and to detail early innovations in this field.\nThe Population/Participants, Concept & Context (PCC) framework\n36\n,\n37\nwas used to inform our inclusion criteria, search, and data charting strategies.\nEligibility criteria for articles to be included in this review were: (1) any published original research, including: primary studies, reports, editorials, opinion articles, letters, conference abstracts, theses, and book chapters; (2) reports with a primary aim to describe, assess, or examine the use of FUTs to facilitate remote collection of patient outcome data; and (3) adult and pediatric all-severity cohorts of TBI patients. Articles were excluded if they were (1) study protocols or secondary research (reviews); (2) reports describing the collection of family or caregiver outcomes only; or (3) no TBI population or involved healthy volunteers only.\n\nPopulation/Participants\nStudies were only eligible for inclusion in this review if their primary aim related to the development, implementation, or validation of technologies contributing to the provision of follow-up care of discharged patients following TBI of any severity, whether directly or via proxy (family members/relatives, caregivers, and guardians). Studies of mixed-pathology cohorts were included.\n\nConcept\nIn this review, we defined follow-up technology as any system, device, equipment, component, or machinery used to both transmit and receive digital information electronically between a remote outpatient or their proxy and a member of their clinical team. The focus of this exchange was to attain data from the patient as to their current welfare status in the form of either patient-generated health data (PGHD), that is, self-reported, or clinician-derived health data (CDHD), that is, garnered through clinician-led assessment or interview, either from the patient or their nominated proxy. In addition, we defined \u201cremote\u201d as, at the time of information exchange, the patient was in a community-based setting (e.g., home, regional care provider such as a general practitioner or regional hospital, or other public settings) at a distance from the clinical team managing their follow-up.\nHerein, we refer to synchronicity as the temporal aspect of the encounter between clinician and patient. Synchronous FUTs function to collect data in real time, often allowing direct contact between clinician and patient through sensor-, text-, voice-, or video-based technology. Asynchronous FUTs collect data by store-and-forward techniques\u2014data are gathered, stored, and transmitted for later review by the clinician at two independent time-points; that is, they do not interact in real time.\n38\nFinally, we define \u201cfollow-up\u201d as any attempt to monitor, assess, communicate, or liaise with a patient, or their proxy, from the point of hospital discharge, for the benefit of furthering their health and well-being, research, or injury surveillance.\n\nContext\nFUTs utilized in any global health setting\nWe utilized HIC and LMIC classifications as defined by the 2021\u20132022 World Bank list of economies.\n39\n\nStudy selection\nA two-stage screening process was followed. All search results were initially imported into the Zotero (Corporation for Digital Scholarship, Virginia, USA) reference manager for title and abstract review. Where necessary, duplicates were removed manually. Two researchers (BGS and ST) independently screened all titles and abstracts, and potentially eligible studies were identified for full-text review.\nDisagreements arising from the selection process were either resolved by consensus, or where this was not possible, a third reviewer (OM) was consulted for resolution. Following preliminary screening, the remaining articles were exported to Microsoft\n\u00ae\nExcel (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington, USA), where full texts were independently screened by two researchers (BGS and ST) for final eligibility; a third researcher (OM) was consulted for disagreements as required. Selected studies formed the final repository of evidence for subsequent data extraction (charting) and collation.\n\nData charting and synthesis of results\nOwing to the exploratory nature of a scoping review, a precursor proforma was developed to facilitate data extraction. Within this document, initial elements of interest that sought to answer our research question were informed by our PCC framework and agreed upon by researcher consensus (BGS, ST, CJW, AGK). The proforma was subdivided into five key sections, including: authorship and study characteristics, description of neurotrauma, characteristics of FUT(s) utilized, and major findings and challenges. This was iteratively updated and refined as the charting process progressed, adding to pre-identified elements of interest (see\nSupplementary Table S1\n). Data charting was conducted independently for all articles by two researchers (BGS and ST). Following the charting of the first five studies, in line with recommendations by Levac and colleagues,\n34\nthe authors reconvened to ensure proforma suitability in addressing the research question, and to advance the proforma following familiarization with this initial subset of studies. Final completed proformas were cross-checked for conformity, and a third researcher (OM) was consulted as necessary in cases of a dispute. No formal critical appraisal, or quality of evidence assessment, was conducted as it would fall beyond the remit of a scoping review.\n40\nFollowing data charting, a narrative summary of included articles was constructed in relation to the review's overarching question and sub-questions."

    "Methods": "Animals and injury model\nAll procedures were approved by the Institutional Care and Use Committees of the Clement J. Zablocki VA Medical Center and the Medical College of Wisconsin. Forty Sprague-Dawley rats (275\u2013300\u2009g) were used for either unilateral (\nn\n=\u200920) or bilateral (\nn\n=\u200920) contusion cervical SCI with equal numbers of male and female within each group. Rats were prepared for surgery at spinal cord level C5 as described previously.\n20\nA 10-g rod with a 1.5-mm diameter tip was dropped from 25\u2009mm using the NYU-MASCIC impactor. The tip was positioned over the spinal cord midline for a bilateral injury and 2\u2009mm lateral to the midline for the unilateral injury. Post-injury care followed guidelines for post-SCI care\n21\nincluding frequent monitoring, free access to food and water, additional fluid therapy, and carprofen administration for 3 days post-injury.\nRats were euthanized at 4 weeks post-injury with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (100\u2009mg/kg body weight) followed by intracardiac perfusion and fixation with 10% formalin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The dissected spinal column was immersed in formalin for 48\u2009h and transferred to storage in PBS for\nex vivo\nMRI.\n\nBehavioral assessments\nForelimb locomotor assessment scale (FLAS)\n22\nand modified Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (mBBB)\n23\nlocomotor scale were conducted at 2 days post-injury (dpi) and weekly beginning at 7\u2009dpi with the terminal assessments performed at 28\u2009dpi. For mBBB, left and right hindlimbs were scored separately up to 19 points. Particularly, forelimb-hindlimb coordination was defined as a one-to-one correspondence between forelimb and ipsilateral hindlimb.\n23\nLocomotion was filmed while the rats freely walked in an open field. The left and right limb scores were scored separately, by two blinded raters, and averaged for final analysis.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging\nIn vivo\nMRI scans were performed at 1\u2009dpi using a Bruker BioSpec 9.4T system. Animals were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane and placed supine in a commercial 38-mm diameter Litz volume coil. Isoflurane was maintained between 1.5% and 2.5% during the scans with respiratory rate and core temperature maintained within physiological ranges.\nT\n2\n-weighted images were acquired using a rapid acquisition relaxation (RARE) sequence with number of excitations (NEX)\u2009=\u20092, rare factor\u2009=\u20094 separately in the sagittal and axial two-dimensional (2D) planes. For sagittal imaging, repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE)\u2009=\u20092000/19, 57, 95\u2009msec, field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u200930\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u2009mm, matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, slice thickness\u2009=\u20090.5\u2009mm. For axial imaging, TR/TE\u2009=\u20092000/20, 59, 99\u2009msec, NEX\u2009=\u20092, FOV\u2009=\u200922\u2009\u00d7\u200922\u2009mm, matrix\u2009=\u2009170\u2009\u00d7\u2009170, slice thickness\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm. T\n2\n*-weighted imaging used a three-dimensional (3D) multi-echo gradient echo with TR/TE\u2009=\u200965/2.5\u2009msec, echo spacing\u2009=\u20092.9\u2009msec, number of echoes\u2009=\u20096, FA\u2009=\u200914 degrees, NEX\u2009=\u20092, FOV\u2009=\u200922\u2009\u00d7\u200914\u2009\u00d7\u200911\u2009mm, and matrix\u2009=\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200948, and respiratory gating. For DTI, an axial four-segment echo planer image (EPI) was acquired with TR/TE\u2009=\u20091800/28\u2009msec, NEX\u2009=\u20094, FOV\u2009=\u200922\u2009\u00d7\u200922\u2009mm, matrix\u2009=\u200996\u2009\u00d7\u200996, slice thickness\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm, b\u2009=\u2009800\u2009sec/mm\n2\n, 15 directions, and 3 non-diffusion weighted (b\u2009=\u20090) acquisitions. A second DWI acquisition was performed using the same parameters but with a filtered-DWI method,\n24\nwhich uses a high-strength diffusion gradient (b\u2009=\u20092000\u2009sec/mm\n2\n) perpendicular to the cord (left-right) with separate diffusion encoding parallel to the cord (b\u2009=\u20090-1000\u2009sec/mm\n2\nin increments of 250).\nEx vivo\nMRI was acquired for spared tissue area and lesion volume measurements. The excised cord was cut to include the cervical and upper thoracic segments (3\u2009cm), and it was inserted into a plastic tube (0.7\u2009mm diameter) filled with PBS buffer at pH 7.4. T\n2-\nweighted imaging was acquired using a 3D isotropic, variable flip angle RARE with parameters: TR/TE\u2009=\u20094000/5.6\u2009msec, FOV\u2009=\u200950\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u2009mm, matrix\u2009=\u2009320\u2009\u00d7\u2009192\u2009\u00d7\u2009192, rare factor\u2009=\u200996, and 16 repetitions. The flip angle schedule was simulated previously\n25\nand yielded an effective TE of 33.6\u2009msec. An inversion recovery pulse (T\nI\n=\u20091500\u2009msec) was used to selectively null the signal of PBS buffer. Total imaging time was 6\u2009h and 50\u2009min for up to seven samples simultaneously.\n\nMRI analysis\nEdema and hemorrhage length were obtained from sagittal T\n2-\nweighted and T\n2\n*-weighted images, respectively, using manual measurements along the rostral-caudal direction. Similarly, edema and hemorrhage were manually circumscribed on the axial images to obtain cross-sectional area. For DTI, images were fit to the tensor model using FSL to obtain FA, MD, axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). For fDWI, images were fit to a mono-exponential decay considering only the parallel diffusion b-values\n17\nto obtain fADC\n||\n, filtered apparent diffusivity parallel to the spinal cord. To create regions of interest (ROIs), perpendicular-weighted images were converted to signal-to-noise (SNR) maps by dividing by the standard deviation from a noise region, and whole cord masks were created by thresholding at SNR \u22656. These resulting binary masks were applied to both DTI and fDWI parameter maps to obtain whole-cord mean values. Further, the DWI-detected lesion area was manually delineated on the color composite fDWI images. For voxelwise analysis, DWI parameter maps were spatially registered to a common coordinate frame based on the digitized Paxinos rat spinal cord atlas.\n26\nBriefly, the steps included manual placement of landmarks within the cord at each vertebral level followed by the automated steps of straightening the cord and rigid plus non-linear warping to the template using the spinal cord toolbox\n27\nimplemented as an automated nipype pipeline.\n28\nThe raw data and source codes are available in a public repository.\n29\nOn\nex vivo\nMRI, the central cavity and spinal cord tissue were manually delineated. Lesion volume was quantified as the 3D volume of the central cavity. Spared tissue was quantified as the smallest cross-sectional area of spinal cord tissue, which occurred at the lesion epicenter.\n\nImmunohistochemistry procedure and analysis\nFollowing\nex vivo\nMRI, the cords were cut into 4-mm blocks, processed, and embedded in paraffin. Transverse, 10-\u03bcm thick sections were cut from the lesion site at the level with the least spared tissue using\nex vivo\nMRI for guidance. Sections were stained to identify white matter axons using SMI-31 (Biolegend, phosphorylated neurofilament H antibody) and imaged with a confocal microscope at a resolution of 570\u2009nm. The area of spared white matter tissue was measured using a custom MATLAB script in which pixels were thresholded after manually cropping out gray matter. The number of SMI-31 stained axons within the white matter were counted using\nThreshold\n(1.57\u20134.46%) and\nAnalyze Particles\n(size\u2009=\u2009100\u2013700 pixels, circularity\u2009=\u20090.3\u20131) in ImageJ (version 1.52k) and quantified as total counts.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStata (StataCorp, 2011), Prism (9.0.0), and MATLAB (R2017b) were used for statistical analysis. Means of parameters by injury group (unilateral and bilateral) were compared using Mann-Whitney U tests adjusted by the two-stage step-up method of Benjamini and colleagues,\n29\nand statistical significance is reported as q, reflecting the adjusted\np\n-value. Similarly, the variance of each parameter was compared using an F-test\n30\nand its significance is reported as q-value. To quantify relationships between each pair of variables, a Spearman's rank correlation was performed. For values including binary variables (sex and injury type), a Point-Biserial correlation was used. To examine the interrelationships between the full set of all variables, principal component analysis (PCA) was used. PCA is an unsupervised data reduction method that was used to visualize the major sources of variation in this multi-dimensional dataset without introducing inherent bias. A total of 19 variables were used, including injury type (unilateral or bilateral) and sex as binary variables. The variables were normalized and used as an input for PCA.\nSix animals were excluded due to one or more missing data in imaging parameters or histology (final\nn\n=\u200934). For voxelwise statistical analysis of DWI parameter maps, a model including FLAS scores as regressors was used with a permutation-based multiple comparisons correction implemented in FSL.\n31\n,\n32\nTo directly compare voxelwise ROIs results with lesion area (fDWI) as outcome predictors, lesion area (fDWI) and the ROI values from the significant voxels were included as regressors in a single, multiple linear regression model."

    "Methods": "Participants\nThe TRACK-TBI prospective cohort study enrolled 2697 participants with TBI from 18 level I trauma centers in the United States. They were enrolled from February 26, 2014 to July 3, 2018 and evaluated at 2 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months post-injury. All TBI participants had sustained a TBI <24\u2009h prior to enrollment and received an acute head CT for clinical care. The current analysis included data from 1718 TBI participants \u226517 years of age who completed the RPQ themselves at 3 months post-injury. Proxies did not complete the RPQ for participants unable to complete it for themselves. For more information about inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study see McCrea and coworkers.\n32\n\nPrimary outcome measure\nThe RPQ is a measure of post-TBI symptoms and lists 16 symptoms that the participant rates to indicate how problematic the symptom has been in the past 7 days compared with before the injury. Each symptom is rated as: not experienced at all (0), no more of a problem than before the injury (1), a mild problem (2), a moderate problem (3), or a severe problem (4). To calculate the total burden of injury-related symptoms, items rated 1 were recoded to 0 prior to summing across all symptoms. The RPQ total score ranges from 0 to 64, with a higher number representing greater symptom burden.\n\nPotential enrichment factors\nPredictive measures were chosen from results of previous research identifying pre-injury, demographic, and acute or subacute risk factors related to post-TBI symptom reporting,\n2\nand TBI biomarkers that relate to TBI severity or outcomes.\n2\n,\n19\nPotential enrichment factors measured on a continuous scale were categorized to evaluate the effect on needed sample size and screening of potential participants if only those in the high-risk category were included in a clinical trial. The categories chosen were based on the literature where available but were not optimized to maximize differences in symptom burden among categories within the TRACK-TBI study.\nParticipants' pre-existing conditions were classified as positive for psychiatric history if they or their proxy reported a pre-injury diagnosis of anxiety, depression, sleep disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or other psychiatric illness; they indicated that they had been hospitalized for emotional or psychiatric problems before the injury; or they took psychiatric medication regularly before the injury.\nA history of previous TBI was assessed using the Ohio State University TBI Identification Method\n33\ngrouped as none versus \u22651 prior to the study TBI. Prior TBI was rated positive if it involved loss of consciousness or a dazed feeling and resulted in a visit to the emergency department (ED) and/or hospitalization.\nThe severity of peripheral injuries was assessed using the maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale\n34\n(AIS) for regions below the neck (i.e., chest, abdomen, extremity, and external areas). Hospitalized participants were divided into those with a score of \u22653 versus those with a score of \u22642. Those not hospitalized were grouped with those with AIS scores \u22642.\nRPQ total score at 2 weeks post-injury was classified as <16 versus \u226516. This division has been suggested as the optimal cutoff for separating people with persistent post-concussion symptoms from healthy adults in the general population,\n35\nand here was considered indicative of high symptom burden representing, for example, reporting at least half of the symptoms as a mild problem.\nSubacute post-traumatic stress symptoms were evaluated with the PTSD Checklist for the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition\n(DSM-5) (PCL-5)\n36\nat 2 weeks post injury. The PCL-5 is a self-report rating scale of 20 symptoms of PTSD each rated from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Total scores range from 0 to 80. PCL-5 scores were classified as <33 versus \u226533 as per our previous work.\n37\nBlood-based biomarkers were obtained within 24\u2009h of injury and included glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP),\n38\u201341\nubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1),\n39\n,\n41\nneuron-specific enolase (NSE),\n41\u201343\nS100 calcium binding protein B (S100b),\n40\n,\n41\n43\nand highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP).\n41\n,\n44\nPlasma GFAP and UCH-L1 were measured based on two platforms (iSTAT and ARCH, Abbott Laboratories) and calibrated to reflect values on the iSTAT platform.\n45\nBiomarkers were grouped into tertiles as we found no published studies with usable cutoffs for suggesting high symptom burden.\n\nStatistical analysis\nMean RPQ total score at 3 months was calculated for subgroups within the TBI cohort and compared using independent samples\nt\ntests or analysis of variance (ANOVA). The 3-month RPQ total score was examined because most symptom recovery occurred by then\n1\nand because that would be a likely time to evaluate outcome for a clinical trial to prevent persistent symptoms after TBI. Magnitude of the difference in symptom burden between subgroups was summarized using standardized mean differences (SMD),\n46\nalso known as Cohen's\nd\n,\n47\nwith the group having the lowest total score as the reference group so that the maximum difference could be readily seen.\nTo calculate the impact of enrichment on the sample size needed to detect a fixed treatment effect and the number needed to screen to obtain that sample size, we used individual data from the TRACK-TBI study and simulated data with a treatment effect by assuming that the treatment has a 20% chance of resolving each symptom individually, independently of its effect on other symptoms for the same participant. To get a more stable estimate, we repeated this 10 times for each participant in the data set. For each trial enrichment strategy, we calculated the mean and standard deviation of the 3-month RPQ total score for the participants meeting the inclusion criteria for that strategy in both the original data set (representing the control condition) and the simulated data set with the 20% chance of resolving each reported symptom (representing the treatment condition). These means and standard deviations were input to a sample size calculator\n48\nfor a two-sample\nt\ntest with unequal standard deviations to get the sample size per group for a trial using that enrichment strategy. We further calculated the number of patients with TBI who would need to be screened to achieve the required sample by dividing the sample size needed by the percentage of cases in the analyzed TRACK-TBI sample who satisfied that enrichment criterion. For example, if the trial requires 100 cases meeting the inclusion criterion and 25% of cases within the study sample meet the inclusion criterion, 400 TBI cases would need to be screened to enroll the required sample size in the study. Only participants who completed the measure at 2 weeks were included in the simulations for calculating the number needed to enroll when evaluating high PCL or RPQ scores as potential enrichment factors. However, when calculating the percentage of cases that met a hypothetical trial enrichment criterion (and hence the number needed to screen) related to 2-week symptom scores, we included individuals who did not complete the questionnaire at 2 weeks in the denominator; that is, we treated them as persons ineligible for trial.\nSensitivity analyses calculated sample sizes based on ranks and assuming a zero-inflated negative binomial distribution (\nSupplementary Methods\n). Analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.4 and SPSS, version 19."

    "Methods": "Study design and setting\nThis prospective multi-center cohort study was conducted across seven Canadian academic EDs (Level I and Level II trauma centers). Patients in the derivation cohort were recruited between July 2013 and October 2016, and those in the validation cohort were recruited between February 2017 and September 2018. This study was approved by each participating institution's research ethics board.\n\nStudy population\nPatients were included if they had a documented mTBI within 24\u2009h of ED visit and were age \u226514 years. We defined mTBI using the World Health Organization Task Force criteria\n74\n: a patient with a head trauma and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13-15\u2009\u2265\u200930\u2009min post-injury and at least one of the following: confusion or disorientation, loss of consciousness \u226430\u2009min, post-traumatic amnesia \u226424\u2009h, and/or other transient neurological abnormalities such as focal signs, seizure, and intracranial lesion not requiring surgery. Patients were excluded if they were hospitalized, were unable to consent, or were not able to communicate in English or French.\n\nData collection\nAssessment in the ED\nEligible patients were identified by emergency physicians and research assistants at each participating site. During the initial ED visit, the emergency physicians used a standardized data collection form (\nSupplementary File S1\n) to collect relevant sociodemographic and clinical data, including the time of trauma. Informed consent was provided during the initial visit before the blood samples were taken. The blood samples were taken for all patients in our cohort for research purposes. The decision to perform a head CT scan was left to the emergency physician, and patients were included whether they had a CT or not.\nPatient follow-up\nTrained research assistants administered phone interviews at 7, 30, and 90 days post-mTBI (\nSupplementary File S2\n). During the 7-day interview, research assistants collected detailed information about the trauma and the medical history of patients to optimize data completeness and accuracy (\nSupplementary File S3\n). The Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ), which is frequently used in the clinical and research settings,\n2\n,\n3\n,\n6\n,\n9\n,\n13\n,\n16\n,\n21\n,\n52\n,\n75\n,\n76\nwas used to evaluate the patient's symptoms at each interview. This simple validated questionnaire assesses the severity of PCS by having patients rate 16 symptoms on a scale of 0 (not experienced at all) to 4 (a severe problem), with the total score being the sum of all RPQ items.\n77-79\nBlood sampling and analysis\nThe exact time of blood sample collection was recorded for each participant. These samples were taken by the ED nurse \u226424\u2009h after the trauma in most of the study's recruiting sites (4/7). This was done only on weekdays by a research nurse for the other participating sites. The samples were sent to the laboratories of each hospital to be centrifuged, put into three small aliquots and frozen at -20\u00b0C until they were sent on dry ice to the study's central laboratory (CHU de Qu\u00e9bec-Universit\u00e9 Laval, Quebec City), where they were stored at -80\u00b0C until batch tested.\nThe blood concentrations of S100\u00df, NSE, GFAP, and C-Tau were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). For each biomarker, different cut-offs were tested during our statistical analyses, including those most often described in the literature: S100B \u2265 0.10 mcg/L\n80\nand \u22650.20 mcg/L,\n81\nNSE \u22651.0 mcg/L,\n82\nand C-Tau \u22651.5 mcg/L.\n83\nFor GFAP, no cut-off point has been established related to PPCS,\n84\nwe have therefore tested \u22650.045 mcg/L (detection limit of our ELISA assays) and \u22650.1 mcg/L (another limit of detection described in the literature).\n85\n\nPrimary outcome measure\nUntil recently,\n86\nthere was no consensus in the literature regarding the diagnostic criteria of PPCS.\n87\nTherefore, we used a nominal croup technique to define our primary outcome, PPCS at 90 days. This technique allows participants to give their opinions during a structured group interaction and comprises four key stages: silent generation, round-robin, clarification, and voting (ranking or rating).\n88\nIn our study, PPCS was defined as the presence of spontaneously described, severe, persistent symptoms that have an impact on patient's life. Symptoms were considered spontaneously described if patients mentioned symptoms following a standardized interview prompt (\u201cI would like to know whether you still have any symptoms from your head trauma?\u2019\u2019 The research assistant completed the RPQ as per standard questionnaire administration guidelines if patients answered positively. If patients responded negatively, their symptoms were not considered spontaneously described. Symptoms were considered severe if patients answered that they had at least one symptom of 4 points (severe problem) or two symptoms of 3 points (moderate problems), as scored on the RPQ. Symptoms were considered persistent if they lasted at least 90 days. To ensure that the symptoms were not newly present at 90 days, patients had to spontaneously answer that they had symptoms at 7 and 30 days.\nAs no specific measure of impact was available in the derivation cohort, symptoms were considered as having an impact if patients who were working/in school at the time of trauma did not return to work/studies as before the trauma. In the validation cohort, the measure of the impact on the patient's life was obtained by asking the following questions: \u201cDid you return to your normal activities just as before the head trauma? If not, is this due to your trauma to the head?\u201d A positive answer to the latter question was considered as having an impact on the patient's life.\n\nSecondary outcome measures\nSecondary outcome measures were PPCS at 90 days according to four other sets of criteria used in the literature:\n1.\nDelphi definition: \u201cAny post-concussion symptom appeared within hours of mTBI which is still present every day 90 days after the trauma and has an impact on at least one sphere of life.\u201d\n86\n2.\nPPCS with a documented impact: impact on normal activities due to mTBI, according to the patient.\n3.\nNon-return to work: patients working/in school at the time of trauma and did not return to work/studies as before trauma.\n4.\nModerate-to-severe symptoms: the presence of at least three symptoms of 3 or 4 points on the RPQ, indicating a moderate-to-severe intensity level.\n\nSample size\nDerivation cohort\nBased on the literature, the proportion of patients with PPCS at 90 days was estimated to be around 13-62%.\n2\n,\n3\n,\n7\u201321\nAssuming a middle range of 35%, 16 potential candidate predictors, a precision of 5% and at least 10 events per covariable, we estimated that 468 observations were required to develop the model.\nValidation cohort\nAs the prevalence of PPCS at 90 days was 15.6% in our derivation cohort, for an accurate estimation of regression coefficients, assuming 10 events per covariable and a final model including eight predictors in the ED, we estimated that a minimum of 550 observations were required to validate the model. For the second step, five predictors at follow-up), assuming a prevalence of 18% of PPCS in that sub-group, a precision of 5% and at least 10 events per covariable, we estimated that a minimum of 275 observations were required.\n\nStatistical analysis\nWe used the methodological standards\n89\n,\n90\nto develop and validate our CDR. Descriptive statistics were computed for baseline characteristics. The prevalence of PPCS has been reported as the proportion of participants corresponding to each definition. Univariate analyses were performed to measure the association between each potentially predictive factor and the primary outcome (odds ratio [OR] with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]). Multiple imputation was used to handle missing data for potential predictors in the ED: the chained equations method was used to simulate missing values, and 20 imputed datasets were generated for the following variables: cervical sprain, history of mental health disorders, prior multiple TBI and prior TBI <1 year.\nA two-step bootstrap sampling with replacement was used to select variables of interest.\n91\nFor each step, 500 random samples were generated for each imputation and variables that were statistically significant in more than 40% of samples (alpha\u2009=\u20090.157) were considered relevant to be tested in the model. Backward selection was used to validate candidate predictors before using them in the final logistic regression model (alpha\u2009=\u20090.157). Selected predictors were screened for multi-collinearity. Coefficient rating was standardized using the smaller value of the coefficient.\n92\nThirty-day follow-up data were used if they were missing for patients who were not reached at the 7-day follow-up (simple imputation). Sensitivity analyses were performed to test different categories for the following variables: age, number of prescribed medications, headache intensity (out of 10), loss of consciousness duration, amnesia duration, RPQ, and different blood levels for all four biomarkers. Some symptoms on the RPQ at the 7-day follow-up were group tested using subtypes classification suggested by some authors\n93\n,\n94\n: cognitive symptoms, oculomotor symptoms, headache/migraine, vestibular symptoms, and anxiety/mood symptoms.\n94\nRisk groups were defined using the most appropriate thresholds from the classification performance for the following two steps: the ED evaluation and the follow-up evaluation 7 days after the trauma. Model performance was evaluated by measuring sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV). Discrimination was evaluated for each step and is presented using area under the curve (AUC). For each step of the model, a calibration curve of expected versus observed risk was assessed. Variance Inflation and Condition Index were used to evaluate the possibility of collinearity. All analyses were performed with the Statistical Analysis System (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, version 9.4).\nPatient and public involvement\nPatients were involved as research partners during our nominal group technique, particularly when discussing the outcome definition."

MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; SOF, Special Operations Forces; TBI, traumatic brain injury.\n\nBlast exposure\nThe primary measure of blast exposure is the GBEV,\n28\nan assessment tool designed to capture units of lifetime blast exposure from weapons and explosives. GBEV asks respondents to self report exposure to five categories of blast: 1) small- and medium-sized arms such as handheld firearms and rifles; 2) large arms, often shoulder-fired, that can be carried on a person; 3) artillery, missile weapon systems, or large arms carried by vehicle, aircraft, or boat; 4) small explosives or grenades; and 5) large explosives or targeted explosives in close range. For each category, respondents provide the number of years, average months per year, days per month, and rounds per day of exposure, as well as how often exposures occurred on 2 or more consecutive days. An automated algorithm calculates the final GBEV, which has a minimum score of zero but no ceiling score.\nFor the ReBlast Pilot, GBEV is administered via telephone interview by a member of the research team who has expertise in assessing blast exposure. Although GBEV has not been validated, in a sample of 984 service members, 200,000 GBEV units was established as a threshold at which participants were likely to report significant symptoms on the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory.\n28\nImportantly, as described above, GBEV does not distinguish between LLB and HLB exposure.\n\nBrain injury assessment\nThe Brain Injury Screening Questionnaire (BISQ)\n69\nPart I is a structured questionnaire that characterizes incidence and severity of lifetime exposure to head trauma. The respondent is asked if they have ever experienced a blow to the head in 19 specific situations (e.g., sports, combat, motor vehicle accidents, etc.). To increase the likelihood of recalling a blow to the head, specific questions are asked for six common contact sports as well as for military training and combat. For every event, participants report if they lost consciousness or had a period of being dazed and confused, and if so, the duration of symptoms. Finally, hospitalizations and emergency department admissions for 13 specific medical events are documented.\nTable 3\n28\n,\n70\u2013101\nprovides detailed information regarding measures of a participant's lifetime history of brain injury, exposure to wartime stress, and the extent and frequency of exposure to RBE and large weaponry.\nTable 3.\nCognitive and Behavioral Assessments\nBlast exposure and medical history\nMeasure\nConstruct measured/ data collected\nAdministration method\nTime (min)\nDemographics\nAge, ethnicity, race, education\nREDCap survey pre-visit\n15\nMilitary history\nMilitary history, rank, time in service (years)\n5\nMilitary occupational status\nBlast exposure (indirect)\n5\nGeneralized Blast Exposure Value\n28\nBlast exposure\nPre-visit by phone\n10\nDeployment Risk & Resiliency Inventory, Combat Experiences Scale, modified for STRONG STAR\n70\n,\n71\nCombat exposure\nREDCap survey pre-visit\n3\nMedical history\nSymptom characteristics, duration, severity, and treatment\nIn-person visit - interview\n10\nBrain Injury Screening Questionnaire\n72\nLifetime TBI exposure\nPre-visit by phone;\nfollow-up in-person\n25\nPittsburgh Sleep Quality Index\n73\n,\n74\nSleep quality & disturbances\nREDCap survey pre-visit; spouse by-phone\n10\nSTOP BANG\n75\nObstructive sleep apnea\nREDCap survey pre-visit\n< 1\nPupillometry Exam\nPupil constriction and dilation\n15\nOpen in a separate window\nNeurocognitive function\nMeasure\nConstruct measured/ data collected\nAdministration method\nTime (min)\nAutomated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics\n76\nProcessing speed, memory, inhibition, and other cognitive processes\nIn-person, laptop\n35\nPhilips Intellispace Cognition\nMemory, verbal processing, working memory, executive functioning, processing speed, visual spatial processing\nIn-person visit, iPad\n45\nGrooved Pegboard Test\n77\n,\n78\nFine motor function\nIn-person visit\n5\nDelis-Kaplan Executive Function System\n79\n,\n80\nInhibitory control, cognitive flexibility\n10\nWAIS- Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 4th version, Digit Span and Arithmetic\n81\nWorking memory\n30\nTest of Premorbid Functioning\n82\nPremorbid ability/cognitive reserve\n5\nAuditory Consonant Trigrams\n83\nDivided attention, working memory\n15\nOpen in a separate window\nNeurobehavioral function, physical symptoms, and quality of life\nMeasure\nConstruct measured/ data collected\nAdministration method\nTime (min)\nPatient Health Questionnaire-9\n84\nDepression\nIn-person visit\n5\nSuicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised\n85\nSuicidality\n< 1\nNeurobehavioral Symptom Inventory\n86\nPost-concussive symptoms\n3\nBrown-Goodwin Lifetime History of Aggression\n87\nAggression\n60\nGlasgow Outcome Scale- Extended\n88\nGlobal outcome\n15\nMild Brain Injury Atypical Symptoms\n89\nSymptom validity/effort\n2\nMedical Symptom Validity Test\n90\nSymptom validity/effort\n15\nFrontal Systems Behavior Scale\n91\nApathy, disinhibition, executive dysfunction\nParticipant: In-person visit\n10\nSpouse: Phone\nPTSD Checklist for DSM-5\n92\nPost-traumatic stress disorder\nREDCap survey pre-visit\n3\nRAND-36\n93\nPhysical functioning, role limitations, energy/fatigue, emotional well-being, social functioning, pain, general health\n5\nTBI-Quality of Life short forms\n94\nAnger\n2\nAnxiety\n2\nEmotional & behavioral dyscontrol\n2\nResilience\n2\nBuss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire\n95\nAggression\n5\nWorld Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule\n96\nCognition, mobility, self-care, getting along, life activities, participation\n5\nAlcohol Use Disorders Identification Test\n97\n,\n98\nAlcohol screening\n2\nDrug Abuse Screening Test\n99\nDrug screening\n3\nHeadache Impact Test-6\n100\nHeadaches\n3\nPROMIS Short forms\n101\nPain Intensity\n7\nPain Interference\nOpen in a separate window\nSTOP-BANG, Snoring history, Tired during the day, Observed stop breathing while sleep, High blood pressure, BMI more than 35\u2009kg/m\n2\n, Age more than 50 years, Neck circumference more than 40\u2009cm and male Gender; PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder; DSM, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; WHO, World Health Organization, PROMIS, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System; REDCap, Research Electronic Data Capture.\n\nCognitive assessment\nThe cognitive assessment battery measures executive function, memory, learning, intellectual performance, and fine motor functioning, as detailed in\nTable 3\n. Assessments are distributed across the first and second days of the study. Some assessments are administered via a computer (e.g., Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metric)\n102\nor iPad (e.g., Philips Intellispace Cognition)\n103\nto complement traditional tests and obtain granular performance metrics (e.g., reaction time). Pupillometry measurements are obtained to assess the integrity of pupil constriction and dilation\u2014a metric of cognitive processing load tolerance.\n104\nThe Medical Symptom Validity Test\n105\nand mild Brain Injury Atypical Symptoms scale\n106\nare administered to assess effort and potential exaggeration of impairment.

Some measures are collected via structured interview or self-report at the in-person visit, while others are collected before arrival online via REDCap,\n107\na secure, web-based software platform.\n\nNeuroimaging\nConnectome MRI for structural connectivity analysis\nAcquisition\nWe perform a multi-shell dMRI protocol on the 3T Connectome scanner (MAGNETOM CONNECTOM Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany)\n108-110\nusing a 64-channel head coil.\n111\nComplete sequence parameters are provided in\nSupplementary Table S1\nand have been previously reported.\n112\u2013115\nSequence parameters include: 2\u2009mm isotropic voxels; eight linearly spaced gradient strengths in the range G\u2009=\u200930-290 mT/m per diffusion time; 16 b-values ranging from 50 to 17,800\u2009sec/mm\n2\nwith either 32 diffusion-encoding directions (for shells with b\u2009\u2264\u20092300\u2009sec/mm\n2\n) or 64 directions (for shells with b\u2009\u2265\u20092400\u2009sec/mm\n2\n). We also acquire a three-dimensional T1-weighted multi-echo magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MEMPRAGE) sequence for anatomic coregistration.\n116\n,\n117\nProcessing and analysis\nWe correct data for gradient nonlinearity distortions\n108\n,\n118\n.\n119\nand susceptibility-induced distortion, head motion, and eddy-current artifacts in the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain Software Library (FSL).\n108\n,\n120\nQuality control steps include visual inspection of the dMRI volumes before and after pre-processing and automated extraction of motion-related measures (\nSupplementary Fig. S1\n). We perform two types of analyses: connectivity-based and region of interest (ROI)\u2013based. For both analyses, we use multi-fiber reconstruction methods\n121\n,\n122\nto extract estimates of fiber orientations in each voxel (\nSupplementary Fig. S2\n). We perform connectivity analysis of probabilistic tractography data\n110\n,\n123\nto quantify axonal connections linking canonical networks whose nodes are segmented via FreeSurfer.\n124\n,\n125\nFor the ROI-based analysis, 42 white matter bundles are automatically reconstructed using TRActs Constrained by UnderLying Anatomy (TRACULA;\nSupplementary Fig. S3\n).\n126\n,\n127\nTo quantify changes in white matter microstructure we fit a tensor model and extract measures of fractional anisotropy, mean, radial, and axial diffusivity at each voxel. We also fit a three-compartment model\n113\n,\n115\n,\n128\nof intra-axonal restricted diffusion, extra-axonal hindered diffusion, and free diffusion to extract estimates of axonal diameter in regions of white matter that are susceptible to blast injury.\n7\u2002Tesla MRI for functional connectivity analysis\nAcquisition\nWe acquire ultra-high spatial resolution blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI data on the 7T scanner, as previously described\n129\nand as detailed in\nSupplementary\nTable 1\n. We use the Terra 7T platform (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) with the vendor-supplied 32-channel head-only receive coil array and birdcage transmit coil (Nova Medical, Wilmington, MA). Notable BOLD sequence parameters include: whole\u2013brain single-shot simultaneous multi-slice\n130\ngradient-echo echo-planar imaging at 1.2\u2009mm isotropic voxel size, with repetition time\u2009=\u20092.25\u2009sec and multiband factor 3. We acquire four runs of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), each with 150 measurements. Before the first run and between runs, the participants are reminded to remain awake with their eyes open and asked to confirm that they are comfortable and alert by squeezing a pneumatic ball. We acquire fMRI data alongside structural MRI data, such as T1-weighted and susceptibility-weighted imaging data, to provide an anatomical reference for the fMRI data, as well as standard calibration and auxiliary data such as magnetic field maps (B\n0\nand B\n1\n+\n) that are used to adjust the system and remove artifacts.\nProcessing and analysis\nWe analyze data in the FreeSurfer\n124\nFunctional Analysis Stream (FSFAST) and the CONN toolbox.\n131\nPreprocessing includes B\n0\ndistortion correction, motion correction, slice-timing correction, and temporal detrending. In FSFAST, the fMRI volume is sampled onto the cortical surface created by FreeSurfer and surface-smoothed; the subcortical areas are resampled into the MNI305 and volume-smoothed. We perform seed-based\n132\nand independent component analyses\n133\nof functional networks to estimate functional connectivity between the cortical and subcortical nodes of canonical neural networks, such as the default, salience, executive control, and dorsal attention networks.\n125\nTranslocator protein PET-MRI\nTSPO genotyping\nA venous blood sample is drawn to perform genotyping for the Ala147Thr polymorphism in the TSPO gene.\nAcquisition\nWe scan each subject using the TSPO ligand [\n11\nC]PBR28\n52\nwith a simultaneous PET-MRI scanner, a unique Siemens BrainPET photodiode-based PET scanner operated in the bore of a 3T whole\u2013body magnetic resonance scanner.\n134\nWe have developed MR-based methods for generating attenuation correction maps.\n135\nAn intravenous bolus injection of [\n11\nC]PBR28 (up to 15 mCi) is administered. After an uptake period of approximately 45\u2009min, PET data are acquired for up to 60\u2009min (overlapping with magnetic resonance data acquisition) and stored in list-mode format.\nWe acquire brain MRI data using the Siemens 3T Trio scanner, equipped with a standard radiofrequency head coil positioned inside the PET insert, similar to standard MRI. During the PET-MRI, we acquire an MEMPRAGE sequence to be used as an anatomical reference, an arterial spin labeling (ASL) sequence to measure regional brain perfusion, and a time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography sequence to image brain vasculature.\nProcessing and analysis\nStandardized uptake values (SUV) from 60-90\u2009min post-injection are calculated as previously described.\n52\nWe coregister the SUV images to the MEMPRAGE image and then register to the MNI template and normalize to a pseudo-reference region (SUVR). Partial volume correction using region-based voxel-wise (RBV) correction is applied using PETsurfer.\n136\nVoxel-wise analysis of ligand binding\n52\nis performed using a combination of software packages, including FreeSurfer and FSL. TSPO genotype is controlled for in all analyses. Individuals with a low-binding genotype, estimated at 10% of the general population,\n137\nwill be excluded from analysis.\nTau PET-MRI\nAcquisition\nEach subject is scanned using the ligand [18F]MK6240.\n138\nAs with the TSPO PET scan, the tau PET scan utilizes a combined PET-MRI scanner. An intravenous bolus injection of [\n18\nF]MK6240 (up to 5 mCi) is administered. After an uptake period of approximately 60\u2009min, PET data are acquired for up to 60\u2009min. We acquire a MEMPRAGE sequence, a T\n2\n-weighted SPACE fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T\n2\nSPACE FLAIR) sequence, and a two inversion-contrast magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MP2RAGE) sequence (\nSupplementary Table S1\n).\nProcessing and analysis\nThe tau PET data analysis pipeline is similar to that used for analysis of the TSPO PET data, including voxel-wise group comparisons of ligand binding.\n52\nSUV from 70-90\u2009min post-injection is calculated as a primary outcome, normalized to a pseudo-reference region, and partial volume corrected.\n\nIntegration of multi-modal neuroimaging data\nTo facilitate precise neuroanatomic correlation of lesions and abnormal signals across modalities, all MRI and PET data are coregistered to the same spatial coordinates (\nFig. 3\n).\n139\nAll MRI data are corrected for gradient nonlinearity distortion\n119\nto reduce differential distortion between the images from any of the MRI or PET scanners. In addition, a B\n0\nmap is computed from images collected with reversed phase-encode blips and used to correct the B\n0\ndistortion in the fMRI.\n140\nCortical surface and whole-brain segmentation are computed using FreeSurfer tools from the minimally distorted T1-weighted image\n124\nacquired on the Connectome. All images are registered to this T1-weighted image: MRI data are registered via boundary-based registration,\n117\nand PET images are registered using normalized mutual information.\n141\nAll coregistered MRI and PET data undergo quality assessment for artifacts or noise, and study investigators manually correct anatomic errors observed on the cortical surfaces or subcortical segmentations.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nMulti-modal integration of neuroimaging data. MRI and PET data are coregistered and segmented using FreeSurfer tools, allowing precise neuroanatomic correlation of lesions and abnormal signals across modalities. The red line indicates the pial surface, and the yellow indicates the cortical gray-white matter junction.

Raw data values are normalized to interspersed pooled plasma samples using our standard approach.\n143-145\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe primary aim of the ReBlast Pilot study is to generate preliminary data that will inform the design of a larger, hypothesis-driven investigation. As such, due to feasibility constraints associated with enrolling active-duty SOF personnel for a 2-day study visit that requires travel away from their training bases, the ReBlast Pilot's target enrollment is 30 participants. Upon completion of study enrollment, we will aggregate GBEV scores from all 30 participants. We will use the median GBEV score to allocate participants into two groups: 1) GBEV\nb\n(\nn\n=\u200915 below the median GBEV), and 2) GBEV\na\n(\nn\n=\u200915 above the median GBEV). Our primary statistical analyses will aim to answer the question: Does the GBEV\na\ngroup differ from the GBEV\nb\ngroup with respect to cognitive, behavioral, physical, neuroimaging, and blood biomarkers? We will use Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to assess the null hypothesis that there is no difference in median biomarker values between the GBEV\nb\nand GBEV\na\ngroups. Of note, this pilot study's sample size of 30 participants is only sufficient to detect large differences between groups (effect sizes >1.2) with 80% power and an unadjusted Type 1 error control of 0.05.\nSecondary analyses\nWe will use Spearman's rank correlation coefficients to test for associations between biomarkers and GBEV scores. Given the exploratory nature of this pilot study, both original and adjusted\np\nvalues (correcting for the number of biomarkers within each domain) will be calculated. We will also use linear regression to identify biomarkers that significantly differ between the GBEV\nb\nand GBEV\na\ngroups. Biomarkers will be treated as dependent variables in each model and GBEV as the independent variable, controlling for lifetime history of TBI exposure (from the BISQ) and combat exposure (from the Combat Exposure Scale), within the limits of our sample size. These analyses aim to identify associations between RBE and alterations in cognitive, behavioral, physical, neuroimaging, and blood biomarkers.\nGiven the inherent limitations of performing a median-split analysis (e.g., exposure to RBE may not differ significantly between the GBEV\nb\nand GBEV\na\ngroups) and of evaluating each biomarker independently, we will also implement an unsupervised learning approach, such as k-means clustering, to derive clusters of personnel whose biomarker profiles are similar within and across domains. This clustering approach minimizes within-group differences, maximizes between-group differences, and increases our ability to identify combinations of biomarkers that account for complex, heterogeneous phenotypes. In turn, we will evaluate whether these clusters, consisting of participants with similar phenotypes, are associated with GBEV scores (\nFig. 4\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 4.\nStatistical plan for ReBlast pilot study. This figure depicts the primary statistical analyses proposed in this study: 1) a stepwise method to reduce the data into a meaningful set of biomarkers that distinguish the groups and then, assessing their relationship with GBEV scores (left panel); and 2) an unsupervised learning approach to reduce the data into meaningful clusters (representing groups of individuals with similar phenotypes) and then, evaluating their association with GBEV scores (right panel). Of note, the scatter plot in the left panel and the clusters in the right panel are hypothetical, not actual results. BEH, behavioral; BLO, blood; COG, cognitive; DMN, default mode network; FA, fractional anisotropy; fALFF, fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations; GBEV, Generalized Blast Exposure Value; GBEVa, participant group with GBEV values above the median; GBEVb, participant group with GBEV values below the median; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; MCP, middle cerebellar peduncle; NEU, neuroimaging; NfL, neurofilament light chain; PHY, physical; rsFC, resting-state functional connectivity.\nLimitations\nThere are four key limitations associated with our analytic approach. First, with a sample size of\nn\n=\u200930, our ability to detect significant differences between the GBEV\nb\nand GBEV\na\ngroups will be limited in both the primary and secondary analyses, including the k-means clustering approach. Second, a median split of GBEV scores may artificially create two participant groups whose exposure to blast is relatively similar. Our secondary analyses aim to address this concern by using GBEV as a continuous variable when evaluating the relationship between the GBEV and biomarkers. Third, we likely lack statistical power to robustly control for variance in mild TBI and combat exposure. Fourth, our study does not include a control group of participants without RBE, because all SOF personnel who have experienced combat (a study inclusion criterion) undergo training that results in RBE. Non-SOF military personnel may have less RBE but did not go through the SOF selection process and would not have similar training or combat exposures. Thus, non-SOF active-duty military personnel would not be an adequate control group. Some of these limitations can be mitigated in future studies by following SOF personnel longitudinally, as discussed below."

    "Methods": "Study population\nThis prospective cohort study enrolled two different cohorts of male collegiate student football athletes from the Pennsylvania State University from two distinct competitive seasons in a Division I NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision. This study was approved by the Pennsylvania State University Institutional Review Board and informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to enrollment.\n\nStudy procedures\nAll participants completed a comprehensive pre-season interview which included demographic information, medical and concussion history (self-report), and history of learning disabilities. Pre-season blood draws were completed within 1 week before the athletic season began (prior to any pre-season contact practices or competitions) and the postseason blood draw within 1 week after the last game of the regular season. None of the athletes were recovering from or were diagnosed with a concussion in the 9 months prior to the pre-season evaluation. A blood sample of 5\u2009mL was placed in a serum separator tube and allowed to clot at room temperature before being centrifuged. The serum was placed in bar-coded aliquot containers and stored at -70\u00b0C until transport to a central laboratory where samples were analyzed in batches. Lab personnel conducting the biomarker analysis were blinded to the clinical data. All athletic trainers, physicians, and research personnel were blinded to the serum biomarker results.\n\nOutcome measures\nThe primary outcome measure was the change in biomarker concentrations over the course of a season. The secondary outcome measure was the association between protein biomarkers and playing positions using two different published classification systems. Per Lehman and colleagues, player positions were divided into either speed versus non-speed positions or three profiles. Speed players included quarterbacks, running backs, halfbacks, fullbacks, wide receivers, tight ends, defensive backs, safety, and linebackers. Non-speed players included all defensive and offensive linemen.\n11\nAdditionally, player positions were divided into three profiles recently developed by Karton and colleagues in a study that used a biomechanical measurement method that incorporated frequency of impact, tissue strain magnitude and time interval between impacts to measure exposures.\n10\nIn this study, \u201cProfile 1\u201d positions were exposed to low impact frequency of proportionately higher strain magnitudes (quarterbacks, wide receivers, and defensive backs). \u201cProfile 2\u201d consisted of all levels of magnitude of mid-range impact frequency and intervals (linebackers, running backs and tight ends). \u201cProfile 3\u201d positions experienced the highest frequency of head impacts within short time intervals (offensive and defensive lines).\n10\n\nBiomarker analysis\nSerum samples were analyzed using the Simoa (single molecule array) Neurology 4-plex assay kit (Quanterix, Lexington, MA) for simultaneous measurement of GFAP, UCH-L1, total Tau, and NF-L on the HDX Analyzer. Assays were batched to minimize variability, with each batch run with appropriate standards and controls to ensure reliability. The laboratory was blinded to the clinical data. All samples were analyzed in duplicate. None of the intra-assay coefficients of variance exceeded 20%. Samples with concentrations below the level of detection were excluded from analysis, this included one pre-season UCH-L1 value and three post-season UCH-L1 values. The average coefficient of variation of measurement of GFAP, UCH-L1, Tau and NF-L were 7.7%, 10.2%, 6.3%, and 5.8%, respectively. Limit of detection of GFAP was 0.211\u2009pg/mL, UCH-L1 was 1.05\u2009pg/mL, Tau was 0.0146\u2009pg/mL, and NF-L was 0.038\u2009pg/mL.\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics with medians, proportions and interquartile ranges were used to describe the data. For statistical analysis, biomarker levels were treated as continuous data and measured in pg/mL. Data were assessed for equality of variance and distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Logarithmic transformations were conducted on non-normally distributed data. Concentrations of all four biomarkers had to be transformed. Group comparisons were performed using the Fisher's exact test, analysis of variance, and independent sample t-tests with variance consideration. Correlational analysis used Pearson's correlation and Spearman's rank correlation. All analyses were performed using the statistical software package SPSS 27.0 (IBM Corporation\n\u00ae\n)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll experiments were conducted in accordance with the institutional guidelines of Sapporo Medical University. The use of animals in this study was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee and the Committee for Security of Recombinant DNA Experiments of Sapporo Medical University.\n\nPreparation of MSCs from rat bone marrow\nThe MSC preparation and culture were conducted based on our previous studies.\n16\nBriefly, bone marrow, obtained from femoral bones in adult (6\u20138 weeks old) Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, was diluted to 15\u2009mL with Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA), 2\u2009mM l-glutamine (Sigma), 100\u2009U/mL penicillin, and 0.1\u2009mg/mL streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) and incubated for three days at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO\n2\n. When cultures almost reached confluence, the adherent cells were detached with a trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution (Sigma) and subcultured at 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n4\ncells/mL of medium. After three passages, the MSCs were used in the present study. A previous phenotypic analysis of the surface antigens revealed cluster of differentiation (CD) 45\n-\n, CD73\n+\n, CD90\n+\n, and CD106\n-\non MSCs.\n17\n,\n18\n\nSCI model\nContusive SCI was performed as described previously.\n12\nBriefly, adult (7-week-old) male SD rats (250\u2013300\u2009g) were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of ketamine (90\u2009mg/kg, IP) and xylazine (4\u2009mg/kg, IP). After skin incision, the T9 vertebra was stabilized, a laminectomy was performed at the T9\u201310 level of the spinal cord, and a 150-kdyn contusion was delivered to the spinal cord using an Infinite Horizons impactor (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, LLC, Lexington, KY). Appropriate post-operative care was provided for all animals, including twice-daily manual bladder expression for up to 14 days. The rats were housed in an atmosphere of 50% humidity at a temperature of 24\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00b0C.\n\nBehavioral testing\nOpen field locomotor function was assessed by a tester blinded to the treatment using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale.\n19\nIntact (\nn\n=\u200910) and SCI rats (\nn\n=\u200920) were scored two days before SCI induction, and at two-day intervals thereafter until sacrifice at eight weeks post-SCI induction.\n\nExperimental protocol\nOnly rats with BBB scores that displayed zero points one day after SCI induction were included in this study. The SCI rats with BBB scores of zero points were randomized and received a single intravenous infusion of MSCs at 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n6\ncells in 1.0\u2009mL of fresh DMEM (\nn\n=\u200910) or vehicle (1.0\u2009mL fresh DMEM alone) (\nn\n=\u200910) via the femoral vein one day after SCI induction. All rats were injected daily with cyclosporine A (10\u2009mg/kg, IP).\n10\n,\n11\n,\n20\nAge-matched intact rats were used as intact controls (\nn\n=\u200910). At day 14 after SCI induction, AAV virus was injected into both SCI animals and age-matched intact animals\n21\u201326\n(\nsee Neuroanatomical tracing\n). Eight weeks after SCI induction, histological analysis was performed.\n\nNeuroanatomical tracing\nGreen Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-encoding AAVs with a chicken beta-actin (CAG) promoter and tdTomato-encoding AAVs with a CAG promoter (AAV-8-CAG-GFP/tdTomato) were purchased from Vector Biolabs (Malvern, PA). At day 14 after SCI induction, the rats were placed on a stereotaxic frame under anesthesia induced by an IP injection of ketamine (75\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg).\nFourteen days post-SCI, a craniotomy was performed to expose the sensorimotor cortex. The GFP-encoding AAV was injected into the right hemisphere. The tdTomato-encoding AAV was injected into the left hemisphere. Five rats per group (five intact, five vehicle-SCI, five MSC-SCI) received both AAV-8-CAG-GFP/tdTomato. Five rats per group (five intact, five vehicle-SCI, five MSC-SCI) received both AAV-8-CAG-tdTomato.\nFor each hemisphere, six injections for cortex (AAVs; 4.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n10\ngenome copy/\u03bcL, 0.5\u2009\u03bcL per site) were performed at the following coordinates: 1.0\u2009mm lateral; 1.5\u2009mm, 1.0\u2009mm depth; and -1.0\u2009mm, 0\u2009mm, 1.0\u2009mm posterior to the bregma using a nanoliter-injector (World Precision Instrument Inc., Sarasota, FL) attached to a pulled glass pipette.\n27\nThe method used in this study allowed us to perform precise microdelivery of viral vectors to localized regions in the brain. The needle was left in place for 3\u2009min before moving to the next site.\n\nHistological analysis\nSix weeks after tracer injections,\n28\nrats were perfused transcardially with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde under deep anesthesia with an IP injection of ketamine (75\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg). Spinal cords were dissected out and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. Sections were cut into 50-\u03bcm thickness using a cryostat (Sakura Seiki Co, Tokyo, Japan).\nOne section of each animal was selected and cut. Then, these sections were washed three times in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) three times. The sections were examined using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM780 ELYRA S.1 system). Sections were viewed directly to assess GFP and tdTomato fluorescence. The intensities of GFP or tdTomato signals were quantified using ImageJ software bundled with Java 1.8.0_172 (National Institutes of Health [NIH], Bethesda MD).\n27\n,\n29\n,\n30\n\nClearing\nThe spinal cord tissue was cleared according to a modified version of the advanced clear, unobstructed brain imaging cocktails and computational analysis (CUBIC) protocol.\n31\nFirst, the samples were treated with half-diluted CUBIC-L (#T3740, Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The fixed samples were immersed in 10\u2009mL of half-diluted CUBIC-L for 6\u2009h at 37\u00b0C under low-speed rotation. The samples were then placed in 10\u2009mL of 100% CUBIC-L solution for four days at 37\u00b0C with gentle shaking. The CUBIC-L was replaced every 2 days.\nThen, to wash off the remaining CUBIC-L reagent, the samples were washed in 10\u2009mL of PBS for 2\u2009h at room temperature with gentle shaking. The samples were then immersed in 5\u2009mL of CUBIC-R+ (for animals) (#T3741, Tokyo Chemical Industry, Co., Ltd.) diluted by half and treated for 24\u2009h at room temperature. Finally, the samples were immersed in 4\u2009mL of CUBIC-R+ and shaken gently at room temperature overnight. The next day, fresh reagents were replaced and incubated for another 24\u2009h before imaging.\n\nLight sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) of optically cleared samples\nThe LSFM of optically cleared rat spinal cords was performed with an Ultramicroscope II (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany), including an Olympus MVX10 zoom body (Olympus), and a scientific complementary metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor camera (PCO, Germany) with a pixel size of 6.5\u2009\u03bcm. Detection optics with an optical magnification range of 1.26 to 12.6 and an NA of 0.5 were used. For tdTomato and GFP excitation, a 561-nm and 488-nm diode laser was used, respectively. The emitted wavelengths were detected with specific detection filters: 620/60\u2009nm for tdTomato and 525/50\u2009nm for GFP. The optical zoom factor of the measurements varied from 1.26 to 8 and the light-sheet thickness ranged from 5 to 10\u2009\u03bcm.\n\nQuantitative analysis\nImages of sections labeled with tdTomato (\nn\n=\u20095/group), each at the C4-5 and L1-2 levels, were acquired using a Zeiss microscope. The distribution of axons was plotted using the ImageJ software (NIH). Their distributions were further calculated in squares, which divided the hemispinal cord image by 6\u2009\u00d7\u20099, and heatmaps were generated using Graph-R software.\n28\nThe value in each square was assigned into 20 divisions ordered from high to low numbers with the squares in the highest division represented in red and the lowest in blue color.\n\nStatistics\nAll statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 21 for Macintosh (IBM, Inc., IL). Groups were compared by one-way analysis of variance, and the Tukey-Kramer test was used for\npost hoc\ncomparisons. Comparisons between two groups were performed using the Mann-Whitney\nU test\n. Data are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean. Differences were considered statistically significant at\np\n<\u20090.05.\n\nData availability\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request."

    "Methods": "Participants\nPatients with traumatic SCI within 6 months of injury who were 18-80 years old, non\u2013ventilator-dependent, and were able to understand the English language were recruited to participate from July 2017 to March 2020. Individuals were excluded if they had insufficient mental capacity, English speaking competency, or reading ability to provide informed consent. We certify that informed, witnessed, written or verbal consent was obtained from each participant prior to initiation of the study procedures. This project is supported by the National Institutes for Disability and Independent Living Rehabilitation Research model systems grant (#SI-0158) and is registered on\nclinicaltrials.gov\n(#NCT02919917). The findings reported here represent secondary analyses from this model systems grant.\n\nISNCSCI examination\nThe ISNCSCI examination is recognized worldwide as the standard for the examination and classification of neurological sensorimotor impairment after SCI for use in clinical trials and routine clinical practice.\n24\nThe ISNCSCI examination is performed with the individual in the supine position to evaluate segmental somatosensory perception, motor function, and provide the NLI and AIS classification of injury.\n\nISAFSCI examination\nWhile the ISAFSCI is designed to document the degree of ANS impairment to multiple organ systems (i.e., broncho-pulmonary, thermoregulatory, sudomotor, bowel, bladder, sexual and reproductive), we focused this study on the cardiovascular section of the examination. We collected beat-to-beat supine HR and BP data at the bedside and used the definitions from the general autonomic function section of the ISAFSCI to assess the clinical presentation of cardiovascular ANS impairments post-SCI.\n15\n,\n16\nBeat-to-beat HR and BP were averaged over a 5-min supine observation, and ISAFSCI criteria for cardiovascular dysfunction were as follows: 1) bradycardia\u2009=\u2009HR \u226460\u2009bpm; 2) tachycardia\u2009=\u2009HR \u2265100\u2009bpm; 3) systolic hypotension\u2009=\u2009supine systolic BP (SBP) \u226490\u2009mm Hg; or 4) diastolic hypotension\u2009=\u2009supine diastolic BP (DBP) \u226460\u2009mm Hg. In addition, we classified individuals with 5) neurogenic shock if they were within 30 days of injury (\nn\n=\u200914) and met criteria for both bradycardia and systolic hypotension. To document orthostatic hypotension (OH), we passively re-positioned patients into the seated position by moving the head of their bed into an up-right position between 45\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 while the legs remained horizontal to the hips, and we monitored beat-to-beat changes in HR and BP continuously. We did not perform the sit-up test, which is a provocative maneuver used in the SCI population to test for OH,\n25\nto avoid eliciting symptoms of orthostatic intolerance and because there were mechanical limitations with the hospital beds. We defined OH 6) as a fall in SBP \u226520\u2009mm Hg and/or 7) a fall in DBP \u226510\u2009mm Hg when moved from the supine to the seated position.\n15\n,\n26\nAutonomic dysreflexia (AD), was defined as 8) a rise in SBP >20\u2009mm Hg from average supine SBP any time during testing in individuals with lesions at or above T6.\n16\n\nData collection\nTesting was conducted at the bedside after hospital admission to an acute SCI rehabilitation unit. Instrumentation was applied during quiet rest with the patient in the supine position and included: a three-lead ECG (UFI RESP1 Impedance Pneumograph, Morro Bay, CA), a finger photoplethysmography cuff (Finometer MIDI, Finapres Medical Systems B. V., Enschede, the Netherlands), and a digital sphygmomanometer (Welch Allyn 300 Series Vital Signs Monitor, Skaneateles, NY). Beat-to-beat BP was monitored and recorded at the middle finger of the dominant hand and brachial BP was recorded at 1-min intervals on the opposite arm, which was used to calibrate the finger BP signals. The depth and rate of breathing was monitored by the RESP1 Impedance Pneumograph, and the 5-min assessment of supine beat-to-beat HR and BP, used to determine ISAFSCI score and parameters of cardiovascular ANS function (i.e., HRV and BP), was recorded during normal tidal, unpaced breathing.\n\nData analysis\nThe continuous HR and BP signals were viewed and monitored in real time and were stored on a laptop hard drive for offline analysis. The customized analytical program, written with LabView graphical software (National Instruments, Austin TX), performs automated peak detection with visual inspection for artifacts and anomalies and allows for cursor-based manual editing of individual beats where appropriate (e.g., because of errors in the automated peak detection process). Discrete Fourier transform algorithms were employed to quantify the power spectra within the high-frequency range of HR (HF\nHRV\n: 0.15-0.40\u2009Hz) and at the Mayer wave frequency range for SBP (SBP\nmayer\n: 0.07-0.14\u2009Hz) as markers of cardio-vagal and sympathetic vasomotor tone, respectively. The natural log (ln) was applied to the raw signals for statistical comparisons and a constant of 1.0 was added to each score to remove negative ln values.\n\nStatistical analysis\nGroup differences in demographic characteristics, supine cardiovascular ANS assessments, HF\nHRV\nand SBP\nmayer\nwere compared with a simple analysis of variance model for NLI (cervical: C2-T1, high thoracic: T2-T5, and low thoracic: T6-T12) or independent t tests for AIS (AIS A versus AIS B/C/D) and ISAFSCI score (0, \u2265 1). The relationships between parameters of cardiovascular ANS control (HF\nHRV\n, SBP\nmayer\n), with demographic characteristics (age, sex, medications), injury characteristics determined on the ISNCSCI examination (NLI, AIS, motor score, sensory score, time since injury [TSI]) and the ISAFSCI examination (total cardiovascular score), were assessed using bivariate regression. Significant univariate associations were further explored with multiple regression analyses to examine the collective impact of the independent variables on HF\nHRV\nand SBP\nmayer\n. Of note, in the multiple regression models, NLI was treated as an integer (e.g., C1\u2009=\u200930, C2\u2009=\u200929\u2026), AIS A\u2009=\u20091 and AIS B/C/D\u2009=\u20090. All analyses were conducted using R software, with the exception that JASP was used to calculate Bayes factors. Data are reported as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation and significance was set at an alpha of 0.05."

    "Methods": "Animals\nThe study was approved and supervised by the University of Arizona Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (~9\u201310 weeks old, ~300\u2013325 g, Charles River Labs) were given 1 week to acclimate in their home cages. Rats were given standard chow and water\nad libitum\nand were housed in a reverse light-cycle room. Experiments were conducted in accordance with University of Arizona, Department of Defense Instruction 3216.01, RIGOR and Animal Research: Reporting\nIn Vivo\nExperiments (ARRIVE) guidelines concerning the care and use of laboratory animals. Adequate measures were taken to minimize pain or discomfort.\n\nMidline fluid percussion injury\nAll rodent experiments were conducted in cohorts of uninjured (sham) and mTBI animals, randomly assigned to groups at the time of brain injury. The individual inducing the brain injury was different from the one assessing cognitive function,\nin vivo\nimaging data, or\nex vivo\nvascular function. After data collection, the group assignment for each animal was decoded. Rats were subjected to midline FPI similar to methods described previously.\n21\n,\n22\n,\n24\nBriefly, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane for surgery, but they did not receive systemic analgesia before injury. Body temperature was maintained with a Deltaphase\n\u00ae\nisothermal heating pad (Braintree Scientific, Inc., Braintree, MA, USA). In a head-holder assembly (Kopf Instrument, Tujunga, CA, USA), a midline scalp incision exposed the skull. A 4.8-mm circular craniotomy was performed (centered on the sagittal suture midway between bregma and lambda) without disrupting the underlying tissue. An injury cap was fabricated from a Luer-Lock needle hub, which was cut, beveled, and scored to fit within the craniotomy. A skull screw was secured in a 1-mm hand-drilled hole into the right frontal bone. The injury hub was affixed over the craniotomy using cyanoacrylate gel and methyl-methacrylate (Hygenic Corp., Akron, OH, USA) was applied around the injury hub and screw. The incision was sutured at the anterior and posterior edges and topical bacitracin and lidocaine ointment were applied. Animals were returned to a warmed holding cage and monitored until ambulatory (approximately 60\u201390 min).\nFor injury induction, animals were re-anesthetized with isoflurane. The dura was inspected through the injury-hub assembly, which was then filled with normal saline and attached to the fluid percussion device (Custom Design and Fabrication, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA). Animals were randomly assigned to receive brain injury (\nn\n= 20; mean: 2.29 \u00b1 0.02 atm, range: 2.20\u20132.44 atm) or sham injury (\nn\n= 21) by releasing (or not releasing) the pendulum onto the fluid-filled cylinder. Animals were monitored for the presence of a forearm fencing response and the return of the righting reflex as indicators of injury severity.\n24\nAfter injury, the injury-hub assembly was removed\nen bloc\n, integrity of the dura was observed, bleeding was controlled with saline and gauze, and the incision was stapled. Brain-injured animals had righting reflex recovery times of 522 \u00b1 34 sec (range 245\u2013755 sec) and sham-injured animals recovered within 15 sec. No sham rat experienced apnea, whereas 16 of 20 injured rats experienced apnea (21 \u00b1 3.7 sec, range 0\u201360 sec). After recovery of the righting reflex, animals were placed in a warmed holding cage before being returned to the housing room. Each rat was evaluated for post-operative health for 3 days. Appropriate interventions, including but not limited to injections of subcutaneous bolus of saline, and feeding with a wet mash of food and water, were performed if clinically indicated. Rats were euthanized if their body weights fell below 10% of their own pre-operative body weight; none met these criteria.\n\nCognitive function evaluation\nThe assessments were performed at 3 and 6 months post-injury by investigators blinded to treatment allocation. Object recognition tasks took place in a square arena (68.58 cm \u00d7 68.58 cm) (\nFig. 1A\n,\n\u200b\n,B).\nB\n). White noise (~46 dB in the arena) was used to mask environmental noises. The novel object recognition (NOR) task tested short-term recognition memory.\n25\nRats were acclimated to the arena for 3 min. Rats were then presented with two objects (O1, O2) in opposite corners of the arena (5 min) in the sample trial. After a 4-h delay, rats were returned to the arena with one object (O2) having been replaced by a novel object (O3). Normal rats explored the novel object (O3) more than the familiar object.\n25\nThe novel object location (NOL) task tested long-term spatial memory.\n26\nThe test trial of NOR served as the sample trial. After 24 h, O3 was placed in the same place as the previous day and O1 was moved to an adjacent corner in the arena. Normal rats explored the item in the novel location (O1) more than the unmoved object. The temporal order object recognition (TOR) task tested temporal working memory by the ability to recognize the order of objects presented over time.\n26\nTwo sample trials established the cognitive framework, followed by a test trial. In sample trials, rats explored two copies of an object for 5 min, followed by exploration of a separate pair of identical objects followed by the test trial where one of each item was present. Breaks between sample phases were 3 min before the two sample phases and 5 min before the test trial (5 min). Normal rats explored the initial object, rather than the more recent object.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nChronic cognitive impairment following mTBI.

Color image is available online.\nExploration of an object was defined as the nose being within ~2 cm of the object. Differences in time spent exploring each object were recorded for all tasks and used to create a discrimination ratio (exploration time of the target object/exploration time of both objects). Normal rats explored the target object more than the original object, in this case resulting in discrimination ratio above 0.5.\n26\nA discrimination ratio of 0.5 indicated equal exploration of object, and equivalent to chance performance. Every trial was tracked and recorded using Ethovision software (Noldus, Leesburg, VA, USA).\nRats were required to explore each item more than 5 sec during the sample trial(s). If a rat did not meet exploration criteria, a discrimination ratio was input (\nSupplementary Table S1\n). The imputed minimal discrimination ratio was calculated using the average lowest exploration time for the target object and the highest average exploration time for the specific rat\u2019s experimental condition.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging\nRats underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 6 months post-injury. Scanning was performed using a 7-T small animal, 30-cm horizontal-bore magnet and BioSpec Avance III spectrometer (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) with a 116-mm high-power gradient set (600 mT/m) and either a 70-mm rat volume quadrature coil or a 40-mm rat head volume quadrature coil depending on size and weight of the animal. Each animal was anesthetized and maintained under isoflurane anesthesia (1\u20132%) in medical air. A tail-vein catheter was placed for injection of ferumoxytol (Feraheme\n\u00ae\n) at a dosing scheme of 0.3 mg/kg for first-pass injection at 2.2 mL/min and 0.7 mg/kg for slow infusion at 1.1 mL/min using a Genie Touch (Kent Scientific: Torrington, CT, USA) power injector. Respiration was continually monitored via a pillow sensor positioned under the abdomen (SA Instruments, Stoney Brook, NY, USA). Normal body temperature (36\u201337\u00b0C) was maintained with a circulating warm-water blanket (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA).\nAnatomical T2-weighted MR images were acquired with rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) sequence (repetition time [TR]: 5,500, echo time [TE]: 12.5, flip angle [FA]: 90 degrees, averages: 4, field of view [FOV]: 30 \u00b7 30 mm, matrix size [MTX]: 150 \u00b7 150, slices: 50, slick thickness: 0.5 mm) for registration and localizing hippocampus. Relaxometry measurements were acquired with pre/post-contrast T1 maps with a RARE at variable TR (RARE-VTR) sequence (TE: 8.5; TR: 275, 500, 800, 1,100, 2,000, 4,000; FA: 90 degrees; RARE factor: 4; averages: 2; FOV: 30 \u00d7 30 mm; MTX: 150 \u00d7 150; slices: 6; slice thickness: 1 mm) and T2* maps with multi-gradient-echo (MGE) sequence (TR: 1.000; FA: 45 degrees; averages: 6; TE: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24; FOV: 30 \u00d7 30 mm; MTX: 150 \u00d7 150; slices: 6; slice thickness: 1). First-pass imaging utilized an echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence (TE: 7.5, FA: 45 degrees, TR: 1,000, averages: 1, FOV: 30 \u00d7 30 mm, MTX: 64 \u00d7 64, slices: 6, slice thickness: 1 mm, repetitions: 240) allowing for 1 min of baseline image acquisition before injection and 3 min of post-injection image acquisition.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging analysis\nThe perfusion data sets were analyzed by investigators blind to treatment allocation using in-house code developed in MATLAB and the MATLAB Imaging Processing Toolbox for registration functions (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). Pre-processing steps included rigid registration and arterial input function (AIF) determination. The first time-point of the dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) data set was registered to the anatomical T2 images in order to apply the tissue regions of interest (ROIs). The remaining DSC time-points were registered across time to account for any potential movement during the scan. After registration, \u0394R2* time curves were computed using the conventional single-echo equation.\n27\nThe AIF was automatically determined using a previously published algorithm.\n28\nMean tissue curves were found in each of the predetermined ROIs within the brain as mentioned above. Finally, CBF was determined as the maximum value of the residue function\u2014the end product of the deconvolution.\n29\nTo compensate for any potential delay between the time curves, the AIF was discretized using a block-circulant method prior to the deconvolution and signal-to-noise (SNR)-based thresholding was used truncate the inverse matrix to help regularize this discretized AIF.\n30\nCBF and CBV were calculated from coronal slices. Regional measurements were made for S1BF and the medial and lateral hippocampus (bisected medial to the dentate gyrus). The length and width of the third ventricle (~3 mm posterior from bregma) were measured and compared to assess for ventriculomegaly. Evidence of gross bleeding and/or microhemorrhage was evaluated by gross visualization from T2*-weighted images.\n\nEx vivo cerebrovascular function assessment\nRats were euthanized at 6 months post-injury via sodium pentobarbital overdose and circle of Willis arteries were carefully dissected from the brain and placed immediately in HEPES buffer (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid). The methods were adapted from previous work.\n31\n,\n32\nMiddle or posterior cerebral arteries were isolated and cannulated, and vessel luminal diameters were measured using videomicroscopes throughout the procedure by investigators blind as to treatment allocation. The vessels were pressurized to 30 mm Hg for 30 min and then 60 mm Hg for 30 min. Myogenic tone was measured based on dilator response to intraluminal pressure. For each rat, several arterial segments (3\u20134) were cannulated and underwent vasoreactivity measurements at baseline and following 1-h exposure to 1 of 3 vascular agonists. Following stabilization, each vessel was pre-constricted with increasing doses of endothelin-1 (10\n\u22129\nto 10\n\u22124\nM, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis MO, USA) until ~60% of last observed maximum diameter was achieved. Baseline dilator responses to acetylcholine (increasing doses from 10\n\u22129\nto 10\n\u22124\nM) were measured to assess endothelium-dependent vasodilation, followed by 10\n\u22124\nM of nitric oxide donor diethylenetriamine NONOate (DETA NONOate, Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) to evaluate smooth muscle-dependent dilation.\nTo assess arterial response to vascular agonists/stressors, baseline (control) response was followed by washout, and each artery was assigned to exposure for 1 h to one of the following treatments: angiotensin 2 (20\n\u00b5\nM, Sigma Aldrich),\n\u03b2\n-amyloid 1\u201342 (A\n\u03b2\n42, 1\n\u03bc\nM, Anaspec, Fremont CA, USA),\n31\n,\n33\nor high glucose (33 mM)\n34\nand a second measurement of dilator responses to acetylcholine and DETA NONOate was performed. For the arterial segments assigned to angiotensin 2, baseline intraluminal pressure prior to vasoreactivity experiments was increased 0 to 30, 60, and then 90 mm Hg. Post-treatment dilator responses were compared with baseline control response in both sham and mTBI rats and change in dilator responses (treatment minus baseline) was compared between sham and mTBI rats.\n\nStatistical analysis\nSample size considerations: Both cerebrovascular and cognitive function outcomes represent study primary outcomes. Our separate preliminary pilot study (\nn\n= 3) on circle of Willis arterial function 5 weeks following surgery showed a difference in dilator response to 10\n\u22124\nM acetylcholine between mTBI and sham of \u221213.8% with a combined standard deviation (SD) of 8.9%. A sample size of at least\nn\n= 15 per group would allow us to show a similar difference at 6 months post-surgery but with a more conservative SD of 13% (\n\u03b1\n= 0.05,\n\u03b2\n= 0.80).\nCognitive function measures (NOR, NOL, TOR) were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA; two-factor study with repeated measures on one factor) with time (3 month and 6 month) as within-subject factor and treatment (mTBI, sham) as grouping/between-subjects factor. mTBI and sham MRI and\nex vivo\nvasoreactivity data were compared using unpaired\nt\n-test for normally distributed data or Mann-Whitney U test for data that were not normally distributed. Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine normality of distribution. Comparison of dilator responses before and following exposure to vascular agonists was done using paired\nt\n-test. Correlation analyses were performed using Pearson\u2019s method for normally distributed data or Spearman\u2019s method for non-normally distributed data. Significant\np\n-value was set at\np\n< 0.05 (two-sided). Analyses were performed using MedCalc version 19.8 (MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium).

C+AIH, P+AIH, and C+SHAM intervention arms were assigned using a random number generator. The order of interventions was balanced across participants with at least 2-week washout periods.

The protocol timeline (B, bottom) illustrates the assessment and treatment days; the vertical lines correspond to baseline (BL), treatment Days 1-5 (D, bold), and follow-up Days 12 and 19.\nWe monitored for pain, dizziness, altered vision, respiratory distress, autonomic dysreflexia, and change in mental function during and after treatment. Cardiovascular responses also were monitored (Radical-7, Masimo Corp, USA) before, during, and immediately following C+AIH, P+AIH, and C+SHAM treatments (\nFig. 1\n). We required participants' heart rate to be between 40 and 160 BPM, systolic pressure between 85\u2009mm Hg and 160\u2009mm Hg, and SpO\n2\nto remain above 75% throughout the duration of treatment sessions.\n2\nBlood samples were drawn before and immediately after treatment on Days 1 (D\n1\n) and 5 (D\n5\n) of each arm to test for C-reactive protein (CRP) levels as an inflammatory marker and to confirm caffeine levels in blood serum (Table S2 in the\nSupplementary Material\n).

The median 10-meter walk test (10MWT) baseline times did not differ between the treatment rounds (Median Test,\np\n=\u20090.638). Follow-up walking assessments occurred 1 week (D\n12\n) and 2 weeks (D\n19\n) post-intervention (\nFig. 1B\n). We quantified the primary outcome measure walking speed using the 10MWT. Using the 6-min walk test (6MWT), we quantified the secondary outcome measure walking distance. Participants used preferred assistive devices for all testing when necessary for safe ambulation (\nTable 2\n).

The GCS score was acquired on presentation to the ED. The six-month follow-up GOSE was administered to capture disability related to the TBI only, with exclusion of disability associated with co-occurring polytrauma (e.g., orthopedic injuries).\n21\u201323\nThe GOSE was dichotomized as <8 (incomplete recovery) versus\u2009=\u20098 (complete recovery) as the primary outcome for the analysis, because incomplete recovery is common in mTBI but is not reliably predicted by clinical injury severity factors such as the GCS or by conventional CT or MRI findings.\n\nMRI acquisition\nThe MRI with DTI was conducted at the 11 level 1 trauma centers in the United States using 3T MR scanners.

Institutes of Health Common Data Elements (CDEs) for TBI pathoanatomical classification of intracranial lesions such as contusions, axonal injury, and subdural hematomas.\n28\nPatients with acute abnormal CT or MRI findings related to the recent injury were categorized as \u201cCT+\u201d or \u201cMRI+,\u201d respectively. Because the study was limited to patients with mTBI, the final dataset did not include patients with large, deep anatomic lesions that could meaningfully interfere with DTI measurements within the skeletonized core of major WM tracts.\n\nAssociation analysis with GOSE at six months post-injury\nDemographics, clinical, and initial CT characteristics were compared between mTBI participants with incomplete (GOSE <8) versus complete (GOSE\u2009=\u20098) recovery at six months post-injury. Between-group comparisons used the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test for continuous variables and the Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Bivariate and multi-variable (adjusting for demographic and other known risk factors such as history of psychiatric illness, previous TBI, and CT imaging results) associations between individual tract-specific DTI metrics at two weeks post-injury and incomplete recovery (GOSE <8 vs.\u2009=\u20098) at six months post-injury were assessed using logistic regression models.\nStandardized score for each DTI measure was calculated using its mean and standard deviation from the analysis sample. This way, we could better compare the effect across the different DTI measures. The Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method was used to adjust for multiple testing.\n29\nStatistical analyses were performed in R version 3.6.1."

    "Methods": "We conducted a retrospective analysis of a prospective longitudinal cohort study of participants enrolled in the TBIMS NDB.23Characteristics of this continuously enrolling database have been described previously.1,24,25The sample includes participants who survived acute hospitalization and were admitted to one of 16 inpatient rehabilitation centers in the United States that participate in the TBIMS program. This study was approved by the Massachusetts General Brigham Institutional Review Board (IRB; Protocol #2012P002476) and by IRBs at each participating center in the TBIMS NDB.\n\nTBIMS procedures and study sample\nAs described previously, TBIMS participants are survivors of acute moderate or severe TBI and are 16 years or older at injury onset.\n1\n,\n26\nFor this study, we included participants admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation facility with DoC, defined here and in prior studies\n1\n,\n3\nas an admission DRS motor item score >0 (i.e., absence of command following). We excluded participants who did not have a FIM score and either the DRS or GOSE acquired at 1-year (365\u2009\u00b1\u200960 days post-injury, as recommended by the TBIMS standard operating procedure).\n26\nAmong 18,486 participants in the TBIMS database enrolled between October 1, 1988 and September 4, 2020, our final cohort included 1483 participants with DoC who met inclusion criteria (\nFig. 1\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nCohort description. Study CONSORT diagram. DoC, Disorders of Consciousness; DRS, Disability Rating Scale; FIM, Functional Independence Measure; GOSE, Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended; TBIMS, Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems.\n\nMeasures\nThe TBIMS NDB includes demographics and TBI characteristics, as well as acute care hospital, rehabilitation, and follow-up outcome variables.\n1\n,\n26\nFollow-up assessments are conducted at 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, and every 5 years after injury until death or withdrawal from the study. Study investigators are trained to collect data from the medical record and to perform all assessments in accordance with quality control guidelines maintained by the TBIMS National Data and Statistical Center.\n26\nWe selected the 1-year time-point for analysis, as it has been previously shown to reflect the range of longer-term outcomes in TBIMS participants with DoC on rehabilitation admission.\n3\n\nFIM\nThe FIM instrument includes a series of standardized questions assessing the degree of caregiver support required to accomplish basic cognitive and motor tasks, with total scores ranging from 18 (most dependent) to 126 (least dependent).\n16\nBased on external validation studies\n13\u201315\n,\n18\nand recent observational studies in this cohort,\n1\nwe defined functional dependency as FIM total score <80 (FIM-dependency). We used the FIM as our study reference standard because of its granularity and extensive validation in multiple previous investigations.\n13\u201315\n,\n18\n\nGOSE\nThe GOSE is an 8-point scale ranging from 1 (Death) to 8 (Upper Good Recovery), based on degree of functional difficulties in major life domains.\n20\n,\n27\n,\n28\nAlthough the GOSE can be analyzed ordinally,\n29\nit is often dichotomized into favorable and unfavorable outcomes, with an unfavorable cut-point set at \u22643 (Lower Severe Disability, e.g., cannot be left unsupervised in the home for more than 8\u2009h)\n2\n,\n30\u201332\nor \u22644 (Upper Severe Disability, e.g., can be left unsupervised in the home for more than 8\u2009h, but dependent outside the home).\n33\u201335\nWe assessed the performance of these cut-points and determined a data-derived optimal threshold for classifying FIM-dependency.\n\nDRS\nThe DRS combines the three items of the Glasgow Coma Scale\n36\nwith five additional measures.\n8\nThese additional measures evaluate a subject's awareness of how and when to feed, groom, and toilet (0: complete awareness to 3: no awareness), level of functional dependence on others (0: completely independent to 5: totally dependent), and employability (0: not restricted to 3: not employable). The eight-item scores are then summed to generate a total score of 0 (least disabled) to 30 (dead).\n8\nPrior observational and interventional studies\n2\n,\n37\nhave categorized DRS total scores into ad hoc clinical categories including None (0), Mild (1), Partial (2\u20133), Moderate (4\u20136), Moderately Severe (7\u201311), Severe (12\u201316), Extremely Severe (17\u201321), Vegetative State (22\u201324), and Extreme Vegetative State (25\u201329) (\nSupplementary Table S1\n).\n8\nWe evaluated the performance of the Severe Disability cut-point (scores \u226512), as well as a data-driven optimal cut-point for classifying FIM-dependency.\n\nDRS\nDepend\nBased on the standardized survey instrument, the GOSE cut-points of \u22643 and \u22644 represent some degree of in-home dependence,\n38\nalthough not necessarily resulting from cognitive impairment. The DRS cut-point of Severe Disability (score \u226512) cannot be directly mapped onto level of dependence. We generated a binary DRS rating (the DRS\nDepend\n) using a subset of DRS items and tested whether this rating classified FIM-dependency better than the GOSE and total DRS. We defined DRS\nDepend\nas a DRS profile with Level of Functioning \u22654 (indicating the need for assistance with all activities at all times), and a score of >0 (some assistance needed) on at least one of the following items: Verbal, Feeding, Toileting, or Grooming. Participants meeting DRS\nDepend\ncriteria, therefore, require the assistance of another person at all times, and that need is based, at least partially, on cognitive impairment. We evaluated the performance of the DRS\nDepend\nfor classifying FIM-dependency.\n\nStatistical analysis\nFirst, we compared baseline demographics and injury characteristics of participants who completed the 1-year follow-up assessment (\nn\n=\u20091483) with those who missed the 1-year follow-up or died (\nn\n=\u2009644) using T (continuous, normally distributed variables), Wilcoxon (continuous, non-normally distributed variables), or \u03c7\n2\n(categorical variables) tests (\nTable 1\n).\nTable 1.\nDemographic and Injury Characteristics of Participants Diagnosed with DoC on Admission to Rehabilitation\nVariable\n1-year outcome complete (\nn\n=\u20091483)\nDeceased or 1-year outcome missing (\nn\n=\u2009644)\nP\nvalue\nAge (mean [SD])\n38 [18]\n43 [20]\n< 0.001\nSex (% male)\n76\n76\n0.9\nRace (% white)\n68\n67\n0.5\nInjury mechanism (% high velocity)\n59\n45\n< 0.001\nIntubated on arrival (%)\n55\n52\n0.2\nInitial GCS (mean [SD])\na\n8 [4]\n9 [4]\n0.1\nCraniectomy performed (%)\n20\n20\n0.9\nAny intracranial hypertension (%)\n43\n37\n0.007\nSDH or SAH (%)\n99\n99\n1\nAny contusion (%)\n79\n81\n0.5\nIVH (%)\n44\n38\n0.01\nSpinal cord injury (%)\n4\n4\n0.8\nGCS on arrival to rehab (mean [SD])\n10 [2]\n10 [3]\n0.2\nDRS on arrival to rehab (median [IQR])\n22 [19, 23]\n21 [19, 24]\n0.6\nDRS on rehab discharge (median [IQR])\n9 [6, 14]\n10 [6, 16]\n0.003\nAcute care length of stay (mean days [SD])\n30 [21]\n29 [19]\n0.5\nTime from injury to 1-year outcome assessment (Mean days [SD])\n370 [36]\n\u2014\n\u2014\nOpen in a separate window\na\n57% un-scorable (due to intubation + sedation/paralytic).\nBold text indicates a significant difference between groups.\nDoC, Disorders of Consciousness; DRS, Disability Rating Scale; GCS, Glasgow Coma Scale; IQR, interquartile range; IVH, intraventricular hemorrhage; SD, standard deviation; SDH, subdural hemorrhage; SAH; subarachnoid hemorrhage; TBI, traumatic brain injury.\nFor the primary analysis, we measured performance characteristics for DRS and GOSE cut-points for classifying participants meeting our reference standard criteria for FIM-dependency. For each cut-point, we computed classification performance measures, including area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV), using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) generated from 1000 bootstrapped samples, with performance assessed in the out-of-bag sample (R package: cutpointr).\n39\nAn applied definition of each performance measure is provided in\nSupplementary Table S2\n.\nIn an exploratory analysis, we defined the optimal GOSE and DRS-based thresholds for identifying FIM-dependency. We serially assessed every possible GOSE and DRS dichotomization cut-point, finding the value for each scale that minimized the number of FIM misclassifications. We based our analysis on the assumption that false-positives (inappropriately classifying an independent patient as dependent) represent an error with more clinical consequences than false-negatives (inappropriately classifying a dependent patient as independent) and assigned a 2:1 false-positive to false-negative misclassification penalty (R: cutpointr).\n39\nWe then compared the resulting AUROC of these data-driven thresholds with the DRS\nDepend\nusing Delong's test."

    "Methods": "Data sources\nThe CRS-R data set for this study was assembled from four cohorts: two clinical trials and two rehabilitation hospitals. One clinical trial administered amantadine or placebo and all participants received inpatient rehabilitation services.\n13\nThe other clinical trial administered active or placebo repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in a hospital setting; participants did not receive additional rehabilitation services.\n14\nThe two rehabilitation hospitals are located in metropolitan areas in the Midwest and Southern regions of the United States. Following Institutional Review Board approval from The George Washington University, data were aggregated into a single data set.\nParticipants (\nn\n=\u2009262) were included if they were >14 years old and had DoC from a brain injury. We included participants age 14-17 because the CRS-R has been administered on adolescents and young adults and is consistent with clinical practice.\n13\n,\n15\nParticipants had at least one CRS-R assessment and up to 37 re-assessments, resulting in a dataset of 1142 CRS-R records. The CRS-R was administered and scored by a rehabilitation practitioner or trained researcher. Data also were collected on age, time from onset to study enrollment or rehabilitation admission, and etiology of the brain injury.\n\nMeasure\nComa Recovery Scale-Revised\nEach CRS-R item (i.e., subscale) includes a hierarchical ordering of rating scale categories (i.e., scores); a higher score indicates more neurobehavioral function. The assessor begins with the highest rating scale category; if a response is observed and meets the scoring criteria, the assessor moves to the next item.\n16\nIf no response is observed or the response does not meet the scoring criteria, the assessor continues down to the next rating scale category for that item. The number of rating scale categories varies by item; for example, Communication has three rating scale categories (2, 1, 0) while Motor has seven rating scale categories (6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0). Total CRS-R raw scores range from 0-23. The CRS-R Administration and Scoring Guidelines can be found on the Rehab Measures database.\n17\nStates of consciousness\nThe CRS-R items and rating scale categories used to diagnose VS/UWS, MCS and eMCS, based on the Aspen consensus criteria (\nTable 1\n), were applied to categorize all CRS-R records (\nn\n=\u20091142) using STATA SE 14.\n9\nAll analytic procedures and results refers to states of consciousness, based on the Aspen consensus criteria, unless otherwise specified.\n\nAnalytic procedures\nThe partial credit Rasch measurement model was applied using Winsteps version 4.0.1.\n18\nSince a score of a 1, for example, is qualitatively different for each item, the partial credit model allows for this item by item variation, enabling each item to have its own rating scale structure.\n19\nFollowing the Rasch Reporting Guideline for Rehabilitation Research (RULER),\n11\n,\n12\nwe examined the reproducibility and structural validity of the CRS-R in order to identify the hierarchy of the CRS-R rating scale categories (\nFig. 1\n). Reproducibility refers to whether the CRS-R assessment results are comparable across individuals. Structural validity refers to whether the items, rating scale categories, and persons cohere on the measure and reflect the requirements of the Rasch model. Second, we evaluated the extent to which Aspen consensus criteria align with the rating scale category hierarchy. Finally, we examined the association between the CRS-R Rasch person measures and states of consciousness.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nFlowchart of analytic procedures.\n\nReproducibility\nWe addressed the potential for local dependency among persons in the full sample (since the dataset included repeated measures of the same individuals) by generating two random subsamples\u2014calibration and validation sub-samples\u2014in which each individual is represented once by either their first or last record.\n20\nThe calibration and validation sub-samples were represented by 242 participants with either their first or last record. Twenty participants with a single record were randomly assigned for a total of 252 participants in the calibration and validation sub-sample, respectively (\nFig. 2\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nGenerating random calibration and validation samples from the full dataset.\nThe calibration sub-sample was used to produce step and item anchors; these were validated with the validation sub-sample. Luppescu's method of cross-plotting person measures and item calibrations with 95% confidence intervals was used to evaluate whether there were significant deviations between the calibration and validation sub-samples.\n21\nStep and item anchors were validated by evaluating item displacement >0.50 logits.\n22\nOnce validated, the step and item calibrations from the calibration sub-sample were applied as anchored values to the full sample.\n19\n\nStructural validity\nStructural validity was examined in terms of rating scale category structure, unidimensionality, hierarchical order, and measurement accuracy.\nRating scale category structure\nRating scale categories for each item were examined to ensure that each had sufficient observations and that the Andrich thresholds proceeded monotonically.\n23\nRating scale categories are defined by the average category difficulty measure.\n24\n,\n25\nCategories with low frequencies (fewer than 10 observations) do not provide enough observations for stable category measures.\n19\nUnidimensionality\nUnidimensionality refers to the items measuring one underlying trait, neurobehavioral function, in the case of the CRS-R.\n19\nUnidimensionality was evaluated by level of item fit, principal component analysis of residuals, and by amount of local item dependence. Items with an infit mean square >1.4 or <0.6 were considered misfitting (i.e., may not represent the same underlying trait of neurobehavioral function).\n26\nPrincipal component analysis of residuals (PCAR) and disattenuated correlations were also used to evaluate the extent to which items and categories share a similar underlying trait. Disattenuated correlations above 0.82 indicate items are likely measuring the same underlying trait.\n27\nWe also examined the residuals of each item to determine if items are duplicative.\n28\nLocal item dependence was analyzed by evaluating the inter-item correlations. Inter-item correlations >0.70 indicate local dependence which violates the assumptions of the Rasch measurement model.\nTo confirm item fit and PCAR, we used a more stringent technique in which we generated 10 simulated data sets based on the calibration data and fit model assumptions to identify more precise upper and lower bounds for infit mean square, Eigenvalue, and percent variance of the first contrast.\n29\nIn Winsteps, the Simulated Data File (SIFILE) output was specified based on: 1) the request for 10 data files; 2) using the data for the simulation; 3) no resampling of persons; 4) allowing for missing data to maintain the same data pattern; and 5) allowing for extreme scores. The 10 data sets were imported into STATA to calculate the more precise upper (97.5%) and lower (2.5%) bounds for infit mean square, ZSTD, Eigenvalue, and percent variance of the first contrast.\nHierarchical order\nWe generated logit calibrations for the average item difficulty and each rating scale category. We examined the hierarchical order of the CRS-R rating scale categories as they relate to the Aspen consensus criteria.\nMeasurement accuracy\nThe separation index and person separation reliability generated from Winsteps software program were used to examine the measurement precision and ability of the assessment to distinguish among patients with different states of consciousness. Wright's sample-independent person separation reliability (PSR) is reported for our analysis as a Shapiro Wilk test determined our data were non-normal (test statistic\u2009=\u20090.93;\np\n<\u20090.01). The person strata index indicates how many statistically distinct states of consciousness the assessment can distinguish.\n30\n,\n31\nWe evaluated the alignment between the distribution of persons and items by comparing the mean person measures and mean item calibrations. Ceiling and floor effects were reported to describe how well the items aligned with the range of person neurobehavioral function measures. Persons with unexpected patterns of responses were identified via infit mean squares. These unexpected patterns can often be clinically useful in identifying people with particular conditions.\n32\nScore-to-measure conversion\nThe Rasch model transforms ordinal scores into equal-interval logit measures. To enhance clinical interpretation of findings, we generated a CRS-R raw score conversion to Rasch person measures.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAlignment of Aspen consensus criteria, Rasch-based Person Measures, and CRS-R Rating Scale Categories\nThe distributions of the CRS-R Rasch person measures were described by mean and standard deviation (SD) for VS/UWS, MCS, and eMCS. To confirm that the VS/UWS, MCS, and eMCS were statistically significantly different, we used a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The Bartlett test indicated unequal variances; therefore, we also used a Kruskal Wallis test to describe the presence of differences in the mean CRS-R Rasch person measures across states of consciousness. The association between Rasch person measures and states of consciousness was examined via Spearman's correlation coefficient. The strength of the correlation coefficients <0.25 were interpreted as having little or no association, 0.25 to 0.50 a low to fair association, >0.50 to 0.75 a moderate to good association, and >0.75 a strong association.\n33"

    "Methods": "Study design and oversight\nThe Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial (SMART) was a pragmatic, unblinded, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial comparing balanced crystalloids with saline for intravenous fluid administration among critically ill adults admitted to Vanderbilt University Medical Center between June 1, 2015, and April 30, 2017. This study is a secondary analysis of the subgroup of patients with TBI enrolled in the SMART trial. The SMART trial was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB# 190159) at Vanderbilt University Medical Center with waiver of informed consent (see\nSupplementary Appendix\n), was registered online prior to initiation (NCT02444988, NCT02547779), and was overseen by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). Further details regarding the original study protocol, statistical analysis plan, and outcomes were reported previously.\n4\n,\n18\nNotably, fluid therapy in the emergency department and operating room was coordinated with the intensive care unit (ICU) to which patients were being admitted to avoid confounding fluid administration prior to ICU admission.\n\nRole of the funding source\nThe funding institutions had no role in: 1) conception, design, or conduct of the study; 2) collection, management, analysis, interpretation, or presentation of the data; or 3) preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript.\n\nPatient population\nIn the original SMART trial, all adults (age \u226518 years) admitted to a participating ICU during the study period were enrolled at the time of ICU admission. Patients in the SMART dataset with the diagnosis of TBI were included in this secondary analysis. TBI was considered to be present if billing records for the hospitalization contained any International Classification of Disease, 10th Edition, Clinical Modification System (ICD-10-CM) codes for intracranial injury (S06-) in the first five billing codes.\n\nData collection\nThe current study used data from two sources: the dataset for the original SMART trial and a trauma registry prospectively maintained by the institution as part of clinical care.\n9\n,\n19\nData from the SMART trial dataset and the trauma registry were matched using patients\u2019 medical record numbers and dates of admission. The SMART trial dataset included information on: patient demographics; diagnoses; orders for intravenous fluids and blood products; plasma electrolyte and creatinine values; receipt of renal replacement therapy (RRT); and vital status at hospital discharge. The trauma registry included information on: mechanism of injury; Injury Severity Score (ISS) and head Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS); Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores at admission and discharge; admission systolic blood pressure and pulse; and discharge disposition.\n\nStudy outcomes\nThe primary outcome was 30-day in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included discharge disposition (home with or without assistance, medical facility, or death) and final GCS before discharge. Additional secondary clinical outcomes included: hospital length of stay and the number of days alive and free of mechanical ventilation (ventilator-free days), the intensive care unit (ICU-free days), and RRT (RRT-free days) during the 28 days after enrollment.\n\nStatistical analysis\nWith 1157 patients in the SMART dataset admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of TBI, we calculated that this secondary analysis would have 80% statistical power at an alpha level of 0.05 to detect a 7% absolute difference between the balanced crystalloid and saline groups in the primary outcome of 30-day in-hospital mortality, assuming 18% mortality in the saline group based on prior data.\n20\n,\n21\nThe primary analysis was an intention-to-treat comparison of 30-day in-hospital mortality between patients assigned to the balanced crystalloids group and patients assigned to the saline group using a logistic regression model accounting for pre-specified baseline covariates. These baseline covariates included three used in the primary analysis of the original trial (age, gender, race) and injury-specific covariates (inter-facility transfer, head AIS, best GCS motor score within 24\u2009h of ICU admission, systolic blood pressure at presentation, and heart rate at presentation).\nTo evaluate the consistency and robustness of the findings of the primary analysis, we performed five sensitivity analyses: 1) population restricted to patients receiving \u22652000\u2009mL of isotonic crystalloid in the 72\u2009h after enrollment; 2) population restricted to patients receiving \u2265500\u2009mL of isotonic crystalloid in the 72\u2009h after enrollment; 3) exclusion of patients admitted in the week prior to a crossover; 4) exclusion of patients who transferred between ICUs or remained in the ICU through a crossover; and 5) population restricted to each patient's first ICU admission (\nSupplementary SMART Trauma Data\n).\nWe compared outcomes between the balanced crystalloid and saline groups in the primary study population using the same set of pre-specified baseline covariates in logistic regression modeling for dichotomous outcomes and proportional odds modeling for ordinal and continuous outcomes. Results are presented comparing the balanced crystalloid group to the saline group (referent) with adjustment for covariates. Accordingly, an odds ratio greater than 1 in the setting of an ordinal or continuous variable represents a higher incidence or value of the outcome for patients in the balanced group compared with the saline group. We compared patients\u2019 receipt of hypertonic saline and mannitol over the 14 days after enrollment between the balanced crystalloid and saline groups. We assessed whether baseline plasma sodium, chloride, or bicarbonate concentration modified the effect of study group on in-hospital mortality using tests of interaction in a multivariable logistic regression model.\nOther between-group comparisons were made with the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables. Continuous variables were presented as mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range; categorical variables were presented as frequency and proportion. A two-sided\np\nvalue <0.05 indicated statistical significance, and no adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. All analyses were performed using R version 4.1.1 software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)."

    "Methods": "The study protocol received institutional review board (IRB) approval (Western IRB 1271583). Ethical approval was also provided by individual IRBs at the Penn State College of Medicine (STUDY00003729), SUNY Upstate Medical University (1070727), SUNY Buffalo (#00004347), Vanderbilt University Medical Center (#181814), and the Department of the Army, Regional Health Command-Atlantic (#1510001-1). Written, informed consent was obtained for all participants and written assent was provided by participants <18 years of age.\n\nParticipants\nThis prospective multi-center study included a convenience sample of 251 individuals (age 18\u2009\u00b1\u20097 years). All 251 individuals received a clinical diagnosis of concussion, as defined by the 2016 Concussion in Sport Group criteria.\n1\nParticipants included individuals with sport-related and non-sport-related mechanisms of injury, who were enrolled from emergency departments (ED), sports medicine clinics, urgent care centers, concussion specialty clinics, and outpatient primary care clinics at initial clinical presentation (within 14 days of injury). At enrollment, saliva was collected from each participant via swab, medical/demographic data was collected via survey, concussion symptoms were assessed via the post-concussion symptom scale (PCSS\n18\n), and balance/neurocognitive performance was measured with the ClearEdge Toolkit (Quadrant Biosciences, Syracuse, NY\n19\n,\n20\n). Concussion symptoms were re-assessed \u22653 weeks post-concussion using the PCSS. Participants were enrolled from April 2017 through February 2020 at seven institutions: Adena Health System (Chillicothe, OH;\nn\n=\u200937), Colgate University (Hamilton, NY;\nn\n=\u200942), the United States Army (Fort Benning, GA;\nn\n=\u20096), Penn State College of Medicine (Hershey, PA;\nn\n=\u2009112), State University of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo Jacobs School of Medicine (Buffalo, NY;\nn\n=\u200911), SUNY Upstate Medical University (Syracuse, NY;\nn\n=\u200926), and Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Nashville, TN;\nn\n=\u200917). Exclusion criteria for all participants were primary language other than English, pregnancy, active periodontal disease, neurological disorder (e.g. epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, hydrocephalus), drug or alcohol dependency, upper respiratory infection, having a legally appointed guardian or inability to provide consent/assent because of intellectual disability, Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) \u226412 at the time of initial injury, penetrating brain injury, hospitalization for current concussion, skull fracture, unresolved concussion symptoms, additional concussion within the previous 3 months, or intracranial bleed on imaging (if performed).\n\nDemographic and medical data collection\nParticipant characteristics were collected via survey and administered by research staff in the clinical care setting. Parents assisted children (\u2264 12 years) with survey completion. When possible, survey responses were confirmed through review of the medical record. The following medical and demographic characteristics were collected: age (years), sex (male/female/non-conforming), race (White, Black or African American, Asian, American Indian or Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander), ethnicity (Hispanic or Latinx/not Hispanic), body mass index (BMI) (kg/m\n2\n), chronic medical issues (presence/absence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], anxiety, depression, and chronic headache disorder). The following concussion-related characteristics were collected: number of previous concussions, time since most recent concussion (days), presence/absence of loss of consciousness. For a subset of all participants (\nn\n=\u2009208) 22 symptoms were self-reported on a Likert scale (0\u20136) using the PCSS. Total symptom severity (sum of all Likert scores), and total symptom burden (sum of all symptoms >0) were calculated for each participant. Presence/absence of persistent post-concussion symptoms (PPCS) >3 weeks after initial injury was assessed through self-report on the PCSS (\u2265 5 symptoms), or through electronic medical record review (where available).\n\nBalance and neurocognitive assessment\nBalance was assessed for a portion of participants (\nn\n=\u2009177) using the validated ClearEdge system, as we have previously reported.\n14\nClearEdge measures body sway in three dimensions during eight different stances: two legs eyes open (TLEO), tandem stance eyes open (TSEO), two legs eyes closed (TLEC), tandem stance eyes closed (TSEC), two legs eyes open on a foam pad (TLEOFP), two legs eyes closed on a foam pad (TLECFP), tandem stance eyes open on a foam pad (TSEOFP), and tandem stance eyes closed on a foam pad (TSECFP). A scaled score of 0 indicates poor balance and 100 indicates superior balance. There were 21 participants who were unable to complete balance testing because of orthopedic injury, or extreme postural instability. The remaining participants were unable to complete the assessment because of time constraints in the clinical setting of enrollment. Computerized neurocognitive assessment was performed in the same subset of participants (\nn\n=\u2009177) using the following tests: simple reaction time (SRT1), procedural reaction time (PRT), go/no-go (GNG), and a repeat of simple reaction time (SRT2). This battery is part of the Defense Automated Neurobehavioral Assessment (DANA\n21\n). The four cognitive tests were scored for speed and accuracy using a mean throughput measure of mental efficiency, where higher scores reflect better performance. Individual scores were objectively calculated with computerized software, and overall test battery means were determined for balance and neurocognition.\n\nSalivary RNA assessment\nSaliva swabs (DNA Genotek, Ottawa Canada) were collected from all participants (\nn\n=\u2009251) in a non-fasting state, as previously reported.\n22\nFollowing RNA extraction (miRNeasy Kit; Qiagen, Germantown, MD), RNA quality was assessed (Agilent Bioanalyzer, Illumina, San Diego, CA), sequencing libraries were prepared (TruSeq Stranded Small RNA Kit, Illumina), and sequencing was performed at a depth of 10,000,000, 50 base-pair reads/sample (NextSeq500, Illumina). Fastq files were trimmed using Cutadapt v1.2.1,\n23\naligned to miRBase22 using Bowtie v1.0.0,\n24\nand quantified using a custom bio-informatics architecture (Human Alignment Toolchain [HATCH]). Aligned reads were quantile normalized and each miRNA feature was mean-center scaled (divided by feature standard deviation). The miRNA profile for each sample was reduced to a panel of 22 miRNAs previously shown to differentiate concussed and non-concussed individuals.\n14\nMissing values (1.5 % of survey measures, 0.0% of miRNA measures) were imputed with the singular value decomposition imputation method. Quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) were used to validate directionality and proportion of change for a subset of miRNAs.\n\nStatistical analysis\nSaliva miRNA levels were used to divide the 251 participants into biological clusters with a K-means clustering approach. K-means clustering was selected because it provided optimal internal validity (Davies Bouldin Index), stability (figure of merit), and biological validity (biologic homogeneity) for this data set, when compared with graph-based clustering and model-based clustering.\n25\nThe optimal number of clusters (between 3 and 20) was determined using the elbow method.\n26\nInitial cluster centroids were selected to optimize the distance between clusters (Euclidean distance metric). A maximum of 1000 iterations was used to compute cluster centroids. K-means clustering analyses were performed in Partek Flow (Partek Flow, St. Louis, MO). Levels of the 22 miRNAs were compared among the biological clusters via Kruskal Wallis testing with Holm step-down multiple testing correction. For three miRNA candidates (miR-27a-5p, miR-192-5p, miR-4510), Spearman's correlations were used to repeatability with qPCR, and directionality of change across clusters was visualized using a hierarchical heat map with a Euclidan distance metric. Next, medical and demographic characteristics were compared across groups using analysis of variance (continuous variables) or \u03c7\n2\ntest (nominal variables). Finally, linear regression was used to assess the relationship of cluster group with subjective symptoms (scores on the PCSS) and functional symptoms (balance scores and neurocognitive scores), while controlling for medical factors that displayed between-cluster differences (age, days post-concussion, number of prior concussions). Between-group comparisons were performed using Jamovi v2.2 software.\n27\nFinally, miRNA function was used to explore the physiological characteristics of each cluster. Cluster-specific miRNAs (i.e., miRNAs with 1.5-fold up- or downregulation relative to the mean value for the entire cohort) were identified for each cluster group. High confidence gene targets (microT-CDS score \u22650.95, adjusted\np\nvalue <0.040) were determined for each set of cluster-specific miRNAs in DIANA miRPATH v3.0 online software.\n28\nOver-representation of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways by these target genes (adjusted\np\n<\u20090.05) was determined using a Fisher's exact test with Bonferroni correction."
