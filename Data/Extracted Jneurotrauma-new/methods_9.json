    "Methods": "Patient enrollment\nInstitutional review board approval was obtained prior to study onset. Initial participant recruitment occurred between May 2000 and August 2014 in a neurointensive care unit through the University of Pittsburgh Brain Trauma Research Center. Due to the altered cognitive status of severe TBI patients, informed consent was obtained from the injured individual's legal representative prior to data collection. If a participant's status improved to a level that (s)he could consent, continued participation in the study was contingent upon assent. Following consent, participants were included in the parent study if they met the following criteria: 1) sustained a severe TBI (GCS \u22648); 2) aged 16\u201380 at time of injury; and 3) possessed an indwelling ventriculostomy catheter. Individuals were excluded if they had: 1) penetrating TBI; 2) cardiac and/or respiratory arrest; or 3) a pre-existing neurological deficit, defined as a pre-TBI history of a serious neurological condition (e.g. mental retardation; stroke; dementia) that may affect scoring on the chosen measures (e.g., GCS, GOS) and could confound study findings. Demographic and initial injury severity data were collected from medical records. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected from the indwelling catheter, and blood was collected from an intravenous/intra-arterial catheter; biological samples were stored using methods known to promote DNA stability until extraction.\nA total of 480 individuals were genotyped; however, not all were included in the final analysis for various reasons as summarized below and depicted in\nFigure 2\n. After elimination of those individuals who lacked genotypic data on at least one tSNP and phenotypic data on at least one dependent variable, 463 cases remained. Beyond the aforementioned inclusion criteria from the parent study, the sample was further refined based on two exclusion criteria to address potential confounders. First, 63 samples from non-Caucasian participants were excluded to control for population stratification and differences in allele frequencies across ancestral groups, as reported in public databases (e.g., dbSNP; HapMap). In our sample, there was an insufficient number of participants in any of the non-Caucasian subgroups to warrant a subgroup analysis and allelic frequency differences negated considering all non-Caucasians together as a single subgroup for analysis. Finally, 20 individuals ages 16\u201317 years were excluded because brain development continues during adolescence, which may confound recovery.\n74\nThe final analysis was restricted to 380 participants who had genotype and GCS data at baseline. Importantly, there was attrition in our sample across the 3-, 6-, and 12-month data collection time-points. Specifically, by 3 months 31 participants were lost to follow-up (\nn\n=\u2009349), an additional 3 were lost between the 3 and 6 month assessment (\nn\n=\u2009346), and 20 more participants were lost between the 6 and 12 month assessment (\nn\n=\u2009326). The sample remaining at 12 months was 85.7% of the original 380 participants included at baseline. Missing data was not imputed due to the complexity of TBI and the fact that loss to follow-up may have been associated with change in status.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nFlowchart depicting the inclusion, exclusion, and loss of participants in this sample. There were a total of 480 genotyped participants from the parent study that were screened for inclusion in this study. Of those screened, 380 met the criteria for inclusion in this study. An additional 54 participants were lost to follow-up during the 12 month study (31 before the 3-month follow-up, three before the 6-month follow-up, and 20 before the 12-month follow-up).\n\nGenotyping\nDNA was extracted from CSF using a commercially-available kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) or from blood using a salting out procedure. Selection of tSNPs was based on data from a Caucasian population in HapMap Build 36. To be included, tSNPs were required to have an r\n2\n\u2265 0.80 and a minor allele frequency \u22650.20. A TaqMan\n\u00ae\nsystem (ABI 700) and associated SDS 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was used to genotype each tSNP using allelic discrimination assays obtained from a single commercial supplier (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The assays for three of the tSNPs (rs10108011, rs2461491, and rs2469749) were readily available commercially, while the fourth (rs2443504) was a custom assay. Relevant details of the custom assay include the forward primer sequence (TTGATGCAAACCCGATGAACAAAAA), reverse primer sequence (ACTATTCCTCTCTTTTTCTCTTTGTGATTTGAT), reporter 1 sequence (CTTTTTATCTTTTGTGTATCTAC), and reporter 2 sequence (CTTTTTATCTTTTGTATATCTAC). All genotype assignments were double called in a blinded manner and any discrepancies were rectified using raw data or re-genotyped.\n\nMeasures\nClinical measures employed were overall mortality, admission GCS, and GOS at 3, 6, and 12 months. GCS was dichotomized as GCS 3\u20135 versus GCS 6\u20138. Similarly, GOS was analyzed dichotomously (1\u20132 vs. 3\u20135).\n75\nWhen possible, GOS assessments were completed face-to-face; otherwise, a phone interview was used. Whether face-to-face or by-phone, all interviews were performed by a trained technician supervised by a neuropsychiatric or neurosurgery attending physician. All individuals involved in collecting data were blinded to PPP3CC genotypes.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 23 (Chicago, IL). For each continuous variable, summary statistics were obtained, including: range, mean, standard error of the mean, and standard deviation. Chi-square analysis was used to determine associations for sex with tSNP genotype and measures of functional status (GCS, GOS, mortality). Similarly, univariate associations between tSNP genotype and injury severity assessments (GCS, GOS) were determined by chi-square analysis and, when appropriate, Fisher's exact test. Associations between age with tSNP genotype and GOS at 3-, 6-, and 12- months were determined using logistic regression. In the second phase of analysis, multivariate analysis was used to determine tSNP associations with outcome, while controlling for covariates chosen based on either significant association with GOS (\np\n<\u20090.05; e.g., age, GCS) or clinical relevancy (e.g., sex) based on published literature. Ultimately, a multiple logistic regression model was used to explore associations between genotype and outcome while controlling for age, sex, and GCS score."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nWe recruited two cohorts of subjects, described subsequently, for a study of cognition and mood in retired NFL athletes. All subjects gave informed written consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The Institutional Review Boards of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and the University of Texas at Dallas approved the study protocols and consent forms.\nThirty-two retired NFL athletes were recruited from a local gathering of retired NFL athletes living in the North Texas region, from meetings of the NFL Athletes Association local chapter, through local advertising, and by word of mouth. Six athletes had a Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI) score >11, suggesting significant depressive symptoms, and were excluded from analysis. One subject showed signs that clinically suggested Alzheimer's disease and was removed from our study because of possible complications from a different comorbid pathology. The remaining 25 athletes ranged in age from 41 to 79, (mean\u2009=\u200961.1, SD\u2009=\u200912.2), with education that ranged from 15 to 18 years, (mean\u2009=\u200916.3, SD\u2009=\u20090.78) (\nTable 1\n). Their NFL experience ranged from 2 to 15 years, (mean\u2009=\u20098.92, SD\u2009=\u20093.61). Eighteen were Caucasian and seven were African American. Concussion history was accumulated from self-reports, and were classified using the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Practice Parameter guidelines for grading concussion.\n32\nConcussion severity ranged from brief periods of confusion to loss of consciousness for several hours. Seven of the athletes met clinical criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). All but two of the athletes experienced some degree of concussion while actively participating in the NFL, which ranged from 1 to 12 in any single athlete (mean\u2009=\u20094.04, SD\u2009=\u20093.36). Additional demographic information can be found in\nTable S1\n(see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n).\nTable\n1.\nDemographic Information\nControl\nAthletes\nNumber of subjects\n22\n25\nAge\n59.4 (11.8)\n61.1 (12.2)\nEducation\n16.2 (2.4)\n16.3 (0.78)\nEthnicity (C/AA)\n20/2\n18/7\nOpen in a separate window\nC, Caucasian; AA, African American.\nThe control group consisted of 22 cognitively normal male controls selected from prior aging studies that fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Controls were screened to have no history of known concussion, repetitive exposure to subconcussive brain injuries, participation in college or professional football, mental illness, cognitive complaints, or neurological disorders. Age ranged from 41 to 77 (mean\u2009=\u200959.4, SD\u2009=\u200911.8), with a minimum of 11 years and a maximum of 20 years of education (mean\u2009=\u200916.2, SD\u2009=\u20092.4) (\nTable 1\n). Twenty of the controls were Caucasian, and two were African American. Four were retired, and 18 were employed at the time of the study.\n\nNeuropsychological data\nNeuropsychological assessment included measures of general cognitive ability, attention, language, memory, visuospatial and executive function, and processing speed\n30\nprior to neuroimaging. The standard 60 item BNT\n1\nwas used as a measure of visual confrontation naming. Participants were instructed to indicate the name of each picture as quickly and as accurately as possible. A trained neuropsychological technician or neuropsychologist performed all testing. Normalized T-scores were generated from each subject's raw BNT score, which took into account age, education, sex, and ethnicity.\n33\n\nStatistical analysis of neuropsychological data\nAlthough this article focuses on the BNT, three other neuropsychological assessments (California Verbal Learning Test, Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test, Semantic Object Retrieval Test) were markedly different between athletes and controls in a different subset published elsewhere.\n35\nWe used the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to identify the best set of variables, among the previously mentioned assessments, that would best predict FA at the voxel level across the entire white matter skeleton.\n34\nThe residual noise variance was calculated for each variable combination at the voxel level and subjected to the BIC. The BIC is a model selection criterion, which attempts to prevent overfitting by penalizing complexity. It is a common variable selection method in multiple regression to choose a parsimonious model with high predictive ability. Therefore, variables that contribute little to prediction are effectively removed from the model, and those that are retained contribute more to prediction without exceeding the complexity penalty. The variable combination that produces the lowest BIC comprises the final model for prediction of FA. The variable(s) corresponding with the best model were compared between groups using the Levene's test for equality of variances, whereas means were compared using independent T-tests in the Statistical Package for Social Sciences SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).\n\nImaging data\nDTI data were acquired on a 3 T MRI system, with an acquisition matrix of 128\u2009\u00d7\u2009128, field of view of 224\u2009\u00d7\u2009224\u2009mm, slice thickness of 2\u2009mm and interslice gap of 1\u2009mm. Images were acquired using 30 gradient directions (b\u2009=\u20091000\u2009sec/mm\n2\n) along with one b\n0\nimage.\n\nImage analysis\nPreprocessing included correction for motion and eddy current distortions followed by skull stripping\n35\nusing FSL 4.1.7 (\nwww.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/\n).\n36\nScans were inspected to validate that head movement was <3\u2009mm for all subjects during data acquisition. Tensors were estimated and FA maps created using the MedINRIA software package (\nwww-sop.inria.fr/asclepios/software/MedINRIA/\n). Both FA and MD data were analyzed with tract based spatial statistics (TBSS)\n37\nin FSL, using a mean FA skeleton threshold of 0.2.\nVoxelwise correlations of the entire white matter skeleton with BNT T-scores were performed using the \u201cRandomise\u201d tool in FSL with threshold-free cluster enhancement and correction for multiple comparisons using family-wise error rate in a Monte Carlo 5000 permutation-based approach.\n38\nThis study focuses on only one cognitive domain; however, other tests of cognition were significant as described by Hart and coworkers,\n35\nand we adjusted our\np\nvalue to compensate (Bonferonni correction\np\n<\u20090.02). Age was regressed from the imaging data prior to the execution of Randomise to make the imaging data comparable to the BNT T-scores that were already stratified for age.\nIn addition to the voxelwise analysis of the skeletonized data, we also examined these data in a tractwise manner by isolating the portions of the TBSS-derived skeleton that fell within the boundaries of several white matter tract regions of interest (ROI). All white matter tracts described by Wakana and coworkers\n39\nexcluding the anterior thalamic radiations were included in our study along with the FAT.\n40\nFor a list and graphical depiction of all tracts included in this study see\nSupplementary Figure 1\n. We calculated a mean FA value for each tract by averaging the FA from the skeletal voxels identified by each tract ROI.\n41\n,\n42\nThe age-corrected mean FA values by tract and each subject's BNT T-score were analyzed with a bivariate Pearson correlation using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).\n\nROI creation\nThe boundaries of each ROI used in the tractwise analysis were determined by performing DTI deterministic tractography with the MedINRIA software package and employing a multiple ROI approach appropriate for each tract of interest.\n15\n,\n40\n,\n42\n,\n43\nin 28 cognitively normal college students who were recruited from the University of Texas at Dallas for a study of higher order semantic processing. Tractography was performed in native space and the tracts, as defined in each subject, were transformed into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, combined across subjects and then limited to only those voxels present in a majority of subjects. Because the brain region sampled by an individual voxel may contain fibers from more than one tract, especially in regions where tracts are closely approximated, the resulting tractograms of neighboring tracts may contain overlapping voxels. To avoid using data from the same voxel for more than one tract, we developed an algorithm for assigning such overlapping voxels to one tract or the other (see\nEq. 1\n). For each pair of tracts with overlapping voxels, two values, one for each tract as reference, were calculated for each overlapping voxel. This value would take into account the probability of tract occupancy adjusted for the relative size of both tracts. The voxel was then assigned to the reference tract with the higher value. This value was calculated by taking the proportion of subjects whose tract occupied each overlapping voxel (\na\n), and multiplying it by the log transform of the ratio of the number of voxels in the alternate tract (\nx\n) to the number of voxels in the reference tract (\ny\n). The log transform of the ratio of tract size was necessary to preserve representation of small tracts.\nWe found it necessary to create tract ROIs in the manner described rather than using pre-existing resources such as the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) atlas supplied with FSL for two reasons. First, we found that the ROIs for the anterior cingulum bundle from the JHU atlas aligned poorly with the TBSS skeleton in MNI space, whereas the ROI produced with our method was a much better fit and allowed inclusion of this important tract in our analysis (see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). Second, creating our own ROIs allowed for the flexibility to incorporate projections from the pre-SMA that are not represented in the standard atlases, but can be readily demonstrated by tractography.\n15"

    "Methods": "Ethics, consent, and permissions\nAll methodology was approved by the Cleveland Clinic Foundation Internal Review Board and all participants gave written informed consent for their participation.\n\nProcedure\nDetailed methods of the PFBHS have been listed elsewhere.\n7\nBriefly, professional fighters with a history of either boxing or mixed martial arts fighting were recruited in two cohorts, active and retired. Once screened for their appropriateness for the study, including ability and willingness to undergo an MRI, they were consented and underwent a visit including a structured interview on demographics and fight exposure, cognitive testing using central nervous system (CNS) vital signs, blood draw for genetic analysis, and MRI scan including anatomical and functional images. Cognitive tests are presented as composite scores. Specifically, verbal memory is a combination of immediate recognition and delayed recognition of a 15 item word list, processing speed is a total of number correct on a symbol digit coding task, psychomotor speed combines number correct on coding with the finger tapping score, and reaction time is derived from the Stroop task.\nHere, we address cross-sectional relationships among APoE status, demographic factors (age, education), fight history, cognitive data, and hippocampal caudate and thalamic volumes as assessed using FreeSurfer (\nhttp://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/\n).\n\nReal-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for APoE genotyping\nGenotyping of APoE alleles was performed using real time PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis by the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) Biomarker Core according to standard operating procedures.\n8\u201310\nBriefly, genomic DNA was collected from blood DNA extracted using Qiamp DNA blood maxi kit (Qiagen) and APoE genotyping was performed using Applied Biosystems TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay. The amplification reaction contained 5\n\u03bc\nL genomic DNA, 2.5\u2009U of Taq DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs, Inc, Ipswich, MA), 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009ThermoPol Reaction Buffer (New England Biolabs), 0.3\u2009mmol/L deoxynucleotide (dNTPs), 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and 0.3\n\u03bc\nmol/L of each primer (forward primer: 5\u2032-ACGCGGGCACGGCTGTCCAAGGA-3\u2032; reverse primer: 5\u2032-GCGGGCCCCGGCCTGGTACAC-3\u2032). The assay was run on a Bio-Rad CFX96. Five positive controls for each genotype and one negative control were included in each plate to confirm accurate determination.\n\nStatistical analysis\nMRI images were processed using FreeSurfer. This program results in volumes and cortical thickness of pre-set regions of the entire brain. We were particularly interested in the thalamus and caudate, because these regions had been shown in our earlier research to be related to exposure and cognition,\n6\nand in the hippocampus, given its role in Alzheimer's disease and in older adults with an APoE e4 allele.\nAfter genotype coding, participants were grouped into those with and without APoE e4. Active and retired fighters were studied collectively. One way analysis of variance was used to compare APoE e4-positive and negative groups on key demographic variables including age and education, as well as the number of years fighting at the professional level, which served as a proxy for exposure. Chi-square tests were used to ensure comparability among groups on categorical demographic variables, including race, gender, and type of fighter (e.g., boxer, mixed martial artist, martial artist). One-way analysis of covariance was used to evaluate for group differences on cognitive measures using raw scores as primary dependent variables and group membership as the dependent variable, with any demographic differences entered as covariates. We used raw scores, because different age groups are compared against different normative values for standardized scores, thus confounding our results. Similar analyses were repeated using structural volumes as the dependent variables and total intracranial volume as the only covariate. Alpha levels were adjusted to\np\n<\u20090.01 to account for multiple comparisons.\nTo evaluate the effect of genotype status on the relationships between fighting exposure and cognitive functioning, and exposure and structural volume, several moderated regression models were tested. A total of 10 independent regression models were fit, using the six individual brain structures and the four cognitive domain scores as the primary dependent variable and exposure and genotype status as predictors. Structural models also included intracranial volume and cognitive models included years of education as predictors. To evaluate the moderating effect of genotype status, an interaction term was calculated between the genotype status and the years of fighting, which was then added to each of the models via forward entry."

    "Methods": "The privacy board of the Suburban Hospital and the Combined Neuroscience Institutional Review Board of the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) approved this study. Suburban Hospital is a community hospital with a level 2 trauma center in Bethesda, Maryland. Annual ED volume of the hospital is \u223c40,000 patients/year. Of these, \u223c1500 are trauma patients. Major traumas requiring special treatment are diverted to the regional level 1 trauma centers. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to any research procedures.\n\nPatient population\nThis exploratory investigation was initially designed as a cross-sectional observational pilot study. Over a 9 month period, patients presenting to the ED with a history of acute head trauma were prospectively enrolled to have a research MRI performed within 48\u2009h of injury using the following inclusion criteria: 1) high clinical suspicion of nonpenetrating acute TBI, determined by the ED physician, for which a head CT scan was performed; 2) being \u226518 years of age; 3) interval between the time of injury to enrollment <48\u2009h; 4) capacity to provide informed consent, and 5) Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score \u226513 at initial examination in the ED. Exclusion criteria were: 1) any neurological or psychiatric disorder causing ongoing disability or treatment; 2) any other accompanying injuries needing special treatment, and 3) any contraindication to MRI scanning. All subjects were initially evaluated the ED physician, and then further assessed by the trauma surgeon as appropriate for the level of care necessitated. Only selected cases (positive initial cranial CT or suspicion of spinal injury) were further evaluated by the on-site neurosurgeon, to exclude the need for intervention. At the time of enrollment, a research team carefully assessed every subject to ensure that each patient met inclusion criteria, and verified any exclusion. The level of consciousness according to the GCS, potential amnesia, relevant history, and clinical diagnosis were recorded and captured on standardized case report forms by the research team. After assessment and treatment in the ED, patients were either discharged home or admitted to hospital based on severity of their injuries. Suspected mTBI was classified post-hoc according to previously published diagnostic criteria.\n18\nThe criteria consisted of loss of consciousness (LOC) of <30\u2009min, post-traumatic amnesia of <24\u2009h and an initial GCS score between 13 and 15. Cases with evidence of any trauma-related intracranial abnormality on initial CT scan were defined as having complicated mTBI. De-identified demographic, clinical, and radiological data were extracted for the analysis by a research fellow.\nTo determine whether it was possible to distinguish traumatic from nontraumatic findings on MRI, a comparative group of patients with suspected minor acute stroke were included. The NINDS Stroke Team provided the clinical stroke service and MRI, not CT, was the imaging modality for the initial evaluation of acute stroke. Suspected stroke patients presenting over the same period were retrospectively selected based on age <70, minor symptoms (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] <4), and ineligible for tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) based on time of presentation (to permit postcontrast imaging).\n\nImaging protocol\nNoncontrast CT scan was obtained for clinical purposes for evaluation of head trauma. Images were acquired in the orbitomeatal plane with 5\u2009mm slice thickness from the skull base through the vertex. MRI was performed within 48\u2009h of traumatic injury on a clinical 1.5 T MR scanner (Sigma, General Electric, Milwaukee, WI). The scan protocol whose duration was <30\u2009min was adapted from the acute stroke protocol in routine use (\nTable 1\n). A subset of the sequences performed was analyzed in this study including: pre- and postcontrast fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), T2*-weighted imaging using both conventional GRE and segmented echo planar imaging (EPI) with a longer echo time to increase the sensitivity to susceptibility effects, isotropic diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps derived from the 15 direction b\u2009=\u20091000 diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).\nTable\n1.\nMRI Sequences Used in Analysis\nPrimary contrast mechanism\nSuspected stroke Series name\nSuspected TBI Series name\nNominal duration\nDuration of series used in study\nLocalization and calibration\nLocalizer\nLocalizer\n2:15\n2:15\nDiffusion weighted\nDTI\nDTI\n3:30\n3:30\nT2\n*\nshort TE\nGRE\nGRE\n1:40\n1:40\nT2\n*\nlong TE echo planar\nmsEPI T2\n*\nmsEPI T2\n*\n1:40\n1:40\nT2-FLAIR\nFLAIR\nFLAIR\n2:30\n2:30\nTime-of-flight MRA\nMRA\n\u2026\n2:00\n\u2026\nT2 - weighted\nT2\n\u2026\n2:30\n\u2026\nT1 - anatomical\n\u2026\n3D T1\n5:10\n\u2026\nPerfusion Imaging\nPWI\nPWI\n3:00\n3:00\nT1 - postcontrast\nT1 post\nT1 Post\n2:35\n\u2026\nT2 - FLAIR postcontrast\nFLAIR post\nFLAIR post\n2:30\n2:30\nTotal\n17:05\nOpen in a separate window\nTBI, traumatic brain injury; TE, echo time; FLAIR, fluid attenuated inversion recovery, MRA, magnetic resonance angiography; DTI, diffusion tensor imaging; GRE, gradient-echo; msEPI, multishot echo planar imaging; PWI, perfusion weighted imaging.\nSection orientation parallel to the subcallosal line was assured by acquiring a multiplanar T1-weighted localizer at the beginning of each study. T2*-weighted GRE imaging parameters were: field of view (FOV) 24\u2009cm, repetition time (TR), 800\u2009ms; echo time (TE), 25\u2009ms; flip angle, 30 degrees; acquisition matrix, 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009192; scan time, 2\u2009min.

FLAIR imaging parameters were: TE, 145\u2009ms; TR, 9000\u2009ms; TI, 2200\u2009ms; slice thickness, 3.5\u2009mm; FOV 24\u2009cm; acquisition matrix, 192\u2009\u00d7\u2009128; scan time 5\u2009min (pre- and postcontrast). MRI execution time was defined as the nominal time from the initiation of the series to the next, including overhead from the any \u201cpre-scan,\u201d and is summarized in\nTable 1\n.\n\nClassification of imaging findings\nBlinded to the patient's identity, clinical information, and diagnosis, two readers who are board certified in neuroradiology (D.A.H.; J.A.B.) independently reviewed the images. In the first read, single MR sequences were evaluated for specific findings. The selected series were presented to the raters absent of all other series for review, to avoid potential bias from findings conspicuous on other contrast mechanisms. Image characteristics were reported in a standardized form according to contrast mechanism. On DWI, images were read for: 1) punctate lesion defined as a hyperintense lesion <1\u2009cm; 2) multifocal lesions described as areas of hyperintense lesions distributed throughout the brain; and 3) any hyperintense lesion >1\u2009cm. On T2*-weighted sequences, images were read for: 1) microbleeds defined as punctate areas of hypointensity contiguous in no more than two slices and distributed throughout the brain; 2) linear hypointensities defined as areas of hypointensity contiguous in more than two adjacent slices; 3) intraparenchymal hematoma (> 1\u2009cm); 4) extra-axial blood such as epidural hematoma (EDH) and subdural hematoma (SDH); 5) subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH); and 6) intraventricular hemorrhage. On FLAIR, images were read for: 1) dural enhancement of meninges determined by comparison of pre- and postcontrast FLAIR, and defined as a focal meningeal hyperintensity after injection of contrast on postcontrast sequences; 2) SAH defined as a hyperintense signal in the subarachnoid space on both pre- and postcontrast FLAIR sequences; and 3) presence of edema. When there was a discrepancy in the evaluation of the images, a third rater (S.W.) resolved points of disagreement.\nTo determine whether or not the MRI findings were specific to stroke or TBI, all cases in which at least one MRI sequence was positive were read in a separate session using all sequences. In this session, the rater chose a diagnosis of stroke, TBI, or indeterminate.\nCT scans of trauma patients were interpreted by the local site radiologist for clinical purposes, then over-read by a radiologist and neurologist (R.P.H.B.; M.C.R.) to resolve ambiguities in the classification of findings. Final diagnosis of suspected stroke patients was based on history, clinical examination, and MRI findings at baseline and any inpatient follow-up using all available sequences, as part of the standard clinical evaluation by the NINDS Stroke Team. The clinical diagnosis was classified as: 1) ischemic stroke, 2) transient ischemic attack (TIA) (both imaging positive or negative TIA), or 3) stroke mimic.\n\nOutcome measures\nThe primary outcome measure was the presence of any acute trauma-related brain injury visualized on MRI. The secondary outcome measure was differences in MRI findings between the suspected mTBI and minor stroke population.\n\nStatistical analysis\nValues are expressed as percentages and median (first interquartile to third interquartile) unless otherwise specified. Comparison of the image interpretation between the two readers was assessed using weighted \u03ba coefficient agreement test. Nonparametric Mann\u2013Whitney test was used to test differences between populations. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (Version 15.0.1; SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) for Windows."

SCI subjects were assigned to three different groups referred as: acute (<1 year post-injury, mean\u2009=\u20092.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9 months;\nn\n=\u20097), chronic (\u22651\u201310 years post-injury, mean\u2009=\u20095.5\u2009\u00b1\u20092.7 years,\nn\n=\u200925), and extended-chronic (>10 years post-injury, mean\u2009=\u200919.7\u2009\u00b1\u20096.6 years,\nn\n=\u200913).\nThe group with acute SCI was defined according to previous literature indicating that neurological scores improved progressively and tended to stabilize by around 1 year post-injury.\n17\nIn this group, four subjects were tested as inpatients at Jackson Memorial Hospital and the other three at The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis. The chronic SCI group was defined based on our previous results highlighting that differences in sensory levels detected by the EPT and ISNCSCI sensory examination followed a similar pattern in persons with SCI up to 10 years post-injury.\n9\nBecause in our previous work, two of the individuals with a SCI for more than 10 years showed different responses, the group with extended-chronic SCI included participants with an injury for more than 10 years. Individuals in the chronic and extended-chronic group were tested at The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis. Evidence showed that although differences exist across age in EPT values in control subjects, old females, young females, and young males do not show such differences.\n9\nOur control subjects ranged from 21\u201377 years of age, which was within the age range of SCI subjects included in each SCI group. No differences were found in age between SCI groups and control subjects (acute SCI\u2009=\u200944.3\u2009\u00b1\u200913.3, ranged from 25 to 61 years,\np\n=\u20090.6; chronic SCI\u2009=\u200952.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091 4.4 ranged from 23\u201380 years,\np\n=\u20090.3; extended-chronic SCI\u2009=\u200950.0\u2009\u00b1\u200911.9, ranged from 32\u201373 years,\np\n=\u20090.6). Because previous results also indicated differences in EPTs between older males compared with younger males and older females, we used the corresponding age-matched and gender group to compare our EPT values in persons with SCI and the control group.\n9\n\nEPT\nThe EPT examination was performed using constant current square wave electrical pulses (0.5\u2009ms pulse width duration, 3\u2009Hz stimulation frequency, DS7A, Digitimer Ltd.). Stimuli were delivered to the skin over the ISNCSCI sensory key points in 22 dermatomes between C2 and T4 (\nFig. 1\n) on both sides of the body by using disposable adhesive electrodes. The cathode was positioned over the ISNCSCI sensory key point, and the anode was placed on the ipsilateral arm to the applied stimulus. The stimulus intensity was manually increased in increments of 0.1\u2009mA up to 10\u2009mA. Each subject was given a familiarization trial to recognize the electrical pulses. Subjects were asked to report verbally when the first sensation was felt.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExperimental setup.\nA, B.\nSensory key points by spinal dermatomes reproduced from the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI). ISNCSCI key points in dermatomes from C2\u2013T4 were tested in the study bilaterally in participants with acute (<1 year), chronic (\u22651\u201310 years), and extended-chronic (>10 years) incomplete cervical spinal cord injury.\nThe procedure was repeated three times on each dermatome. The intensity was increased in steps by 0.1\u2009mA, and the time when the stimulus was first perceived was recorded. Then, the intensity was increased two steps above that, and decreased in steps of 0.1\u2009mA until the stimulus was not perceived anymore. The EPT (mA) was calculated as the mean of the intensities when sensation was not perceived in each trial (lowest descending stimulus intensity). The perceived stimulus was described as a light \u201ctapping\u201d or gentle \u201cpulsing\u201d sensation and was not reported as painful by any of the subjects. Subjects were blinded to the amplitude of the stimulus current.\nCumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of EPT values were created for control subjects and SCI participants in dermatomes located above and below the ISNCSCI and EPT sensory level. This function describes the probability that a real-valued random variable\nx\nwith a given probability distribution will be found to have a value less than or equal to\nx\n.\n\nISNCSCI\nSCI subjects participated in a neurological assessment from an ISNCSCI-certified assessor, following the standards by the ISNCSCI guidelines.\n2\nAll ISNCSCI sensory examinations were completed by the same examiner. The ISNCSCI examination involved sensory but not motor assessment. The sensory examination included the pinprick and light touch components from dermatomes C2\u2013T4 on both sides of the body (\nTable 1\n). The ISNCSCI sensory level was defined as the most caudal intact dermatome for both pinprick and light touch sensation. Note that some sensation could be detected below the ISNCSCI sensory level in some of the dermatomes (\nTable 1\n).\n\nData analysis\nIn control subjects, mean EPT values and values 2 standard deviation (SD) above the mean were calculated for each dermatome. In SCI participants, EPTs were analyzed in two ways. As in controls, mean EPT values and values 2 SD above the mean for each dermatome were calculated. An EPT was considered \u201cabnormal\u201d when it was >2 SD of the mean value of an age and sex comparable control group. We also assessed significant deviations of EPT values in SCI participants from the mean results in age and sex comparable controls using Z-scores.\n9\nA Z-score represents the distance between the raw score and the population mean in units of the SD. A negative Z-score is found when the raw score is below the mean and positive when it is above.\nA Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine the effect of GROUP (acute SCI, chronic SCI, extended-chronic SCI, controls) on EPT values. The same test was conducted to examine the effect of DERMATOME (acute above, acute below, chronic above, chronic below, extended-chronic above, extended-chronic below, controls) on EPT values and GROUP on age. Bonferroni\npost hoc\nanalysis was used to test for significant comparisons. Paired\nt\ntests were performed to test the difference between groups and sides as needed.\nZ-scores for the SCI population were computed for each dermatome by using the following formula: (SCI EPT value \u2013 EPT mean value for control subjects)/(SD for control subjects). A Pearson correlation analysis was used to examine the relationship between differences in sensory level detected by the EPT and ISNCSCI sensory level and time post-injury. Significance was set at\np\n<\u20090.05. Group data are presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD in the text."

    "Methods": "SCI and study design\nTwenty-two adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (190\u2013230\u2009g) were used in the study. All experimental procedures involving animals were approved by the University of Louisville Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. On arrival, animals underwent a weeklong acclimatization protocol that involved daily gentling and introduction to the experimental apparatus used for kinematic and behavioral assessments.\nFigure 1\nshows a timeline for the entire experiment, including collection of the primary outcome measures. Rats received a T9 laminectomy followed by a T10 moderately severe spinal cord contusion (25\u2009g/cm, NYU Impactor) as described previously.\n21\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nTimeline for the primary experimental procedures including functional assessments. SCI, spinal cord injury.\nAnimals were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups after the first behavioral locomotor assessment on day 4 post-injury: Acute Stretch (AcS,\nn\n=\u200910), Chronic Stretch (ChS,\nn\n=\u20099), or injury control for muscle histology (\nn\n=\u20093). The stretching protocol was implemented as described previously\n22\nfor the AcS group starting at 4 days post-injury and continuing for 5 weeks and for the ChS group starting at 10 weeks post-injury and continuing for 4 weeks. Stretching in the ChS group was stopped after 4 weeks because of the development of severe contractures in some of those animals and the inability of our PTs to achieve full end ROM during stretching.\nBriefly, the stretching protocol consisted of two 12-min sessions of six static stretches (each held for 1\u2009min at the end ROM) performed bilaterally of major hindlimb muscle groups: ankle flexors and extensors, quadriceps, hamstrings, and hip abductors/adductors (each muscle group received 2\u2009min of stretch per day). There were seven PTs who participated in stretching sessions. Animals were rotated among the PTs such that no animal was stretched twice by the same therapist in any given week. PTs were trained on proper animal handling and hindlimb positioning for each stretch in a pilot study that is not reported. We did not measure the forces applied during stretching; thus, PTs were instructed to closely monitor the limb position and to achieve normal end ROM for each stretch. Stretching was performed 5 days a week (Monday\u2013Friday). After 5 weeks of stretching, the AcS group survived for an additional 13 weeks and the ChS group for 7 weeks.\n\nLocomotor functional assessments\nOverground stepping was assessed using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) Open Field Locomotor Scale\n23\nas described previously. BBB assessments were performed three times per week: Monday am (pre-stretch), Monday pm (>1\u2009h post-stretch), and Friday pm (>1\u2009h post-stretch) during the weeks of stretching and once weekly (Monday am) when stretching ended. During the first 5 weeks, the ChS group served as a behavioral control for the AcS group. The BBB scores of the ChS group plateaued at 4 weeks post-injury, and they served as their own controls.\nIn addition, hindlimb kinematics and gait were assessed using digital video (sagittal and ventral views) acquired while the animals stepped in 2\u2033 (5\u2009cm) of water sufficient to supply approximately 60% body weight support, as described previously.\n24\nWe used a three-segment, two-angle model of the hindlimbs for kinematic analysis with the hip-ankle-toe (HAT) representing ankle and knee excursions and the iliac crest-hip-ankle (IHA) representing hip and knee excursions.\nGait analysis was derived from ventral view videos that allowed accurate identification of paw placement and timing, and each paw placement was determined to be plantar (paw and toes appropriately placed with dorsal surfaces up) or dorsal (with one or more toes curled and/or the paw itself oriented such that dorsal surface was observable in the ventral view). Three indices of gait were determined: the central pattern index (CPI), calculated as the number of correctly patterned plantar and dorsal steps over the total number of steps, the regularity index (RI), calculated as the number of correctly patterned plantar steps over the total number of steps (dorsal and plantar), and the plantar stepping index (PSI), calculated as the number of hindlimb plantar steps over the total number of forelimb steps. Kinematic and gait analyses were performed every other week using MaxTraq & MaxMate software (Innovision Systems Inc., Columbiaville, MI) and custom designed Excel macros.\n21\n,\n22\n\nNocturnal in-cage activity recordings\nOvernight in-cage activity was measured once a week (Thursday) during the weeks of stretching using overhead cameras (Basler, acA645-100\u2009gm) and infrared lights. A 2-cm tracking dot was drawn with a Sharpie pen on the shaved lower back of each animal. The recordings were made using custom software that acquired high-resolution video at 4\u2009Hz for 1\u2009min of every 10 for 12\u2009h. The video recordings were analyzed using MaxTraq software and the distance travelled determined using a custom-designed Excel based add-in program. Discreet movements of the tracking dot that were less than 2.0\u2009cm were not counted, thus removing much of the movement associated with grooming and sleeping.\n\nMagnetically evoked potentials from tail stimulation\nPreviously, it was established that stretching affects both the mechanical properties of muscles and motoneuron excitability\n25\n; 30 sessions of stretching resulted in a temporary reduction in H-reflex amplitude.\n26\nWe thus wanted to determine whether our stretching protocol similarly affects the excitability of the gastrocnemius (GM) motoneuron pool after SCI. Unanaesthetized animals were restrained on a pine board using a cloth stockinette as described previously.\n27\nAfferents in the base of the tail were stimulated using a 25-mm figure-8 magnetic coil attached to a MagStim 200 (MagStim Ltd., Whitland, U.K.); stimuli were delivered at 80% of maximum intensity, sufficient to induce a plateau response but avoid direct muscle/motor axon activation.\n28\nGM muscle responses (EMGs) were recorded bilaterally using 26-gauge needle electrodes.\n22\n,\n27\nEMGs were analyzed for onset latency and peak-to-peak amplitude. The assessments were performed every 4 weeks. During the weeks of stretching, the tail stimulation was performed at least 1\u2009h after the last stretching session for each animal.\n\nHistological procedures\nAnimals were overdosed with a ketamine (50\u2009mg/kg)/xylazine (0.024\u2009mg/kg)/acepromazine (0.005\u2009mg/kg) cocktail and transcardially perfused with phosphate buffer, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).\n29\nThe spinal cord and hindlimb muscles (biceps femoris [BF], GM, and tibialis anterior [TA]) were dissected out, post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight, and cryprotected with 30% sucrose. The fixed spinal cords were carefully examined to confirm the injury level (T10) and 1-cm long pieces containing the injury epicenter were prepared and placed in tissue freezing medium. Transverse sections were cut at 30\u2009\u03bcm and stained for spared white matter using eriochrome cyanine (EC).\n27\nPhotomicrographs were acquired at 4X magnification. Cross-sectional area of compact, darkly stained white matter was traced and measured using ImageJ software (NIH) as described previously.\n16\nMuscles were divided in two at the midbelly, placed in tissue freezing medium, and transverse sections were cut at 18\u2009\u03bcm. Sections were stained with Masson Trichrome for collagen as a marker of tissue fibrosis and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for identification of centralized nuclei as a marker of regenerating muscle fibers. For collagen quantification, two 10X images were taken from midbelly sections in specified areas oriented to consistent vascular landmarks (branches of the posterior tibial artery) in the posteromedial portion of the TA muscle (or to fascia separating the two heads of the GM and BF muscles that were present in all animals. Area (mm\n2\n) of collagen was measured using ImageJ. Manual tracing of 150 random midbelly muscle fibers was performed, per muscle, and cross-sectional area (CSA) was determined using ImageJ. It was previously established that a sample size of 150 fibers is sufficient to accurately estimate the mean muscle fiber CSA.\n30\nMuscle fibers with centralized nuclei were counted from three 40X images and normalized to the total number of muscle fibers analyzed for each animal (reported as a percentage). Histological analysis was performed by a person blinded to the experimental groups.\n\nROM assessment\nAfter 4 weeks of stretching therapy, it was noted that ChS animals had reduced ROM about the hip and knee joints. To confirm this observation, we measured passive ROM around those joints at week 15 post-injury. The animals were restrained as for stretching, and each hindlimb was moved into hip/knee extension/knee flexion until passive resistance was felt. A goniometer was used to measure the joint angles as described previously.\n12\nROM assessment was repeated at week 18 post-SCI when locomotor function had recovered to pre-stretch levels.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented as group means \u00b1 standard deviation. Mixed model repeated measures analysis of variance (RM ANOVA), fixed and random effects, followed by Bonferroni\npost hoc t\ntests were performed on all outcome measures except gait indices. Nonparametric one-sample\nt\ntests were performed to analyze the CPI, PSI, and RI in chronic stretch animals and PSI and RI of the acute stretch group. A binomial proportions nonparametric test was performed to analyze CPI in the acute stretch group. Differences between groups and/or time points were considered statistically significant when\np\n\u2264\u20090.05."

Males (weighing 21.8\u201329.8\u2009g) and females (weighing 16.6\u201321.7\u2009g) were group housed (five in each cage) in separate cages with standard enrichment (cotton nestlets and huts or igloos) until post-injury day (PID) 10, when they were separated into individual cages (also with standard enrichment) for the duration of the study. Individual housing was \u201csemisocial\u201d as the mice could view other mice in the adjacent cages. Food (Harlan Teklad Global Diets 2018, 18% protein) and water were available\nad libitum\n, and the room was on a standard 12:12\u2009h light:dark cycle.

Mice were randomly assigned to receive sham procedures (male,\nn\n=\u200917; female,\nn\n=\u200917), mild CCI (male,\nn\n=\u200916; female,\nn\n=\u200916), or severe CCI (male,\nn\n=\u200917; female,\nn\n=\u200917) as previously described.\n16\n,\n27\nBriefly, mice were anesthetized in a clear induction chamber with 3% isoflurane in 100% oxygen until corneal and pedal reflexes were absent. Anesthesia (1.5% isoflurane) was maintained during procedures via a flow-through nose cone, and body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C. Head hair was clipped, and mice were placed in a stereotaxic device with ear bars and an incisor bar (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL). A high-speed drill was used to perform a 5\u2009mm craniectomy over the left parietal cortex. CCI was delivered by the electromagnetically controlled Impact One device (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). The tip of the impactor (3\u2009mm diameter) was centered over the impact site (2.5\u2009mm posterior to bregma and 1.5\u2009mm left of midline) at a 15 degree angle relative to the sagittal plane, and a mild (5.0\u2009m/sec velocity, 1.0\u2009mm depth) or severe (5.0\u2009m/sec velocity, 2.0\u2009mm depth) cortical contusion was produced. Following the injury, the skin was closed with silk suture and mice were placed into a warm home cage for recovery. Sham-treated animals went through all procedures described except the cortical impact.\n\nOpen field (OF)\nThe OF apparatus (Stoelting) was 40\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u200940\u2009cm with opaque walls and illumination of \u223c175 lux. Each apparatus had an overhead camera connected to a computer with Any-Maze tracking software (Stoelting). Mice were individually placed into the center of the apparatus, and the software recorded movements of the animals for a 20\u2009min session. Measures obtained and analyzed included the total distance traveled, and the distance traveled in the software-defined 20\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u200920\u2009cm center region of the apparatus (expressed as a percentage of the total distance).\nOn the day prior to CCI or sham procedures, each mouse was placed in an OF environment for 20\u2009min for acclimation and baseline measurements. Subsequent sessions were conducted in the mornings on days 1, 10, and 20 following injury or sham procedures.\n\nLight dark box (LDB)\nOn the mornings of days 2 and 21 following CCI or sham treatments, mice were tested in an LDB (Stoelting) for assessment of anxiety. The LDB consisted of a \u201clight\u201d chamber (40\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u200920.5\u2009cm) and a \u201cdark\u201d chamber (24\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u200919\u2009cm), separated by a \u201cdoor\u201d (7\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u20096.6\u2009cm) in the shared wall. The light chamber had clear walls and was illuminated by overhead lights; light level was \u223c320 lux. The dark chamber was enclosed by opaque walls and covered with infrared transparent, dark Plexiglas, and the only light in this chamber was that coming through the door from the light section of the apparatus (\u223c 10 lux when measured 8\u2009cm inside the door). Mice were placed in the center of the light chamber, facing away from the door between the two chambers, and allowed to freely explore the apparatus for 10\u2009min. Infrared lights were positioned around the apparatus to allow recording of mouse activity in the dark chamber by an overhead camera. The camera was linked to a computer with Any-Maze software, which reported measures including time spent in the light and dark chambers and the total distance traveled by each animal.\n\nElevated zero maze (EZM)\nIn the afternoons of days 2 and 21 following CCI or sham procedures, anxiety was assessed in the EZM (Stoelting). The EZM is an annular platform divided into four equal quadrants. Two opposite quadrants were \u201copen\u201d but surrounded by an edge \u223c1\u2009cm high. The remaining two \u201cclosed\u201d quadrants were surrounded by dark, opaque walls 16\u2009cm high. The platform was elevated 49\u2009cm above the floor. Overhead fluorescent lamps provided additional illumination; light levels in the open and closed quadrants were \u223c1600 lux and 200 lux, respectively. Mice were individually placed at a randomly chosen boundary between an open and a closed quadrant, facing the inside of the closed quadrant, and allowed to freely explore the maze for 5\u2009min. A ceiling camera tracked the position of each animal, and Any-Maze software calculated the time spent in the open and closed quadrants and the distance traveled during the test session. Videos were later scored by an observer blinded to sex and injury condition of the animals to assess the numbers of U turns, head dips (HDs) (downward movement of the head toward the floor) and stretch-attenuated postures (SAPs) (elongation of the body with the feet remaining in place).\n\nMarble burying test (MBT)\nThe MBT was employed to measure anxiety and compulsive-like behaviors 7 days following injury. The test took place in the morning, in a dimly lit room (70 lux). A large, clear Plexiglas box (45\u2009cm long\u2009\u00d7\u200924\u2009cm wide\u2009\u00d7\u200922\u2009cm high) was filled to a depth of 5\u2009cm with standard wood shavings. Twelve black glass marbles were placed on the surface of the shavings in a rectangular shape, spaced 6.5\u20139.5\u2009cm apart. Mice were individually placed in the center of the box; the test session was 30\u2009min. At the end of the session, the numbers of marbles buried to at least a two thirds depth was counted by an investigator blinded to the injury status and sex of the mice.\n\nSucrose preference test (SPT)\nFollowing OF testing on PID 10, mice were separated into individual cages. On day 14 following sham or contusion injury, mice were presented with two 20\u2009mL bottles of 1% sucrose in their home cages to acclimate them to the sweet taste of sucrose and to the presence of two bottles. The bottles were spaced \u223c7.5\u2009cm apart and at an equal height above the bedding of the cage. The amount of sucrose consumed was measured on the mornings of days 15 and 16 following injury by weighing the bottles. On day 16, the SPT began whereby each mouse was given one bottle of 1% sucrose and one bottle of filtered tap water. The amounts of sucrose and water consumed by each mouse were measured in grams on the mornings of days 17 and 18 following injury. During the middle of the 48\u2009h test, the positions of the bottles were switched for each animal, to control for any possible side preferences. The sucrose-preference ratio was calculated for the 48\u2009h test as (consumed sucrose\u2009\u00d7\u2009100)/(consumed water + consumed sucrose). Data from two animals (one male sham and one female mild CCI) were excluded because their water bottles were not flowing properly during the test.\n\nPorsolt forced-swim test (FST)\nLearned helplessness/despair was assessed with the Porsolt FST on the morning of day 22 following injury. To ensure equal water temperature for all trials, at least 5 days prior to the test a large water maze tank was filled with tap water and allowed to equilibrate to room temperature (25\u00b0C). The FST chambers (Stoelting) were clear Plexiglas cylinders measuring 42\u2009cm in height and 19\u2009cm in diameter. The chambers were filled to a depth of \u223c25\u2009cm, and mice were individually placed into the cylinders where they remained for 6\u2009min. Following testing, the mice were gently dried with paper towels and placed in a clean cage warmed by a heat lamp. The cylinders were rinsed and fresh water was used for each animal. The sessions were filmed with a standard video camera, and videos were scored offline by an observer blinded to the injury condition and sex of the animals. Videos were imported into Any-Maze software and key presses were used to measure the following behaviors during minutes 2\u20136 of the test: immobility (immobility was defined as the animal floating on the surface of the water, only making minimal movements necessary to remain afloat, typically slow paddling of one foot), climbing (forelimbs making vertical movements against the wall of the cylinder), and swimming (horizontal movement in the chamber).\n\nHistological assessment of injury\nEight mice from each sex and injury group were randomly chosen for lesion volume analysis. Harvesting of tissue and histological analysis of the lesion site was performed as previously described.\n16\nBriefly, on day 23 following CCI or sham procedures, all mice were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were removed and post-fixed in PFA for 24\u2009h, at which time they were cryoprotected in 20% sucrose for \u223c48\u2009h. Brains were blocked identically, frozen in dried ice powder, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until they were serially cut into 30\u2009\u03bcm sections. ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health [NIH], Bethesda, MD)\n28\nwas employed to measure the area of serial sections at 540\u2009\u03bcm intervals. The lesion area for each section was determined by subtracting the area of the hemisphere ipsilateral to the injury site from the area of the hemisphere contralateral to the contusion. The areas for all sections from a mouse were summed, and multiplied by 540\u2009\u03bcm for the lesion volume estimate.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 21; IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY). Variables that were measured at multiple points in time were analyzed with a mixed-design three way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with one repeated measure (day) and two fixed factors (sex and injury status). Wilks' lambda F-statistics resulting from multivariate analyses with measures from each test day as dependent variables are reported. Where significant sex by injury interactions were found, univariate analyses were performed for each sex with injury status as a fixed factor, and Bonferroni-adjusted\nt\ntest values were used to determine differences among injury groups. The adjusted\nt\ntest values were also used to determine differences among injury groups on individual testing days following univariate analyses when day by injury interactions resulted from the mixed-design three way ANOVA. With the exception of the number of HDs in the EZM on day 21 and the total distance traveled in the EZM on day 21, all variables passed the homogeneity of variance test as assessed by Levene's test of equality of variances. After a square root transformation, the number of HDs passed Levene's test, and a two way ANOVA was performed on these values. The homogeneity of variance assumption remained violated for the EZM total distance traveled (day 21) data despite multiple tranformations; a Kruskal\u2013Wallis test on the six sex/injury groups was performed on those data, and followed by a stepwise step-down follow-up test. Effect sizes (Cohen's\nd\n) for all main effects of sex were calculated as\n, where s\npooled\n=\n. Cohen's\nd\nwas also calculated for all main effects of injury; absolute values of the differences between the means of the injury groups were divided by the pooled standard deviations of the relevant injury groups.\nFinally, variability in the behavioral data was compared between the sex and injury groups. Coefficients of variation (CVs) were calculated for each treatment group for each behavioral variable on which an ANOVA was performed; repeated measures such as distance traveled in the OF were averaged across days to yield a single CV for each treatment group for each of those variables. A two way ANOVA (sex\u2009\u00d7\u2009injury) was performed to compare the mean CVs for each treatment group. Additionally, Levene's test for equality of variances was employed to compare the distributions of CVs for each group.\n29\n,\n30\nThe median CV for each group was determined, and a two way ANOVA was performed on the absolute values of the differences between the median CV and the CVs for each behavioral measure.\nResults were considered significant when the\np\nvalue was \u22640.05, and the data in all figures represent the means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the means."

    "Methods": "Study design\nAnalysis of four prospective, observational, longitudinal cohort studies.\n\nSubjects\nWe screened a total of 1105 subjects between 2008 and 2013 across four cohorts and enrolled a total of 591 subjects, 347 of whom completed follow-up 6\u201312 months later at Washington University in Saint Louis (\nFig. 1\n). The first three cohorts were enrolled at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC) after medical evacuation from theater (Study 1\u20133). LRMC is the primary Role 4 evacuation hub for all medically evacuated casualties originating from Iraq and Afghanistan.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nConsort diagram of enrollment. *Subjects disqualified for poor performance on the Test of Memory Malingering and/or substantial artifacts on magnetic resonance imaging, criteria of the study. **Subjects disqualified at follow-up for apparent malingering and/or erratic performance on clinical evaluations. TBI, traumatic brain injury.\nStudy 1 cohort was enrolled from November 2008 to August 2009 and accepted patients 0\u201390 days post-injury. Study 2 cohort was enrolled from September 2010 to March 2011 and accepted patients 0\u201330 days post-injury. Study 3 cohort was enrolled from October 2010 to May 2013 and accepted patients 0\u201330 days post-injury. Study 4 cohort was enrolled at Kandahar Air Field and Camp Leatherneck in Afghanistan from March to September 2012 and accepted patients 0\u20137 days post-injury who remained in theater. Reasons for nonenrollment included contraindications to study procedures (399), refusal to participate (99), inability to follow up (5), interference with medical care (5), and other (6).\nFour groups of subjects were enrolled:\n\u2022\u2002Blast control: subjects with blast exposure but without clinical evidence of resultant TBI\n\u2022\u2002Nonblast control: subjects without blast exposure and without TBI\n\u2022\u2002Blast + impact TBI: subjects with blast-plus-impact concussive TBI.\n\u2022\u2002Nonblast TBI: subjects with nonblast-related concussive TBI (i.e., TBI from mechanisms other than blast)\nInclusion criteria across cohorts for both the blast + impact and nonblast concussive TBI groups were as follows: (1A) a positive screen for TBI at LRMC based on standard US military clinical criteria\n23\nincluding self-report of blast exposure or no-blast mechanism such as blunt trauma resulting in loss of consciousness, amnesia for the event, or change in neurological status, for studies 1\u20133, or (1B) a clinical diagnosis of TBI in Afghanistan based on the criteria from the American Congress of Rehabilitation 1993, for Study 4; (2) TBI from blast or nonblast mechanisms of injury within the specified time of enrollment; (3) US military service member; (4) ability to provide informed consent in person; (5) no contraindications to MRI such as retained metallic fragments; (6) no pre-deployment history of moderate to severe TBI based on Department of Defense (DoD) criteria; (7) no pre-deployment history of major psychiatric disorder; (8) agreement to communicate by telephone or email monthly for 6\u201312 months and then travel to Washington University for in-person follow-up.\nInclusion criteria for the control groups were the same except for a negative diagnosis of TBI. The requirement for in-person informed consent made patients with more severe TBI typically not eligible, and none was enrolled. No intracranial abnormalities were detected on noncontrast head CT. Thus, all TBI subjects met the DoD criteria for uncomplicated \u201cmild\u201d/concussive TBI.\nFor the control groups in the LRMC cohorts who were medically evacuated, gastrointestinal, dermatological, and women's health reasons were the main diagnoses. Orthopedic injuries from noncombat events such as broken bones resulting from recreational sports on time off or work-related accidents also comprised a subset of this population. The control group from Afghanistan mostly included onsite personnel who volunteered to participate in the study. A small number of controls enrolled in Afghanistan also had minor orthopedic injuries from noncombat events that did not require medical evacuation to LRMC. All clinical histories from the controls indicated no current or previous diagnoses of TBI. The blast control groups endorsed previous history of blast exposure but were found not to have had TBI after a clinical evaluation for possible brain injury at LRMC.\nFor the blast TBI groups across all of the cohorts, all available clinical histories indicated blast exposure plus another mechanism of head injury such as a fall, motor vehicle crash, or being struck by a blunt object. None suffered an isolated blast injury. The mechanisms of injury for the nonblast TBI group were primarily falls, motor vehicle crashes, or being struck by a blunt object that did not involve blast exposure. For both the blast and nonblast TBI groups, clinical histories indicated a change in the level of consciousness or loss of consciousness for at most a few minutes and post-traumatic amnesia for less than 24\u2009h.\nAll clinical histories were verified by study personnel taking additional clinical history and reviewing medical records. All screening-based identifications of TBI were confirmed; none that screened positive for TBI were determined not to have had a TBI on further inspection. Initial records of clinical status in TBI subjects using the Military Assessment of Concussion Evaluation (MACE)\n23\nwere reviewed. This brief cognitive test assesses orientation, immediate verbal memory, concentration, and short-term delayed verbal memory.\n\nProtocol\nThe research protocol was approved by the Human Research Protection Office at Washington University, the Institutional Review Board at Brooke Army Medical Center, the Clinical Investigation Regulatory and Human Research Protection Offices of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, and the Department of Defense Central Command Medical Research and Materiel Command Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects in person at the time of enrollment; no surrogate consent was allowed. Competence to provide informed consent was assessed in a standardized fashion based on responses to questions regarding the purpose of the study, expected requirements for participation, and potential risks. Additional written consent was obtained from the subjects at the time of follow-up at Washington University. Active duty military subjects were not paid for participation, although travel expenses to Washington University were covered. Subjects not on active military duty status at the time of follow-up were paid $240 plus travel expenses for participation.\n\nClinical assessments\nOverall clinical outcome was assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOS-E).\n24\n,\n25\nThe GOS-E is scored from 1\u20138: 1\u2009=\u2009dead, 2\u2009=\u2009vegetative, 3\u20134\u2009=\u2009severe disability, 5\u20136\u2009=\u2009moderate disability, 7\u20138\u2009=\u2009good recovery. Moderate disability (GOS-E\u2009=\u20095\u20136) is defined as one or more of the following: (1) inability to work to previous capacity; (2) inability to resume the majority of regular social and leisure activities outside the home; (3) psychological problems that have frequently resulted in ongoing family disruption or disruption of friendships. For subjects with moderate disability, we further subcategorized the disability as related to work, nonwork, or both work and nonwork. Severe disability (GOS-E\u2009=\u20093\u20134) is defined as reduced ability to perform activities of daily living such that supervision is required. Standardized, structured interviews were performed according to published guidelines.\n24\nIn-person clinical evaluations at Washington University included a neurobehavioral assessment, neuropsychological test battery, and psychiatric evaluation. The neurobehavioral assessment involved a structured examination and interview designed for patients with TBI (Neurobehavioral Rating Scale-Revised),\n26\nscored using a previously published five subdomain model.\n27\nThe neuropsychological test battery consisted of the Conner's Continuous Performance Test II,\n28\na computer-based assessment of attention, impulsivity, reaction time, and vigilance; the California Verbal Learning Test II,\n29\nan assessment of verbal declarative memory; the 25 hole grooved pegboard test.\n30\nan assessment of upper extremity motor speed and coordination; a timed 25 foot walk; the Trail Making test,\n31\nan assessment of visual scanning, coordination and mental flexibility; the Controlled Oral Word Association test,\n32\nan assessment of verbal fluency; and the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading,\n33\nan estimate of pre-injury verbal intelligence. A relatively easy forced choice test embedded in the California Verbal Learning Test was used to assess adequacy of effort. Five subjects, all from Study 3, were disqualified for either poor effort or apparent malingering. The psychiatric evaluation included the Clinician-Administered Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Scale (CAPS) for\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,\n4\nth\nedition (\nDSM-IV\n)\n34\nand the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)\n35\nperformed by trained and validated clinicians. The CAPS was scored using standard scoring rules from Blake and colleagues, National Center for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, July 1998 revision.\nThe 6\u201312 month follow-up evaluations involved approximately 5\u2009h of in-person assessments. The standardized neurological examination and interview required approximately 1\u2009h per subject. The psychiatric assessments required approximately 2\u2009h per subject, and the neuropsychological battery required approximately 2\u2009h per subject. Subjects took all medications as prescribed by their clinical providers. All tests were performed between 9 am and 5 pm in private, quiet, well-lighted rooms. All examiners were blinded to other clinical information, although in the course of the interviews, it often became clear whether the subjects were in the TBI or control group based on their endorsements of previous events. All examiners were clinicians who underwent standardized training in administering the assessments.\n\nSafety and data monitoring\nSubjects were assigned a random four-digit code number to protect confidentiality, and all research data were identified by code number only. A board certified psychiatrist (E. Nelson) was immediately available in case the CAPS examination exacerbated PTSD symptoms. No exacerbations necessitating medical intervention occurred, although additional support from study staff was required on several occasions.\nFor clinical evaluations, the principal investigator audited 1 in 10 randomly selected subjects' data sets to ensure that data were scored and entered correctly. These audits revealed only minor discrepancies in scoring criteria that were then corrected across the entire cohort of subjects.\n\nStatistical analyses\nData were analyzed using Statistica 12.0 (Statsoft Inc). The normal distribution of each continuous variable was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. For normally distributed variables, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), and Student\nt\ntests were used to compare groups. For nonnormally distributed variables, Kruskal-Wallis tests and Mann-Whitney U tests were used. We pre-specified the hypothesis that subjects with concussive TBI would have worse outcomes than controls. One-sided tests were used when hypotheses were pre-specified, and two-sided tests were used otherwise. Uncorrected\np\nvalues have been reported, but only considered significant if\np\n<\u20090.05 after Bonferroni or Dunn correction for multiple comparisons.\nAfter Dunn correction for multiple comparisons, there were no significant differences in GOS-E within comparable subgroups of subjects across studies. Therefore, the data were combined into the following three groups for additional analysis: nonblast control, blast control, concussive TBI. For ANCOVA and generalized linear models, there were too few officers (8 total) or women (10 total) for accurate statistical assessment, so the analyses were limited to enlisted men.\nTo determine the number of neuropsychological tests expected to be abnormal by chance, the binomial distribution was used with\np\n=\u20090.02275 for the (\nn\n=\u200913) neuropsychological variables examined. Before this analysis, all neuropsychological variables were confirmed to be statistically independent as is required by the assumptions of this approach. There were no significant differences in the number of subjects with abnormal neuropsychological test performance in two or more neuropsychological assessments between evacuated TBI subjects, nonevacuated TBI subjects, and blast control subjects.\nLogistic regression modeling was used to explore the relationship between a dichotomized measure of clinical outcome (GOS-E) and the demographic and clinical measures collected 6\u201312 months post-injury. For logistic regression, the Statistica 12.0 \u201cgeneralized linear/nonlinear model building\u201d algorithm was used with the selection of the \u201clogit\u201d link function for logistic regression. The algorithm generated a distinct model for each possible subset of demographic data and quantitative measures of specific symptoms and impairments. Models were then ranked by Akaike information criterion,\n36\nwhich penalizes models with larger numbers of parameters to discourage overfitting."

    "Methods": "Animals\nTwo cohorts of adult male rats (Sprague-Dawleys for the first set of studies and Wistar rats for the second study) weighing between 250\u2013275\u2009g were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) and pair-housed in a temperature and humidity controlled animal housing room with a 12\u2009h light/dark cycle. We used Sprague-Dawley rats for neurobehavioral analysis, immunohistochemical analysis, and phosphoprotein expression analysis to stay consistent with (and extend the findings of) our previous study.\n16\nTo further explore the mechanisms involved in neuroprotection, we used Wistar rats exclusively for the electrophysiology studies. Wistar rats tend to show pronounced cortical changes after injury,\n23\nand in parallel studies conducted by our group, they are being used to examine alcohol drinking behaviors after TBI because of their more ease in acquiring alcohol self-administration behavior. Our studies have shown similar neurobehavioral and neuroinflammatory changes following identical protocols of TBI in both strains of rats.\n16\n,\n24\n,\n25\nBoth sets of animals were exposed to identical experimental procedures. Animals had\nad libitum\naccess to water and standard rat chow, and were allowed 1 week to habituate to housing conditions before any experimental procedures. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC; New Orleans, LA) and were in accord with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines.\n\nCraniotomy\nSurgeries were completed as detailed previously.\n24\nBriefly, animals were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (90\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (9\u2009mg/kg) before craniotomy (-2\u2009mm bregma and 3\u2009mm lateral to bregma; over the left sensorimotor cortex). A female Luer-Loc connector was superglued over the craniotomy site and secured with dental cement (Lang Dental Manufacturing, Wheeling, IL). The female Luer-Loc was filled with sterile physiologic saline and capped.\nAfter surgery, animals were allowed to recover for 3 days in single housed cages with\nad libitum\naccess to food and water before randomization to either Sham (craniotomy-only) or TBI groups. Based on the stereotaxic coordinates of the crianotomy center (\u22122\u2009mm caudal and 3\u2009mm lateral), the injured areas will include: body, limb, and barrel (whisker) fields on the primary somatosensory cortex, primary and secondary motor cortical areas, parietal association areas, and to a lesser degree: retrosplenial dysgranular cortex, cingulate cortex, and secondary visual cortex.\n26\n\nTBI via lateral fluid percussion (LFP)\nTBI was produced by LFP as described previously.\n24\nBriefly, rats were anesthetized via inhalant isoflurane (4% induction, 3% maintenance) and placed in a stereotaxic frame (model 900; Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA). The Luer-Loc that was previously attached to the rat skull was connected to the LFP apparatus via pressure tubing. Dropping the mallet on the LFP apparatus from a pre-determined angle (approximately 18 degrees) produced a consistent saline pressure wave that impacted the dura (2 atm pressure for 25\u2009msec) and resulted in a mild TBI.\nThis procedure results in a mild-to-moderate TBI as defined by (1) the pressure of the saline impact (1.5\u20132 atm), (2) the resulting righting reflex and subsequent neurological behavioral scores, and (3) resultant localized inflammation and blood brain barrier permeability (criteria by McIntosh and associates\n27\n).\nSham control animals were subject to the same procedure and connected to the LFP apparatus but did not receive an injury.\nWe measured apnea, respiratory rate, and righting reflex immediately after TBI. TBI caused an average apnea of 10\u201315\u2009sec, a reduction in respiratory rate to approximately 70 breaths per minute (compared with 90\u2013100 for Sham controls), and an average righting reflex of approximately 12\u2009min. All animals were placed back into their individual home cage and continuously monitored for 2\u2009h post-TBI with free access to food and water.\n\nEC degradation inhibition\nJZL184 is a selective inhibitor of MAGL, the enzyme responsible for 2-AG hydrolysis. MAGL inhibition after JZL184 administration is rapid (maximal inhibition achieved within 0.5\u2009h post-treatment) and potent (>80% inhibition of 2-AG hydrolysis activity resulting in a 7\u20139 fold increase in brain 2-AG levels). The half-life of JZL184 is approximately 7\u2009h.\n26\nJZL184 (16\u2009mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally 30\u2009min after TBI (TBI/JZL) in both cohorts of rats. Time-matched TBI and Sham animals received equal volumes of vehicle (0.64\u2009mL of vehicle per kg body weight; TBI/VEH or SHAM/VEH; vehicle injections contained alcohol, emulphor, and saline (1:1:18)). Animals were studied during the 7\u201314 days post-TBI recovery period.\n\nAssessment of neurobehavioral function\nNeurological (neurological severity scores; NSS) and neurobehavioral (neurobehavioral scores; NBS) function were assessed at baseline (1\u2009h before TBI) and at 2\u2009h, 24\u2009h, 72\u2009h, 7 d, 14 d, 21 d, and 30 d post-TBI, as described previously.\n24\nAll animals were exposed to all tasks, trained, and evaluated before TBI using the testing parameters that were adapted from previously published methods of assessing cognition and behavior. Animals were allowed 30\u2009min to habituate to the testing room before assessment. NSS scores range 0\u201325 (least to most impaired) and NBS scores range 0\u201312 (least to most impaired) and were based on the animal's performance on each task.\nNSS evaluates motor function, sensory, reflexes, beam walking, and beam balancing. Pinna, corneal, startle, and righting reflexes were assessed, where a score of 1 indicates impaired reflex and a score of 0 indicates the reflex is intact. Animals were placed on beams of decreasing width (10, 8, 5, and 2.5\u2009cm) to test motor coordination (allowed 60\u2009sec to traverse each beam). In addition, beam balance was assessed where animals were placed on a 1.5-cm\u2013wide beam and given 60\u2009sec to balance. Failure to walk all beams and/or balance for 60\u2009sec resulted in increased NSS total.\nNBS tests sensorimotor, proprioception, exploratory behavior, and novel object recognition. Proprioception was assessed by pushing each animal laterally (lateral pulsion) on each side of its body. Each side was assessed, and failure to resist lateral pulsion on one or both sides increased the NBS total. Exploratory behavior was assessed immediately after the animal's cage top was removed\u2014uninjured animals actively explored the top of the cage and surroundings (lower NBS score) while injured animals tended to avoid exploratory behavior (increased NBS score).\n\nTissue collection\nAfter behavioral tests were completed, animals were euthanized by decapitation under light isoflurane anesthesia. Brains were rapidly dissected and snap frozen in isopentane. The site of injury was isolated using a pre-frozen standard adult rodent brain slicer matrix (Zivic Instruments, Pittsburgh, PA) and divided at midline to separate the ipsilateral (injured) from the contralateral (uninjured) region. Brain tissues were then stored at \u221280\u00b0C for further analyses.\n\nImmunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence\nImmunohistochemistry was performed as described previously.\n24\n,\n25\nBriefly, a subset of animals were perfusion-fixed and brains isolated and sectioned in 40 micron slices at \u221220\no\nC before permeabilization with 0.3% Triton-X 100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30\u2009min. Sections were then blocked at room temperature with blocking buffer (bovine serum albumin, normal donkey serum, Triton-X 100, PBS) for 1\u2009h.\nSections were incubated with rabbit antiglial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP; 1:200; Abcam) for 24\u2009h at 4\u00b0C in a humidification chamber. The next day slides were washed for 15\u2009min (3\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009min in fresh PBS) before secondary antibody incubation with Alexa Fluor 555 donkey antirabbit (1:200; by Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) for 2\u2009h at room temperature in the dark. The slides were dried and coverslipped using mounting media with DAPI (ProLong Gold, Life Technologies Carlsbad, CA). Images were captured at 20x or 4x magnification using a 3\u2009msec exposure time on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The imaging software was NIS Elements (Version 3.22.11, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).\nAs described previously,\n25\ntwo pictures were taken of three sections per brain region per animal (for a total of six uniformly sized pictures per brain region per animal), and five animals were analyzed per group. Images were taken using the same exposure time in the following regions: site of injury, contralateral cortex, ipsilateral corpus callosum, and contralateral corpus callosum. Each image was quantified, and the two quantification values per region per animal were averaged. Five animals were quantified per group and averaged together to obtain a single value for each brain region for each group. Special care was taken not to include any artifact, such as pia or tissue edges, in the images for quantification. Slide selection to determine the site of injury was made based on coordinates (-2\u2009mm bregma) and the rat brain atlas to precisely identify white matter tracts; within each section, the area to be quantified was determined with a standard size box used for each animal and each brain region (listed above).\nQuantification was completed using ImageJ software (NIH Public Domain). Briefly, RGB color images were split into single color channels, and each channel was converted to gray scale. The gray scale image was then converted to a binary image by adjusting the image threshold to highlight only the structures of interest (activated cells). The same threshold used to identify activated cells was used for every subsequent image and brain region. Once the image was in binary, analysis was completed using the ImageJ command analyze \u2192 analyze particles. Output is given as percent positive staining over total image size.\n\nWestern blot\nTo determine whether TBI induced sustained disruption of excitatory signaling and whether JZL184 could attenuate these changes, we examined changes in glutamate receptor subunit GluR1 and levels of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), a marker of neuronal activity. Individual ERK and GluR1 phosphorylation levels in the brain regional homogenates were determined as described previously.\n26\nRegional tissue samples were obtained using 12\u201316 gauge punches from frozen coronal brain slices (0.5\u2009mm thick) obtained by the use of a cryostat.\nTissue samples were homogenized by sonication in lysis buffer (320\u2009mM sucrose, 5\u2009mM HEPES, 1\u2009mM EGTA, 1\u2009mM EDTA, and 1% SDS, with protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails II and III diluted 1:100; Sigma, St Louis, MO), heated at 100\u00b0C for 5\u2009min, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until the determination of protein concentration by a detergent-compatible Lowry method (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Protein samples (15\u2009\u03bcg) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 4\u201315% gradient acrylamide gels by using a Tris/Glycine/SDS buffer system (Bio-Rad), followed by electrophoretic transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ).\nMembranes were blocked overnight in 5% nonfat milk at 4\u00b0C and were then incubated in primary antibody recognizing the dual phosphorylated form of ERK (1:2500, 5% non-fat milk; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) and the protein kinase A (PKA)-phosphorylated AMPA glutamate receptor subunit pGluR1S845 (1:1000; 5% nonfat milk; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA). Membranes were washed and labeled with species-specific peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10 K; Bio-Rad) for 1\u2009h at room temperature.\nAfter chemiluminescence detection (SuperSignal West Pico; Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL), blots were stripped for 20\u2009min at room temperature (Restore; Thermo Scientific) and were reprobed for total protein levels of ERK (1:5000; Cell Signaling) and GluR1 (1:2500; Cell Signaling). Immunoreactivity was quantified by densitometry (ImageJ 1.45S; NIH) under linear exposure conditions. Densitized values were expressed as a percentage of the mean of control values for each gel to normalize data across blots. Individual phosphoprotein levels were normalized to individual total protein levels to generate ERK phosphorylation (pERK)/ERK and GluR1 phosphorylation (pGluR1)/GluR1 ratio values for statistical comparison.\n\nElectrophysiology\nTo further validate whether TBI caused sustained changes in glutamate homeostasis disruptions and whether JZL184 could attenuate these changes, we used electrophysiology to examine spontaneous excitatory activity in the form of miniexcitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSCs). Animals underwent the same experimental procedures described above and were sacrificed by decapitation under deep isoflurane anesthesia 10 days post-TBI. Brains were removed and sliced in an ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM): 125 choline chloride, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 2 MgSO\n4\n, 25 NaHCO\n3\n, 7 dextrose, 0.5 CaCl\n2\n, 7 MgCl\n2\nsaturated with 95% O\n2\n\u20135% CO\n2\n.\nCoronal slices containing somatomotor cortex underlying the site of injury were then transferred to a holding chamber in a water heat bath where the holding/recording solution was kept at 36\u00b0C. The holding/recording solution consisted of (in mM): 125 NaCl, 25 NaHCO\n3\n, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 2.5 KCl, 10 dextrose, 1.25 CaCl\n2\n, 2 MgCl\n2\n, 1.3 Na-ascorbate, and 3 Na-pyruvate. After 30\u2009min, the holding chamber was removed from the heat bath and allowed to rest at room temperature for \u223c45\u2009min before slices were used for electrophysiological recording experiments.\nWhole-cell recordings were performed using borosilicate glass micropipettes (3\u20137\u2009M\u03a9) filled with internal solution containing (in mM): 130 K-gluconate, 10 HEPES, 10 Na\n2\n-phosphocreatine, 4 MgCl\n2\n, 4 Na\n2\n-ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP, 3 ascorbic acid, 0.2 EGTA (pH 7.25, 290\u2013295\u2009mOsm). Recordings were obtained from pyramidal neurons because they are the primary excitatory neurons in the cortex and, because of their location, may be vulnerable to damage and altered signaling by TBI.\nPostsynaptic current was measured while clamping the membrane voltage at \u221270\u2009mV; mEPSCs were detected in current traces, and both frequency and amplitude were calculated to characterize glutamatergic synaptic transmission in cortical brain slices. Changes in the amplitude, kinetics, or frequency of mEPSCs were analyzed to garner information about both pre-synaptic and post-synaptic alterations\n29\nthat may occur as a result of TBI. Electrophysiological recordings were at or near the center of the craniotomy and so were all most likely in the body (shoulder, limb, and trunk) representation of primary somatosensory cortex.\n30\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical differences were determined by either one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or two-way ANOVA with repeated measures using GraphPad Prism 5.0 statistical software (Graphpad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). The Tukey test for one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni test for two-way ANOVA were used for pair-wise multiple comparisons. Statistical significance was set at\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Participants and assessments\nForty-four adult (18\u201360 years old) MVC survivors were recruited from emergency departments (EDs) within 48\u2009h of the accident. The survivors were excluded if they were: pregnant, under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs at the time of the accident, seriously injured (Abbreviated Injury Scale score >2), or had sustained moderate to severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] scores <13, or any abnormality detected with conventional computerized tomography in the ED). All survivors gave written Institutional Review Board approved informed consent. All survivors were alert and oriented upon testing. Survivors completed self-reports in the ED that included the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire,\n48\nas well as information about the MVC. Police traffic reports from the Ohio Department of Public Safety (\nhttps://ext.dps.state.oh.us\n) were used to confirm information on the MVC collected in EDs. Three months after MVC, 24 survivors completed the PTSD Checklist-Stressor Version (PCL) questionnaire with the MVC specified as the index traumatic event.\n49\n,\n50\n\nmTBI diagnosis\nmTBI was diagnosed according to American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine (ACRM) criteria using ED medical records and self-reported symptoms. Using this ED information, individuals who had experienced head impact or acceleration-deceleration during MVC were considered to have sustained mTBI if they had loss of consciousness (LOC) for <30\u2009min, post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) for <24\u2009h, or severe neurological symptoms such as disorientation, dizziness, or headache.\n51\nMVC survivors who did not meet any ACRM criteria served as a non-mTBI control group.\n\nMRI data acquisition\nAll participants completed MRI brain scanning within 2 weeks after MVC, except one participant who was scanned at 20 days. MVC survivors were scanned using a 3 T General Electric Signa HDX MRI scanner. Survivors were positioned in the scanner and their heads were comfortably restrained to reduce movement. Heart rate and respiration were monitored throughout the experiment. fMRI images were acquired with a T2*-weighted, Echo Planar Imaging pulse sequence (single-phase gradient echo pulse sequence, repetition time [TR]\u2009=\u20092000\u2009ms, echo time [TE]\u2009=\u200930\u2009ms, flip angle [FA]\u2009=\u200990 degrees, field of view [FOV]\u2009=\u2009240\u2009mm, matrix\u2009=\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200964, slice thickness\u2009=\u20093.5\u2009mm with no gaps, 34 axial interleaved slices to cover the whole brain, with 225 phases obtained in each run). A high-resolution T1-weighted sMRI image was also obtained with our previously used three dimensional (3D) Volume Inversion Recovery Fast Spoiled Gradient Recall Echo (IR-FSPGR) protocol (TR\u2009=\u20097.9\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u20093\u2009ms, inversion time [TI]\u2009=\u2009650\u2009ms, FOV\u2009=\u200925.6\u2009\u00d7\u200925.6\u2009cm, matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, slice thickness\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm with no gaps, voxel dimensions\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm, 164 contiguous axial slices to cover the whole brain).\n52\nAn additional T1- weighted sMRI scan for intermediate overlaying of fMRI data was obtained using a gradient recall echo (GRE) sequence (2 excitations, TR\u2009=\u2009250\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u20093.6\u2009ms, FA\u2009=\u200990 degrees, FOV\u2009=\u2009240\u2009mm, matrix\u2009=\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200964, slice thickness\u2009=\u20093.5\u2009mm, 34 axial slices to cover the whole brain).\n\nfMRI paradigm\nBlood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) activation patterns associated with implicit emotion processing and regulation were probed using a Shifted-Attention Emotion Appraisal Task (SEAT). The SEAT paradigm is composed of trials that use a gray-scaled compound picture that presents an angry, fearful, or neutral emotional face on a background of an indoor or outdoor scene (\nFig. 1\n). The subjects are cued to judge whether: 1) the face is male or female (Male/Female); 2) the background is of an indoor or outdoor scene (Indoor/Outdoor); or 3) they like or dislike the face (Like/Dislike). These three trial types activate different neural circuits and probe activation that is respectively associated with implicit emotion induction, emotion modulation by attention, or emotion modulation by cognitive appraisal.\n53\n,\n54\nUncompounded pictures of either neutral faces or building scenes were used for control trials. Inter-trial intervals were randomized from 3 to 8\u2009sec. Fourteen trials for each task and 10 control trials were organized into three runs of \u223c7\u2009min/run. The paradigms were created with E-Prime (PST, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA), and run on a Dell workstation. Stimuli were presented with a high resolution fMRI visual goggle presentation system (NordicNeuroLab). A fiberoptic button system (Psychology SoftwareTools, Inc.) was used to record responses. Time series of trials and survivor responses were logged in E-Prime.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nShifted-Attention Emotion Appraisal Task (SEAT): examples of compound pictures with different facial expressions on a background scene.\n\nMulti-plane surface-based integrative analysis of fMRI and sMRI data\nA multi-plane surface-based approach was used to test mTBI effects on cortical activation and thickness in functionally defined cortical regions (\nhttp://homepages.utoledo.edu/xwang/index.html\n).\n47\nImage processing was as follows.\nFirst, high resolution T1-weighted sMRI images were processed in FreeSurfer (version 4.5.1) (\nhttp://www.surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki\n)\n55\nto create a continuous grid of vertex (1\u2009mm\n2\nthickness measures covering each hemisphere). Individual MRI slices were visually inspected and inaccuracies in pial and WM borders were manually corrected if necessary.\nSecond, fMRI data were processed using FEAT from FSL 5.0.2.2 (FMRIB's Software Library,\nwww.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl\n). fMRI images underwent removal of the initial four volumes, skull-striping, slice timing correction, motion correction, and high-pass temporal filtering (128\u2009sec). fMRI data were not smoothed, to ensure spatial accuracy for surface rendering. Individual level activations were calculated with fixed effect in the FMRIB's Improved Linear Model (FILM). Contrasts among different trial types were used to identify brain activation patterns associated with each trial type.\nSubsequently, FLIRT/FSL was used to register each individual's activation maps with high-resolution structural images, using the low-resolution structural image as an intermediate to create initial registration parameters. Initial registration parameters were fine-tuned by rerunning all steps using FLIRT plus FreeSurfer boundary-based corrections for cortical borders. fMRI contrast images were registered to individual high-resolution structural images using optimized registration parameters and then registered to the FreeSufer atlas using the surface-based registration parameters of the individual high-resolution structural images.\nNext, the FreeSurfer surface-based fMRI analysis procedure (\nhttp://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/MultiModal/\n) was independently performed at five planes of thickness in cortex. The five planes were at 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% of cortical thickness from the WM surface. Activation located inside a plane within a subject was normalized to the corresponding plane in the FreeSurfer atlas. The normalized individual activation was then spatially smoothed along the surface using a two-dimensional Gaussian kernel of full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 8\u2009mm. Group comparisons of cortical activation were performed at every vertex using a general linear model (GLM) of two sample\nt\ntests, controlling for age and gender. The maximal\nz\nscores across all five planes of each vertex were summed on the WM surface of the atlas. A cluster-wise correction for multiple comparisons within each hemisphere was performed by means of Z Monte Carlo simulations as implemented in FreeSurfer.\n56\nDifferences were considered significant after a multiple comparison correction with a cluster-wise\np\nvalue <0.05 and a surface area >100\u2009mm\n2\n.\n57\nFinally, cortical thickness and task-related activation were extracted from functionally defined regions of interest (ROIs). Significantly active clusters in each of the five planes in the FreeSurfer template were individualized to the individual spaces. The individualized supra-threshold vertices on any plane were summed to create a surface ROI for the individual. The thickness of vertices in the individual surface ROI was extracted from the subject's thickness map, and a 3D ROI for measures of activation of the region was reconstructed. We projected the individualized supra-threshold vertices on each plane to a ribbon around the plane. The planes of the pial surface and of the WM surface were inwardly projected to 12.5% of cortical thickness. The other three planes were projected to 25% of cortical thickness centered at the plane. Each surface vertex was projected to a 1\u2009mm\n3\nspace in the ribbon, and any 3D 1\u2009mm\n3\nvoxel in the ribbon was included if it was hit by the projection of any of the surface vertices. The hit voxels from all ribbons were merged to create a 3D volume ROI. The 3D volume ROI was registered on a segmentation map of gray matter to remove non-cortical voxels. The task-related activations in each run were represented by the average percent change in contrast of perimeter estimates (COPE) extracted from the 3D volume ROI using FSL/featquery. The extracted COPEs were then averaged across all three runs.\n\nStatistical analysis\nSPSS-21 was used for statistical analyses. Survivor age and the time between the MVC and MRI scan were compared for mTBI and non-mTBI groups using two sample\nt\ntests. Univariate analyses of variance (ANOVA) of PCL scores and mean cortical thickness of ROIs were conducted using mTBI diagnosis as an independent variable, controlling for age and gender. Relationships between activation and PCL were examined with partial correlation analyses, controlling for age and gender. The response times and accuracy of identifying gender of fearful and neutral faces were analyzed in a repeated measure factorial design of emotion by group. Results are reported as mean \u00b1 standard deviation, with\np\n<\u20090.05 considered significant."

    "Methods": "Animals and mild traumatic brain injury procedure\nThe protocol used in this study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Welfare Committee. The guidelines provided in the National Institute of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animal\n22\nwere strictly followed.\nA total of 30 adult male Sprague Dawley rats weighing between 280 and 300\u2009g were used in this study. The animal breakdown for the study was as follows: 12 animals were used for MRI scans paired with histology and 12 animals (6 injured and 6 uninjured) were used for cytokine measurements. Six animals were used as control for histology. TBIs were produced as described previously.\n21\nBriefly, animals were anesthetized with a mixture of 2% isoflurane, air, and oxygen, administered through a Harvard rodent ventilator (Model 683, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) during the entire procedure. The malar process on each side was exposed via infraorbital incisions. The grooves of the brass rods of the coupling arm were positioned on the malar processes. The energy for the frontal impact was applied via a steel ball (\u223c500\u2009g) accelerated by gravity by rolling down from a vertical height of 2.1\u2009m. The path of the rolling ball was directed by a pair of parallel rails (two pieces of 19-mm diameter tubular steel electrical conduit, joined 3\u2009cm apart at their centers by nuts and bolts) bent to resemble the shape of hockey sticks. After injury the infraorbital incisions were sutured and closed. Animals had free access to food and water.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging following mTBI\nAll MRI scans were performed prior to mTBI (baseline) and 72\u2009h after injury. The MRI studies were carried out on a 7T Bruker Biospec 70/30 URS scanner (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). A vendor-supplied birdcage radiofrequency (RF) coil (Bruker) with a 72-mm internal and 112-mm outer diameter was used for transmission. A two-element phased array coil (Bruker) was placed over the head of the animal, which was fixed using ear and mouth bars attached to a PMMA acrylic glass\u00ae (polymethyl-methacrylate) animal bed (Bruker). The animal's vital signs were monitored using a Small Animal Instruments unit (SAI, Stony Brook, NY). It provided readings of the pulse and blood oxygen level via a pulse oximeter (hindpaw clamp), core temperature via a rectal probe, and respiratory movement via a pressure sensor located under the animal. The core temperature was registered and maintained by a feedback-controlled flow of warm air with the SAI module.\nPrior to each study, a cylindrical phantom (2.9\u2009cm o.d.) containing deionized water doped with CuSO4 and NaCl was used to measure the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with the macro Auto_SNR, which is a part of the scanner operating system (Bruker, Billerica, MA). In this method the average signal intensity of an array of 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093 voxels around the brightest voxel was divided by the average of the noise's standard deviation (SD; corners of image) in a single slice using the procedure described elsewhere.\n23\nFor visualizing possible anatomical lesions, images were obtained using the dual echo 2D rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) sequence with the following parameters: number of slices\u2009=\u200985, slice thickness\u2009=\u20090.3\u2009mm, field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u200930\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u2009mm, matrix\u2009=\u2009200\u2009\u00d7\u2009200, in plane resolution 0.15\u2009\u00d7\u20090.15\u2009mm, voxel size 0.00675\u2009mm\n3\n, effective echo times (TEs)\u2009=\u200929\u2009msec and 79\u2009msec, repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u20099245\u2009msec, Hermite pulse, RARE factor\u2009=\u20095, bandwidth\u2009=\u200950\u2009kHz, number of dummy scans\u2009=\u20092, number of averages\u2009=\u20094, fat suppression on. The total scan time was 24\u2009min, 40\u2009sec.\nFor registration and spatial normalization for group analysis, 3D RARE scan matching mostly the geometry of the 2D RARE acquisition was also recorded. The geometric parameters were 0.3\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20090.3\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20090.3\u2009mm voxel size, 30\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u200925.5\u2009mm FOV, and a 100\u2009\u00d7\u2009100\u2009\u00d7\u200985 matrix. The other parameters were TR\u2009=\u20091000\u2009msec, effective TE\u2009=\u200963.7\u2009msec, RARE factor 16, use of fat suppression and saturation slices (\nn\n=\u20096). The acquisition time was 8.5\u2009min.\nThe geometry of the DTI protocol was identical to that of the 3D RARE protocol (0.3-mm isotropic voxel size). The data were acquired with a segmented (two shots) 3D echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence, using an icosahedral encoding scheme with bipolar gradients along 42 encoding directions\n24\n, TE\u2009=\u200924.7\u2009msec, TR\u2009=\u2009350\u2009msec, Hermite excitation RF pulse (pulse width\u2009=\u20092.16\u2009msec, flip angle\u2009=\u200990 degrees), bandwidth\u2009=\u2009247\u2009kHz, number of averages\u2009=\u20091, and partial Fourier transform (FT) acceleration\u2009=\u20091.5. The diffusion parameters were b-value\u2009=\u2009800\u2009sec/mm\n2\n, diffusion gradient duration\u2009=\u20094\u2009msec, diffusion gradient separation\u2009=\u20098.5\u2009msec, and number of repetitions without any diffusion gradient (b\n0\nimages)\u2009=\u20099. Fat suppression and outer volume suppression (\nn\n=\u20096) were activated. The acquisition included double sampling, automatic trajectory measurement, and regridding based on the trajectory. The total scan time was 50\u2009min.\n\nMRI analysis\nDTI analysis was performed as described previously.\n23\n,\n25\nBriefly, following the stripping of extra meningeal tissues the diffusion-weighted images (DWI) were smoothed using the procedure described by Hahn and colleagues.\n26\nInitially voxel-wise analysis was performed to identify possible regions that showed significant group differences in the DTI measures. For this purpose all the DWI volumes were registered to one of the volumes that had the best SNR. The registration was performed using the 3D model 4 (105 parameters) of AIR 5.2\n27\nThe t-maps showing the regions with significant group differences were then generated with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM 8).\n28\nThis was followed by region-of-interest (ROI) analysis over the regions that showed significant differences on the t-maps. The ROI analysis was performed in the native space.\n\nCytokine measurement and histological analysis\nThe expression levels of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were evaluated and measured from the following brain white matter tract regions: splenium (scc), genu (gcc), fimbria (fi), and internal capsule (ic) using Bio-Plex Pro Rat Cytokine, Chemokine, and Growth Factor Assay Kits (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Briefly, samples were homogenized in a lysing solution containing Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma), frozen at \u201370\u00b0C overnight. The samples were then thawed, sonicated, and centrifuged at 4500x\ng\nfor 4\u2009min. The supernatants were collected and total protein concentration was determined using Pierce\u2122 BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific). The following cytokines were assayed: eotaxin, fractalkine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte macrophage (GM-CSF), GRO/KC, interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3), interleukin (IL)-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 (p70), IL-13, IL-17A, IL-18, inducible protein (IP)-10, leptin, LIX, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-1\u03b1), MIP-2, regulated upon activation of normal T-cell expressed and presumably secreted (RANTES), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).\nHistological analyses of mTBI and control brains were performed as described previously.\n23\n,\n25\n,\n29\nBriefly, following theMRI scan, animals were transcardially perfused with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The brains were sectioned at 20\u03bcm thickness and six brain sections/animal were used for staining with each primary antibody: myelin basic protein (MBP, 1:1000; Covance, CA), neurofilament heavy (NF-H, 1:1000; Millipore, Billerica, MA), Iba-1 (1:1000; DAKO), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, 1:1000, DAKO). Primary antibodies were diluted with blocking solution (0.1\u2009M PBS containing 5% goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100). Appropriate secondary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:600 in 0.1\u2009M PBS.\nAll images were captured using a Nikon Eclipse Ni-E microscope (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY). Analysis was performed as described previously.\n23\n,\n25\n,\n29\nBriefly, the exposure times were determined for each antibody in pilot experiments. The threshold levels were set to match those with positive staining and excluded background fluorescence. Image-Pro Plus Software (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Silver Springs, MD) was used to measure the percent areas of fluorescent intensity of the expression of the various antibodies. A circular ROI of 700\u2009\u03bcm size was placed in the regions defined by the DTI analysis and the same ROI size was maintained throughout the experiment. The intensity levels were determined from normal brain sections and the same threshold levels were used on all sections.\n\nNeurobehavioral assessments\nExploratory behavior that included fine motor movements, ambulation, and rearing activities was assessed using Open Field Apparatus (OFA)\n30\nIn this assay animals were placed in the activity chambers for a 25-min testing period, and data were collected using the software provided with OFA (Med Associates, Inc., St. Albans, VT). The OFA acquires data on the animal's movements within the activity chamber by recording the number of photo beams interrupted. The activity can be categorized as fine motor movements, gross movements, and rearing. Baseline monitoring was performed before mTBI and 72\u2009h post-injury prior to MRI scans. This assay was performed at approximately the same time of day for both baseline and 72\u2009h post-injury. Rats were allowed to habituate for 30\u2009min prior to each test. Locomotor activity was collected as ambulatory distance traveled or cumulative time associated with four standard behaviors: ambulatory or vertical movement, resting, and stereotypic behavior, measured as repeated breaking of the same photo beam.\n\nStatistical analysis\nComparison between injured and baseline measures for MRI and neurobehavioral assessments were performed using a paired\nt\ntest. Cytokine, chemokine, and growth factor measures and histological measures were compared using unpaired\nt\ntest. Pearson's correlation coefficients between MRI measures, cytokine measurements, histological results, and behavioral results were calculated. The data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA)."

    "Methods": "Participants\nThe study used a prospective, longitudinal, concurrent cohort research design to examine long-term outcomes in adolescents following TBI or OI sustained during early childhood. The original cohort included children who had sustained TBI or OI between the ages of 3 and 7 years. Children and their families were recruited within 3 months post-injury, and were assessed 6, 12, and 18 months post-injury.\n53\u201356\nA follow-up study 3.5 years post-injury was also conducted to assess long-term outcomes.\n18\nThe present extended follow-up study assessed long-term neuropsychological and adaptive outcomes of these children an average of 6.9 (\u00b1 1.10) years post-injury.\nChildren were recruited from inpatient admissions between 2003 and 2006 at three Ohio children's hospitals and one Ohio general hospital, all with level 1 trauma centers. The OI group was included to provide a comparison group who had similar effects of pre-injury risk exposure and the experience of hospitalization for a traumatic injury. General eligibility criteria included age of injury between 36 and 84 months at the time of injury, and English as the primary language in the home. Children with developmental, intellectual, or neurological disorders prior to injury, or whose injuries resulted from child abuse as documented by medical record or self-report, were excluded. Children in the TBI group had a complicated mild, moderate, or severe TBI through a blunt head trauma that required overnight hospitalization. Complicated mild to moderate TBI (henceforth referred to as \u201cmoderate TBI\u201d) was defined as a Glasgow Coma Scale\n57\n(GCS) score of 9\u201312 with or without abnormal neuroimaging (moderate TBI) or a higher GCS score with abnormal neuroimaging as defined by an intracranial or parenchymal injury or depressed skull fracture (complicated mild TBI). Severe TBI was defined as one resulting in a GCS score \u22648. The GCS score assigned to the child was the lowest one recorded post-resuscitation. Eligibility in the OI group included a documented bone fracture (excluding skull fracture) that required overnight hospitalization, and the absence of any evidence of loss of consciousness or other findings suggesting the presence of a brain injury or head trauma.\nOf the 217 participants eligible for the follow-up assessment, we successfully re-established contact with 163 participants (75%), of whom 17 (10%) declined to participate because they were too busy or the child was no longer interested in taking part. Seventy-two children with OI and 58 children with TBI completed the follow-up assessment. Participants included 16 of 23 children with severe TBI (69.6%) and 42 of 64 children with moderate TBI (65.6%). Participants did not differ significantly (\np\n<\u20090.05) from children who did not complete follow-up with respect to injury type, sex, race, socioeconomic status (SES), or child intelligence quotient (IQ) at baseline. Within the follow-up sample, the TBI and OI groups did not differ significantly in age at injury, age at test, sex, race, median family income, or highest maternal educational attainment (see\nTable 1\n).\nTable\n1.\nParticipant Characteristics by Injury Group\nOI (\nn\n=\u200972)\nModerate TBI (\nn\n=\u200942)\nSevere TBI (\nn\n=\u200916)\nSignificant differences,\np\n< 0.05\nGender,\nn\n(% male)\nns\nMale\n38 (52.8)\n25 (59.5)\n10 (62.5)\nRace,\nn\n(%)\nns\nWhite\n55 (76.4)\n32 (76.2)\n10 (62.5)\nNon-white\n17 (23.6)\n10 (23.8)\n6 (37.5)\nAge at injury in years, mean (SD)\n5.10 (1.08)\n5.19 (1.21)\n5.04 (0.98)\nns\nAge at test\n11.91 (1.08)\n12.00 (1.07)\n12.17 (1.52)\nns\nMedian family income, mean (SD)\na\n$59,917 (21,128)\n$61,406 (24,521)\n$55,957 (18,191)\nns\nHighest maternal educational attainment,\nn\n(%)\nns\n< high school\n5 (6.9)\n5 (11.9)\n3 (18.8)\n\u2265 high school\n67 (93.1)\n37 (88.1)\n13 (81.2)\nGlasgow Coma Scale\n\u2013\n13.40 (2.18)\n4.00 (1.90)\nSev < Mod\nOpen in a separate window\na\nMissing median family income for one participant with severe TBI.\nns, non-significant; OI, orthopedic injury; TBI, traumatic brain injury.\n\nProcedure\nThe study was approved by the institutional review boards at each participating site. Informed consent was obtained from the families before data collection. Children completed a structured neuropsychological battery for the purpose of assessing verbal skills, verbal learning, and several executive functions, including fluid reasoning, processing speed, inhibitory control, working memory, cognitive flexibility, verbal fluency, and problem-solving skills. Simultaneously, the primary caregiver of each child participated in a structured interview, which assessed adaptive functioning.\n\nMeasures\nVerbal skills\nThe Vocabulary subtest of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence\n58\n(WASI) assessed verbal knowledge based on the child's ability to provide word definitions. The Pragmatic Judgment test from the Comprehensive Assessment of Spoken Language\n59\n(CASL) assessed knowledge and use of pragmatic language rules by asking the child to formulate contextually appropriate verbal responses to pictured social scenarios.\nVerbal learning\nVerbal learning was assessed using the Verbal Paired Associates (VPA) from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised\n60\nas modified for children by Gonzalez, Anderson, Wood, Mitchell, and Harvey.\n61\nIn this test, the examiner read eight word pairs (four easy word pairs and four hard word pairs) to the child and then administered three recall trials. On each recall trial, the child attempted to recall the words paired with the ones read by the examiner.\nFluid reasoning\nFluid reasoning was assessed using the WASI Matrix Reasoning subtest (WASI MR),\n58\nwhich requires the child to select visual stimuli to complete a visual matrix based on their similarity with other stimuli in the matrix.\nAttention, executive functions, and processing speed\nThree subtests of the Test of Everyday Attention for Children\n62\n(TEA-Ch) were used to measure different aspects of attention and executive functioning. The Walk/Don't Walk subtest assesses inhibitory control by requiring participants to mark footprints on a path in response to a \u201cgo\u201d tone and inhibit marking in response to a \u201cstop\u201d tone. In Code Transmission, which assesses working memory, participants listen to a series of single digit numbers while attempting to recall the numbers immediately preceding two consecutive \u201c5s\u201d. The Creature Counting subtest assesses cognitive flexibility by requiring participants to count a series of creatures in either forward or backward order according to up or down cues.\nThe Letter Fluency condition of the Verbal Fluency test from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System\n63\n(D-KEFS) was administered to measure verbal fluency. Over three trials, participants are asked to say as many words beginning with a designated letter as possible in 60\u2009sec.\nThe Tower of London-Second Edition\n64\n(TOL) was given to assess visual-motor planning and problem-solving skills. In this task, participants are asked to move beads on their tower board to match the layout of the examiner's board by making the fewest number of moves possible. Performance was measured by the Total Correct (TC) score, defined as the number of items the participant completed without making extra moves.\nProcessing speed was assessed by the Processing Speed Index (PSI) of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition\n65\n(WISC-IV). PSI is a composite of the two timed subtests: Coding, which requires copying of symbols that are paired with numbers, and Symbol Search, which involves visual search for geometric symbols to match target symbols.\nAdaptive functioning\nAdaptive functioning was assessed by the Child and Adolescent Functional Assessment Scale\n66\n(CAFAS). The CAFAS is a structured caregiver interview designed to obtain information on functioning in eight domains: School, Home, Community, Behavior Toward Others, Moods/Emotions, Self-Harmful Behaviors, Substance Abuse, and Thinking. Functioning in each domain is rated on an ordinal scale ranging from 0 (unimpaired) to 30 (severe impairment) in 10 point increments. A total score is created by summing domain scores (range: 0\u2013240), with scores \u226450 considered to be \u201cunimpaired\u201d and those >50 considered to be \u201cimpaired.\u201d The CAFAS predicts service utilization better than either psychiatric diagnoses or standardized checklists,\n67\n,\n68\nis used widely to assess changes in clinical outcomes for youth receiving mental health services,\n69\nand has established validity and excellent inter-rater reliability ranging from 0.74 to 0.99.\n70\nThe CAFAS was administered by two researchers with advanced degrees in psychology or counseling who were certified as CAFAS trainers. Additional raters were trained to achieve inter-rater reliability >80%, as recommended by the creator of the CAFAS.\n71\nRaters were unaware of the severity or nature of the child's injury. Ten percent of interviews were taped and jointly rated yielding an overall inter-rater reliability of 98.7%. The CAFAS total score was used as the adaptive functioning outcome measure.\n\nStatistical analysis\nProfile analysis\nLong-term differences in neuropsychological outcomes between and among participants who sustained TBI or OI were analyzed using a profile analysis. Profile analysis is a statistical technique for examining differences among groups on a set of outcome variables.\n72\n,\n73\nThree primary questions were addressed:\n1.\u2002Level\u2014Do some groups have higher overall mean scores when averaged across neuropsychological measures than other groups (main effect of group)?\n2.\u2002Flatness\u2014Are scores on some neuropsychological measures higher or lower than scores on other measures, averaged across groups (main effect of measure)?\n3.\u2002Shape\u2014Does the pattern of scores across neuropsychological measures differ between groups (interaction of group \u00d7 measure)?\nScores on each neuropsychological measure were converted to\nz\nscores based on the mean and SD of the OI group so that all scores were of the same metric to facilitate comparison across scores. The profile analysis was conducted as a mixed repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with scores on each of the neuropsychological measures treated as within-subjects measures and injury group (severe TBI, moderate TBI, OI) as a between-subjects variable. Covariates included time since injury and SES (defined by averaging sample\nz\nscores for maternal education and median income).\n53\nFollow-up post-hoc tests compared 1) groups on each neuropsychological measure to determine which measures differentiated the groups; and 2) the mean on each neuropsychological measure to the average of the remaining measures within each group to determine areas of strengths or weaknesses within each group. Post-hoc comparisons were tested at an \u03b1 of\np\n<\u20090.05.\nMediation analysis\nFirst, differences in long-term adaptive functioning between groups, previously reported by Wade and coworkers,\n26\nwere confirmed using ANCOVA, controlling for time since injury and SES. These analyses were repeated here because we combined the complicated mild and moderate TBI groups, whereas our previous report examined those groups separately. Next, the neuropsychological skills that were significantly impaired in children with TBI were examined as mediators of the effect of TBI on adaptive functioning. We employed a multiple mediator model using ordinary least squares path analysis to determine the relative contributions to adaptive functioning accounted for by group and each neuropsychological measure entered in the model.\n74\nThis approach allows for the simultaneous inclusion of multiple mediators while testing the individual effects of each potential mediator after controlling for the others. In addition, predictors are permitted to be categorical and covariates can be included. Group was first entered as an independent variable, coded as two dichotomous dummy variables (severe TBI vs. OI; moderate TBI vs. OI). Neuropsychological test scores that showed significant group differences based on the profile analysis were then entered simultaneously as potential mediators of the group effects on adaptive functioning. Time since injury and SES were included as covariates. Unstandardized path coefficients (betas) were provided for each individual path of the model, scaled according to the measurement of variables in each path. The procedure provides tests of direct, indirect, and total effects (i.e., combined direct and indirect effects). To compute one tailed tests of mediation effects, we used 90% bias-corrected confidence intervals (CIs) based on 10,000 bootstrap samples. Evidence for significant mediation is provided when the effect is in the predicted direction and the CI for the indirect effect does not contain zero."

Diffusion-weighted data were acquired using a two-dimensional single-shot EPI sequence (TR\u2009=\u200910,500\u2009msec; TE\u2009=\u200999\u2009msec; flip angle\u2009=\u200990 degrees; spatial resolution\u2009=\u20092.2\u2009\u00d7\u20092.2\u2009mm\n2\n; slice thickness\u2009=\u20093\u2009mm; slices\u2009=\u200954; 10 b\u2009=\u20090 volumes; 15 diffusion directions with b\u2009=\u20091000/2000\u2009sec/mm\n2\neach). The additional b value of 2000 provided for computation of DKI metrics.\nPre-processing of diffusion tensor images was performed using FMRIB Software Library.\n32\nAll DKI-derived and WMM metrics were calculated using the Diffusion Kurtosis Estimator (DKE).\n33\nImages were corrected for distortion by normalizing the B0 image to the T1 image and subsequently applying the transform to the DKE output images. These scalar maps were then normalized to MNI space based on parameters from an SPM8 normalization of the corresponding T1-weighted structural images. WMM metrics were masked to only allow white matter voxels with fractional anisotropy (FA) above 0.4, in accordance with the model assumptions.\n34\nDKI-derived metrics were masked for whole\u2013brain, white matter, and gray matter for separate analysis. All images were visually inspected to ensure quality of processing procedures. Delta maps (post-season minus pre-season), were computed for each DKI and WMM metric. The group mean and standard deviation of the delta maps were used to calculate voxel-wise Z-scores thresholded at \u00b12 SD.\n11\nThis provides a single number representing the total number of abnormal voxels for each subject and each scalar metric to be used in the regression analysis.\n\nComparison of biomechanics and imaging data\nLinear regression analyses were performed to study the relationship between cumulative exposure metrics and DKI-derived and WMM metrics using JMP (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Secondary analyses with RWE\nLinear\nand RWE\nRotational\n, and DKI-derived and WMM measures also were performed to better characterize any associations. In the primary analysis, the number of abnormal MK voxels was used as a dependent variable. A log transformation was applied in order to satisfy assumptions of normality. Age at pre-season, body mass index (BMI), and time between scans were used as covariates. No outliers were identified in any linear regression performed based on the Cook's distance of each point.\nNo corrections were made for multiple comparisons, as our primary hypothesis centered on the relationship between RWE and MK.\n\nComparison of cognitive testing and imaging data\nThe delta (post- season minus pre-season) of each ImPACT outcome measure also was computed (Verbal Memory, Visual Memory, Visual Motor [Processing Speed], and Reaction Time). The delta scores were then individually, compared with the number of abnormal DKI voxels using the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient."

    "Methods": "Between December 2009 and March 2011, we collected consecutive electronic medical record (EMR) data for 276 U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) personnel who were referred for an initial evaluation for a suspected mTBI within 1 week to 3 months of injury. An mTBI was defined as a head injury with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13\u201315 with reported symptoms and/or observed signs or impairment related to the injury. We de-limited our sample to less than 3 months post-injury, as beyond this time period represents diagnostic criteria for post-concussion syndrome (PCS).\n\nMedical personnel from USASOC headquarters organized and aggregated de-identified data for the study from existing EMRs. Data obtained included demographic data (age, sex, total months deployed, and total years of military service) and data on mTBI events to include number and type (blast, blunt, combination). Only medically-diagnosed previous mTBIs that occurred during military service and appeared in the EMR were included. Additionally, PTS symptom data and mTBI symptom data were obtained from PTSD Checklist (PCL) and Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS) documentation found in EMRs. Data were collected during the study period from consecutive patients treated in deployed (i.e., Afghanistan, Iraq) and training (i.e., Fort Benning, Georgia; Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Fort Lewis, Washington) locations. The study was approved by the institutional review boards at the University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Womack Army Medical Center, North Carolina using an exempt de-identified medical records protocol.\n\nThe PCL assesses self-reported PTS symptoms. The PCL encompasses 17 items and requires individuals to indicate on a scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely) how much each item bothered them during the past month. The PCL yields a PTSD symptom score that ranges from 17\u201385. Clinical PTSD cut-offs for the PCL were set at 28 or higher per current guidelines for recent veterans of combat in Afghanistan and Iraq.25,31\n\nThe PCSS assesses mTBI symptoms. The PCSS contains 22 self-report mTBI symptoms (e.g., headache, fogginess, dizziness) rated on a 0- (none) to 6- (severe) point Likert scale. The total PCSS score ranges from 0\u2013132.\n\nChi-square and independent Mann-WhitneyUtests were used to assess differences between groups on demographic variables. A logistic regression was performed using the enter method for multiple independent variables that predict PTS. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with area under the curve (AUC) analysis was used to determine the diagnostic utility of pre-morbid and post-injury variables for PTS. All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 22."

    "Methods": "Patients\nBetween 2010 and 2012, pre-season (baseline) PBMC samples were collected from 253 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division III contact sport athletes at two universities in Rochester, New York, and then banked. Contact sports included basketball, football, ice hockey, lacrosse and soccer. Both males and females ages 18 and older were invited to participate, and there was no restriction on race or ethnicity. Individuals unable to speak and read English or Spanish, due to availability of Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) in only these languages, were excluded. Additional exclusion criteria included use of drugs or alcohol on the day of consent and baselining, subjects who were pregnant, and history of TBI within 2 weeks prior to baseline. Regarding the latter, history of TBI >2 weeks prior to baseline was documented. These athletes were followed prospectively for the development of an SRC, which was defined as an injury witnessed by an on-field coach or certified athletic trainer and meeting the definition of concussion as defined by the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 2.\n13\nIn brief, this tool provides a structured framework for evaluating 22 post-concussive symptoms, as well as orientation, memory, recall, balance, and gait. Deficiencies in any of these areas were used to confirm suspicion of concussion. In athletes with an SRC, a second PBMC sample was obtained within 6\u2009h of injury (acute sample) and a third PBMC sample was obtained at 7 days post-injury (sub-acute sample).\nBecause physical exertion alone can potentially produce changes in gene expression,\n14\na comparison of gene changes before and after SRC potentially identifies genes not only related to SRC, but also to physical exertion. In other words, immediately after a concussion, gene expression changes reflect both brain injury and physical exertion. In order to isolate the effects of brain injury alone on gene expression changes, the effects of physical exertion must be measured and removed. In order to measure the effects of physical exertion on post-SRC gene changes, a non-injured control group was examined. Non-injured athlete controls were identified at the time of each SRC. Athletes who supplied a baseline pre-season PBMC sample were eligible to serve as controls when one of their teammates suffered an SRC. Controls were matched to the concussed athlete for gender, team, and sport. A further eligibility requirement for controls was that they must have provided the baseline pre-season PBMC sample in the same month and year as the concussed athlete, thus controlling for the time interval between baseline and injury.\nBoth the concussed athlete and the non-injured teammate control athlete underwent phlebotomy for PBMC sampling at the same time acutely (i.e. within 6\u2009h) post injury. The concussed athlete, but not the uninjured teammate control, underwent repeat phlebotomy at the sub-acute time-point. Because prior studies have demonstrated the stability of gene transcription profiles among healthy adults sampled at intervals ranging from 1 week\n15\nto several months,\n16\nit was assumed that the mRNA expression among uninjured control athletes would not change significantly over the 6 days spanning the acute-to-sub-acute time period. Unlike the injured athletes, who ceased all physical exertion after concussion, there was no change in the exertional activities of controls between the acute and subacute time-points. The institutional review boards at University of Rochester and Rochester Institute of Technology approved this protocol; written informed consent was obtained from all study participants prior to subject participation.\n\nClinical outcome after SRC\nClinical outcome after SRC was determined by changes in cognitive performance, post-concussive symptoms, and postural stability, according to the recommendations of the 3rd International Conference on Concussion in Sport.\n17\nAll participating athletes underwent baseline, pre-season determination of cognition and postural stability with ImPACT and the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS), respectively. ImPACT and BESS testing were repeated in all subjects 7 days post-injury. ImPACT is a proprietary computer program that measures verbal memory, visual memory, reaction time, and visuomotor speed.\n18\nImPACT also includes a post-concussive symptom inventory. Normal day-to-day variation (termed \u201creliable change\u201d) has been determined for each of these cognitive domains: verbal memory, 8.75 points; visual memory, 13.55 points; visuomotor speed, 4.98 points; post-concussion symptom score, 9.18 points; and reaction time, 0.06\u2009sec.\n19\nA significant change in a specific cognitive domain was thus defined as change exceeding the reliable change for that domain. BESS requires the athlete to stand in three different stances (double leg, single leg, and in tandem) for 20\u2009sec with eyes closed. Each stance is performed on a firm surface and on a 10-cm thick foam pad. The BESS score is calculated by adding 1 error point for each performance error, with a maximum of 10 errors per stance.\n20\nUnlike ImPACT, there are no accepted reliable change values for BESS.\n\nPBMC and RNA isolation\nPBMCs were isolated within 1\u2009h of venous blood collection following the protocol described in detail elsewhere.\n21\nIsolated PBMC pellets were suspended in complete RPMI-10 medium and moved to storage in a \u221280\u00b0C freezer, after which they were stored at \u2212190\u00b0C until analysis. Total RNA was isolated from PBMCs using TRIzol\n\u00ae\nPlus RNA Purification Kits (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), and was treated with DNase I-Amplification Grade Kits (Life Technologies). The purity and concentration of RNA samples were verified using a NanoDrop DN-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE). RNA integrity was determined on an Agilent bioanalyzer 2100 using the RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent, Sana Clara, CA). The quality of mRNA was evaluated in each sample. Samples with an RNA integrity number (RIN) less than 7.0 were excluded from analysis.\n\nMicroarray\nUsing the GeneChip 3\u2032 IVT Expression kit, each RNA (100\u2009ng) sample was reverse transcribed, converted to biotinylated complementary RNA, and hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays (Affymetrix Inc, Santa Clara, CA), which contain 54,675 probesets representing over 38,500 specific human genes. After staining with streptavidin-phycoerythrin and thorough washing, the raw data were obtained by laser scanning imaging.\n\nStatistical analysis\nDemographic variables were compared in concussed athletes and uninjured teammate controls using Student's\nt\n-test for age, and Fisher's exact test for gender, race, and sport. Clinically significant changes in cognitive function were determined by the percentage of athletes in each of the five cognitive domains displaying changes not exceeding reliable change. In addition, the mean score for each domain pre-injury was compared with the score post-injury using a paired\nt\n-test. Changes in postural stability were determined by comparing the mean score for each stance preinjury to the score post-injury using a paired t-test. Statistical significance was defined as a\np\nvalue of less than or equal to 0.05.\nPartek Genomics Suite software, version 6.6 (Partek Inc, St. Louis, MO), was utilized for all analyses performed on microarray data. Interrogating probes were imported, and corrections for background signal were applied using the robust multi-array average method, with additional corrections applied for the GC-content of probes. The probesets were standardized using quantile normalization, and expression levels of each probe underwent log-2 transformation to normalize data distributions. Parameters for identifying differentially expressed genes over time (i.e., within-subject comparison) were then identified using analyses of variance of each probe set's expression level as a function of time-point (baseline, acute, or sub-acute), while controlling for gender and race as covariates. Restricted maximum likelihood method was employed to fit the fixed and random effects of the design separately. In order to estimate the contribution of physical exertion to post-SRC gene changes, the same pre-post gene expression comparisons were planned among uninjured teammate controls athletes. Significant gene expression changes were defined as those increasing or decreasing by at least 1.5-fold (from baseline) and a\np\nvalue threshold with a false discovery rate <0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons.\nA Partek-generated heat map was used to display differential gene expression at baseline, as well as acutely and sub-acutely post-SRC. Significant changes in differentially expressed genes were identified by comparing gene expression at baseline with expression acutely after SRC, and by comparing gene expression at baseline with expression sub-acutely after SRC (\nFig. 1\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nStudy design and analysis plan. Among athletes who suffered a sports-related concussion (SRC), gene expression was compared at baseline with acutely (within 6\u2009h) post-SRC (a), and at baseline with sub-acutely (7 days) post-SRC (b). Among uninjured teammate athletes (controls),\na piori\nanalysis involved a comparison of gene expression at baseline with the same acute post-SRC time-point as the injured athlete to whom they were matched (c). Because none of the baseline samples from uninjured control athletes were suitable for messenger RNA (mRNA) analysis, baseline samples from athletes who subsequently suffered an SRC (i.e., before they were injured) were used as a surrogate for uninjured control baseline mRNA expression (c*). Based on the presumption that mRNA expression among uninjured teammate controls would not change significantly over the 6 days spanning the acute to sub-acute time period, mRNA expression at the acute time-point was applied to the sub-acute time-point.\nThe functional biologic networks associated with these significantly changed genes were identified using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA; Qiagen Ingenuity Systems Inc, Redwood City, CA). Central transcriptional nodes (\u201chubs\u201d) were identified from the IPA-generated networks. Within each network, genes were ranked by the number of direct and indirect connections made with other genes. The top four genes with the most connections were considered transcriptional hubs.\n22"

    "Methods": "Study design\nThis present sample was part of a larger ongoing study, the Longitudinal Examination to Gather Evidence of Neurodegenerative Disease (LEGEND) study, at the Boston University Alzheimer's Disease and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center. LEGEND is a longitudinal study to assess potential risk factors for short- and long-term consequences of RHI. Participation involves annual telephone-based cognitive assessments; web-based measures of mood, behavior, and cognition; and saliva sampling for APOE genotyping. The LEGEND research protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Boston University Medical Campus and written consent was obtained from all LEGEND participants. Study participation was open to adults, \u226518 years of age, who were either active or former athletes, across all sports and levels of play. There is no active recruitment program for LEGEND. Rather, this is a convenience sample in which potential subjects learn of the study through descriptions on the investigators' web sites and through word of mouth. Therefore, the LEGEND sample should not be viewed as being representative of all athletes. Detailed descriptions of the LEGEND protocol have been previously published.\n25\n,\n47\n,\n48\n\nParticipants\nOf the 800 participants in the LEGEND data set at the time of analysis, 93 former amateur football players met the following inclusion and exclusion criteria: 1) highest level of football played was at high school or college, 2) no concussion was sustained in the year prior to their initial evaluation (to diminish potential effect of acute brain injuries on clinical outcome measures), and 3) they did not participate in another contact sport (i.e., amateur wrestling, boxing, bull riding, diving, horse jumping, ice hockey, karate, lacrosse, martial arts, mixed martial arts, entertainment wrestling, rugby, or soccer).

Questions about athletic experience captured variables regarded by the literature as being potential predictors of brain trauma, such as: 1) sports played,\n11\n,\n49\n2) AFE to tackle football,\n32\u201334\n3) levels of play\n50\u201353\n(youth, high school, college, professional), 4) number of seasons played at each level,\n27\n,\n28\n,\n54\n5) total years played,\n23\n,\n35\u201337\n6) all positions\n55\u201358\nplayed for each sport (first, second, third) at each level, 7) percentage of game time played at each position,\n46\n,\n58\nand 8) age at retirement from the sport.\n36\nThe self-reported number of concussions was obtained, after participants were read a \u201cmodern\u201d definition of concussion, based on the CDC statement on sports-related concussion\n59\nand the Third International Conference on Concussion in Sport held in Zurich.\n60\nThe concussion history characteristics of the sample are provided in\nTable 2\n. Because the distribution of self-reported concussions is highly skewed, we used the log of concussions in all subsequent analyses to normalize the distribution. Participants were also asked to report their AFE to tackle football and the total number of seasons they played (i.e., duration of football play) (\nTable 2\n). For our analysis, participant's AFE was converted into a dichotomous variable: AFE before age 12 and AFE at age 12 or above. Age 12 was selected as the cutoff, based on our previous work on AFE, as an exposure metric associated with later-life clinical and structural changes.\n32\n,\n33\nFor duration of play, we used seasons rather than years because for some athletes, a year of football involved both a fall and spring season.\nTable\n2.\nExposure Variables\nTotal sample\nn\n=\u200993 Mean (SD)\nHigh school\nn\n=\u200917 Mean (SD)\nCollege\nn\n=\u200976 Mean (SD)\np\nvalue\nConcussion history median (IQR)\na\n20 (3)\n10 (13)\n20 (39)\n0.0431\n*\nCHII\n5805.7 (3091.2)\n3237.6 (1932.4)\n6384.4 (3015.4)\n<.0001\n*\nAge at first exposure (years)\n10.9 (2.7)\n10.8 (2.7)\n11.0 (2.7)\n0.884\nAverage years of youth football\n3.3 (2.5)\n3.4 (2.3)\n3.3 (2.5)\n0.931\nSeasons of football play\n11.1 (4.2)\n7.1 (3.1)\n12.0 (3.1)\n<0.0001\nTime since retirement (years)\n26.3 (14.2)\n26.4 (12.2)\n26.3 (14.4)\n0.971\nOpen in a separate window\nNumbers in parentheses are standard deviations except when otherwise indicated.\na\nInterviewers read participants a current definition of concussion (methods described elsewhere\n47\n) and asked to estimate their concussion history based on that definition.\n*\nWilcoxon two sample test.\nIQR, interquartile range; CHII, Cumulative Head Impacts Index.\n\nCHII\nThe CHII was developed as an estimate of an athlete's total cumulative exposure to RHI from football. To derive an individual's CHII we combined data from two sources of information: 1) individual\nself-report\nmeasures of athletic exposure obtained from the LEGEND questionnaire at each level played (youth, high school, college), such as number of seasons played, positions played at each level (primary, secondary, tertiary), and the proportion of the season's total game time played at each position; and 2) a measure of estimated head impacts received per season, based on data from published helmet accelerometer studies that report the frequency of head impacts per season by position and level of play (See following section and\nTable 3\n).\n55\u201357\n,\n61\n,\n62\nTable\n3.\nSummary of Data Collected from Review of Helmet-Accelerometer Studies\nLevel\nPosition\nStudy\nMinimum acceleration\nn\nMean/ Median\nWeighted mean impacts per season\nCollege\nDL\nCrisco et al. 2010\n57\n14.4\ng\n29\n1086\n871\nMihalik et al. 2007\n55\n10.0\ng\n13\n965\nCrisco et al. 2011\n62\n10.0\ng\n49\n718\nLB\nCrisco et al. 2010\n57\n14.4\ng\n29\n846\n685\nMihalik et al. 2007\n55\n10.0\ng\n9\n655\nCrisco et al. 2011\n62\n10.0\ng\n47\n592\nDB\nCrisco et al. 2010\n57\n14.4\ng\n34\n487\n417\nMihalik et al. 2007\n55\n10.0\ng\n12\n731\nCrisco et al. 2011\n62\n10.0\ng\n55\n306\nOL\nCrisco et al. 2010\n57\n14.4\ng\n46\n960\n728\nMihalik et al. 2007\n55\n10.0\ng\n22\n921\nCrisco et al. 2011\n62\n10.0\ng\n75\n543\nOB/RB\nCrisco et al. 2010\n57\n14.4\ng\n23\n459\n412\nMihalik et al. 2007\n55\n10.0\ng\n12\n589\nCrisco et al. 2011\n62\n10.0\ng\n37\n326\nWR\nCrisco et al. 2010\n57\n14.4\ng\n16\n305\n237\nMihalik et al. 2007\n55\n10.0\ng\n5\n501\nCrisco et al. 2011\n62\n10.0\ng\n30\n157\nQB\nCrisco et al. 2010\n57\n14.4\ng\n8\n305\n206\nCrisco et al 2011\n62\n10.0\u2009g\n14\n149\nHigh School\nQB\nBroglio et al. 2011\n61\n15.0\ng\n4\n467\n467\nWR/DB\nBroglio et al. 2011\n61\n15.0\ng\n28\n372\n372\nRB/LB\nBroglio et al. 2011\n61\n15.0\ng\n27\n619\n619\nDL/OL\nBroglio et al. 2011\n61\n15.0\ng\n41\n868\n868\nYouth\nAll positions\nDaniel et al. 2012\n56\n10.0\ng\n7\n107\n107\nOpen in a separate window\nPlayer positions selected by our study participants were grouped, whenever necessary, in accordance with position groups as reported in the selected helmet-accelerometer studies and cross-referenced with position groups as characterized by relevant and authoritative publications.\n58\n,\n114\nDL, defensive linemen; LB, linebackers; DB, defensive backs; OL, offensive linemen; OB/RB, offensive backs or running backs; WR, wide receivers; QB, quarterbacks; WR/DB, wide receivers and defensive backs (cornerbacks and safeties); DL/OL, linemen.

The participants in the studies summarized in\nTable 3\nwere active in both games and practices. Because most players at the youth level play at multiple positions, we include a single number to reflect exposure for all seasons each player spent at the youth level. There was a single high school study identified that grouped together certain positions, such as linesmen, regardless of whether or not they played at offensive or defensive positions. Because many players at the high school level would interchangeably play at both offense and defense, using a similar exposure metric for these positions is a realistic assumption.\n61\nImpact frequencies from these studies were pooled and weighted, whenever possible, to derive averages weighted by each study's sample size. These weighted averages are estimates of the impact frequencies per position at the different levels of play (youth, high school, college).\nThe CHII was calculated from the self-report variables and weighted impact frequencies using the equations outlined in\nTable 4\n.

The benefits and validity of cognitive test batteries administered by telephone are well documented.\n79\n,\n83\nThe BTACT requires 20\u2009min to complete and consists of six subtests that measure episodic verbal memory (Immediate and Delayed Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test), working memory (Digits Backward), verbal fluency (Animals Categorical Fluency), task switching (Red/Green Test), inductive reasoning (Number Series), and processing speed (Backward Counting).\n67\nA global composite score was derived with the bi-factor approach, which has an overall improved validity over the single-factor approach and is better able to distinguish among persons with a lifetime history of head injury.\n79\nAge- and gender-corrected scores were scaled relative to a healthy normative sample. Objective cognitive impairment was defined as 1.5 standard deviations (SDs) below the normative mean.\n82\n,\n84\nBRIEF-A\nParticipants completed an online version of the BRIEF-A questionnaire,\n68\na well-validated 75 item measurement of executive function behavior in activities of daily living. Participants rate \u201chow often each of the [75] following behaviors has been a problem?\u201d in the past month on a three point Likert scale (1\u2009=\u2009never, 2\u2009=\u2009sometimes, 3\u2009=\u2009often); higher scores indicate a greater degree of dysfunction. We used the global measure of executive function (Global Executive Composite [GEC]), as well as two factor-based measures of cognitive regulation (Meta-cognition Index [MI]) and behavioral-emotional regulation (Behavioral Regulation Index [BRI]). Raw scores were converted into standardized age-adjusted T scores (mean\u2009=\u200950, SD\u2009=\u200910). T-scores \u22651.5\u2009SDs of the normative mean (T scores \u226565) are considered to indicate clinical impairment.\n68\nCES-D\nThe CES-D\n69\nis a 20 item self-report measure of depression symptoms that was developed and validated by the National Institute of Mental Health.\n69\nParticipants rate their depression symptom severity in the past week on a four point Likert scale that ranges from \u201cnone of the time\u201d to \u201call of the time.\u201d Higher scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms, with an established total CES-D cutoff score \u226516 reliably indicating clinically meaningful depression.\n80\n,\n81\nAES\nThe AES\n70\nis an 18 item self-report measure of apathy over the previous 4 weeks.

This model is illustrated in\nFigure 1\n. We first identified a point (threshold dose) at which the magnitude of the relationship (slope) changes from a zero magnitude (B1\u2009=\u20090) to a non-zero magnitude (B2\u2009>\u20090). The change point threshold shows the conversion of the relationship from a baseline risk of playing football to a dose-response relationship above which higher exposure to head impacts can lead to higher risk of impairment.\n85\nThe change point was identified using a Bayesian hierarchical model estimated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with 30,000 simulations implemented in PROC MCMC in SAS 9.4.\n85\nAn important contribution in modeling head impact exposure to long-term outcomes is the incorporation of concussion history into the model. Because a head impact is a necessary condition for a concussion, we cannot estimate the effect of head impacts by controlling for concussions in a simple regression setup. This relationship between predictors where a value of one variable is directly caused by another is often described as endogenous.\n86\nIf endogeneity exists between variables within our model, the following two problems would occur: 1) a linear regression model that includes both the CHII and concussion history would give invalid inference, and 2) the estimates of the slopes from such a regression model would be biased. To address the inference and bias problems caused by endogeneity we used an \u201cinstrumental variable model\u201d with log concussions as the instrument.\n87\nThe instrumental variable model can be described as a two stage regression. In the first stage regression, we estimated the effect of the log of the number of concussions on the CHII, whereas in the second stage regression we used the predicted values from the first stage to estimate the effect of the CHII on the probabilities of impairment for each of the outcomes. Both regressions included age and education as covariates. Next, we applied the instrumental variable model using a bivariate probit model. The estimated effect of cumulative head impacts derived from this instrumental variable model is equivalent to an effect estimated among the compliers from a study where exposure was prospectively randomized.\n88\nTherefore, an instrumental variable model allows for causal inference from observational data with large measurement error.\n88\n,\n89\nFurther, the instrumental variable approach reduces the measurement error of the estimates of frequency of head impacts by position and level of play. Because the studies used to estimate these frequencies are independent from the LEGEND study, their measurement error is uncorrelated from the self-reported concussions in LEGEND. Therefore, in this instance, concussions become an ideal instrument to calibrate and reduce the measurement error of head impact exposure. Similar approaches in different settings have been used in econometric and clinical therapeutic studies.\n90\n,\n91\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSchematic of the dose-response model with a constant baseline risk of later-life impairment (baseline gradient of slope\u2009=\u20090) below the cumulative head impact threshold dose and with increasing probability of impairment (dose-response gradient of slope >0) above that threshold dose.

    "Methods": "Animals\nThe Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Temple University (Philadelphia, PA) approved all procedures detailed in this section that required the use of vertebrate animals before initiating any experimental objectives. Six-week old, male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Animals were housed in the University Laboratory Animal Research (ULAR) facilities at Temple University School of Medicine, Medical Education and Research Building (Philadelphia, PA) on a 12-h light-dark cycle. Upon arrival, animals were group housed for the first 48\u2009h in order to acclimate the mice to the ULAR facility. After the acclimation period, animals were separated and housed in single cages for 24\u2009h before the induction of experimental TBI. Throughout the entire course of housing in the ULAR facilities, animals were allowed free, unlimited access to standard calorie chow and fresh water.\n\nExperimental traumatic brain injury using controlled cortical impact\nAnimals were weighted 24\u2009h before surgery to obtain a baseline for monitoring the health status of animals after CCI procedures. On the day of surgery, animals were weighed and anesthetized using a solution of ketamine/xylazine (Henry Schein Animal Health, Dublin, OH) administered through intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection at a dose of 100/10\u2009mg/kg. Depth of anesthesia was monitored throughout the surgical procedure by hindpaw toe pinches to assure that animals remained properly sedated. Once anesthetized, animals were shaved to remove hair from the scalp surrounding the surgical area using a cordless trimmer (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). Animals were immobilized using a Just for Mouse\n\u2122\nStereotaxic Instrument (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL). Ophthalmic ointment (Dechra Veterinary Products, Overland Park, KS) was applied to the eyes of immobilized animals to prevent ocular drying. Seventy percent isopropyl alcohol was used to wash the scalp, neck, and ears of surgical animals. A Zeiss Stemi 2000-C stereomicroscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC, Thornwood, NY) equipped with a SCHOTT EasyLED Ringlight (SCHOTT North America Inc., Elmsford, NY) was used to magnify and illuminate the surgical site. Surgical instruments were autoclaved before use and sterilized between animals using a Hot Bead Sterilizer (Fine Science Tools Inc., Foster City, CA). Surgical scissors were used to remove a portion of the scalp and expose the skull from the sagittal suture to the right temporalis muscle. The underlying fascia was removed, and an Ideal Micro-Drill\n\u2122\n(CellPoint Scientific Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) with a 0.5-mm, rounded burr was used to create a 4-mm craniotomy between bregma and lambda. The surgical area was periodically washed with 1\u00d7 phosphate buffered saline (PBS; Corning Inc., Manassas, VA), and drill time was minimized in order to avoid overheating of the surgical area. The bone fragment resulting from the craniotomy surgery was carefully lifted away from the surgical site to avoid disrupting the underlying dura and cortical tissue. An Impact One\n\u2122\nStereotaxic CCI Instrument (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) outfitted with a piston (2-mm diameter) was secured to the stereotaxic stage and positioned over the craniotomy. The piston was oriented parallel to the cortical plane and lowered until contact was made with the dural surface. Two degrees of neurotrauma were tested in the subsequent procedures by adjusting impact velocity and depth along the following parameters: velocity, 2.0\u2009m/s; depth, 1\u2009mm (mild); or velocity, 4.5\u2009m/s; depth, 2\u2009mm (moderate). A dwell time constant of 500\u2009ms was maintained for both degrees of neurotrauma. After discharging the impactor piston, the site of injury was covered by a sterile, 5-mm glass cover-slip (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA), which was secured to the skull using Vetbond\n\u2122\ntissue adhesive (3M, St. Paul, MN), creating a waterproof seal between the glass cover-slip and the surgical margins of the scalp. This cranial window served as means to monitor the injury site visually after the craniotomy surgery. Further, this was done in order to evaluate whether experimental animals sustained additional injury (i.e., meningeal bleeding) as a result of animal handling during i.p. injection procedures in the CPP assay. Any animal with abnormal gross tissue morphology visualized through the cranial window was excluded from the study. After adhering the cover-slip atop the craniotomy, animals were removed from the stereotaxic stage and placed in their home cage, resting upon an isothermal pad (Braintree Scientific, Inc., Braintree, MA) to maintain body temperature during recovery. Animals were monitored in their home cage until consciousness was regained. After surgery, animals were weighed and surgical margins were inspected daily for 7 days. Cranial windows were also inspected on each day of behavioral testing. Animals displaying physical distress or greater than a 10% reduction in body weight were immediately euthanized. Surgical control (craniotomy only) procedures included all of the steps described above minus impactor discharge. Nonsurgical (naive) control animals were housed in single cages at the same time as experimental animals; however, these mice did not receive an i.p. injection of ketamine/xylazine and were not weighed daily for 7 days.\n\nLocomotor activity monitoring\nOne week after CCI surgery, animals from all experimental groups were evaluated for locomotor deficits. Animals acclimated to the behavioral testing room in the ULAR facilities in their home cages for 30\u2009min before initiating the locomotor activity assay. Animals were placed into a clean, translucent open-field chamber (approximately 18\u2033 L\u2009\u00d7\u200914\u2033 W\u2009\u00d7\u20098\u2033 H) for a 30-min testing session. Activity in the open field was monitored using the AccuScan Home Cage Activity System (Omnitech Electronics, Inc., Columbus, OH), which consists of a cage frame that houses a set of 16 photobeams arranged along the horizontal axis of the testing chamber, and a pair of sensor panels used to detect the beams. Fusion Software (Omnitech Electronics, Inc.) was used to collect data from the sensor panels across multiple home cage system variables in 5-min intervals over the entire 30-min testing session. Locomotor activity has been defined as the combination of ambulatory activity counts and stereotypy activity counts recorded as part of the home cage system variables. Ambulatory activity counts are the number of photobeam interruptions detected by the sensor panel as ambulation by an animal occurs in the open field. Stereotypy activity counts are the number of photobeam breaks that occur repeatedly at the same set of photobeams, which accounts for all nonambulatory activity in the open field, but does not distinguish between individual stereotypies, such as grooming or head bobbing behaviors. Together, these variables divulge information pertaining to the total activity of an animal. Any surgical mice falling below 1.5 times the standard deviation from the mean total activity counts of no craniotomy control animals were considered impaired and excluded from the CPP assay. At the end of the testing session, animals were removed from the open-field chamber and placed into their home cages and returned to an animal housing room in the ULAR facilities.\n\nConditioned place preference assay\nA three-phase, biased CPP assay was used to assess preference for a drug-paired environment. The CPP assay was performed using a custom-designed Plexiglas chamber (approximately 13.75\u2033 L\u2009\u00d7\u20095.25\u2033 W\u2009\u00d7\u20095.00\u2033 H) manufactured by Shore Plastics (Philadelphia, PA). A removable divider wall was used to separate the chamber into two, equal-sized compartments. To established diverse environments in the CPP chamber, each compartment was designed to be both visually and texturally distinct. One compartment had black walls and a grit-textured floor. The other compartment had white and black striped walls and a smooth-textured floor. The first phase consisted of a 30-min pre-test, which was used to establish compartment bias. During the pre-test, an opening in the compartment divider wall allowed animals to move freely between the two compartments. Animals were monitored for residence time in each compartment of the CPP chamber for 30\u2009min. The compartment that an animal resided in for more than 15\u2009min (> 50% of the total test time) was designated as the preferred compartment. The alternate (nonpreferred) compartment was assigned as the drug-paired compartment for the second phase of the CPP assay. All pre-tests were performed on day 15 post-CCI injury, followed by the second (conditioning) phase of testing, which consisted of 6 days of noncontingent cocaine administration on days 16\u201321 post-injury. On each of the 6 conditioning days, animals received an i.p. injection of cocaine (dosage, 10\u2009mg/kg) dissolved in 0.9% sterile saline in the morning, whereas a separate group of control animals received an equal volume of 0.9% sterile saline without drug. All animals were immediately confined to their drug-paired (nonpreferred) compartment for 30\u2009min. During the conditioning phase of the CPP assay, the door opening in the compartment divider was replace by a solid wall to prevent animals from residing in the alternate (pre-test: preferred) compartment. In the afternoon of each conditioning day, 4\u2009h after cocaine exposure, all experimental animals received an i.p. injection of 0.9% sterile saline (at volumes equivalent to the morning injections) followed immediately by confinement in their preferred (drugless) compartment for 30\u2009min. Animals were weighed in the morning on the first, third, and sixth day of cocaine conditioning in order to deliver a correct, intended dose of cocaine throughout the conditioning phase. On day 22 post-injury, animals entered the third phase of CPP testing, which consisted of a 30-min post-test. During the post-test, again, an opening in the compartment divider wall allowed animals to move freely between the two compartments. Animals were monitored for residence time in each compartment of the CPP chamber for 30\u2009min. Place preference shifts were calculated by subtracting the residence time in the nonpreferred compartment during the pre-test from the residence time in the nonpreferred (drug-paired) compartment during the post-test. In order to increase precision and control for behavior not provoked by cocaine conditioning, only animals producing shift values between 90 and 500\u2009sec were included in the statistical analysis. At the end of all testing sessions, animals were removed from the CPP chamber and returned to their home cages in an animal housing room of the ULAR facilities.\n\nTissue preparation and histology\nAfter the CPP assay, brain tissue was harvested from all experimental animals on day 29 post-CCI. Animals were anesthetized using 4% Isoflurane and perfused transcardially, first with 20\u2009mL of 1\u00d7 PBS (Corning Inc.) followed by 20\u2009mL of Poly/LEM Fixative (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA). After perfusion, brains were extracted from the skull and immediately post-fixed in Poly/LEM Fixative for 24\u2009h at 4\u00b0C then dissected into 2-mm-thick segments using an Alto stainless steel 1-mm brain matrix oriented in the coronal plane (CellPoint Scientific Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Segments were post-fixed in Poly/LEM Fixative for another 24\u2009h at 4\u00b0C. After the second 24-h round of post-fixation, brain segments were washed three times with 1\u00d7 PBS and processed using a Tissue-Tek\n\u00ae\nVIP\n\u00ae\n6 (Sakura Finetek USA, Inc., Torrance CA). The tissue was then paraffin-embedded using a TN-1500 Embedding Console System (Tanner Scientific, Inc., Sarasota, FL) and serial sectioned at 5\u2009\u03bcm on charged slides using a rotary microtome (Leica Microsystems). Sections were heated to 56\u00b0C for 60\u2009min before immunofluorescence staining.\n\nImmunofluorescence assay\nSerial sections of paraffin-embedded tissue were cleared and rehydrated for antigen retrieval. Sections were incubated at 95\u00b0C for 30\u2009min in pre-warmed citrate buffer (10\u2009mM of citric acid in distilled water, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0). After antigen retrieval, sections were cooled to room temperature and rinsed with distilled water. Sections were then incubated with Background Punisher (Biocare Medical, LLC, Concord, CA) at room temperature for 30\u2009min before application of primary antibodies. Sections were incubated in a humidifying chamber overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies: mouse antimouse GFAP (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA) and rabbit antimouse IBA-1 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) diluted in 2% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc., West Grove, PA) at ratios of 1:500 and 1:200, respectively. After overnight incubation, sections were warmed to room temperature for 1\u2009h, then rinsed with 1\u00d7 PBS (Corning Inc.) three times before application of secondary antibodies: donkey antimouse Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA) and donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Secondary antibodies were diluted in 2% normal donkey serum both at a ratio of 1:500. Sections were incubated with secondary antibodies in a dark humidifying chamber for 1\u2009h at room temperature. After incubation with secondary antibodies, sections were rinsed with 1\u00d7 PBS three times, then counterstained using ProLong Gold antifade reagent with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Thermo Fisher Scientific) mounted with coverslips, and stored at 4\u00b0C before immunofluorescence microscopy.\n\nImmunofluorescence microscopy and image analysis\nFluorescent images were acquired using a Coolsnap EZ CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) connected to an Eclipse 80\ni\nmicroscope (Nikon Instruments, Inc., Melville, NY) with a solid-state Lumencore SOLA light engine\n\u00ae\n. Equal capture parameters were used to acquire fluorescent images from all subjects. AxioVision (Carl Zeiss Microscopy) was also used to pseudocolor the captured images. GFAP and IBA-1 positivity were quantified based upon area and fluorescent intensity using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). A binary image was processed in ImageJ after defining a threshold for fluorescence intensity. Particle counting (GFAP or IBA-1) based on area was then used to determine the final number per area under observation (ImageJ software).\n\nReal-time polymerase chain reaction\nBrains were harvested from CCI-TBI (moderate) and no craniotomy control animals at 24\u2009h and 2 weeks post-CCI surgery. Animals were transcardially perfused with 1\u00d7 PBS (Corning), after which brains were removed and segmented using a mouse brain matrix oriented in the coronal plane (CellPoint Scientific Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Segments containing the NAc and site of impact were placed immediately into RNA\nlater\n\u00ae\nSolution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored at 4\u00b0C overnight before being transferred to \u201320\u00b0C for long-term storage. The ipsilateral region of the NAc and cortical tissue from the site of impact were excised using a brain microdissection tool 1.25\u2009mm in diameter (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL). For each N, the ipsilateral region of the NAc and cortical tissue from the site of impact from 2 experimental animals were pooled before proceeding with RNA isolation. Total RNA was isolated from the regions of interest using TRIzol\n\u00ae\nReagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and quantified using a NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and an Eppendorf Mastercycler\n\u00ae\npro (Eppendorf AG, Hauppauge, NY) were used to prepare the complementary DNA (cDNA) for real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The prepared cDNA was then mixed with nuclease-free water and TaqMan\n\u00ae\nFast Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and added to Applied Biosystems\n\u00ae\nTaqMan\n\u00ae\nArray Mouse Immune Response 96-well Fast Plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing probes for immune response-associated genes. Data were analyzed using ExpressionSuite Software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the delta-delta threshold cycle (Ct) method (Relative Quantification). Data are expressed as the relative fold change compared to na\u00efve controls.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData were analyzed for statistical significance using Prism software (version 6; GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). Student's\nt\n-tests and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's post-hoc tests were performed to analyze the place preference shift data from our cocaine CPP assay. Cumulative total activity counts and GFAP and IBA-1 positivity in the NAc and VTA were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc tests. Our mouse immune response panel was analyzed by two-way ANOVA with Sidak post-hoc tests. For all tests, statistical significance was defined at\np\n\u2264\u20090.05."

Similar to other ERP research, participants self-reported the number of diagnosed concussions they experienced before testing.\n22\n,\n28\n,\n52\u201354\nAthletes also reported the date of their most recent concussion and if any resulted in loss of consciousness or difficulty remembering events. In the case that participants did not complete a recent case interview at the host institution, past concussion history was determined from case history reports on their most recent ImPACT evaluation (ImPACT Applications, Pittsburgh, PA). Concussion severity information (loss of consciousness, memory problems) was not provided for 2 participants. Participants were only included in the concussion history group if they reported at least one\ndiagnosed\nconcussion. Time elapsed since most recent diagnosed concussed was calculated as the time (in months) between the approximate date of injury and the date of participation in the study.\nNeuropsychological tests\nTrained researchers administered three traditional paper-pencil neuropsychological tests that measured executive functioning abilities, including inhibition, mental flexibility, processing speed, task-switching, and working memory. EEG was not recorded during these tests.\nTesting sequence\nFirst, the oddball ERP task was administered. Then, the three neuropsychological tests were administered for approximately 15\u201320\u2009min, with brief breaks after each test. Because the oddball task occurred before the neuropsychological tests, ERPs were not influenced by any mental or physical fatigue resulting from the neuropsychological tests.\n55\nThe three neuropsychological tests are described below.\nDelis-Kaplan Executive Function System Color-Word Interference\nAll participants completed the Color-Word Interference subtest of the D-KEFS Neuropsychological Battery (Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System).\n56\nData from 2 participants were removed from D-KEFS analyses because of color-blindness. Participants were presented with 50 color words (blue, red, and green) printed in congruent (e.g.,\nblue\nin blue ink) or incongruent (e.g.,\nblue\nin red ink) colors. The goal of this task was to verbally identify each word's ink color. Elapsed time to complete the test (ms) and errors (corrected, uncorrected) were recorded. Data were scaled to account for age. Performance on this test represents cognitive flexibility and inhibition.\n57\nTrail-Making Test\nParticipants completed an adapted version of the Trail-Making Test Forms A and B.\n58\nOne participant was removed from Trail-Making analyses because of missing data. Two forms of the test were used. For Form A, the numbers 1\u201325 were placed in an array on a sheet of paper and participants connected the numbers in sequential order as fast as possible. Performance on Form A is thought to represent visual search speed.\n59\nForm B consisted of numbers (\n1\nto\n12\n) and letters (\nA\nto\nL\n) organized in an array. Participants were instructed to connect the numbers to letters in sequential and alphabetical order (e.g.,\n1\u2014A\u20142\u2014B\u20143\u2014C\n). Time elapsed to complete each form (ms) was recorded. Form B represents working memory, task-switching, and information processing speed.\n59\n,\n60\nWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV Letter-Number Sequencing\nThe Letter-Number Sequencing subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)-IV assesses attention, mental flexibility, and working memory.\n61\nIn this task, the administrator verbally presented sequences consisting of letters and numbers. The participants then repeated back the numbers in sequential order, starting from the lowest number and then repeated the letters in alphabetical order. The amount of items within each sequence increased throughout the task. Scores reflect the number of sequences correctly recalled. Data were scaled to account for each participant's age.\nTwo-tone auditory oddball task\nBefore the neuropsychological tests, participants completed a standard two-tone auditory oddball task during ERP recording to assess selective attention.\n62\nParticipants were seated in a dark room and centered in front of a standard Dell LCD 15.5\u201d (39.5\u2009cm) monitor. A speaker was placed 1\u2009m behind and above the midline of the participant's head. Volume was adjusted such that stimulus loudness levels were matched at 80\u2009dB SPL(A) when measured at the participant's ear. During the task, participants attended to a black screen that displayed a centered, white fixation cross. The fixation cross was viewed from a distance of 1\u2009m with a visual angle of 0.46 degrees. Participants first completed four practice trials in which they heard each tone (1000\u2009Hz, 1500\u2009Hz) presented twice. Next, participants heard 100 random presentations of the two tones, which were classified as \u201ctarget\u201d (30%) and \u201cnontarget\u201d (70%) and counterbalanced across participants. The tones were presented every 1400\u20131600\u2009ms using E-Prime software (version 2.0; Psychology Software Tools, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). Participants only responded to target tones by pressing a designated button on a handheld pad with their right thumb and their response time recorded. Accuracy was recorded for nontarget and target trials. Only correct responses were submitted to statistical analysis.\n\nEvent-related potential recording\nData collection and reduction\nThe ongoing EEG was recorded using a high-density Ag/AgCl 256-electrode net and Net Station software (version 4.4.2; Electro Geodesics Inc. [EGI], Eugene, OR). Sampling rate was 250\u2009Hz. Electrode impedances were measured before and after the oddball task and maintained below 60\u2009k\u03a9. No filters were imposed on the data during data collection. After data collection, EEG signals were band-passed filtered offline from 0.3 to 30\u2009Hz. Correct trials were segmented to an epoch of 200\u2009ms before each tone presentation and 900\u2009ms post-stimulus onset. To control for brain changes related to increases in exposure to the stimuli throughout the testing session, we examined sequential pairs of target and nontarget trials: Correct target trials were only submitted to analyses if at least one of the two preceding trials included a nontarget. Similarly, correct nontarget trials were only included when at least one of the two following trials were targets. All signals were adjusted for computer timing offsets. Eye blinks were classified as a voltage shift greater than 150\u2009uV at any electrode during any trial and were removed and replaced through spline interpolation from immediately adjacent electrodes. Next, trials were baseline-corrected using a 200-ms pre-stimulus period and rereferenced to the average reference. All trials were averaged within conditions (target, nontarget) for each electrode. To increase statistical power,\n63\nthe averaged ERPs were clustered into nine bilateral scalp regions: inferior frontal, inferior occipital, inferior temporal, occipital, orbital, parietal, prefrontal, tempoparietal, and temporal.\n64\nEvent-related potential brain source localization\nUsing all 256 electrode placements, we determined sources of brain localization that employed the sLORETA constraint\n45\nwithin the GeoSource software package (version 2.0; EGI). A forward modeling approach mapped electrode scalp recordings onto brain tissue using a finite difference model (FDM). This method estimated the location of scalp electrodes in relation to the brain using conductivity values modeled for different tissues. Fixed conductivity parameters within the FDM included those for scalp (0.44\u2009S/m), skull (0.018\u2009S/m), cerebrospinal fluid (1.80\u2009S/m), and brain (0.25\u2009S/m).\n65\nThe FDM segmented brain tissue into 2-mm voxels, which were fit to the Montreal Neurological Institute's (MNI) 305-adult averaged MRI database. Gray matter volume was separated into 7-mm voxels based on this model and represents electrical current density (nA) in neuroanatomical MNI space. Each of these voxels served as a source location with three orthogonal dipole orientations for a total of 2447 orthogonal source triples. Dipole locations were weighted equally with a Tikhonov (1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n\u20132\n) regularization and a minimum norm solution that was constrained to sLORETA. Given our hypotheses, current density was analyzed during the P3b latency window for the target stimuli and the N2 latency window for the nontarget stimuli.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 21; IBM, Chicago, IL). Reported results were statistically significant at the\np\n<\u20090.05 level. Effect sizes for significant analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were calculated using partial eta-squared and Cohen's\nd\nstatistic for independent-samples\nt\n-tests. One-way ANOVAs determined whether performance on each of the three neuropsychological tests or oddball task (accuracy, response time) varied between groups. P3b adaptive mean amplitudes (\n\u03bc\nV) were extracted from a regional pool of parietal electrode channels throughout the 260- to 388-ms time window. This window is based on past research reporting a spatial-temporal principal component analysis factor in parietal electrode channels between 200 and 400\u2009ms.\n66\nAdaptive mean amplitude was defined as the mean ERP amplitude within the temporal window, including a two-sample (8-ms) adjustment before and after the window. Consistent with past work using a sample of college-aged athletes, the N2 ERP was recorded throughout the 150- to 300-ms time window,\n22\nover prefrontal electrode channels. ERP latency was quantified as the time point of the maximum positive and negative deflections for the P3b and N2 time windows, respectively.\nFigure 1\ndepicts the P3b and N2 components by group and condition.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG 1.\nAveraged ERP waveforms are represented by group (concussion history\u2009=\u2009gray; control\u2009=\u2009black) and condition (target\u2009=\u2009solid; nontarget\u2009=\u2009dashed).

    "Methods": "Study participants\nInclusion criteria were as follows: males and females, 18\u201365 years of age, with chronic (>1 year post-injury), traumatic SCI at or above T6, confirmed AD during UDS, confirmed NDO, capable of CIC, and resistant to anticholinergic medications. Exclusion criteria included documented traumatic brain injury, previous use of Botox for the bladder, previous genitourinary disease or surgery, multiple injury levels, acute urinary tract infection (UTI) (culture-proven diagnosis), and history of cardiovascular disease.\n\nStudy design\nThis prospective, open-label, pre/post comparison study was conducted from April 2013 to August 2014 at the Blusson Spinal Cord Centre, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Approval was received by the Clinical Research Ethics Board at the University of British Columbia, and the Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute Ethics Board, conforming to the Declaration of Helsinki, and was registered (#NCT02298660) at\nClinicalTrials.gov\n. All participants provided written informed consent. The neurological level of injury and completeness of injury were classified according to the International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI.\n10\nBaseline (pre) testing consisted of a UDS assessment to confirm the presence of AD, 24\u2009h ABPM, and QoL questionnaires. Two weeks following baseline evaluations, participants received Botox injections. One month following injections (post), participants repeated the same measurements as the baseline test. Participants were asked to refrain from exercise, coffee, alcohol, and anticholinergic medications \u226512\u2009h prior to testing. To minimize the effects of the bowel (i.e., impaction and defecation) on AD,\n11\n,\n12\nthe UDS and 24\u2009h ABPM assessments were scheduled at least 2 days prior to each participant's scheduled bowel program.\n\nUDS assessment\nPrior to UDS, a urinary dipstick test confirmed the absence of infection. UDS occurred between 0800 and 1200\u2009h in a temperature-controlled room (21\u00b0C) according to established standards.\n13\n,\n14\nCystometry was performed by a double-lumen catheter (6 Fr, Laborie, Canada) with continuous filling of sterile water (37\u00b0C) at a fixed rate of 30\u2009mL/min. Abdominal pressure was measured with an intrarectal balloon catheter (10 Fr, Laborie, Canada). Pelvic floor electromyography (EMG) (Aquarius TT, Laborie Model 94-R03-BT, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) was recorded using surface EMG. Filling was stopped if any of the following conditions were observed: 1) reported sensation of fullness, 2) spontaneous urine leakage, 3) intravesical pressure \u226540\u2009cm H\n2\nO, 4) infused volume reached 500\u2009mL, or 5) sustained SBP \u2265180\u2009mm Hg or intolerable AD symptoms.\nHeart rate (HR) and BP were recorded every minute on the right arm during UDS using an automated sphygmomanometer (DinamapV100; GE Medical Systems, Fairfield, CT), using a medium (23\u201333\u2009cm) or large (31\u201340\u2009cm) adult-sized cuff. Three supine measurements were taken at the beginning of UDS and averaged to determine baseline supine SBP. After this, hemodynamic measurements corresponding to each of the following time points were documented: 1) first urge to perform CIC, 2) at maximum volume infused, and 3) the overall maximum SBP reached during UDS. Signs and self-reported symptoms of AD were documented. The change in SBP (\u0394SBP) and HR (\u0394HR) from baseline at each time point was calculated. At the end of the assessment, a CIC was performed to void the bladder. If AD persisted, it was managed according to established guidelines\n15\n,\n16\nincluding sitting the participant upright to induce orthostatic BP response, loosening any restrictive clothing, confirming the bladder had been fully voided, and checking for any other possible sources of stimuli. If these steps did not result in the normalization of BP, the administration of an antihypertensive agent was considered if SBP remained \u2265150\u2009mm Hg. In the present study, no participants required the use of an antihypertensive agent to manage their AD following the UDS assessment.\n\nTwenty-four hour ABPM assessment\nTo document the incidence of AD during bladder-related events across a 24\u2009h period, ABPM was used (Meditech Card [X] plore; Meditech Ltd., Budapest, Hungary). A medium (24\u201332\u2009cm) or large (32\u201342\u2009cm) adult-sized cuff was used. With participants seated in their own wheelchairs, three discrete seated BP and HR measurements were taken on the nondominant arm and averaged to determine the baseline seated SBP and HR values with which the 24\u2009h ABPM values would be compared. Automatic recordings were taken every 15\u2009min from 0700 to 2300\u2009h (daytime period), and every hour from 2300 to 0700\u2009h. Manual BP measurements were also documented in an activity log before and after each CIC and suspected AD episode. The number of bladder-related events (i.e., CIC) was documented, and the highest SBP prior to each CIC was subtracted from the baseline seated SBP to determine if AD was occurring (\u0394SBP \u226520\u2009mm Hg). The corresponding HR during these events was also subtracted from baseline HR to determine the change (\u0394HR). The average daytime and nighttime BP values were also determined.\n\nQuestionnaires\nThe AD Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (AD QoL)\n12\nand the Incontinence Quality of Life Questionnaire (I-QoL)\n17\nwere administered to assess the impact of AD and NDO on perceptions of health.\n\nBotox injections\nTwo weeks following UDS, one cycle of Botox was injected according to the established clinical protocol for NDO.\n7\nTo avoid provocation of AD, a local anesthetic was utilized with instillation of 50\u2009mL of 2% lidocaine into the bladder mucosa. In brief, 200\u2009U of Botox diluted in 20\u2009mL 0.9% saline solution was injected into 20 sites of the detrusor muscle (10\u2009U/site), trigone sparing. Oral antibiotics were prescribed 5 days prior to treatment. Anticholinergic medications were progressively decreased 1 week post-treatment. Adverse events were documented 1 week (by phone call) and 1 month (in person) post-Botox.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (Version 19.0; IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY). All data were assessed for normal distribution using Shapiro\u2013Wilk tests, and analyzed by paired\nt\ntest and Wilcoxon signed rank test for normal and non-normal distributions, respectively. All statistical analyses were considered significant at\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Procedures\nWe used daily automatic queries of electronic medical records and TBI consultation lists to identify consecutively eligible inpatients with TBI. Research staff obtained consent from eligible patients who were fully oriented before discharge. For patients disoriented at discharge, we obtained assent from legal next of kin to conduct follow-up. Those patients not approached at discharge were recruited via a letter from the attending neurosurgeon and telephone calls. Trained research assistants used structured telephone interviews to assess participants at months 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12 months after injury. Disoriented patients were followed for up to 1 year and were required to pass standardized orientation examination before consenting.\n36\nStudy procedures were approved by the University of Washington Institutional Review Board and followed guidelines from the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. We obtained a waiver of consent to determine eligibility and retain selected demographic information about nonrecruited patients. Otherwise, participation required written consent.\n\nParticipants\nThis is a reanalysis of data gathered between 2001 and 2006 and published previously.\n1\nThis study was the recruitment phase of a clinical trial investigating the efficacy of sertraline for major depressive disorder (MDD) after TBI. Participants with evidence of acute TBI were recruited from consecutive admissions to Harborview Medical Center. Acute TBI was defined as having radiological evidence of acute, traumatically induced brain abnormality or Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score lower than 13 (based on the lowest score within 24\u2009h after admission or the first after paralytic agents were withdrawn). Other inclusion criteria were: at least 18 years old, English speaking, and residing in King, Pierce, Kitsap, Jefferson, Mason, Thurston, or Snohomish counties.\nPotential participants were excluded if they had uncomplicated mild TBI (GCS 13\u201315 and no radiological abnormality)\n37\nor if they had GCS scores lower than 13, no radiological evidence of TBI, and blood alcohol levels over 199\u2009mg/dL because of diagnostic uncertainty in these groups.\n38\nOther exclusion criteria were homelessness, having no contact information, pending incarceration, and schizophrenia. We did not exclude persons with a history of other mental health disorders because of the high prevalence of these disorders and the potential importance of psychiatric history in predicting outcomes.\n3\n,\n4\n,\n33\n,\n39\nPatients were referred for further evaluation and treatment if they reported suicidal ideation with plan or intent.\n\nMeasures\nWe gathered demographic, medical, radiologic, and\nInternational Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision\n(ICD-9) code data from participant interviews, medical record reviews, and the Harborview Trauma Registry. We assessed race via self-report and record review. We based other system injury severity on the Injury Severity Score excluding head injury.\n40\nSerum blood alcohol level and toxicology screening results (cocaine and amphetamine) were obtained on 80% of the sample.\nDuring the first assessment, we conducted a structured interview to assess pre-injury history of psychiatric disorders and treatment.\n1\n,\n19\nWe coded participants as having a pre-injury history of depression if they reported ever receiving a diagnosis of or treatment for depression or making a suicide attempt. We asked participants whether they ever received any of the following mental health diagnoses before injury: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder or manic depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, any phobia, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or any psychotic disorder.\nBecause of the prevalence and salience of PTSD in TBI,\n6\nwe reported those with this disorder separately, while the remainder were grouped into the category of those having a history of \u201cother mental health disorder.\u201d Lifetime history of alcohol dependence was based on endorsing at least two items on the CAGE (Cut down? Angered? Guilty? Eye\u2013opener?) questionnaire.\n41\nAlcohol intoxication was defined as blood alcohol level greater than 79\u2009mg/dL. Other drug use was defined as a positive toxicology screen for cocaine or amphetamine on admission. Participants were asked whether they were involved in or planning a lawsuit related to their injury.\nThe subsequent assessments focused on assessing symptoms of depression and mental health treatment. Depressive symptoms were assessed using a telephone-based, structured interview of depressive symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item depression scale (PHQ-9).\n42\nIn a subset of this sample, the PHQ-9 has been shown to have excellent interrater reliability (r\u2009=\u20090.99) and good diagnostic validity using telephone interviews in persons with TBI.\n43\nAt a cutoff of 10 or higher, the PHQ-9 has a sensitivity of (0.88) and a specificity of (0.90) for independently diagnosed MDD in persons who are within 1 year of sustaining TBI.\n43\nTherefore, we refer to PHQ-9 scores less than 10 as being in the nondepressed range and scores of 10 or more as being in the depressed range.\nTo capture use of antidepressants, we asked participants whether they were taking \u201cany medicine for nerves, stress, depression, or to help you sleep in the last 4 weeks,\u201d and if the medication was an antidepressant, they were coded as using an antidepressant. To capture use of counseling, we asked whether they were \u201ccurrently receiving outpatient mental health treatment.\u201d PHQ-9 scores were captured from both treatment and control subjects during the trial, because there were no differences in treatment response between the two groups. Participation in the trial, however, was not counted as having received antidepressants because the treatment received was not community-based.\n\nStatistical analyses\nWe conducted latent class growth mixture models (LCGMM) on total PHQ-9 scores to obtain distinct trajectories of depression over time.\n29\n,\n44\n,\n45\nLCGMM is a contemporary longitudinal technique and is an extension of conventional growth modeling.\n46\nWhen conducting these conventional analyses, we assume that all persons in the study sample come from a single population. This implies that one (average) trajectory will adequately describe the developmental pattern of the whole sample.\nThis assumption is relaxed in LCGMM, meaning that persons in the sample need not come from one single underlying population but can come from multiple, underlying (or latent) subpopulations. Identifying the number and characteristics of these underlying subpopulations is the main aim of LCGMM. This is done by identifying\nk\nnumber of distinct latent classes (i.e., subgroups) of trajectories of depression. Each identified class has its own specific growth parameters (intercept, linear slope), which are also assumed to be unobserved, or latent.\nTo decide on the optimal number of classes, we used the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), the Bootstrapped Likelihood Ratio Test (BLRT), and the entropy.\n47\n,\n48\nLower BIC values, nonsignificant BLRT\np\nvalues (lower than\np\n=\u20090.05), and entropy values close to 1.00 imply a better fitting model. Clinical interpretation and class sample size were also considered in the decision making process where models with clinically uninterpretable classes and classes with <1% of the study sample were rejected.\n49\n,\n50\nFor the present study, we conducted models with linear slopes including an estimated intercept variance parameter. The variance of the linear slopes only was fixed at zero, implying that all persons within a class have a similar depression trajectory shape. Missing data were adequately handled by the Expectation-Maximization algorithm and treated as missing at random. Solutions with 1\u20136 classes were run based on previous studies.\n50\u201354\nWe tested putative predictors of class membership based on biopsychosocial predictors of incident depression after TBI.\n1\nWe assessed predictors of class membership by conducting multinomial regression analyses through the newly introduced three-step approach,\n54\n,\n55\nwhere class membership was the outcome variable. In this improved approach, the latent classes are formed first (i.e., the predictors are not clouding the interpretation of the classes). In the second step, the most-likely class membership variable was created, which in the third step is used as the outcome variable in the multinomial logistic regression that assesses predictors of class membership while taking into account the measurement error (or uncertainty) in class assignment.\nThe predictors described in\nTable 1\n(excluding treatments received) were assessed, and odds ratios (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and\np\nvalues were presented comparing each class with all other classes.

    "Methods": "Subjects\nSixty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) weighing 300\u2013325\u2009g on the day of surgery were housed in standard steel-wire mesh cages and maintained in a temperature (21\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C) and light (on 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM) controlled environment with\nad libitum\nfood and water. After 1 week of acclimatization, all rats underwent a single day of beam walk training, which consisted of 3\u20135 trials. After training, the rats were randomly assigned to one of the following group conditions: TBI + standard (STD) + vehicle (VEH) (1.0\u2009mL/kg;\nn\n=\u200910), TBI + STD + HAL (0.5\u2009mg/kg;\nn\n=\u200910), TBI + EE + VEH (\nn\n=\u200910), TBI + EE + HAL (\nn\n=\u200910), Sham + STD + VEH (\nn\n=\u20095), Sham + STD + HAL (\nn\n=\u20095), Sham + EE + VEH (\nn\n=\u20095), or Sham + EE + HAL (\nn\n=\u20095). All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Pittsburgh. Every attempt was made to limit the number of rats used and to minimize suffering.\n\nSurgery\nA CCI injury was produced as described previously.\n31\u201336\nBriefly, surgical anesthesia was induced and maintained with 4% and 2% isoflurane, respectively, in 2:1\u2009N\n2\nO:O\n2\n. After the rats were intubated, they were secured in a stereotaxic frame and ventilated mechanically. Using aseptic procedures, a midline scalp incision was made, the skin and fascia were reflected to expose the skull, and a craniectomy (6\u2009mm in diameter) was made in the right hemisphere (encompassing bregma and lambda and between the sagittal suture and the coronal ridge) with a high-speed dental drill. The bone flap was removed, and the craniectomy was enlarged further.\nSubsequently, the impacting rod was extended and the impact tip (6\u2009mm, flat) was centered and lowered through the craniectomy until it contacted the dura mater; then the rod was retracted and the impact tip was advanced 2.8\u2009mm farther to produce a brain injury of moderate severity (2.8\u2009mm tissue deformation at 4\u2009m/sec). Core body temperature was maintained at 37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u00b0C with a heating blanket. Immediately after the CCI, anesthesia was discontinued, and the incision was promptly sutured. The rats were subsequently extubated and assessed for acute neurological outcome. Sham rats underwent similar surgical procedures but were not subjected to the impact.\n\nAcute neurological evaluation\nHind limb reflexive ability was assessed immediately after the cessation of anesthesia by gently squeezing a rat's paw with forceps every 5\u2009sec and recording the time to elicit a withdrawal response. Return of the righting reflex was determined by the time needed to turn from the supine to prone position. These tests are sensitive indicators of injury severity and duration of anesthesia.\n31\u201337\n\nHousing conditions: Environmental manipulation\nAfter surgery and after the effects of anesthesia abated (as evidenced by spontaneous movement in the holding cage), the rats were returned to the colony where those designated for enrichment were immediately placed in specifically designed steel-wire cages (91\u2009\u00d7\u200976\u2009\u00d7\u200950\u2009cm). The EE cages consisted of three levels with ladders to ambulate from one level to another and contained various toys (e.g., balls, blocks, and tubes), nesting materials (e.g., paper towels), and\nad libitum\nfood and water.\n25\n,\n26\nTo maintain novelty, the objects were rearranged every day and changed each time the cage was cleaned, which was twice per week. Ten to 12 rats, which included HAL and vehicle-treated TBI and sham controls, were housed in the EE together to minimize variability among the groups. Rats in the STD conditions were placed in typical shoebox cages (37\u2009\u00d7\u200925\u2009\u00d7\u200918\u2009cm, two rats per cage) with only food and water.\n\nDrug administration\nHAL (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was prepared daily by dissolving in 1:1 dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/saline, which also served as the VEH. The dose of HAL was chosen because it has been reported to be comparable to that used clinically to control psychosis\n38\nand has been used in several brain injury studies investigating functional outcome.\n16\u201322\nTreatments began 24\u2009h after CCI or sham surgery and were provided IP once daily for 19 days. The half-life of HAL using this dose and route is reported to be 2.6\u2009h,\n39\nand thus it was provided after the daily behavioral assessments to circumvent sedative effects, which may confound the results. The biological effect of HAL, however, was active during the exposure to the EE because they were housed continuously.\n\nMotor performance\nMotor function was assessed using the well-established beam balance and beam walk tasks.\n31\u201337\nBriefly, beam balance consisted of placing the rat on an elevated narrow beam (1.5\u2009cm wide) and recording the time it remained on for a maximum of 60\u2009sec. Beam walk consisted of recording the elapsed time to traverse the beam (2.5\u2009cm wide \u00d7100\u2009cm long). Testing was conducted approximately 1\u2009h before surgery (to establish a baseline measure), as well as on post-operative days 1\u20135, and consisted of three trials (60\u2009sec allotted time with an intertrial interval of 30\u2009sec) per day on each task. The average daily scores for each subject were used in the statistical analyses.\n\nCognitive function: Acquisition of spatial learning\nSpatial learning was assessed in a Morris water maze task that has been shown to be sensitive to cognitive function after TBI.\n31\u201337\n,\n40\u201343\nBriefly, the maze consisted of a plastic pool (180\u2009cm diameter; 60\u2009cm high) filled with tap water (26\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C) to a depth of 28\u2009cm and was situated in a room with salient visual cues that remained constant throughout the study. The platform was a clear Plexiglas stand (10\u2009cm diameter, 26\u2009cm high) that was positioned 26\u2009cm from the maze wall in the southwest quadrant and held constant for each rat.\nSpatial learning began on post-operative day 14 and consisted of providing a block of four daily trials (4-min intertrial interval) for 5 consecutive days (14\u201318) to locate the platform when it was submerged 2\u2009cm below the water surface. On day 19 the platform was made visible to the rats by raising it 2\u2009cm above the water surface as a control procedure to determine the contributions of nonspatial factors (e.g., sensory-motor performance, motivation, and visual acuity) on cognitive performance.\nFor each daily block of trials, the rats were placed in the pool facing the wall at each of the four possible start locations (north, east, south, and west) in a randomized manner. Each trial lasted until the rat climbed onto the platform or until 120\u2009sec had elapsed, whichever occurred first. Rats that failed to locate the goal within the allotted time were manually guided to it. All rats remained on the platform for 30\u2009sec before being placed in a heated incubator between trials. The times of the four daily trials for each rat were averaged and used in the statistical analyses.\n\nCognitive function: Probe trial (memory retention)\nOne day after the final acquisition training session (i.e., day 19), all rats were given a single probe trial to measure memory retention. Briefly, the platform was removed from the pool, and the rats were placed in the maze from the location point distal to the quadrant where the platform was situated previously (i.e., \u201ctarget quadrant\u201d) and allowed to freely explore the pool for 30\u2009sec. The percent time spent in the target quadrant was used in the statistical analysis.\n\nHistology: quantification of cortical lesion volume\nAfter the last behavioral assessment (i.e., post-operative day 19), the rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50\u2009mg/kg IP) and then perfused transcardially with 200\u2009mL 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) followed by 300\u2009mL 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were extracted, post-fixed in the perfusate for 1 week, dehydrated with alcohols, and embedded in paraffin. Coronal sections (7-\u03bcm thick) were cut at 1-mm intervals through the lesion on a microtome and mounted on microscope slides. After drying at room temperature, the sections were deparaffinized in xylenes, rehydrated, and stained with cresyl violet.\nAn observer blinded to experimental conditions analyzed the cortical lesion volumes (mm\n3\n) using a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope. The area of the lesion (mm\n2\n) was first calculated by outlining the inferred area of missing cortical tissue for each section (typically 5\u20137) and then by summing the lesions obtained, as reported previously.\n25\n,\n26\n,\n32\n\nData analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed on data collected by observers blinded to treatment conditions using Statview 5.0.1 software. The motor and cognitive data were analyzed by repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Acute neurological assessments and swim speed were analyzed by one-factor ANOVAs. When the overall ANOVAs revealed a significant effect, the Newman-Keuls\npost hoc\ntest was used to determine specific group differences. The data are presented as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM) and are considered significant when corresponding\np\nvalues are \u22640.05."

    "Methods": "All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the National Institues of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Henry Ford Health System.\n\nAnimal model and experimental groups\nThe controlled cortical impact (CCI) TBI animal model employed has been previously described.\n49\n,\n50\nBriefly, male Wistar rats (300\u2013350\u2009g,\nn\n=\u200930) were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (350\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) and their rectal temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C with a feedback-regulated water-heating pad. The head of each animal was mounted in a stereotactic frame and two 10\u2009mm diameter craniotomies, one in each hemisphere, were performed adjacent to the central suture, midway between lambda and bregma, leaving the dura mater over the cortex intact. The left craniotomy confined the location of experimental impact whereas the right one allowed for the lateral movement of cortical tissue. Using a CCI device, a unilateral brain injury was induced by delivering a single impact at a velocity of 4\u2009m/sec reaching a depth of 2.5\u2009mm below the dura mater layer to the left cortex with a pneumatic piston containing a 6\u2009mm diameter tip. Following the operation, the bone flap was replaced and sealed with bone wax, and the skin was sutured. For analgesia, Buprenex (0.05\u2009mg/kg, s.q.) was administered to each animal after brain injury.\nTo investigate how cell therapy benefits structural remodeling and whether acute cell engraftment advances the therapeutic effect compared with delayed intervention, strategies previously proven efficient in improvement of neurological function, including cell type, dose, and treatment time point,\n49\n,\n50\nhad been used.\nMSCs are a mixed cell population, including stem and progenitor cells.\n46\nThe hMSCs were provided by Theradigm (Baltimore, MD). The cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) prior to injection into rats, which was performed at 6\u2009h or 1 week post-TBI. Rats subjected to brain injury were randomized to one of four treatment groups, 6\u2009h cell-treated (\nn\n=\u200910), 1 week cell-treated (\nn\n=\u200910), 6\u2009h saline-treated (\nn\n=\u20095), and 1 w saline-treated (\nn\n=\u20095) groups. Anesthesia was reinstituted before the transplantation and a bolus of the cell suspension (\u223c 3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n6\nhMSCs in 1\u2009mL PBS) was slowly infused over a 5\u2009min period into the tail vein of each rat in the cell-treated groups using a Hamilton syringe. The needle was left in place for 1\u2009min before withdrawal to minimize cell leakage, and the injection site was compressed for a short time to reduce bleeding. Replacing the cell suspension with the same amount of saline, each animal in the saline-treated groups underwent the identical procedure as those in the cell-treated groups.\n\nDiffusion entropy\nDiffusion anisotropy is a direct consequence of biological barriers and hindrances the water molecules experience as they passively diffuse. These diffusing molecules probe, on a microscopic scale, the underlying tissue structure.\n31\nShannon entropy provides a measure of uncertainty or randomness based on information theory. By applying Shannon entropy to investigate the diffusion-weighted data, it was hypothesized that tissue types with varying degrees of diffusion anisotropy could be differentiated based on their underlying information content, with a higher entropy or uncertainty reflecting a severer diffusion anisotropy. Diffusion entropy, E, was calculated pixel by pixel using the following formula:\n19\nwhere\nD\nis the set of all gradient directions in q-ball sequence, and\np(x\ni\n,d\nj\n)\nis the probability of the MRI signal attenuation value being repeated throughout\nD\nas a result of water displacement along a certain spatial orientation\nd\nj\nfor pixel\nx\ni\n, and the MRI signal attenuation value for pixel\nx\ni\nin diffusion direction\nd\nj\nis calculated by dividing its diffusion-weighted signal intensity by pixel\nx\ni\n's diffusion-free (b\u2009=\u20090\u2009sec/mm\n2\n) signal intensity.\n\nMRI and data processing\nMRI was performed using ClinScan 7T system (Siemens, Erlanger, Germany). The animal was securely fixed on an MR-compatible holder equipped with a nose cone for administration of anesthetic gases and stereotaxic ear bars to immobilize the head. For reproducible positioning of the animal in the magnet, a fast gradient echo imaging sequence was used at the beginning of each MRI session. During image acquisition, anesthesia was maintained by a gas mixture of 1.0\u20131.5% isoflurane in medical air (1.0 L/min), and rectal temperature was kept at 37\u2009\u00b1\u20091.0\u00b0C using a feedback-controlled water bath (YSI Inc, Yellow Springs, OH) underneath the animal. T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and DTI were acquired for all animals 1 day pre-TBI, 1 day post-TBI and then weekly for 3 weeks. All rats were killed after the final\nin vivo\nMRI scans.\nT2WI was acquired using a multi-slice (13 slices, 1\u2009mm thick), multi-echo (6 echoes) sequence with echo times (TE) of 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90\u2009ms and a repetition time (TR) of 4.5\u2009sec. Images were produced with a 32\u2009\u00d7\u200932\u2009mm\n2\nfield of view (FOV) and a 128\u2009\u00d7\u200964 image matrix. Q-ball DTI was accomplished using a single-shot spin-echo echo-planer sequence with one baseline of b\u2009=\u20090\u2009sec/mm\n2\nand 64 diffusion directional measurements at b\u2009=\u20091500\u2009sec/mm\n2\n(32\u2009\u00d7\u200932\u2009mm\n2\nFOV, 128\u2009\u00d7\u2009128 image matrix, 13 slices (1\u2009mm thick), TE\u2009=\u200950\u2009ms, TR\u2009=\u200910\u2009sec).\nFA and entropy maps were generated using DTIstudio (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) and an in-house software, respectively. Whereas T2 maps were calculated on a voxel-wise basis by linear least-squares fit of the logarithm of the signal intensity versus TE (Eigentool Image Analysis Software, Henry Ford Health System, MI), the orientation distribution function at each voxel was computed from q-ball imaging with Camino (Microstructure Imaging Group, University College London, London, UK).\nBefore quantification and analysis, the image distortion induced by eddy currents during diffusion measurement has to be rectified. For this task, an image registration software known as bUnwarpJ,\n51\nwhich was designed to align pairs of images distorted by both physical and acquisition-related distortions, was used. The approach combines the ideas of elastic and consistent image registration and minimizes the similarity error between the target and source image after imposing a consistency constraint. As a bidirectional registration, the algorithm calculates deformation fields for both direct (from source image to target image) and inverse (from target image to source image) transformation simultaneously. All slices of FA and entropy map (source image) were registered onto their corresponding slices of T2 map (target image), which served as reference for delineating the particularly targeted regions. Because the values of FA and entropy may change after registration procedure, the quantification was not performed on the registered image. Instead, the lesion and boundary regions of interest (ROIs) based on target image (T2 map) were inversely transformed to source image (original FA and entropy map) where the estimation was conducted.\nAs shown in\nFigure 1\n, cortical lesion was present on T2 as a hyperintensive area (arrow in\nFig. 1A\n). Two distinct microstructural changes were revealed on both FA and entropy as a reduced lesion area with elevated boundary regions (red arrows in\nFig. 1B and C\n). In these pericontusional cortex regions, WM reorganization was present after injury, which was confirmed by histological observation (\nFig. 1D\n). To track the structural remodeling and compare the treatment effect (6\u2009h cell or 1 week cell vs. saline) in this specific boundary region, the lesion was identified on a T2 map using a threshold value\n49\n,\n50\nprovided by pre-injury scan. An ROI, encompassing the boundary region with apparent signal increase on FA and entropy map, was created by expanding the outline of the lesion 6 pixels outward in the cortex area (\nFig. 1E\n, Eigentool). Values of FA and entropy were monitored in both the lesion and boundary region. For each animal, measurements were performed at observation time points post-TBI, and data were normalized to FA or entropy values of the homogeneous tissue areas provided by its pre-injury scan.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nRepresentative section of a 6\u2009h cell-treated animal (3 weeks post-traumatic brain injury [TBI]) showing white matter (WM) reorganization and region of interest (ROI) creation. Cortex lesion exhibits hyperintensive area on T2 map\n(A)\n, which corresponds to the hypointensive area on the fractional anisotropy (FA) map\n(B)\n, indicative of structural disruption. The hyperintensities on the FA map are detected in the cortex regions near the lesion (red arrows in\nB\n). A similar pattern is present on the entropy map (red arrows in\nC\n). Bielshowsky's silver and Luxol fast blue (B+LFB) stain (\nD\n, scale bars\u2009=\u2009500\u2009\u03bcm) reveals that these pericontusional cortex regions contain oriented and extended bundles of axons, suggesting WM reorganization. Whereas T2 hyperintensities identify the lesion area\n(A)\n, the 6 pixel wide ROIs immediately adjacent to the lesion encompass the lesion boundary regions with structural remodeling\n(E)\n.\n\nModified neurological severity score\nThe modified neurological severity score (mNSS)\n52\ngrades the composite neurological function of an animal on motor (muscle status and abnormal movement), sensory (visual, tactile, and proprioceptive), reflex and balance tests. One point is awarded for the inability of an animal to perform the tasks correctly or for the lack of a tested reflex (normal score: 0; maximal deficit score: 18). Therefore, the higher the score, the more severe the neurological dysfunction. mNSS was assessed for each animal 1 day pre-TBI, 1 and 4 days post-TBI, and weekly thereafter by an examiner blinded to the treatment groups and the corresponding MRI results.\n\nTissue preparation and histological evaluation\nImmediately after the final\nin vivo\nMRI measurements at 3 weeks after TBI, rats were anesthetized intraperitoneally with 4% chloral hydrate, and perfused transcardially first with saline solution, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M PBS (pH 7.4). Their brains were removed, post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 2 days, and then cut into seven standard coronal blocks (2\u2009mm) on a rodent brain matrix. A series of adjacent sections (6\u2009\u03bcm) was sliced with a microtome from each block embedded in paraffin and stained for histological evaluation.\nTo detect the axonal fiber tracts, a double staining, Bielshowsky's silver and Luxol fast blue (B+LFB) staining, was performed to demonstrate axons and myelin, respectively. For Bielshowsky's silver staining, sections were first incubated in 20% silver nitrate in the dark, followed by adding ammonium hydroxide until the tissues turned brown with a gold background. The sections were then treated with sodium thiosulfate. Finally, sections were stained in Luxol fast blue solution, washed in 95% alcohol, and placed in lithium carbonate. Under a light microscope, myelin appears as blue whereas axons are black on the stained tissue slice.\nFor axon quantification, the density of the immunoreactive area along the lesion boundary zone was measured under the microscope using 20\u00d7 objective. Data were collected in the pericontusional cortex regions (as indicated in\nFig. 1E\n) from six fields (three fields per side)\n49\nand presented as the average percentage of positive area.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using SAS (Cary, NC, version 9.2). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was employed to compare the group difference in MRI measurements (lesion volume, FA, and entropy) and functional assessments (mNSS) with the independent factor of treatment and dependent factor of time. The treatment effect on mNSS was conducted based on the ranked data, because the data were not normally distributed. Analysis began with testing the treatment group and time interaction, followed by testing the group difference at each time point and the time effect for each treatment group if the interaction or the overall group/time effect was detected at the 0.05 level. A subgroup analysis would be considered if the interaction or main effect of group/time was not at the 0.05 level. Density of the immunoreactive area was analyzed by two sample\nt\ntest. Results are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error (SE). Statistical significance was inferred for\np\n\u2264\u20090.05."

The study protocol and procedures were approved by an Institutional Review Board at each site and met the exception from informed consent requirements for emergency medical research under Food and Drug Administration code of regulations 21 CFR 50.24.7.\n\nStudy subjects\nEligibility criteria to undergo neuropsychological testing included being seen for follow-up within a 6 month post-injury window (\u00b130 days) and receiving a score of \u226575 on the Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test (GOAT).\n9\nThis cutoff score was used to ensure that subjects were not disoriented and confused, which would have affected their ability to complete the measures.\n\nStudy outcomes\nOur study protocol, initiated in 2010, incorporated the recommendations of an expert TBI outcomes panel\n10\n,\n11\nto include a brief yet sensitive neuropsychological battery to balance subject tolerance and completion with the ability to detect group differences. The 45-min battery was designed to evaluate the cognitive domains commonly affected in survivors of moderate to severe TBI including memory, attention, executive functioning, and language.\nEpisodic memory was assessed using the six trial Buschke Selective Reminding Memory Test\n12\nin which subjects were read a list of 12 words and were reminded on each subsequent trial only of those words not recalled on the previous trial. Total immediate word recall and 20\u2009min delayed word recall were the dependent variables collected.\nAttention was evaluated via the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III Digit Span\n13\nForward subtest, requiring repetition of increasingly longer number sequences, and the Trail Making Test,\n14\nPart A, involving visual-motor sequencing of numbers under timed conditions. Dependent variables were the number of successful trials for Digit Span Forward, and the completion time and number of errors for the Trail Making Test Part A.\nExecutive functioning was measured by backward repetition of increasingly longer number sequences via the Digit Span Backward task, and alternating between sequencing numbers and letters under timed conditions on the Trail Making Test Part B. Dependent variables were the number of successful trials on Digit Span Backward, and completion time and number of errors on the Trail Making Test Part B. Language was examined using a phonemic fluency test, Controlled Oral Word Association,\n15\nrequiring the rapid generation of words beginning with specific letters. Total number of correct responses (excluding proper names and the same words with different endings) was the dependent variable. Fine motor coordination and dexterity were examined for the dominant and nondominant hands separately using the Grooved Pegboard Test\n16\nrequiring rapid placement of pegs under timed conditions. Dependent variables were the number of seconds to complete the task and the number of peg drops.\n\nStudy procedure\nThe neuropsychological battery was administered in a fixed order across sites by outcome examiners who were blinded to treatment versus placebo group assignment. Training to administer these measures and data collection were overseen by the ProTECT Central Neuropsychologists (AFC, FCG). All 6 month testing sessions were video recorded. The Central Neuropsychologists reviewed 100% of the first five evaluations completed by each site study examiner (including review of source documents and data entry) at a minimum. The Central Neuropsychologists were also blinded to treatment versus placebo group assignment.\nFeedback after every evaluation regarding any administration issues and/or scoring errors was provided to the examiner. Administration and scoring errors were corrected on both the source documents and the online database by the site study examiner, and these corrections were verified by the assigned Central Neuropsychologist. Additional evaluations were reviewed if needed until the assigned Central Neuropsychologist was confident that the examiner was proficient. Review was then reduced to a random sample of 10% of the recorded evaluations.\nThe site study examiners assigned recorded reliability code values for every test to specify whether test administration was standard and reliable, highly irregular, or not done. If the code assigned was \u201chighly irregular\u201d or \u201cnot done,\u201d the examiner recorded the reason(s), including whether the subject was too cognitively impaired, too physically impaired, or if there was a problem unrelated to the subject's ability (e.g., examiner error). This coding allowed for a determination of whether tests were incomplete because of a neurologic reason associated with the brain injury.\n\nStatistical analyses\nThe hypothesis of better outcomes for the progesterone group was evaluated in a number of ways. First, the groups were compared with respect to their ability to undergo neuropsychological testing at 6 months. Next, the groups were compared with respect to the mean differences in their test scores. Finally, each subject was classified as having a favorable or unfavorable outcome on a specific test as follows: the raw score of the subject on a test was converted to a z-score by using the demographically adjusted mean and standard deviation of nonhead injured subjects on that same test.\n17\u201322\nSubjects with a z-score of \u2265 \u22121 on a test were said to have a favorable outcome on that test, whereas subjects with a z-score of < \u22121 were said to have an unfavorable outcome on that test. We compared the groups with respect to the proportions of unfavorable outcomes on each test.\nAnalyses of covariance were used to compare groups with respect to continuous data (i.e., test scores) and chi-square tests to compare groups with respect to discrete outcomes (i.e., favorable vs. unfavorable outcome). The threshold significance level using a false discovery rate approximation was adjusted (\na[m\u2009+\u20091]/2m)\n, where a is the original conventional threshold of 0.05, and m is the number of tests.\n23\nTherefore, with 13 dependent variables for each distinct set of analyses (continuous, dichotomous), a threshold significance level of 0.026 was used.\nTests that received a reliability code of \u2018\u2018too cognitively impaired\u2019\u2019 were included in the analyses because they implied a poor outcome from the brain injury. In these cases, the worst score for the entire sample was substituted for missing data.\n7\nValues coded as missing for noncognitive reasons were excluded from the analyses."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nForty-eight adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) weighing 300\u2013325\u2009g on the day of surgery were housed in standard steel-wire mesh cages and maintained in a temperature (21\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C) and light (on 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.) controlled environment with food and water available\nad libitum\n. After 1 week of acclimatization, all rats underwent a single day of beam walk training, which consisted of 3\u20135 trials to traverse the beam. On the day of surgery, the rats were pre-assessed on the beam balance and beam walk tasks to determine baseline performance. Following training the rats were randomly assigned to one of the following group conditions: TBI+standard [STD]+vehicle [VEH] (1.0\u2009mL/kg;\nn\n=\u20098), TBI+STD+MPH (5\u2009mg/kg;\nn\n=\u20098), TBI+EE+VEH (\nn\n=\u20098), TBI+EE+MPH (\nn\n=\u20098), Sham+STD+VEH (\nn\n=\u20094), Sham+STD+MPH (\nn\n=\u20094), Sham+EE+VEH (\nn\n=\u20094), or Sham+EE+MPH (\nn\n=\u20094).\nAll experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Pittsburgh. Every attempt was made to limit the number of rats used and to minimize suffering.\n\nSurgery\nA CCI injury was produced as described previously.\n28\u201332\n,\n34\n,\n44\nBriefly, surgical anesthesia was induced and maintained with inspired concentrations of 4% and 2% isoflurane, respectively, in 2:1\u2009N\n2\nO:O\n2\n. After endotracheal intubation, the rats were secured in a stereotaxic frame, ventilated mechanically, and core temperature was maintained at 37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u00b0C with a heating blanket. Using aseptic procedures, a midline scalp incision was made, the skin and fascia were reflected to expose the skull, and a craniectomy (6-mm in diameter) was made in the right hemisphere (encompassing bregma and lambda and between the sagittal suture and the coronal ridge) with a hand-held trephine. The bone flap was removed and the craniectomy was enlarged further with cranial rongeurs.\nSubsequently, the impacting rod was extended and the impact tip (6\u2009mm, flat) was centered and lowered through the craniectomy until it touched the dura mater; then the rod was retracted and the impact tip was advanced 2.8\u2009mm farther to produce a brain injury of moderate severity (2.8\u2009mm tissue deformation at 4\u2009m/sec). Immediately after the CCI, anesthesia was discontinued, and the incision was promptly sutured. The rats were subsequently extubated and assessed for acute neurological outcome. Sham rats underwent similar surgical procedures but were not subjected to the impact.\n\nAcute neurological evaluation\nHindlimb reflexive ability was assessed immediately after the cessation of anesthesia by gently squeezing the rat's paw every 5\u2009sec and recording the time to elicit a withdrawal response. Return of the righting reflex was determined by the time needed to turn from the supine to the prone position.\n\nHousing conditions: Environmental manipulation\nAfter surgery and after the effects of anesthesia abated (as evidenced by spontaneous movement in the holding cage), the rats were returned to the colony where those designated for enrichment were immediately placed in specifically designed steel-wire cages (91\u2009\u00d7\u200976\u2009\u00d7\u200950\u2009cm). The EE cages consisted of three levels with ladders to ambulate from one level to another and contained various toys (e.g., balls, blocks, and tubes), nesting materials (e.g., paper towels), and\nad libitum\nfood and water.\n22\n,\n23\nTo maintain novelty, the objects were rearranged every day and changed each time the cage was cleaned, which was twice per week. Ten to 12 rats, which included VEH and MPH-treated TBI and sham controls, were housed together. Rats in the STD conditions were placed in standard steel-wire mesh cages (two rats per cage) with only food and water.\n\nDrug administration\nMPH was purchased from Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St. Louis, MO) and was prepared daily by dissolving in sterile saline, which also served as the VEH. MPH (5\u2009mg/kg) or a comparable volume of VEH (1.0\u2009mL/kg) was administered intraperitoneally beginning 24\u2009h after CCI or sham injury and once daily (15\u2009min before daily behavioral testing) thereafter for a total of 19 days. The dose of MPH was selected based on a previous study from our laboratory showing cognitive efficacy after a CCI injury of similar severity.\n34\n\nMotor tasks: Beam balance and beam walk\nMotor function was assessed using well-established beam balance and beam walk tasks.\n28\u201332\nAssessment of the beam balance entails that each rat be placed onto an elevated narrow wooden beam (90\u2009cm above floor level and 1.5\u2009cm wide) and the time spent maintaining its balance is recorded for a maximum of 60\u2009sec per trial. Three trials are conducted during assessment of pre-injury baseline and subsequent test days 1\u20135. Testing on the beam walk consists of recording the elapsed time to traverse an elevated narrow wooden beam (90\u2009cm above floor level, 2.5\u2009cm wide, and 100\u2009cm in length). A maximum of 60\u2009sec was allotted to traverse the beam, with an intertrial interval of 30\u2009sec. Three trials are conducted during assessment of pre-injury baseline and subsequent test days 1\u20135. The average daily scores for each rat in each task were used in the statistical analyses.\n\nCognitive performance: Spatial learning\nSpatial learning was assessed using a Morris water maze (MWM) task\n45\nthat is sensitive to TBI-induced deficits and subsequent recovery.\n28\u201332\nBriefly, the maze consisted of a plastic pool (180\u2009cm diameter; 60\u2009cm high) filled with tap water (26\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C) to a depth of 28\u2009cm and was situated in a room with salient extra-maze cues. The platform was a clear Plexiglas stand (10\u2009cm diameter, 26\u2009cm high) that was positioned 26\u2009cm from the maze wall in the southwest quadrant and held constant for each rat.\nAcquisition of spatial learning began on post-operative day 14 and consisted of providing a block of four daily trials for 5 consecutive days (14\u201318) to locate the platform when it was submerged 2\u2009cm below the water surface (i.e., invisible to the rat). On day 19, the platform was raised 2\u2009cm above the water surface (i.e., visible to the rat) as a control procedure to determine the contributions of nonspatial factors (e.g., sensory-motor function, motivation, and visual acuity) on cognitive performance.\nFor each daily block of trials, the rats were placed in the pool facing the wall at each of the four possible start locations (north, east, south, and west) in a quasi-randomized manner. Each trial lasted until the rat climbed onto the platform or until 120\u2009sec had elapsed, whichever occurred first. The rats that failed to locate the escape platform within the allotted time were manually guided to it. All rats remained on the platform for 30\u2009sec before being placed in a heated incubator between trials (4-min intertrial interval). The times of the four daily trials for each rat were averaged and used in the statistical analyses.\n\nCognitive performance: Memory retention\nOne day after the final acquisition training session (day 19), all rats were given a probe trial to measure retention. Briefly, the platform was removed from the pool, and the rats were placed in the MWM from the location point most distal to the quadrant where the platform was previously situated (i.e., \u201ctarget quadrant\u201d) and allowed to freely explore the pool for 30\u2009sec. Typically, rats that have learned the location of the escape platform exhibit a spatial bias and spend significantly more time in the target quadrant searching for the absent platform. The data were obtained using a spontaneous motor activity recording and tracking (SMART) system (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA).\n\nStatistical analyses\nAnalyses were performed using Statview 5.0.1 software (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA) on data collected by experimenters blinded to the pharmacological treatments. The motor and cognitive analyses were conducted using repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). The acute neurological data (i.e., hindlimb withdrawal reflex and righting reflex) as well as the data for the visible platform, probe trial, and swim speed were analyzed using one-factor ANOVAs. When the overall ANOVA revealed significant effects, the Newman-Keuls\npost hoc\ntest was used to determine specific group differences. The results are expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM) and were considered significant when\np\n\u2264\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Animal handling and preparation\nAdult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (250 to 300\u2009g) were obtained from the National Laboratory Animal Center, Taipei, Taiwan, or from Taconic (Germantown, NY) for use in studies performed within Taipei Medical University and the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute on Aging, respectively. Rats were provided food and water\nad libitum\nand were maintained on a 12\u2009h light/dark cycle in a temperature- and humidity-controlled animal center at both medical institutions.\nAll experimental protocols were performed in accordance with either (1) the Guidelines for Animal Experiments of Taipei Medical University and the Guiding Principles for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals approved by the Chinese Society of Laboratory Animal Sciences, Taiwan (LAC-100-0221), or (2) the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Intramural Research Program, National Institute on Aging (438-TGB-2016), and were in compliance with the guidelines for animal experimentation of the National Research Council (Committee for the Update of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 2011) and the National Institutes of Health (DHEW publication 85-23, revised, 1995). A minimal number of rats were used for each study, and all efforts were made to minimize potential suffering.\n\nTreatment groups\nModified surgical procedures were based on previously described methods.\n52\nAnesthetized SD rats (tiletamine/zolazepam [10\u2009mg/kg], and xylazine [2\u2009mg/kg]) were placed in a stereotaxic frame. A craniotomy (5\u2009mm in diameter) was performed in the right parietal cortex between bregma and lambda, 1\u2009mm lateral from the midline. A mild grade TBI model was induced by a controlled cortical impact (CCI) device with a velocity of 2.5\u2009m/sec at 1\u2009mm depth. Body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C \u00b1 1\u00b0C with a heating pad during surgery and afterward.\nHuman GIP or saline vehicle was delivered by a subcutaneous ALZET micro-osmotic pump that was implanted aseptically under anesthesia 2 days pre-injury. This delivered GIP over the course of 2 weeks at a rate of 21.58 or 38.85\u2009\u03bcg/kg/day. There were three experimental groups, which included (1) mTBI animals saline-treated, (2) mTBI animals treated with the lower dose of GIP (21.58\u2009\u03bcg/kg/day), and (3) mTBI animals treated with the higher dose of GIP (38.85\u2009\u03bcg/kg/day).\n\nBehavioral assessments\nSeveral behavioral tests were chosen to identify the sensorimotor and cognitive impairments in our rat mTBI model. For cognition, long-term spatial memory was assessed by the Morris water maze (MWM), whereas recognition memory was evaluated by novel object recognition (NOR). The beam walking test and the adhesive removal test were used to evaluate sensorimotor functions in the rats with mTBI.\nMWM\nThe MWM paradigm was used to evaluate long-term spatial memory.\n53\nAnimals were trained to find a hidden platform in a circular aluminum pool (150\u2009cm in diameter and 75\u2009cm deep) that was surrounded by visual cues placed at the same starting point over 5 consecutive days before mCCI. All animals were monitored by a video camera. Data were calculated by a computerized video tracking system. To test whether the function of visual acuity and muscle strength were affected after CCI, these tests were also conducted with visual water task.\n54\nNOR\nRecognition memory was evaluated using NOR, which is a task that uses a rat's innate preference to investigate a novel object versus an already known one.\n55\nFirst, rats were habituated to an open field Plexiglas arena (59\u2009\u00d7\u200959\u2009\u00d7\u200940\u2009cm) for 10\u2009min. After habituation, rats were allowed to explore two identical objects for 5\u2009min during the familiarization phase. After a 1\u2009h intertrial interval, rats were returned to the arena and allowed to explore the familiar object (F), as well as a novel object (N). A preference index (i.e., the time spent exploring the novel object over the familiar one) was calculated as a percentage as follows: %\u2009=\u2009([Time\nN\n- Time\nF\n]/[Time\nN\n+ Time\nF]\n) \u00d7 100, where F and N represent the time spent near the familiar and novel objects, respectively.\nBeam walking test\nMotor coordination was evaluated by the beam walking test.\n56\nAnimals were trained before surgery to walk along a Plexiglas beam (120\u2009cm long, 1.5\u2009cm wide) toward a home cage located at one end of the beam. The latency to walk across the beam during five test trials after mTBI was calculated as a measure of motor coordination\nAdhesive removal test\nSensorimotor function was evaluated by adhesive removal test.\n57\nRats were familiarized with the testing environment. Small dot-shaped stickers were placed on the contralateral forepaw. The time to remove the small adhesive stickers was recorded for the contralateral forelimb.\n\nBiochemical analyses\nWestern blot\nAnimals were quickly anesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone intraperitoneally (60\u2009mg/kg, Apoteksbolaget, Sweden) and then decapitated. The brain was removed, and cortical tissue was cut approximately 5\u2009mm from the mCCI lesion epicenter and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cortical samples were subsequently homogenized in a lysis buffer consisting of 50\u2009mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1\u2009mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 1% mammalian protease inhibitor. The lysate was incubated on ice for 30\u2009min and then centrifuged at 132,000 \u00d7\ng\nfor 5\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was collected and the protein concentration was determined by BCA kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL).\nFor Western blot analysis, protein samples (30\u2009\u03bcg) were resolved using a 10% polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were incubated in a blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk/1% Tween 20 in TBS) for 1\u2009h at room temperature. The membranes were then probed with specific primary antibodies (anti- \u03b2-actin, 1:2000, Chemicon; anti-GFAP, 1:1000, Chemicon; anti-BMX, 1:1000, BD Biosciences; anti-APP, 1:1000, Novus) overnight at 4\u00b0C. After a series of TBST washes, the membranes were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-rabbit or anti-mouse) for 1\u2009h at room temperature. \u03b2-actin was used as a loading control.\nProtein bands were then detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blot detection reagents (Millipore). The immunoblots were quantified by UVP (Biospectrum Imaging System).\nImmunofluorescence\nAnimals were perfused through the ascending aorta with 100\u2009mL of cold physiologic saline, followed by 100\u2009mL of ice-cold 4% w/v paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The brain was removed and post-fixed in the same fixative for 3 days followed by a series of incubations in 10%, 15%, and 30% sucrose. Sections were cut at a thickness of 30\u2009\u03bcm, placed on slides, and stored at \u221220\u00b0C.\nFor immunostaining, the sections were washed several times with PBS and then incubated in a blocking buffer of 0.3% Triton X-100 and 4% normal goat serum for 1\u2009h at room temperature. The sections were subsequently incubated with a mouse anti-GFAP antibody (reconstituted in PBS and 2% goat serum) at 4\u00b0C for 14\u201316\u2009h, and then rinsed with PBS. Thereafter, they were incubated with an Alexa Fluor 555 fluorescent antibody for 1\u2009h at room temperature. After several PBS washes, sections were mounted with Crystal Mount and analyzed by a Leica microscope. Controls consisted of omission of the primary antibody.\nGIP plasma assay\nPlasma concentrations of GIP were quantified in a parallel series of SD rats similarly implanted with a subcutaneous 2 week ALZET micro-osmotic pump containing either vehicle or the high dose GIP dose (38.85\u2009\u03bcg/kg/day,\nn\n=\u20095/group). Animals were euthanized at 7 days, and blood was taken by cardiac puncture and immediately placed into iced heparinized tubes containing an excess of DPP4 inhibitor. These were directly centrifuged (10,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009G at 4\u00b0C), the plasma removed and immediately frozen to \u221280\u00b0C. Samples were later thawed on wet ice and analyzed for human active GIP (1\u201342) by solid phase sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Immuno-Biological Laboratories (IBL)-America, Minneapolis, MN).\n\nExperimental design summary and statistical analyses\nIn our mTBI rat model, we investigated the effects of human GIP on behavioral impairments and mTBI-related cellular mechanisms (\nFig. 1\n). Behavioral assessments and biochemical analyses were used to evaluate the therapeutic effects of GIP at multiple time points post-mTBI. Rats were initially pre-trained in each behavioral assay for at least 2 days to generate baseline data. Animals were then categorized into three groups: saline, and low or high dose of GIP.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSchematic diagram of behavioral assessments and biochemical analyses forrats with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) treated with vehicle or glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). GIP and sham treatments were delivered by implanted micro-osmotic pumps for 2 weeks implanted 2 days before injury. Behavioral tests included the beam walking test, the adhesive removal test, and the Morris water maze, which were performed on day 1, 4, 7, and every week after mTBI injury to evaluate a time course of the treatment effects. Biochemical evaluations were performed on days 1, 7, and 14 post-TBI lesion to identify any neuroprotective effects after GIP treatment.\nTwo days before mTBI injury, mTBI rats were treated with 21.58 or 38.85\u2009\u03bcg/kg/day GIP over the course of 2 consecutive weeks delivered subcutaneously under steady-state conditions via an aseptically implanted mini pump. For functional outcomes, cognition and motor function were assessed on the fourth day post-injury, then at weekly intervals up to 4 weeks post-injury (i.e., 7, 14, 21, 28 days post-injury) using the same test conditions.\nFurther, to examine the possible regulatory mechanisms underlying GIP's neuroprotective effects after mTBI, we used Western blots and immunofluorescence to evaluate astrocytic activation, inflammatory responses, and axonal injury. Brains were collected at 1, 7, and 14 days post-injury for biochemical analyses.\nData were analyzed using SPSS (version 11.0) and are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean values. The effects of GIP on mTBI were evaluated by a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVARM), with \u201cgroup\u201d as a between-subjects factor and \u201ctime\u201d as a within-subject factor. For the long-term effects on locomotion and behavioral scores, a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) assessed several time points (\u201cpre- and post-injury intervention\u201d) as the within-subjects factor and \u201ctreatment\u201d (saline, low and high doses of GIP) as the between-subjects factor. Paired\nt\ntests were performed on the follow-up data.\nPost hoc\nFisher least significant difference tests were used to compare between groups, as required. Effects were considered to be significant if\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Recruitment\nParticipants were obtained from a natural history study following a cohort of subjects with non-penetrating TBI. Recruitment was carried out from 2011\u20132015 via the National Institutes of Health Patient Recruitment and Public Liaison Office, the Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine Recruitment Core, and advertisements displayed in the community. Participants were eligible for the natural history study if they were: 1) 18 years of age or older; 2) diagnosed with a non-penetrating TBI; 3) able to provide informed; and 4) enrolled within the first year from injury. Participants were excluded if they had a contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, were unable to read or speak sufficient English to complete the clinical phenotyping assessments, or had medical or psychological instability where they could not reasonably complete the study requirements. Participants were evaluated at 30 days, 90 days, 180 days, and 1 year post-injury and annually thereafter for up to 5 years. A cross-sectional enrollment option was offered to participants who were more than 1 year out from their injury or were unable to commit to longitudinal visits. Similar inclusion and exclusion criteria applied to cross-sectional participants, except that the evaluation had to be conducted within 5 years post-injury. All subjects were seen by our study physician who performed a history and physical and reviewed medical records when available from the subject.\n\nParticipants\nSubjects included in this study were classified as having sustained a mild TBI using the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense TBI severity rating scale\n25\nor a complicated mTBI if they met criteria for mTBI but had positive (MRI findings. All subjects passed effort tests to ensure score validity. Subjects were dichotomized into two groups based on their highest score on the PTSD Checklist (PCL). A cut-off score of 26 or lower qualified subjects for the mTBI group. Subjects endorsing high PTSD symptoms, as defined by a score of 44 or higher, were grouped into the PTSD positive group (mTBI/PTSD). All subjects in the mTBI/PTSD group, with the exception of three, had also undergone behavioral therapy and/or a course of medication for the treatment of PTSD symptoms. The Beck Depression Inventory II and the Brief Symptom Inventory 18 Anxiety Subscale were used as screening tools to exclude subjects who were symptomatic for co-morbid depression or anxiety. Additionally, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) was used to screen for alcohol misuse. An AUDIT score of 8 and above identified subjects at risk for alcohol misuse. Of these, two subjects were removed due to history of alcohol dependence. Subjects also were screened for the use of illicit drugs. Subjects with large parenchymal lesions were excluded from this study due to potential for miscalculation of brain volumes in FreeSurfer. Finally, because the mTBI/PTSD group was further out from their injury, the evaluation for the time-point with the highest PCL score was used for the mTBI/PTSD group and the most recent evaluation was used for the mTBI-only group.\n\nMeasures\nAll subjects completed a battery of neuropsychological tests and self-report measures evaluating the following domains: attention and concentration, executive functioning, learning and memory, processing speed, and effort.

Strong diagnostic sensitivity (0.944) and specificity (0.864) of the PCL has been well documented in relation to the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), with a PCL suggested cut-off score of 44.\n26\nThe Ohio State University TBI Identification instrument was used to collect information regarding subject history of prior TBI.\n\nImage acquisition\nVolumetric analysis was performed using T1-weighted Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) scans acquired on a Siemens Biograph MR 3T scanner. Images were segmented using the longitudinal pipeline within the FreeSurfer software package (version 5.3)\n27\nwith some minor modifications to the preprocessing steps. Briefly, images were corrected for intensity non-uniformity using the N4ITK algorithm,\n28\nthen skull stripped using SPECTRE.\n29\nThe following regions of interest (ROIs) were selected and analyzed: anterior cingulate, middle frontal, lateral orbito-frontal, medial orbito-frontal, entorhinal, middle temporal, and parahippocampal gyri, as well as the amygdala and hippocampus.\nDiffusion weighted images were acquired with parameters repetition time\u2009=\u2009, msec, echo time\u2009=\u200998\u2009msec, flip angle\u2009=\u200990 degrees, voxel size\u2009=\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009mm, matrix size\u2009=\u2009128\u2009\u00d7\u2009128, and slices\u2009=\u200975. The acquisition included 10 images at b\u2009=\u20090\u2009sec/mm\n2\n, 10 images with non-collinear directional gradients at b\u2009=\u2009300\u2009sec/mm\n2\n, and 60 images with non-collinear directional gradients at b\u2009=\u20091100\u2009sec/mm\n2\n. Images were processed using the CATNAP software previously described for tensor estimation.\n30\nBriefly, images were preprocessed for motion and eddy current correction, with adjustments to the gradient table performed based on subject position. Linear tensor estimation was performed followed by computation of FA, axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) and segmentation of white matter tracts with the DOTS software. Based on the literature, we selected two\na priori\nfiber bundles: cingulum bundle and uncinate fasciculus.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 22. Independent\nt\n-tests were performed to compare age, education, premorbid IQ, days since injury, and PCL score between subjects with mTBI and mTBI/PTSD. Due to significant differences in mean age between clinical groups, age was used as a covariate for all subsequent imaging analyses. Analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were applied to analyze volumetric and structural connectivity differences between mTBI and mTBI/PTSD subjects. Controlling for intracranial volume and age, we analyzed volumes of frontal and temporal areas, as well as sub-cortical structures (i.e. amygdala and hippocampus). Controlling for age, ANCOVAs also were used to analyze the DTI fibers tracts of interest. Based on findings related to processing speed, we performed\npost hoc\nANCOVAs to analyze two more fiber bundles, namely the inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculi. Two subjects from the mTBI/PTSD group and four subjects from the mTBI only group were excluded from DTI analysis due to incomplete DTI scanning. Finally, to analyze neuropsychological variables, ANCOVAs were used to compare performance between groups on Trail Making Test (TMT) A, TMT B, Working Memory Index, Processing Speed Index (PSI), California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) Free Recall, and CVLT Long Delay Free Recall. ANCOVAs also were applied to other neuropsychological measures (i.e., Booklet Category Test total errors and Seashore Rhythm Test), though these measures were not obtained from every cross-sectional subject. Due to the exploratory nature of the present study, we did not correct for multiple comparisons. Thus, findings should be interpreted with caution as they are meant to inform further research rather than to be generalized across the mTBI population."

    "Methods": "To establish guidelines for animal cyclic loading conditions, four volunteers (two male, two female) were asked to shake an instrumented 1.5-month-old human infant surrogate with at least 10 maximal-effort shakes without impact. This surrogate used for the shakes was our most recently published surrogate45with average weight for age, and more life-like skull, suture, and neck properties than our earlier published surrogate24with a unidirectional hinge neck. The surrogate was instrumented with a 9-linear accelerometer array (7264B-2000, Endevco) and an angular velocity transducer (ARS-01, ATA Sensors) to measure three-dimensional head rotations at a sampling rate of 5\u2009kHz. Motion capture (sampled at 100\u2009Hz) was used in conjunction with the surrogate instrumentation to visualize and quantify head and thorax kinematics during shaking.\n\nThe volunteers moved the torso in a manner that created predominantly sagittal head rotations, but the multidirectional neck allowed unrestricted rotation in all three planes. Only the accelerations associated with sagittal rotations were extracted to compare with our previously published shaking data using surrogates with hinge24and rubber23necks. An example of the head motion resulting from one of these shaking episodes is shown inFigure 1.\n\nAs might be expected, there was a large variability between shakes and across subjects. Averaging across the episodes and volunteers, the average sagittal (\u00b1 standard deviation [SD]) head rotational velocity was 47.12\u2009\u00b1\u200913.96\u2009rad/sec, angular acceleration was 1512\u2009\u00b1\u20091295\u2009rad/sec2, and frequency was 2.19\u2009\u00b1\u20090.49\u2009Hz. Similar to our earliest study showing significantly smaller accelerations for a rubber flexible neck than a hinge neck,23the velocity, acceleration, and frequency with our new, more biofidelic neck were lower than the 61\u2009\u00b1\u20099.6\u2009rad/sec, 3480\u2009\u00b1\u20092467\u2009rad/sec2, and 3.08\u2009\u00b1\u20091.00\u2009Hz achieved, respectively, with the low-resistance hinge neck of our previous surrogate that restricted movement to purely sagittal head rotations.24\n\nThe average infant surrogate kinematics were scaled from the 500\u2009g young infant human brain46to the 40\u2009g infant piglet brain using conventional mass-scaling approaches.47This calculation established that equivalent piglet rotation should have a peak-to-peak rotational velocity of 109\u2009rad/sec and an acceleration of 8141\u2009rad/sec2to produce similar brain tissue deformations during vigorous shaking at approximately 2\u20133\u2009Hz.\n\nAcceleration and velocity are kinematic byproducts of the rotational excursion of the head and the time course of that motion. The objective of our study was to exclude cervical spine hyperflexion and hyperextension effects, and focus on isolating the pathological effects of repetitive brain motion. Given the narrower physiologic range of the piglet cervical spine and our focus on comparing single head rotations with repetitive head rotation at cycling frequencies of 2\u20133\u2009Hz, the resulting accelerations and velocities (presented in Results) were similar to the unscaled measurements of the infant surrogate, but lower than average human infant values scaled to the smaller piglet brain.\n\nAll animal protocols were approved by the Institute of Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania. Immature piglets (3\u20135 days old) were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane via a snout mask. Once fully anesthetized, as determined through absence of a pinch reflex, animals were intubated and maintained under anesthesia with 2\u20133% isoflurane. Oxygen saturation, end tidal CO2, rectal temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate were continuously monitored during anesthesia.\n\nAnimals were mounted to the bite plate of a mechanical rotation device (Fig. 2) and underwent either a repetitive back and forth head rotation (cyclic), a single head rotation (noncyclic), or no head rotation (sham). Head rotations were constrained to physiological range of motions with the center of rotation in the cervical spine. Animals experiencing a cyclic head rotation were assigned to three possible cyclic patterns: continuous, double continuous, or episodic. Each of these loading conditions is described in detail below.\n\nAnimals were euthanized at 6\u2009h, 24\u2009h, or 6 days after head rotation or sham anesthesia (Table 1). Animals surviving 6\u2009h were anesthetized for the entire 6 hours. Animals surviving 24\u2009h or more were weaned from anesthesia, extubated, and returned to veterinary care after demonstrating capability to ambulate readily to food and water sources.\n\nIn animals undergoing cyclic head rotation and surviving for \u226524\u2009h, cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured just before sacrifice. A 2-mm hole was created using a hand drill approximately 2\u2009mm anterior to the coronal suture and 2\u2009mm left of the sagittal suture. A thermal diffusion probe (Bowman Perfusion Monitor, Hemedex, Cambridge, MA) was inserted approximately 5\u20137\u2009mm into the cortex to access the subcortical white matter. Once stabilized, 30\u2009sec of continuous measurements were recorded. The average measurement over this 30\u2009sec time frame, expressed in units of mL/min per 100\u2009g of tissue, was used for statistical analysis. All animals were sacrificed by a lethal intravenous injection of pentobarbital, and brains were perfusion fixed as described previously.14\n\nHead rotation mechanics\nContinuous cyclic rotation (\nn\n=\u200925)\nThe snout of the animal was attached to a mechanical system designed to apply a back and forth head rotation through a \u00b130-degree sagittal arc or \u00b150-degree right-to-left lateral (axial) arc, with 0 degrees defined as the neutral axis position of the neck. This back-and-forth head rotation was applied at a frequency of 2\u20133\u2009Hz until the total time duration (10 or 30\u2009sec) was reached (\nFig. 3A\n). Subjects thus experienced 30\u201390 back-and-forth head rotations during this interval. Animals were sacrificed at 6\u2009h (group B), 24\u2009h (groups C, D) or 6 days (group F) after the cyclic head rotation. Details about group sizes are provided in\nTable 1\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\n(\nA\n) Representative velocity-time curve for 30\u2009sec continuous cyclic head rotation. (\nB\n) Representative velocity-time curve for episodic cyclic head rotation (group A).\nDouble continuous cyclic rotation (\nn\n=\u20099)\nA 30-sec continuous axial cyclic head rotation was performed as described above. Animals were recovered, returned to the housing facility, re-anesthetized 24\u2009h later, and exposed to a second 30-sec continuous axial cyclic head rotation (group E). Animals in this group were sacrificed 24\u2009h after the second cyclic head rotation.\nEpisodic cyclic rotation (n\u2009=\u20095)\nEpisodic head rotations were similar to the continuous cyclic head rotations, but the 30\u2009sec cyclic rotation was interrupted by pauses to simulate repeated episodes of shorter bursts of shaking activity. Specifically, continuous rotations were applied for 6\u2009sec, followed by pauses lasting 30\u2009sec. This pattern repeated five times. The total event duration was 2.5\u2009min, consisting of a total of 30\u2009sec of cyclic head rotation (group A,\nFig. 3B\n).\nSingle (non-cyclic) rotation (\nn\n=\u200911)\nUsing our previously published nonimpact head rotation device,\n19\nanimals experienced a single head rotation through a 60-degree sagittal arc starting with the neck in full flexion and ending with the neck in full extension. The lower velocity limit of the single rotation device was used to achieve angular velocities comparable to those of the cyclic device. There was no return of the head to the original starting position. Similar to the cyclic rotations, animals surviving 6\u2009h remained anesthetized for the entire 6\u2009h (\nn\n=\u20095, group G). Animals surviving 24\u2009h after a single head rotation (\nn\n=\u20096, group H) were weaned from anesthesia and returned to the animal facility.\nShams (n\u2009=\u20094)\nSham animals were anesthetized and attached to the bite plate of the cyclic device, but their heads were not rotated. Two of the shams survived for 6\u2009h (with continuous anesthesia) to serve as uninjured controls for groups A, B, and G. Two additional shams were weaned from anesthesia and returned to the animal facility. Animals were re-anesthetized 24\u2009h later for CBF measurement, and then euthanized to serve as controls for the animals in the 24\u2009h post-injury survival groups C, D, E, and H.\n\nTissue processing and injury assessment\nExtra-axial hemorrhage (EAH)\nTo quantify the extent of EAH, digital color images were taken of the brain immediately after brain removal. Care was taken to include any blood in the subdural space at the time of brain removal. These images captured any subdural or subarachnoid hemorrhage present at sacrifice, but did not distinguish between the two hemorrhage types. Images spanned four fields of view (apical, basal, rostral, caudal). After compensating for regions appearing in more than one view, the total image area of brain covered by blood in the cerebrum was summed in all views and divided by the total area of the cerebrum to define the cerebrum EAH score (%). This process was repeated for the cerebellum to identify the cerebellum EAH score. The total brain EAH score was the injured surface area of the cerebrum and cerebellum divided by the total brain surface area.\nAxonal injury and red cell neuronal/axonal change (RCNAC)\nTo quantify the injury within the cerebrum, the perfusion-fixed brains were sectioned into 3\u2009mm-thick coronal blocks through the cerebrum and brainstem, processed and embedded in paraffin, and 6\u2009\u03bcm-thick sections from every block were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (\u03b2-APP) immunohistochemical marker. Immunohistochemical sections were lightly counterstained with Mayer hematoxylin. Regions of \u03b2-APP reactivity were marked on digital images of each brain section by the neuropathologist (CS) masked to the injury group, as described previously,\n36\nand used to denote AI.\nIschemic AI identified with \u03b2-APP was not included as part of the overall AI. Instead, H&E sections were used to quantify axonal ischemia using RCNAC. Positive RCNAC findings were marked separately on the digital images. The marked regions of AI and RCNAC were digitized to obtain an injured area in each slice, and the boundary of every brain slice was digitized to obtain the total brain area. Volume of AI and RCNAC was defined as the sum of the injured areas across all slices divided by the sum of all the brain slice areas.\nOcular injury\nIndirect fundus examinations through pharmacologically dilated pupils were performed by an ophthalmologist (GB) in the anesthetized animals immediately before injury, immediately post-injury, and immediately before sacrifice. Any abnormal findings were recorded. After sacrifice and perfusion, eyes were removed\nen bloc\nand placed in a 1.25% gluteraldehyde/1% formaldehyde mixture until analyzed.\nEyes were first examined macroscopically for any signs of hemorrhage or any other ocular abnormalities. Then, the extraocular muscles and surrounding soft tissues were removed and globes were embedded in paraffin wax. Five thin (5\u2009\u03bcm) sections of each eye (one section through the pupil-optic nerve-head plane, one section each slightly superior and inferior to that plane, and one section each through the retinal periphery superior and inferior to this plane) were stained with H&E. Slides were examined for the presence or absence of ocular hemorrhage by an ocular pathologist (RLP), masked to the injury group.\n\nData analysis\nAngular velocity for all events was measured with a single axis angular rate transducer (ARS-06, ATA, Albuquerque, NM). Data were sampled at 3000\u2009Hz and filtered using a low-pass Butterworth digital filter with a cutoff frequency determined by the objective function developed by Yu and colleagues\n48\nfor kinematic data. The peak-to-peak velocity of each cyclic motion was averaged across the duration of the cyclic event, and injury group averages are reported as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of these averages. A one-way analysis of variance was used to determine whether there were significant differences in kinematics across groups.\nFor every injury group, each outcome (CBF, EAH, AI, RCNAC, and OI) was compared with the appropriate sham group using a Dunnett test or the Dunn method for nonparametric variables. Five different comparisons were performed for each outcome across groups using Pearson chi-square tests to evaluate differences in the occurrence of a positive finding, and Wilcoxon rank sum/Kruskal-Wallis tests to identify significant differences in the continuous injury variables (CBF, EAH, AI, RCNAC). The Wilcoxon test was used because continuous injury variables tended not to be normally distributed. CBF was only measured in a subset of groups (\nTable 2\n) and was therefore limited to group comparisons within the subset.\nTable\n2.\nSummary of Kinematic and Injury Data for Each Group\nFrequency (Hz)\nAngular velocity (rad/sec)\nAxonal injury (%)\nRed cell neuronal/axonal change (%)\nTotal brain EAH (%)\nCBF (mL/100\u2009g-min)\nGroup A (Episodic 6\u2009h survival)\n2.36\u2009\u00b1\u20090.32\n*\n22.96\u2009\u00b1\u20092.61\n*\n0 (0%)\n0 (0%)\n0.33\u2009\u00b1\u20090.75% (20%)\n-\nGroup B\nSAG\n(30\u2009sec continuous 6\u2009h survival)\n2.65\u2009\u00b1\u20090.24\n22.51\u2009\u00b1\u20094.33\n*\n0.014\u2009\u00b1\u20090.034% (17%)\n0 (0%)\n0.20\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08% (33%)\n-\nGroup B\nAXIAL\n(30\u2009sec continuous 6\u2009h survival)\n2.74\u2009\u00b1\u20090.23\n28.52\u2009\u00b1\u20094.05\n0 (0%)\n0 (0%)\n0 (0%)\n-\nGroup C (10\u2009sec continuous 24\u2009h survival)\n2.94\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05\n30.86\u2009\u00b1\u20090.77\n0.13\u2009\u00b1\u20090.13% (100%)\n0 (0%)\n0.54\u2009\u00b1\u20090.63% (50%)\n74.93\u2009\u00b1\u200915.87\nGroup D (30\u2009sec continuous 24\u2009h survival)\n2.86\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02\n28.54\u2009\u00b1\u20092.67\n0.067\u2009\u00b1\u20090.17% (25%)\n0.044\u2009\u00b1\u20090.052% (50%)\n2.40\u2009\u00b1\u20095.23% (50%)\n45.48\u2009\u00b1\u200920.01\nGroup E (Double continuous 24\u2009h survival)\n2.76\u2009\u00b1\u20090.17\n28.75\u2009\u00b1\u20093.02\n0.13\u2009\u00b1\u20090.16% (56%)\n0.082\u2009\u00b1\u20090.074%\n#\n(67%)\n2.70\u2009\u00b1\u20093.99% (67%)\n48.27\u2009\u00b1\u200913.80\nGroup F (30\u2009sec continuous 6 day survival)\n2.91\u2009\u00b1\u20090.10\n28.41\u2009\u00b1\u20093.87\n0.090\u2009\u00b1\u20090.085% (80%)\n0.004\u2009\u00b1\u20090.009% (25%)\n1.24\u2009\u00b1\u20092.69% (40%)\n64.53\u2009\u00b1\u200916.11\nGroup G (noncyclic 6\u2009h survival)\n-\n32.19\u2009\u00b1\u20097.04\n0 (0%)\n0 (0%)\n0 (0%)\n-\nGroup H (noncyclic 24\u2009h survival)\n-\n42.86\u2009\u00b1\u20096.45\n*\n0.028\u2009\u00b1\u20090.059% (33%)\n0 (0%)\n0 (0%)\n-\nShams\n-\n-\n0 (0%)\n0 (0%)\n0 (0%)\n58.13\u2009\u00b1\u20093.33\nOpen in a separate window\nEAH, extra-axial hemorrhage; CBF, cerebral blood flow; Sag, saggital.\n*\nSignificantly (\np\n<\u20090.05) different than other groups in column.\n#\nSignificantly (\np\n<\u20090.05) different than shams.\n-Measurement not applicable or not collected.\nAnimals without injury were given a value of zero and included in the averages \u00b1 standard deviation.

OHSCs were cultured as previously described.\n30\u201332\nBriefly, Sprague-Dawley rat pups (post-natal day [PND] 8\u201310) were rapidly decapitated, the hippocampus excised, and placed in ice-cold Gey's balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with\nd\n-glucose (4.5\u2009mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Transverse sections (400-\u03bcm-thick) were cut using a McIlwain tissue chopper (Ted Pella, Redding, CA) and then plated on polydimethylsiloxane membranes (Specialty Manufacturing, Saginaw, MI) previously coated with laminin (80\u2009\u03bcg/mL; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and poly-\nl\n-lysine (320\u2009\u03bcg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) in custom-made stainless steel wells. Cultures were initially fed Neurobasal (Life Technologies) medium supplemented with B27 (Life Technologies), GlutaMAX (2\u2009\u03bcM; Life Technologies), and\nd\n-glucose (4.5\u2009mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich). Cultures were maintained under standard culture conditions at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO\n2\n. After 3 days\nin vitro\n(DIV), the medium was changed to full serum medium containing 50% modified Eagle's medium (Sigma-Aldrich), 25% heat-inactivated horse serum (Life Technologies), 25% Hanks' balanced salt solution (Sigma-Aldrich), GlutaMAX (2\u2009\u03bcM; Life Technologies), and\nd\n-glucose (4.5\u2009mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich). Medium was changed every 2\u20133 days.\n\nIn vitro\nmodel of traumatic brain injury\nAfter 10 DIV, OHSCs cultured on silicone membranes were subjected to a moderate mechanical injury. The injury was induced by stretching the underlying silicone substrate to a predetermined strain at a pre-determined strain rate to produce the desired tissue injury under motion control. Our well-established model produces a highly accurate and reproducible injury to OHSCs.\n12\n,\n23\n,\n32\nTissue deformation was verified by image analysis of high-speed video (MotionPro; Redlake, Pasadena, CA) at 1000 frames per second.\n21\nLagrangian strain of the tissue was determined by calculating the deformation gradient tensor by locating fiduciary markers on the tissue slice before and at maximal stretch using custom MATLAB software (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA) scripts.\n21\n\nIn vivo\nmodel of traumatic brain injury\nAnimal procedures for closed-head TBI were approved by Drexel University's IACUC and were in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Animals. Brain injuries were induced using a pneumatically driven controlled cortical impact device (AmScien Incorporated, Richmond, VA) as described by Raghupathi and colleagues.\n27\nBriefly, rat pups (PND11) were anesthetized with isofluorane (2%) using a nose cone, and once a loss of a tail-pinch reflex was observed, a midline incision was made to expose the skull. The periosteum was reflected, the animal was placed in a restrainer, and the head was supported by a soft foam pad to make it level with the body. The restrainer was positioned under the cortical impact device, the nose cone was removed, and the zero-point for the indenter was made on the skull over the left parietal cortex, midway between the lambda and bregma sutures. The exposed skull was subjected to a 5-mm-diameter piston impact of 3.0\u2009mm in depth, 5\u2009m/s velocity, and 100\u2009ms in duration for moderate injury. Sham-injured animals underwent the same procedures, except that the piston was not activated. Total time from initiation of anesthesia to removal of the nose cone preceding zeroing the impactor tip was typically 5\u20136\u2009min. After recovery from injury/anesthesia, animals were reanesthetized with isofluorane for the scalp to be sutured, and pups were returned to the dam. Animals were placed on a heating pad kept at 37\u00b0C to maintain body temperature throughout the procedures and recovery.\n\nAffymetrix gene chips\nOHSC samples, including time-matched controls, were collected after the\nin vitro\nmodel of TBI at 1, 6, 12, and 24\u2009h post-injury. Whole hippocampal samples, including time-matched controls, were collected after the\nin vivo\nmodel of TBI at 1, 6, and 24\u2009h post-injury. Tissue was collected, flash frozen, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), following the manufacturer's protocols. Quality of RNA was assessed using a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Purified RNA was used to synthesize complementary (cDNA) using the HT One-Cycle cDNA Synthesis Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), following the manufacturer's protocols. Amplified complementary RNA cRNA was produced from the cDNA template using the 3\u2032 IVT Labeling Kit (Affymetrix). The cRNA was then hybridized to the Affymetrix Rat 230 2.0 chips, washed, and scanned at the Columbia Genome Center according to the manufacturer's protocols.\n\nMicroarray data analysis\nUsing custom MATLAB scripts, each array was normalized for variations in background using the robust multi-array average procedure.\n33\nAfter performing a Student's\nt\n-test between experimental groups on an individual gene basis,\np\nvalues were adjusted for false discovery rate (FDR) using Storey-Tibshirani's method to improve confidence in\np\nvalues.\n34\nAn FDR-corrected\np\nvalue <0.05 and a 2-fold biological change in expression were chosen as criteria for identifying genes whose expression was altered both statistically and biologically.\n35\nAnalysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to determine whether gene expression over time was significantly different between experimentally injured groups and noninjured controls. An ANCOVA\np\nvalue <0.05 was considered significant. To enrich for the most significantly changed genes in our data set for further analysis, we focused on genes that were significant in both the Student's\nt\n-test and ANCOVA.\nTo determine the correlation between the two injury models, Pearson's correlation coefficient was determined for the 323 genes found to be significant in both the\nin vitro\nand\nin vivo\nmodels by the Student's\nt\n-test.\nUsing Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) Bioinformatics Resources provided by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), each time point was analyzed for the most enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms.\n36\nWe chose to focus on biological process terms and have excluded cellular component and molecular function GO terms from analysis. Specifically, GO FAT biological process terms, as described by DAVID, were used for analysis. The GO FAT subset excludes the broadest GO terms, so that they do not overshadow more-specific terms.\n\nWestern blots\nAdditional samples were collected 48\u2009h post-injury to confirm the transcriptional results at the protein level. This time point was chosen to allow for changes in messenger RNA expression to be translated to protein expression. For\nin vitro\ninjured and uninjured controls, nine slices were collected for protein extraction. Slices were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and immediately placed in lysis buffer A (40\u2009mM of HEPES, 120\u2009mM of NaCl, 1\u2009mM of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 10\u2009mM of sodium pyrophosphate, 50\u2009mM of sodium fluoride, 0.5\u2009mM of sodium orthovanadate, and 10\u2009mM of \u03b2-glycerophosphate; Sigma-Aldrich). Samples were sonicated (Sonicator 3000; Misonix, Farmingdale, NY), incubated on ice, and then centrifuged to remove cell debris. Approximately 50\u2009\u03bcg of protein per sample was loaded in a 4\u201312% Bis-Tris gel (Life Technologies), and proteins were separated by electrophoresis (150\u2009V, 1\u2009h). Proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Life Technologies) using a semidry apparatus (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After transfer, the membrane was blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; pH 7.4) with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 2\u2009h. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies (Anti-SORL1 [S9200; Sigma-Aldrich], anti-\u03b2-tubulin to serve as an internal control [32-2600; Life Technologies]) in TBS-T (0.1% Tween-20; pH 7.4) and 5% BSA. After primary antibody incubation, membranes were washed 3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009min in TBS-T. For detection, membranes were labeled with a corresponding secondary antibody (goat/anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 546 or goat/anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647; Life Technologies). Fluorescence was detected using a CRi Maestro 2 Imaging System (PerkinElmer, Akron, OH). Grayscale images were analyzed in ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD) using the gel analysis function.\n37\nSORLA band intensities were normalized by the intensity of the \u03b2-tubulin band.\n\nPatient samples\nAutopsy case material was obtained from the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner (OCME; New York, NY). According to the policies of the New York City OCME and New York University School of Medicine, this research did not require institutional review board (IRB) approval; however, it was submitted to and approved by the OCME legal office to insure that it complies with OCME policies and did not require IRB approval. Two types of subjects who died of TBI were sought: those that died immediately from the TBI and those that survived for at least 12\u2009h post-TBI. The immediate-death cases served as controls for comparison of changes in post-traumatic protein expression in the delayed-death cases. Blocks of fixed brain tissue from subjects with TBI were embedded in paraffin.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nAll steps were performed with a Ventana Benchmark Ultra automated staining instrument (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples from either human (at indicated time points) or rat OHSCs (48\u2009h post-injury) were cut at 8 or 6\u2009um, respectively. Using the automated Ventana equipment, paraffin was removed at 72\u00b0C, and antigen retrieval was achieved by incubation with CC1 reagent (Ventana Medical Systems) at 95\u00b0C. After antigen retrieval, slides were incubated with anti-SORL1 (S9200, 1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich) for 32\u2009min before being washed. Tissue nuclei were stained using hematoxylin. Slides were then dehydrated using gradient alcohols and cover-slipped. Adjacent sections were stained with Luxol fast blue and hematoxylin and eosin (LHE) for routine pathological analysis.\n\nQuantification of staining in human tissue\nStained sections from autopsy cases were analyzed semiquantitatively by a blinded observer. For SORLA IHC, a 4-point rating scale (0, +, ++, and +++) was devised to correspond to the intensity of staining (none, weak, moderate, or strong, respectively). A similar scheme (0, +, ++, and +++) for the LHE-stained sections (none, rare, occasional, or frequent, respectively) was devised to quantify pathological findings, including shrunken neurons, vacuolization, neuronal loss, and dark neurons."

    "Methods": "Data were obtained from a database created by the Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston for the PRospective Observational Multicenter Major Trauma Transfusion (PROMMTT) study.5PROMMTT enrolled 1245 injured patients who required the highest level activation at one of 10 level 1 trauma centers who subsequently received one or more units of red blood cells (RBC) within 6\u2009hours of hospital admission. Exclusion criteria included age <16 years, transfer from another hospital, pregnancy, >20% burn injury, inhalation injury, incarceration, and death within 30\u2009minutes of hospital admission. Data were collected in real time on fluid and blood product infusions. The time of mortality or hospital discharge was recorded. Approval was obtained from the institutional review board (IRB) at each center and from the U.S. Army Human Research Protections Office. Because PROMMTT was an observational study, waiver of consent was granted by the IRB at the Data Coordinating Center, 9 of 10 clinical sites, and by a secondary review by the U. S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command Office of Research Protections. One site IRB requested consent from surviving subjects, but allowed retention of data on all patients unable to consent as long as consent attempts were documented. No patient or legal representative refused consent.6\n\nCollected data included age, gender, mechanism of injury, ISS, AIS by body region, vital signs upon emergency department arrival and initial laboratory values. The volume of LR or NS administered prior to hospital arrival was recorded. Patients who received any other type of fluid or blood products and those who received both LR and NS were excluded. Patients receiving a small volume of pre-hospital fluid (<200\u2009mL) and those with minor injuries (ISS <9) were also excluded. Mean or median values for each variable were calculated in the LR and NS subgroups for both brain-injured (AIS head \u22653) and non-brain injured (AIS head \u22642) patients. Comparisons were made with the Mann-Whitney U test or Pearson's \u03c72test, as appropriate. Time of death or hospital discharge was available for all patients. Our primary outcome was mortality at 30 days. Secondary outcomes were RBC and crystalloid use in the first 6\u2009hours after admission. Admission physiological and biochemical variables, including systolic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate, International Normalized Ratio (INR), hemoglobin, base deficit, pH, and lactate were also treated as secondary outcomes because they were measured after pre-hospital LR or NS was administered.\n\nStatistical analysis\nTo determine the effect of pre-hospital fluid type on mortality, a Cox proportional hazards model with random effects was created that included pre-hospital fluid type, pre-hospital fluid volume, ISS, AIS head, AIS extremity, age, pre-hospital intubation status, and study site. The Cox proportional hazards model with random effects is utilized for analysis of time-to-event data with covariates whose values may change over time.\n7\nThe random effects method assumes a single hazard factor for each trauma center that adjusts for unmeasured clinical practices that affect all patients from the center, thus controlling for some of the bias introduced by the heterogeneity of practices at each clinical site. Separate models were created for patients with and without brain injuries. Linear regression models were created using the same covariates to examine the impact of pre-hospital fluid type on each of the secondary outcome variables. Statistical analyses were carried out with Stata version 12.1, 2012 (StataCorp., College Station, TX).\nP\nvalues \u22640.05 were considered significant."

    "Methods": "Participants\nParticipants were recruited from three Level I trauma centers as part of the multi-center, prospective Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) Pilot study.\n28\nThese trauma centers included San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH), San Francisco, California, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and University Medical Center at Brackenridge (UMCB), Austin, Texas. Study protocols were approved by the institutional review boards at each participating center. Eligible patients for the TRACK-TBI Pilot study presented to the emergency department (ED) within 24\u2009h of sustaining head trauma of sufficient severity to triage to a non-contrast head computed tomography (CT) scan using the American College of Emergency Physicians/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention evidence-based joint practice guidelines.\n29\nInformed consent was obtained from the patient or through proxy. Individuals who were non-English speakers, pregnant, in legal custody, or under a medically-evaluated psychiatric hold at the time of enrollment were excluded from the study.\nOf 586 patients age \u226516 years enrolled in the TRACK-TBI Pilot study, a total of 338 completed the full 6-month TBI-CDE Outcome Battery, which included the PCL-C measure. Of these, 280 patients were classified as mTBI by ED admission GCS (13\u201315) and were included in the analysis. A higher number of study participants were enrolled at the SFGH site (\nn\n=\u2009196), compared with at the UPMC (\nn\n=\u200965) and UMCB (\nn\n=\u200919) sites, and several differences in sample composition are noted. Specifically, SFGH had a higher proportion of participants with positive pre-injury psychiatric history (\np\n<\u20090.001) and injury mechanism of assault (\np\n<\u20090.001) and fewer Caucasian participants (\np\n<\u20090.001; data not presented).\n\nMeasures\nDemographic and injury characteristics were collected at the time of enrollment. The TRACK-TBI Pilot study outcome assessment battery listed below consisted of the core measures recommended by the NINDS consensus-based TBI-CDEs (Version 1).\n23\u201326\nAdministered and self-reported neurocognitive and neuropsychological measures and global outcome ratings also were collected via in-person interview at 6 months post-injury.\nDemographics\nData collected included age, race, gender, ethnicity, years of education, marital status, and employment status.\nBaseline health status\nParticipants were queried according to TBI-CDE (Version 1) standard checklist of prior medical and psychiatric history.\n23\n,\n24\nThis self-reported information was supplemented with data gathered through medical record abstraction.\nInjury characterization\nA variety of indices were collected to characterize TBI etiology and severity. These included GCS score\n30\nassessed by a neurosurgeon at hospital admission, duration of loss of consciousness (LOC), PTA, injury severity score (ISS),\n31\nhospital length of stay, discharge disposition, and location of discharge from the ED. Finally, CT scans were categorized as being positive or negative for acute intracranial lesions.\nPCL-C\nThe PCL-C\n25\n,\n32\nis a standardized self-report rating scale of 17 PTSD symptoms that correspond to\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision\n(DSM-IV-TR) criteria for PTSD across three component subcategories (\u201cRe-experiencing,\u201d \u201cAvoidance,\u201d and \u201cHypervigilance\u201d), causing clinically significant distress or impairment for more than one month.\n33\nRespondents are asked to rate on a 5-point scale (1\u2009=\u2009not at all to 5\u2009=\u2009extremely) how much they have been bothered by each symptom in the past month. A higher score indicates more symptomatology of PTSD. Subjects simultaneously endorsing a score of \u22653 in one or more symptoms under \u201cRe-experiencing,\u201d three or more symptoms under \u201cAvoidance,\u201d and two or more symptoms under \u201cHypervigilance\u201d subcategories on the PCL-C were coded as positive for PTSD.\nGOS-E\nThe GOS-E\n34\nprovides an overall measure of disability based on scales of cognition, independence, employability, and social/community participation collected via structured interview. Individuals are described by one of the eight outcome categories: 1\u2009=\u2009dead, 2\u2009=\u2009vegetative state, 3\u2009=\u2009lower severe disability, 4\u2009=\u2009upper severe disability, 5\u2009=\u2009lower moderate disability, 6\u2009=\u2009upper moderate disability, 7\u2009=\u2009lower good recovery, and 8\u2009=\u2009upper good recovery. Good recovery is defined as a score of 7\u20138, moderate disability is defined by a score of 5\u20136, and severe disability is defined as a score of 3\u20134. A GOS-E score of 8 reflects full recovery to baseline status with no disability.\nBrief Symptom Inventory 18\nThe Brief Symptom Inventory 18 (BSI18)\n35\nis used to assess psychological distress, with each item rated on a 5-point scale from 0 (not at all distressed) to 4 (extremely distressed). The Global Severity Index is represented by a T-score composed of the sum of three subscales\u2014depression, somatization, and anxiety\u2014containing six items each. Higher scores reflect greater psychological distress. An overall score of \u226563 meets the cutoff for clinical screening indicating a need for further assessment.\nRivermead Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire-13 Item\nThe Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire-13 Item (RPQ-13)\n36\nqueries the presence and severity of somatic, cognitive, and emotional symptoms that are commonly reported following TBI. Participants are asked to compare current (past 24\u2009h) versus pre-injury symptom severity on a scale of 0 to 4 (0\u2009=\u2009not experienced; 1\u2009=\u2009no more of a problem; 2\u2009=\u2009mild problem; 3\u2009=\u2009moderate problem; 4\u2009=\u2009severe problem). A score of \u226520 meets the cutoff for clinical screening for symptoms of post-concussion syndrome, a clinical state of persistent symptoms of a TBI.\n37\nSatisfaction With Life Scale\nThe Satisfactions With Life Scale (SWLS)\n38\nis a global measure of life satisfaction consisting of five statements that the respondent is asked to endorse on a 7-point Likert scale (1\u2009=\u2009strongly disagree to 7\u2009=\u2009strongly agree). A higher score indicates greater life satisfaction. A score of >20 indicates some degree of satisfaction, and a score of <20 indicates some degree of dissatisfaction.\nTrail Making Test\nThe Trail Making Test (TMT)\n39\nis a cognitive assessment consisting of two timed parts (TMT-A and TMT-B) that measure executive function and mental flexibility. Specifically, TMT-A assesses visual processing and TMT-B assesses mental flexibility and processing speed.\nCalifornia Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition\nThe California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition (CVLT-II)\n40\nis a verbal learning and memory task in which there are five learning trials, an interference trial, immediate (short-delay) recall trials, and post-20\u2009min (long-delay) recall trials. The standard score (normalized for age, years of education, and handedness) for long-delay free recall was used in this analysis as a measure of encoded verbal memory.\nWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition, Processing Speed Index\nThe Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition, Processing Speed Index (WAIS-PSI)\n41\nsubscale is composed of the Symbol Search and Coding tasks, which require visual attention and motor speed. The scaled composite PSI score (normalized for age), which ranges from 50 to 150 to correspond to the 0.1 to 99.9 percentile of performance across age groups, was used in this analysis. Scores of \u223c90, 100, and \u223c110 correspond to the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, respectively.\n\nStatistical analysis\nPatients who completed the 6-month PCL-C data were selected for this study (\nn\n=\u2009280). PTSD status was determined by dichotomous classification on the PCL-C according to DSM-IV criteria based on the number and categories of symptoms reported.\n33\nStatistical analysis first examined differences in baseline variables, comparing participants who were positive for PTSD symptoms and those who were not. Differences in means and frequencies for continuous and categorical variables, respectively, were compared between those who screened positive for PTSD symptoms and those who did not screen positive at 6-month follow-up. Continuous variables identified as having a skewed distribution (Shapiro-Wilk W statistic <0.05) were compared using the Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test. Categorical variables were compared using Pearson's chi-square test and Fisher's exact test for comparisons with group counts <5.\nTo further explore the association between potential relevant baseline predictors and positive screening for PTSD at 6 months, we selected possible predictors as identified from the literature\n2\n,\n8\n,\n11\n,\n14\nand from clinical knowledge, including demographics (age, gender, race, education, marital status), medical history, mechanism of injury, acute toxicology, head injury severity (CT, GCS), and overall injury severity (ISS). Baseline variables identified as having a significant association with PTSD in univariate analysis (\np\n<\u20090.05) were selected to be included in a multi-variable logistic regression model predicting the probability of being diagnosed with PTSD based on the PCL-C scale. These variables included demographic, pre-injury, and injury-related variables, including race, years of education, marital status, prior psychiatric history, and injury mechanism (assault vs. all other causes). Caucasian race and married marital status were included as binary variables.\nOther 6-month outcome measures were not included as independent variables in the model as the aim of the study was to examine baseline factors associated with PTSD. These measures were analyzed by comparing mean scores between those with and without a positive screen for PTSD to understand symptoms and conditions associated with PTSD at the time of follow-up.\nA variable selection procedure was then applied to improve the performance of the initial non-parsimonious prediction model using a step-wise forward procedure (\np\n-entry \u22640.25;\np\n-remain \u22640.15) based on the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic. The association between each potential predictor and the outcome is reported on the odds ratio scale, together with its 95% confidence intervals. The parsimonious model's goodness-of-fit is expressed using the c-statistic. All statistical analyses were run on SPSS v.21 (Chicago, IL)."

    "Methods": "Ventriculomegaly rats and mild TBI\nAll studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at our institution, and experiments were performed according to the National Research Council's Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Female 8-week-old Wistar rats purchased from Charles River Laboratory (Wilmington, MA) and Harlan Laboratory (Indianapolis, IN) were used in this study. Rats underwent baseline MRI screening for patterns of ventriculomegaly by T2-weighted (T2W) images: TR 3.8\u2009sec, TE 15\u2009ms, rapid imaging with refocused echoes (RARE) factor 8, in-plane resolution 100\u2009\u00d7\u2009100 (\u03bcm) with 0.5\u2009mm thickness using a Bruker 7T scanner (Bruker Corp., Billerica, MA) with a Doty radiofrequency quadrature coil (Doty Scientific, Inc., Columbia, SC). Thirty slices were acquired to cover the brain from olfactory bulb to cervical spinal cord to screen for ventriculomegaly. Each animal's baseline MRI was reviewed and scored at 8 anatomical locations to evaluate ventricular dilatation, asymmetrical ventricles, aqueduct stenosis, arachnoid cysts, cyst-like lesions, hyperintense lesions, and otherwise unidentified bright objects (UBO) per our previous guidelines.\n1\nFifteen rats were identified with MVM, with an average score of 12.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.8 on the ventriculomegaly rating scale (0\u20132: normal; 3\u201330: abnormal), and selected for the subsequent mild TBI study. Fifteen rats identified as within the normal limits served as the experimental controls.\nNormal (\nn\n=\u200910) and MVM (\nn\n=\u200910) rats underwent a modified version of the Marmarou weight drop closed head injury model for mild TBI.\n6\nIsoflurane-anesthetized rats were placed on Marmarou polyurethane foam (density: 13.8\u2009kg m\n3\n; Foam to Size Inc., Ashland, VA) with dimensions of 15\u2009cm (H) \u00d720\u2009cm (W) \u00d745\u2009cm (L) to absorb excessive momentum. A custom- made metal disk was strapped to the top of the head to prevent skull fractures. A 450\u2009g weight was allowed to free fall in a tube from distance of 2\u2009m. Rats were monitored post-injury until they awakened and could move normally. Rats typically recovered within 5\u2009min of impact. Five animals without injury served as the baseline controls for each group.\n\nIn vivo\nMRI and data analysis\nIn vivo\nMRI was conducted on animals prior to injury (baseline), and at 1 and 8 days post-injury (DPI). Animals were anesthetized with an isoflurane/oxygen mixture (4.5\u20135% for induction and 1.5\u20132.0% for maintenance). The inhalant anesthetic was delivered to the animal through a custom-made nose cone. Throughout MR scans, warm water was circulated through heating pads placed under the animals to keep them warm at 37\u00b0C. Respiratory rate was monitored using a pressure sensor (SA Instruments Inc., Stony Brook, NY) and maintained at 40\u201350 breaths per minute by an isoflurane/oxygen mixture.\nAt each time point, T2*-weighted images were first acquired to evaluate the presence of hemorrhage or subdural hematoma using three-dimensional (3D) multiple gradient echo (MGE): TR 60\u2009ms, TE 3.18\u2009ms, echo spacing 3.25\u2009ms, voxel size 200\u2009\u03bcm (isotropic). T2* maps were created by fitting the magnitude images of 14 echo MGE data to an exponential function on a pixel-by-pixel basis. DTI data was acquired using 3D spin echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with TR 700\u2009ms, TE 37\u2009ms; segment 4, \u0394 15\u2009ms; \u03b4 5\u2009ms; b-value 0 and 800\u2009s/mm\n2\n, 15 diffusion encoding directions. The voxel size of DTI was identical with MGE. Diffusion-weighted images were corrected for B\n0\nsusceptibility-induced EPI distortion, eddy current distortions, and motion distortion with b-matrix reorientation using Tortoise.\n7\nAfter correction, the diffusion tensor was calculated to derive DTI parameters, including FA, MD, AD, and RD. MTI was acquired by two dimensional (2D) RARE sequence with (M\nS\n) and without (M\n0\n) magnetic transfer (MT) preparation pulses added before excitation: TR 5000\u2009ms, TE 11.56\u2009ms, RARE factor 8, MT saturation frequency offsets 6000\u2009Hz, saturation pulse amplitude 4\u2009\u03bcT, duration 1\u2009ms, pulse number 20, pixel size 200\u2009\u03bcm\n2\n, and slice thickness 0.5\u2009mm. Magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) maps were calculated by (M\n0\n-M\nS\n)/M\n0\n. Region of interest (ROI) analysis was performed using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD) on the corpus callosum and cortex near Bregma \u22121.0\u2009mm, which was previously identified as the location showing the most DAI in this injury model (\nFig. 1\n). ROIs were manually defined on three consecutive imaging slices for the DTI data set using the FA maps and on one slice for the MTR maps. Values of DTI and MTI metrics were acquired and then averaged to be the final values. A voxel-by-voxel temporal-spatial statistical analysis was performed for the FA and MTR maps to test the sensitivity and specificity of examining the microstructural abnormalities in the entire brain over the 8 day period following mild TBI. FA and MTR maps were segmented and registered to a common space of an anatomical image using FLIRT\n8\nand TBSS.\n9\nEach of the rats' aligned maps were projected onto the mean skeleton, and the resulting data fed into voxelwise cross-subject statistics by repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA).\n9\nThe null distribution for the data in the TBSS statistics was built over 10,000 permutations, and the results were shown as a voxelwise significance level (\np\nvalue) <0.05. For the multiple comparison correction within the data, cluster-level inference at t\u2009>\u20092.7,\np\n<\u20090.05, and false discovery rate theory\n10\nat q\u2009<\u20090.05 were used. Except for those processed by the aforementioned software, all other imaging data were processed via in house Matlab (Mathwork, Natick, MA) programs.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nThe MRI\n(A)\nand immunohistochemistry\n(B)\ndata were acquired from the regions of interest at bregma \u22121.0\u2009mm. CC, corpus callosum; CT, cortex. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\n\nIHC analysis\nFive rats per group were randomly picked for IHC examination at each imaging time point following MRI. Following euthanasia, animals were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for histology. The brain tissue was cryosectioned at 10\u2009\u03bcm for IHC staining. Slides of sectioned tissue were washed with PBS, blocked in Superblock (Scy Tek Laboratories, Logan, UT) for 10\u2009min at room temperature, and incubated in primary antibody to detect activated microglia, ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) (Wako, Richmond, VA) at 1/200; astrocytes, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) at 1/1500; phosphorylated neurofilament H (SMI31) (Covance, Princeton, NJ) at 1/1500; myelin basic protein (MBP) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) at 1/500 in 1x PBS, 0.3% Tween-20, and 1.0% bovine serum albumin at 4\u00b0C overnight. After three PBS +0.3% Tween-20 washes, slices were incubated in secondary antibody: for MBP and SMI31, goat F(ab') polyclonal secondary antibody to mouse IgG- H&L Dylight 594 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA); for Iba1 and GFAP, goat anti-rabbit F(ab') IgG- H&L Dylight 594 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) at a dilution of 1/200 in 1x PBS with 0.3% Tween-20 and 1.0% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1\u2009h, rinsed three times in PBS +0.3% Tween-20, dipped in dH2O, and mounted in ProLong Gold antifade with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Slides were visualized with an Aperio FL fluorescent microscope (Aperio, Vista, CA). The quantification of IHC staining was conducted by counting the areas of the positive staining in the 20\u00d7 images using Matlab program CellC with manual confirmation.\n11\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was conducted using Prism software version 6.0c (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Longitudinal data were analyzed using two way ANOVA with repeated measures. Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was used to examine the difference between normal and MVM rats, with significance levels predetermined at 0.05. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to delineate the possible pathological correlation between the MRI and IHC data. All data are reported as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD)."

    "Methods": "Overview of the Pre/Post Deployment Study (PPDS) of the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS)\nDetailed information about the design and conduct of Army STARRS is available in a separate report.\n14\nThe PPDS of Army STARRS is a multiwave panel survey that collected baseline data (T0; self-administered questionnaire [SAQ]) from US Army soldiers in three brigade combat teams (BCTs) during the first quarter of 2012, within approximately 6 weeks of their deployment to Afghanistan. Follow-up data collections for these same respondents were available for this report at three times after they returned from deployment: within 1 month of their return (T1; SAQ and blood samples), and then approximately 3 months (T2; SAQ), and 9 months (T3; SAQ) later.\nThe baseline (T0) SAQ was an extensive survey of sociodemographic characteristics, lifetime and past-30-day mental disorders, and additional other potential risk and resilience factors including but not limited to past civilian and military experiences. The T1 follow-up SAQ included only a brief assessment of experiences that occurred during deployment (including deployment stressors and TBI). The T2 and T3 SAQ, which were virtually identical, covered mainly subsequent experiences such as post-concussive and other symptoms.\n\nParticipants\nThe PPDS study population consisted of all soldiers in three BCTs whose members deployed to Afghanistan (average duration of deployment was 10 months) shortly after completing the baseline (T0) PPDS data collection. All participants gave their informed, written consent to participate. These procedures were approved by the Human Subjects Committees of all collaborating organizations. At the baseline (T0), a total of 9949 soldiers were present for duty in the three BCTs. Of these, 9488 (95.3%) consented to participate in the survey with 8558 (86.0%) providing complete T0 survey responses and consent to link their survey responses to their administrative records.\nThe T0 longitudinal analysis cohort for this investigation was restricted to the subpopulation (\nn\n=\u20097742) of these T0 study participants who subsequently deployed to Afghanistan. A total of 4645 (60.0%) of the 7742 T0 study participants who deployed to Afghanistan provided complete data at all three post-deployment assessments (i.e., T1, T2, and T3).\nTo compensate for T1, T2, and/or T3 attrition losses from the eligible baseline sample of 7742 participants, response propensity (based on T0 measures available for all baseline respondents) and post-stratification (based on comparisons of distributions for key sociodemographic and Army career variables from administrative data available for the entire Army as well as for survey respondents) weighting factors\n15\nwere developed and applied in all analyses of the multiwave data.\nFinally, because this investigation focuses on sequelae of mTBI, 127 of the eligible soldiers with complete data were excluded because they met study criteria for \u201cmore-than-mild\u201d (i.e., moderate or severe) TBI (see\nMeasures\nbelow). This resulted in a final sample size of 4518 for the current analysis.\n\nMeasures\nBaseline (T0) assessment\nAt baseline (T0), PPDS respondents self-administered a computerized version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview screening scales (CIDI-SC)\n16\nto assess 10 lifetime\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,\n4th edition mental disorders. The sum of all past 30-day depression, anxiety, and irritability items from the screening scales (24 items each ranging 0\u20134) was calculated to create a past-month general distress score (range 0\u201396). Also collected at the T0 assessment were sociodemographic information and a query about previous TBI(s). The latter was assessed by a series of questions similar to those described below for the T1 assessment. For purposes of the analyses described here, any pre-deployment reporting of probable TBI with loss of consciousness of any duration was counted as being positive for probable TBI history before the index deployment.\nFirst post-deployment (T1) assessment\nDeployment stress\nThe T1 survey included 15 questions that assessed the frequency of specific deployment experiences that were stressful or traumatic in nature\n[e.g., During your deployment how many times did you\u2026Go on combat patrols or have other dangerous duty (e.g., route clearance, clearing buildings, disarming civilians, working in areas that had improvised explosive devices)?\nor \u2026\nFire rounds at the enemy or take enemy fire (either direct or indirect fire)?]\n. Responses to these questions were discretized (yes/no), and positive responses were summed to create a total (0\u201315) deployment stress severity score.\nDeployment-acquired TBI\nProbable TBI was determined by the probe\n[How many times during your recent deployment did you have a head, neck, or blast injury that\u2026]\nfollowed by a series of questions pertaining to alteration or loss of consciousness (LOC) and lapse of memory that followed. We used the highest level of severity of response(s) to characterize each respondent as having had one of: (1) No TBI; (2) probable \u201cvery mild\u201d\nTBI\n(alteration but no LOC\n[\u201cdidn't knock you out but caused you to be dazed or \u2018see stars'\u201d]\nand no lapse of memory); (3) probable \u201cmTBI\u201d (LOC\n[\u201cknocked you out\u201d]\nfor less than 30\u2009min and/or lapse of memory for less than 30\u2009min); or (4) probable \u201cmore-than-mTBI\u201d (LOC for 30\u2009min or more or lapse in memory lasting 30\u2009min or more).\nUsing these criteria, TBIs classified as very mild or mild would match up with most standard and widely used definitions of mTBI (e.g.,\nhttp://tbilaw.com/acrm-brain-injury-definition.html\n). The majority of TBIs classified as more-than-mild would fall into a higher category (i.e., moderate or severe) of clinical severity and were therefore not included in the present analyses. We evaluated the effects of level of mTBI severity (i.e., very mild vs. mild), as well as \u201cany\u201d deployment-acquired mTBI compared with none.\nSecond (T2) and third (T3) post-deployment assessments\nPCS\nIncluded at T2 and again at T3 were eight items that reflect the array of PCS: balance problems or dizziness; sensitivity to noise; sensitivity to light; memory problems; irritability; difficulty concentrating; headaches; and feeling tired out or being easily fatigued. Past 30-day occurrence of these symptoms was assessed in a survey section that inquired generally about \u201chealth problems\u201d without any reference to TBI or other injury or event. Respondents rated each symptom on a 5-point frequency scale that ranged from \u201cNone of the time (0)\u201d through \u201cAll or almost all of the time (4).\u201d\nSumming these ratings yielded an eight-item PCS score (PCS-8) ranging from 0\u201332, with good internal consistency (Cronbach alpha\u2009=\u20090.88). For the purpose of sensitivity analysis, we also calculated an alternative PCS measure (PCS-5; range\u2009=\u20090\u201320) that excluded symptoms that are also commonly associated with anxiety and depressive disorders (i.e., irritability, difficulty concentrating, and feeling tired or easily fatigued).\n\nStatistical methods\nUsing the total sample (\nN\n=\u20094518), we conducted zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression analyses to jointly model the effect of predictors of interest on presence (yes/no) and severity (for nonzero scores) of PCS symptoms (as measured by the PCS-8) at T2 and T3, respectively. Some of the predictors of interest were assessed before the index deployment; these were age (30-or-younger vs. older), sex, race (white vs. black vs. Asian vs. other), ethnicity (Hispanic vs. other), number of previous deployments (none vs. one vs. two or more), previous lifetime TBI, and pre-deployment past-month general distress.\nTwo additional predictors reflected experiences during the index deployment and were collected immediately on return to the United States at T1; these were severity of deployment stress and deployment-acquired mTBI. BCT was also dummy-coded and adjusted for in the analyses. Duration of index deployment and the interaction of lifetime TBI and deployment-acquired mTBI were included in preliminary models but did not predict PCS and were thus excluded from the final models.\nIn the subsample of soldiers who reported mTBI during the index deployment (\nn\n=\u2009822), linear regression was conducted to evaluate associations between the pre- and peri-deployment factors listed above and severity of PCS (as measured by the PCS-8) at T2 and T3. Given that all soldiers in the subsample had sustained mTBI, level of severity of deployment-acquired TBI (very mild vs. mild) was entered as a predictor instead of any mTBI versus none.\nTo evaluate the robustness of findings, all ZINB and linear regression analyses were repeated using PCS-5 (see\nMeasures\n) as the outcome. This sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the possibility that observed associations between mTBI and PCS were attributable to symptoms that could also be explained by co-occurring anxiety or depression. An additional set of sensitivity analyses were conducted by excluding persons with concurrent MDE or PTSD. The purpose of this set of analyses was to determine whether the observed associations between mTBI and PCS were attributable to the presence of these comorbid mental health conditions.\nAll analyses were weighted to account for T1, T2, and T3 survey attrition from the eligible T0 soldier cohort. Because the PPDS data are both clustered by BCT and administration session and weighted, the design-based Taylor series linearization method was used to estimate standard errors. Multivariate significance was examined using design-based Wald c\n2\ntests. All statistical analyses were conducted using the software R (version 3.0.2; R Development Core Team, 2011) or STATA Version 14.0. The\np\nvalues less than 0.05 (two-tailed) were considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "For this study, we used 6- to 8-week-old maleC57Bl6mice (n=\u2009101 in total; purchased from Jackson Laboratories, Kent, UK) and FXI-/- mice (male, 8\u20139 weeks old;n=\u200915 in total). These mice were described previously,30,31and backcrossed for at least nine generations toC57Bl6Jbackground.\n\nAll animal experiments were carried out in compliance with our institutional guidelines, and all experiments were approved both by the Research Ethics Committee of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI; REC number 467) and by the Ministry for Health and Children in Dublin, Ireland (license number B100/4169). Our results are being reported in accordance with the Animal Research: Reporting ofIn VivoExperiments guidelines.32\n\nHusbandry\nThe mice were housed under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle in groups of \u22645 mice per cage with access to food and water\nad libitum\nprior to the experiment. Once in the experiment, the animals were housed in single cages. Hygiene management checks and health screens were performed in compliance with the guidelines and recommendations established by the Federation of Laboratory Animal Science Associations.\n33\n\nRandomization\nThe animals were randomly assigned to the treatment groups and time-points of sacrifice. Both the researcher performing the experiments and the one carrying out the analysis were blind to the treatment/genetic background of the animals throughout the experiments.\n\nAnimal preparation for intravital microscopy\nIntravital microscopy was performed as described previously.\n15\n,\n34\n,\n35\nFollowing controlled cortical impact (CCI;\nn\n=\u20098) or the sham procedure (\nn\n=\u20096; see below), the animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of a cocktail containing medetomidine (0.5\u2009mg/kg body weight; Domitor\n\u00ae\n; Dr. E. Graeub AG, Basel, Switzerland), fentanyl (0.05\u2009mg/kg body weight.; Janssen-Cilag, Neuss, Germany), and midazolam (5\u2009mg/kg body weight; Dormicum\n\u00ae\n; Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Subsequently, the animals were endotracheally intubated and ventilated in a volume-controlled mode (MiniVent 845 ventilator; Hugo Sachs Elektronik, March-Hungstetten, Germany); end-tidal pCO\n2\nwas continuously monitored and recorded using microcapnometry\n36\n(Capnograph 340; Hugo Sachs Elektronik). Throughout the experiment, body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C via a rectal probe attached to a feedback-controlled heating pad. A catheter was inserted into the femoral artery and used to monitor mean arteriolar blood pressure and administer both saline (0.9% NaCl) at 0.4\u2009mL/h and the fluorescent dye. To maintain the anesthesia, one-third of the initial dose was administered every hour. The animal was then immobilized in a custom-made stereotaxic frame, the cranial window was prepared (see below), and the animal was transferred to the 2-photon microscope. At the end of each experiment, arteriolar blood gases and pH were measured (Rapidlab 348; Siemens, Munich, Germany).\n\nCranial window preparation\nFollowing CCI (see below), a cranial window (2\u2009mm \u00d72\u2009mm) was prepared over the right fronto-parietal cortex under continuous cooling with saline as described previously.\n15\n,\n34\n,\n35\nSpecial care was applied in order to leave the dura mater intact. The location of the window was placed 1\u2009mm laterally to the sagittal suture and 1\u2009mm frontally to the coronal suture, thereby enabling us to view the region 1.5-3.5\u2009mm frontal to the primary contusion (i.e., in the region where we expected maximum microthrombus formation to occur;\nFig. 1\n). Following the craniotomy, the dura mater was removed, and the surface of the brain was rinsed with saline. Subsequently, a precise-fitting custom-made square cover glass with a thickness of 175\u2009\u03bcm (Schott Displayglas, Jena, Germany) was carefully placed in the window and fixed to the skull using dental cement (Cyano Veneer; Hager & Werken, Duisburg, Germany).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nQuantification of microthrombi following traumatic brain injury (TBI).\n(A)\nScheme of our experimental setup. Five regions of interest were observed, with the regions 1-3 located proximal and regions 4 and 5 more distal to the contusion.\n(B)\nRepresentative images of the microcirculation in a mouse cortex 2\u2009h after sham operation (left) or controlled cortical impact (CCI; right)\nin vivo\n(scale 425\u2009\u00d7\u2009425\u2009\u00d7\u2009500\u2009\u03bcm). The vessels are labeled in green (fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran), and the red staining visualizes leukocytes, and leukocyte-platelet aggregates/microthrombi (rhodamin 6G). Following sham operation, the microcirculation is not impaired. By contrast, TBI leads to a significant formation of leukocyte-platelet aggregates/microthrombi.\n(C)\nUnder physiological conditions, only few microthrombi are visible in the parenchymal microcirculation, and most of these are dissolved or have moved on with the blood flow 60\u2009sec later (four images in the left; scale: 100\u2009\u00d7\u2009100\u2009\u00d7\u2009100\u2009\u03bcm). By contrast, most microthrombi formed after trauma are stable for at least 60\u2009sec (two images on the right).\n\nTwo-photon microscopy\nTwo-photon imaging was performed as described previously\n34\nusing a Zeiss LSM-710 upright confocal microscope equipped with a Ti:Sa laser (Coherent Chameleon Vision II; Coherent, Glasgow, UK) and two non-descanned photomultipliers for detecting red (BP 500-550\u2009nm) and green (BP 565-610\u2009nm) fluorescence. Visualization of the micro-vessels and microthrombi was performed by an intravenous injection of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran (0.1\u2009mL of a 0.5% solution, molecular weight 150,000; Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, Missouri) and Rhodamine 6G (repetitive injections of 0.05\u2009mL of a 0.01% solution; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), respectively. For imaging, the window was divided into five regions measuring 425\u2009\u03bcm \u00d7 425\u2009\u03bcm on the surface and reaching up to 500\u2009\u03bcm into the parenchyma (cortical layers 4 and 5). The first three regions were aligned close to the primary contusion, whereas region four and five were placed more distally (\nFig. 1\n). Beginning 1.5\u2009h after CCI/sham, z-stacks were captured (at 3-\u03bcm increments) from all five regions within 1\u2009h.\n\nAnalysis of data acquired by 2-photon microscopy\nThe images were analyzed offline as described previously\n34\nusing the ImageJ software (\nhttp://imagej.nih.gov/ij\n) by an investigator who was blind to the treatment of each animal. We quantified total vessel volume and the total volume of leukocyte-platelet aggregates/microthrombi within the vessels. Data are expressed as the percentage of microthrombi per total vessel volume. By acquiring two consecutive images within 60\u2009sec, we were able to identify stationary microthrombi.\n15\n,\n34\nThe total number of microclots per investigated volume (425*425*500\u2009\u03bcm) and the volume of each clot were determined using the Imaris image analysis software (Bitplane AG, Zurich, Switzerland).\n\nCoagulation tests\nIn our study, we used an antibody specifically designed to selectively inhibit prothrombotic FXI activation by factor XIIa (14E11)\n37\n,\n38\nand a control antibody (control immunoglobulin G [IgG]). The antibodies were injected into the femoral vein, which was subsequently ligated (4\u2009mg/kg body weight dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline; a mouse weighing 25\u2009g received a volume of 0.25\u2009mL intravenously). Previously, 14E11 was shown to prolong activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) in mice at least for 72\u2009h.\n38\nWe verified the selective inhibition of the intrinsic pathway by determining the aPTT, a test for the intrinsic coagulation pathway,\n39\nand the prothrombin time (PT), a test for the extrinsic coagulation pathway,\n40\u201342\nwith a coagulation analyzer (ACL 200 Automated Coagulation Laboratory; Instrumentation Laboratory; Bedford, MA). APTT and PT were determined in mice that received control IgG or 14E11 via the femoral vein, and in\nC57Bl6\nand FXI-/- mice (\nn\n=\u20098 per group). In this series, mice were anesthetized in an isoflurane chamber (4% in a 1:2 mix of O\n2\n:N\n2\nO), and anesthesia was maintained with a face mask using 1.2% isoflurane in a 1:2 mix of O\n2\n:N\n2\nO during surgery. A thermostatically regulated feedback-controlled heating pad was used to maintain rectal temperature at 37\u00b0C (FHC Inc., Bowdoin, ME). At 24\u2009h after treatment, the animals were anesthetized deeply by injection of the above mentioned triple combination intraperitoneally. Following a quick thoracotomy, the right ventricle of the heart was punctured and 0.1\u2009mL blood was withdrawn with a 1\u2009mL syringe containing 75\u2009\u03bcL 3.2% sodium citrate.\n\nCCI\nTraumatic brain injury was induced as described previously.\n15\n,\n35\n,\n43\nIn brief, the mice were anesthetized with a gas mixture containing 2% isoflurane, 65% N\n2\nO, and 33% O\n2\n. A craniotomy window was drilled over the right parietal cortex under continuous cooling with saline. A cortical contusion was produced using a CCI device optimized for use in mice (cylinder diameter: 3.0\u2009mm; velocity: 6.0\u2009m/sec; penetration depth: 0.5\u2009mm; contact time: 150 msec). Immediately following the impact, the bone flap was re-implanted and fixed using histoacrylic glue. The animals were then allowed to wake in a recovery chamber (33\u00b0C and 50% humidity). Sham-operated animals were treated as above, except CCI was not performed.\n\nHistopathological analysis\nSecondary lesion expansion, brain swelling, and intracranial hemorrhage following CCI were assessed in histological sections as described before.\n34\n,\n44\nAs a reference for the initial primary damage, these parameters also were assessed 15\u2009min after trauma in each experimental series. At the respective end-point of the experiments, the animals were anesthetized with ketanest intraperitoneally and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Immediately afterwards, the brains were removed carefully, frozen in powdered dry ice, and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. Ten-micrometer thick coronal sections were cut from 15 levels with a distance of 500\u2009\u03bcm throughout the contusion site using a cryostat (Cryostar CM 1950; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Subsequently, two sections from each level were stained with cresyl violet and hematoxylin/eosine, respectively, and digitized using a camera connected to a microscope (Leica DM 3000; Wetzlar, Germany). Using an imaging analysis system (Leica), the contusion area and total volume of both hemispheres in each section were quantified in the sections stained with cresyl violet, and intracranial hemorrhage was determined in the sections stained with hematoxylin/eosin. Finally, the total volumes of contusion, each hemisphere, and intracranial hemorrhage were calculated respectively with the following formula: x\u2009=\u2009d*(A1/2 + A2 + A3\u2026+ A15/2), where d represents the distance between neighboring sections (i.e. 0.5\u2009mm) and A stands for the contusion area assessed on the single sections. Brain swelling was estimated by the size (area) of the ipsilateral hemisphere divided by the size of the contralateral hemisphere. The thrombosis index, defined as the number of microthrombi per total vessel number in the sample, was determined on hematoxylin/eosin\u2013stained coronal brain sections.\n45\n,\n46\nIn the section containing the largest contusion, three regions of interest were investigated adjacent to the contusion: a medial region (1), a region in the middle of the hemisphere (2), and a lateral region (3). Subsequently, the corresponding regions on the contralateral side were investigated.\nThe following treatment series were carried out: a) treatment with control IgG or 14E11 24\u2009h before trauma and sacrifice at 15\u2009min (no treatment) or 24\u2009h post-trauma (\nn\n=\u200924); b) administration of control IgG 30\u2009min after CCI, 14E11 30\u2009min after CCI, 14E11 2\u2009h after CCI after trauma and sacrifice at 15\u2009min (no treatment) or 24\u2009h post-trauma (\nn\n=\u200932); and c) CCI in wildtype\nC57Bl6\nand FXI-/- mice and sacrifice at 15\u2009min or 24\u2009h post-trauma (\nn\n=\u20097 per group).\n\nStatistical analysis\nResults are presented as median followed by the 75th and 25th percentile in parentheses, except for the thrombosis index and the results acquired by the coagulation analyzer, which are reported as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Differences between the groups were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test with the Bonferroni correction. Differences with a\np\n<\u20090.05 were considered significant. The calculations were performed with a standard statistical software package (Sigma Stat 3.0; Systat Software, Erkrath, Germany)."

One of the subject's acceleration data was not recorded because the measurement device was not turned on during that subject's heading performance.\nFour participants in EXP and three participants in CON self-reported a history of at least one concussion; however, the time of the concussion was not collected. Independent\nt\ntest reveal no differences for self-reported concussion between groups. Subjects were told to refrain from substances that could affect nervous system function (e. g., stimulants and/or depressants) during the period of testing. The Temple University Institutional Review Board approved the procedures, and all participants signed informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act forms before the start of the study.\n\nExperiment design\nThe experiment used a repeated measures design with three time sessions (a pre-heading, 0-hour post-heading, 24-h post-heading). In each time session, a clinical measurement and two different assessments (standing posture control assessment and walking posture control assessment) were conducted with both groups in randomized order. All measurements were completed within a 2-h window. The pre-heading session (Pre) was a baseline measurement. After approximately 24\u2009h, the subject performed 10 headers following the protocol described in the\nSoccer heading model\nsection. The same measurements were performed within 2\u2009h of heading (Hr0) and then approximately 24\u2009h later (Hr24).\n\nSoccer heading model\nA human head impact model was used to provide standardized and reliable soccer heading testing.\n4\nA triaxial accelerometer (Gforce Tracker, Gforcetracker Inc., Markham, ON) was positioned and secured on the back of the head with pre-wrap and tape to measure linear head impact acceleration (\ng\n-force;\nTable 1\n). A JUGS soccer machine (JPS Sports, Tualatin, OR) was used to simulate a soccer kick and standardize ball speed across subjects. A size 5 soccer ball was inflated to 8\u2009psi and launched from the JUGS machine at speeds of 25\u2009mph (11.2\u2009m/sec). Participants stood approximately 40 feet away from the machine to perform the headers. These experimental parameters were used, because it has a low level of impact and has created significant results post-heading using robust assessment techniques in a previous study.\n4\nEXP subjects performed 10 standing headers over a 10\u2009min period, whereas CON subjects did not perform soccer heading. Acceleration data of the headers is reported in\nTable 1\n.\n\nClinical measurement\nThe Sport Concussion Assessment Tool, 3rd edition (SCAT3) is a standardized tool for evaluating injured athletes for concussion and is mostly used in the field for sideline clinical concussion measurement. We used a modified Balance Error Scoring System (mBESS), which is a subsection of the SCAT3, to examine the subconcussive head impact as a clinical measurement.\n7\nThe mBESS consists of three different tasks including: single leg (nondominant), double leg, and tandem stance (nondominant foot at back). All tasks are performed on a firm surface without shoes. Subjects were asked to close their eyes, put their hands on the iliac crests, and maintain upright stance for 20\u2009sec for each task. There was a 1-min break between tasks.\nAn error is credited to the subject when any of the following occurred: moving the hands from the iliac crests, opening the eyes, step stumble or fall, abduction or flexion of the hip beyond 30 degrees, lifting the forefoot or heel off the ground, and remaining out of the proper testing position for greater than 5\u2009sec. Two experienced scorers performed the assessment in the current study; however, each subject was assessed by the same scorer throughout all testing sessions.\n\nStanding posture control assessment\nGalvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) was applied while subjects stood on a foam pad with eyes closed to diminish reliable foot/ankle proprioceptive input and maximize the vestibular sensory modality for postural control of upright stance, as pictured in\nFigure 1A\n. Two linear isolated stimulators (Biopac Systems, Inc., Goleta, CA) generated the binaural-monopolar GVS. Independent stimuli were delivered to each side via a pair of circular electrodes secured over the mastoid process with an elastic headband and 2\u2009cm ipsilateral to the T2 spinous process.\n21\nThe electrodes were secured using adhesive tape, and electrode gel was applied at the electrode-skin interface to improve conductance.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExperimental setup for standing and walking posture control assessment. (\nA)\nStanding on foam with eyes-closed during galvanic vestibular stimulation. (\nB)\nSchematic of a subject walking the treadmill with visual feedback system.\nGVS consisted of a \u00b11\u2009mA sinusoidal galvanic stimulus at 0.36\u2009Hz.\n20\nThe polarity of stimulation was always the same for the two sides (binaural-monopolar GVS), inducing an illusion of pitch rotation at the ankle joint (i.e., anterior-posterior sway) in the sagittal plane. The response to the GVS stimulus was measured by gain and phase. Gain represents the amplitude of response to the GVS stimulation, while phase represents the response time to the GVS stimulation. Calculations for gain and phase is further described under the\nFrequency response function analysis\nsection.\nThe instruction to the subjects was to look straight ahead and stand upright comfortably. The subjects were instructed to place their feet on the foam so that they could stand comfortably for the length of a trial, but no wider than shoulder width apart. The feet were aligned symmetrically in the frontal plane, and foot position was marked by tape to be reproducible throughout the experiment. Eight trials were repeated for each subject, and the length of each trial was 125\u2009sec with 5\u2009sec added at the beginning and end of each trial (total 135\u2009sec) to allow vestibular stimulation to ramp up and ramp down.\nDuring each trial, kinematics were captured by a six-camera motion capture system (Motion Analysis, Santa Rosa, CA). The head (temple), shoulder (scapula), hip (greater trochanter), knee (lateral femoral condyle), ankle (lateral malleolus), and foot (fifth metatarsal head) were measured by attaching 12 reflective markers on both sides of the subject to measure subject's anterior-posterior movement in the sagittal plane. An extra marker was placed on the sacrum to approximate body center of mass (COM) based on the sacral marker method.\n23\nThe leg angle \u03b8\n1\n(\nt\n), trunk angle \u03b8\n2\n(\nt\n), and head angle \u03b8\n3\n(\nt\n) with respect to vertical were determined by the anterior-posterior (AP) and vertical displacement of the head, shoulder, hip, and ankle markers. Kinematics were sampled at 120\u2009Hz.\n\nWalking posture control assessment\nFor the walking balance assessment, subjects walked on a treadmill (56\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u2009160\u2009cm, TMX425, Full Vision, Newton, KS) while two webcams (Logitech HD Pro Webcam C920, Logitech, Newark, CA) tracked the trunk orientation angle with respect to a self-calibrated vertical reference axis of each subject's standing posture (\nFig. 1B\n). Trunk orientation was based on the three-dimensional (3D) coordinates of three flat green rectangular markers, affixed to an elastic suspender, at the acromioclavicular joints and the navel. The 3D coordinates over the walking space of the treadmill were reconstructed from two consecutive sequences of live images from the webcams calibrated using a modified open source code.\n24\nThe visual display was created with custom scripts using Vizard (WorldViz, Santa Barbara, CA), on a desktop computer (Dell PWS650, Dell, Round Rock, TX). The current system setup has been described in detail in a previous aticle.\n22\nTrunk orientation was represented to the subject as the position of a moving cursor within a bull's-eye target on a 68.58\u2009cm (27-inch) wide screen TV (ViewSonic VA2703, ViewSonic,Walnut, CA) mounted at standing eye level. Trunk orientation relative to vertical here is defined as AP and medial-lateral (ML) angular displacement of the segment defined by the naval marker to the midpoint of the acromion process markers. The center of the bull's-eye corresponded to the subject's standing upright vertical position. The bull's-eye was displayed as 10 concentric 2.54\u2009cm wide rings with each expanding ring corresponding to 1 degree of angular displacement from the vertical. The center circle of the bull's-eye is 2.54\u2009cm in diameter. The radius of the center circle and the width of each expanding ring is 1.27\u2009cm. The length of 1.27\u2009cm is represented as 1 degree of trunk angular deviation.\nCursor motion was scaled as a 1:1 ratio to trunk segment motion. Up-down movement of the cursor represented fore-aft angular deviations of the trunk from vertical, and left-right movement of the cursor represented side-to-side angular deviations of the trunk from vertical. During each time session, subjects were instructed to walk for three trials on the treadmill at 1.4\u2009m/sec for 2\u2009min while maintaining the cursor within the center of the bull's-eye. The amount of time the cursor maintained within the center circle of the bull's-eye was converted to a performance score out of a maximum of 1200 points (e.g., 1\u2009sec maintained at the center was given as 10 points), displayed after each trial. Trunk kinematics was measured with the same two webcams used to display the cursor, sampled at 15\u2009Hz.\n\nFrequency response function analysis\nFrequency response function (FRF) analysis was applied to the standing posture control assessment to investigate the relationship between two signals: GVS (input) and body movement from segment angles and COM (output). For any two signals\nx\n(\nt\n) and\ny\n(\nt\n), the power spectral densities (PSDs)\np\nxx\n(\nf\n) and\np\nyy\n(\nf\n) and cross spectral density (CSD)\np\nxy\n(\nf\n), where\nf\nis frequency, are computed using the Welch method\n25\nwith 50-sec Hanning windows and 50% overlap and then averaged across trials. FRF is the CSD divided by the PSD of the input. Gain is the absolute value of the FRF, describing the strength of the relationship between output and input signals. Phase, calculated from the angle of FRF, is a measure of the temporal relationship between the input and output; the output may lead the input (positive values) or lag behind it (negative values).\n\nTrunk orientation\nTo investigate dynamic stability involving sensory feedback during walking, trunk orientation displacement was calculated as the difference between the midpoint of the top two acromion process markers and the navel marker in the frontal plane (for ML direction), to approximate small angular deviations.\n26\nTrunk orientation velocity was calculated from\nv(t)\n=\u2009(\nx(t\u2009+\u20091)\n\u2212\nx(t\u2009\u2212\u20091)\n)/2, where\nt\nis the time/frame,\nv(t)\nis the velocity as a function of time,\nx(t)\nis the position as function of time. This method reduces higher-frequency noise from the tracking system when calculating velocity from displacement data.\n27\nRoot mean square (RMS) displacement and velocity was calculated as a measure of overall trunk motion variability.\n\nStatistical analysis\nIndependent\nt\ntests were used to compare subjects' characteristics (age, weight, height, years of soccer playing experience, and number of past concussions) between EXP and CON groups. Significant demographic difference in age and soccer playing experience existed between groups as shown in\nTable 1\n. Because of significant demographic difference between groups (\nTable 1\n) and the repeated measures design, a conservative approach using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was applied to determine group differences in all outcome measurements with respective baseline values of each measurement set as covariate to account for any potential differences of task performance by the subjects.\nValues for experiences were self-reported and their playing and practicing habits were not accounted for. Therefore controlling for the baseline performances of each measurement created a more empirical comparison by creating a state of equality for the subject's performance capabilities at the time of testing. Moreover, the current study's aim is to investigate behavioral changes across time. Thus, to control for potential validity threats when comparing between groups during pre- and post-heading, baseline values were set as covariates to account for potential changes caused by subconcussive impact. The level of statistical significance for ANCOVA analysis was set to\np\n<\u20090.05.\nPaired\nt\ntests (two-tailed) were used to determine significant differences within subjects across testing sessions. The level of statistical significance for the paired\nt\ntests was set to\np\n<\u20090.0175 after adjusting for Bonferroni correction. Because of the limitation of having 10 subjects per group,\nt\ntests that resulted in significant difference at\np\n<\u20090.017 were further investigated by calculating the Cohen d to identify effect size for the observed change. All data analyses were performed in SPSS 20 statistical software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) and MATLAB R2014b (The MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA)."

    "Methods": "Animal housing\nAdult female Sprague-Dawley rats (\u223c230\u2009g) were purchased from Hilltop Lab Animal (Scottdale, PA). Animals were housed in pairs during the acclimation period and were housed individually for post-operative care and throughout the rest of the experiments.\n22\nRats were maintained at a 12:12\u2009h light-dark cycle and trained for behavioral studies after 1 week of acclimation. Water and rat food chow (Harlan Teklad) were provided\nad libitum.\nThe Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus, reviewed and approved all animal surgeries, procedures, and post-operational care. Laboratory personnel managed animals following the\nNational Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\n.\n\nLaminectomy, SCI, and drug administration\nSurgical procedures were performed under sterile and aseptic conditions. A total of 126 rats underwent surgical procedures for the development of this study. A total of 80 rats were used for the behavioral and histological and immunofluorescence studies, and 15 rats were used for the Western blot experiments. A total of 31 rats were excluded from these studies because of errors during surgical procedures (damage of the spinal cord during laminectomy) or failure to exert a successful compression (height errors during compression with the impactor), which resulted in extensive movement of the hindlimbs at 2 days post-injury (DPI). The exclusion parameter of animals with BBB score \u22655 was established before the development of the experiments.\nFemale Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with a cocktail of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine, 87.5/4.2/0.8\u2009mg/kg (Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IO). All surgical procedures were performed as described previously.\n23\n,\n24\nVaginal smears were performed on at least five animals from each group to determine the estrus cycle stage of the animals. Cytology evaluation was performed blinded to treatment at the moment of surgery and gave us a representation of the cycle of the complete population of animals used for this study. Briefly, a sterile cotton swab was damped on sterile saline inserted in the vagina. The cotton swab was rotated gently until the uterine wall was reached. The sample was spread on frosted slides with a rotating motion and dried at room temperature for 5\u2009min. The slides were stained with Dip Quick Stain (Jorgensen laboratories Inc., Loveland, CO #catJ-322) and evaluated by an experimenter blinded to treatment. No significant trend was observed between the rats that recovered better from SCI and the estrus cycle that the rats were staged at before SCI (data not shown).\nGroups were randomly divided between SCI, SCI + treatment, and sham animals. Sham animals underwent laminectomy at the T9\u2013T10 and were sutured immediately after surgery. Injured animals received a laminectomy at T9\u2013T10 followed by a moderate contusion using the MACSIS impactor device. After laminectomy, the vertebral column was stabilized with clamps, and a 10\u2009g rod was dropped from a 12.5\u2009mm height over the exposed spinal cord and the compression maintained for 5\u2009sec.\nTAM pellets were designed for a continuous drug release of 0.71\u2009mg/day for 21 days after SCI, similar to the amount used in our pre-treatment studies.\n15\nImmediately or 24\u2009h after SCI, a pellet of TAM (15\u2009mg) or PLB (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL, cat.# E-361) was placed subcutaneously in the mid-scapular region. The pellets were designed to release TAM immediately after implantation. Previous studies from our laboratory using UPLC-MS/MS have confirmed that TAM is consistently released in animals after implantation, and the levels decline with time (at 14, 21, and 28 days post-implantation).\n15\nThe release of TAM was monitored indirectly by weighing the animals weekly, because this drug provides an anorexic effect.\n25\nAnimals were sutured, and post-operative care included antibiotic injection (25\u2009mg/kg cefazolin for 7 days), subcutaneous saline administration, eyedrops (to prevent excessive dryness to the cornea), and buprenorphine (Reckett & Colman Pharmaceuticals, Richmond, VA; 0.05\u2009mg/kg) application twice a day for 3 days.\n24\nBladders were manually voided three times a day until micturition reflexes were fully reestablished (5\u20137 days). All animals were housed individually after laminectomy or SCI. Cereal and paper enrichment was provided to all animals (sham and injury) throughout the experiments.\n26\nParameters related to the compression injury performed with the MACSIS impactor were evaluated (\nTable 1\n). Compression injury was similar among groups, with no statistical difference observed, according to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Tukey's multiple comparison\npost hoc\ntest (F\n(3,51)\n=\u20090.4540;\np\n=\u20090.7156). Analysis of the rod impact velocity revealed no significant difference among groups (F\n(3,50)\n=\u20091.124;\np\n=\u20090.3484). The BBB test was performed at 2 DPI to establish the exclusion baseline of rats for this study. The animals that were able to perform extensive movement of the hindlimbs a this time point (BBB score \u22655) were excluded from all further tests and were not included in this article.\nTable\n1.\nImpact Parameters Related to Compression Injury with the MASCIS Impactor\nTreatment groups\nCompression (mm)\nImpact velocity (m/sec)\nBBB score (2 DPI)\nSham PLB\nN/A\nN/A\n21\nSham TAM\nN/A\nN/A\n21\nSCI PLB\n2.24\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07\n0.48\u2009\u00b1\u20090.00\n0.55\u2009\u00b1\u20090.31\nt\u2009=\u20090\u2009h\nSCI TAM\n2.20\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07\n0.47\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\n0.63\u2009\u00b1\u20090.29\nt\u2009=\u20090\u2009h\nSCI PLB\n2.23\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08\n0.47\u2009\u00b1\u20090.00\n0.30\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12\nt\u2009=\u200924\u2009h\nSCI TAM\n2.12\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06\n0.47\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\n0.42\u2009\u00b1\u20090.15\nt\u2009=\u200924\u2009h\nOpen in a separate window\nBBB, Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan; DPI, days post-injury; PLB, placebo; TAM, tamoxifen; SCI, spinal cord injury.\nEvaluation of the impact parameters related to the compression injury with the NYU impactor showed no significant difference among groups. Compression injury was similar among groups; no statistical difference was found according to one-way analysis of variance, Tukey's multiple comparison test (F\n(3,51)\n=\u20090.4540,\np\n=\u20090.7156). Analysis of the rod impact velocity revealed no significant difference among groups (F\n(3,50)\n=\u20091.124,\np\n=\u20090.3484). Locomotor assessment at 2 DPI revealed no significant difference among groups, suggesting that the impact to the cord exerted a successful moderate compression (F\n(3,36)\n=\u20090.1948,\np\n=\u20090.8992). Rats were not included in the behavioral, histological, and molecular data if the animals were capable of exerting extensive movement of two areas of the hindlimbs at 2 DPI (BBB score \u22655).\n\nBehavioral experiments\u2014recovery of locomotion, balance, and coordination\nAll animals were trained on the behavioral tests 1 week before SCI. Locomotor recovery was assessed weekly at 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 DPI. The BBB open field test was used as a tool for evaluating locomotor behavior as reported previously.\n27\nBriefly, rats walked individually on a plastic pool while two examiners, blinded to treatment, evaluated hindlimb locomotion. Each hindlimb was scored individually (between 0 and 21) based on joint movement, paw position, weight support, coordination, toe clearance, among other parameters. The average score of both limbs for each animal was reported. An initial evaluation was performed at 2 DPI to confirm that the injury was performed appropriately (\nTable 1\n).\nThe grid walk test was used to evaluate animal coordination when crossing a horizontal ladder (3\u2009ft long, with bars separated by 1 or 2 in). Every week, the separators were alternated randomly to prevent habituation of the animal. Animals were evaluated on the number of errors (failure to correctly position the paw on the grid) and the number of correct paw positions. Because statistical analysis revealed no differences between left and right hindlimb scores of each group (data not shown), the number of errors and correct paw positions were averaged between left and right hindlimbs.\nThe narrow beam crossing test was used to evaluate recovery of equilibrium when challenged to cross a narrow surface. Rats crossed the square (2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009cm) and round (2\u2009cm diameter) beams at 36\u201344\u2009cm (\u223c15\u201318 inches) from the ground and were scored according to their ability to cross from one side to the other.\n28\nAnimals were scored weekly for each beam as follows: half a bar, 0.5 point; entire beam without the use of hindlimbs 1.0 point; entire beam using one hindlimb, 1.5 points; or the entire beam using both hindlimbs; 2 points. The total score for both beams was combined, and the average was reported for each animal. Sham animals received a total score of 4 points throughout the experiment (data not shown).\n\nAnimal sacrifice and tissue collection\nFor histology and immunofluorescence studies, rats were anesthetized and sacrificed by intracardial perfusion with cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 35 DPI. The areas of laminectomy and lesion epicenter were identified, the vertebral column was cut open, spinal nerves were cut, and 1.5\u2009cm of spinal cord was exposed and removed. The segment was obtained and presumed as a representation of the entire affected area (0.5\u2009cm of the rostral, 0.5\u2009cm epicenter, and 0.5\u2009cm of the caudal area). The spinal cord was post-fixed in cold 4% PFA for 3\u2009h. Tissue was washed in cold PBS and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose; tissue was stored at 4\u00b0C until further processing. To determine effect of TAM on tumorigenesis, the liver was extracted after fixation at 35 DPI.\n29\nAlso, the brain was dissected, and both organs were dried overnight and weighed 24\u2009h after dissection.\n30\n\nLuxol fast blue histology and densitometry analysis\nSpinal cord tissue was embedded on freezing medium and transversely sectioned at 20\u2009\u03bcm using Leica Cryostat. Transverse spinal cord sections were placed on gelatin coated slides and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until further processing. The amount of white matter spared tissue was determined by staining transverse tissue sections with Luxol fast blue as reported previously.\n15\n,\n24\n,\n31\nTo have a representation of the lesion epicenter, a total of three sections (\u223c200\u2009\u03bcm apart) were selected for each animal evaluated in the Luxol fast blue experiments. Photomicrographs were taken using Motic (version 1.2 software).\nDensitometry analysis was performed with MCID (Imaging Research, Inc. Ontario, Canada) as reported previously.\n15\n,\n24\n,\n31\nRepresentative images (10x) were captured with Nikon E20L inverted microscope with DSRI2 CMOS camera. Briefly, to determine the amount of white matter spared tissue per area, the stained section of the spinal cord was delineated, selected, and the density per area (D \u00d7 A) measured. Then, the area of the epicenter cavity was delineated, selected, and measured (D \u00d7 A). The density measured on the epicenter cavity area was subtracted from the total density measured for the lesion epicenter, which represents the amount of white matter spared tissue on this area in density per unit area (density/area).\n\nImmunofluorescence imaging and quantification\nCellular and structural markers, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament heavy chain (NF-H), were evaluated by immunofluorescence on 20\u2009\u03bcm transverse sections, as proteins associated with secondary damage after SCI. Neuronal nuclei antibody (NeuN) was used to identify neuronal populations on the dorsal horn (DH) and ventral horn (VH) of the spinal cord. Slides were dried at 60\u00b0C for 30\u2009min, and freezing media was removed with forceps.\nAll washes and incubations were performed at room temperature. First, cell membrane was permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS, fixed in 4% PFA, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS/0.01%NaN\n3\nfor 2\u2009h. Slides were incubated for 1\u2009h with the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-GFAP (1:2000 BD Biosciences, #cat 556327), mouse anti-NF-H (1:1000 Millipore, #cat CBL212), or mouse anti-NeuN (1:4000 Millipore, #cat MAB377). To assess the amount of nonspecific binding, every antibody was validated by the use of isotype controls at the same concentration as the primary antibody. Isotype controls were mouse IgG1 (CST, #cat G3A1) or mouse IgG2B (Millipore, #cat MABC006). Slides were washed with PBS and probed with Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 donkey anti-mouse (1:500, Invitrogen).\nSections were visualized with an Axio Observer Z1 Zeiss Fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging Inc., Thornwood, NY) and photographed with AxioCam MRm (Rev.3). Imaging parameters were established at the beginning of the experiment and kept constant throughout the experiment. Negative control slides from each experiment were used to calibrate the microscope before imaging. Because quantification of fluorescence may be limited by autofluorescence from the tissue or fluorescence from the fluorophore used, control slides were quantified to determine the amount of fluorescence emitted by these variables. Therefore, immunoreactivity of the primary antibody quantified was expressed as the amount of fluorescence emitted over the background fluorescence and autofluorescence.\nTo assess the effects of TAM on neuronal number as a consequence of spatial damage after SCI, a total of two sections rostral to the lesion epicenter were counted per animal (\u223c5\u2009mm from the lesion epicenter, \u223c500\u2009\u03bcm apart). To reduce bias, two evaluators performed individual assessments of each anatomical area in the DH and VH. Evaluators identified neurons by positive immunoreactivity for NeuN on each area and counted the number of cells. Only cells that showed a complete soma on the DH and a defined nucleus in the VH were counted. Neuronal raw counts were normalized against sham animals to obtain the percent of cells that approximately survived after SCI.\nThe effect of TAM in GFAP or NF-H immunoreactivity after injury was determined from 8 bit images that were loaded into Image J. All measurements were limited to threshold and redirected to the image. GFAP and NF-H immunoreactivity were quantified using the Otsu method.\n32\n,\n33\nBriefly, the Otsu method is a mathematical method that automatically defines the optimal threshold for an image with a gray histogram (8 bit) based on integration. The method uses a series of equations to define a value for the pixels with the highest intensity (immunoreactivity for GFAP or NF-H) and the pixels with the lowest intensities (background).\nTo assess the amount of GFAP at the lesion epicenter, images from the dorsal, ventral, and lateral white matter were captured and quantified with the Otsu method. The average of the total quantification for all the areas was reported. To assess the amount of neurofilaments at 35 DPI, we evaluated NF-H immunoreactivity in the lateral funiculus \u223c2\u2009mm caudal to the lesion epicenter. Images from the lateral funiculus (left and right side) were captured and quantified using the Otsu method.\nSham animals were quantified using the same method. The quantification of both sides of each sham animal was averaged and taken as 100%, which was compared to the injured animals. Injured spinal cords were quantified and the total amount (left and right) of NF-H was standardized against the sham animals. The fraction obtained represents the amount of NF-H spared as a consequence of both the moderate contusion to the cord and TAM effects neutralizing the detrimental environment as secondary damage develops after SCI.\n\nProtein extraction and immunoblots\nAnimals were decapited at 35 DPI and three areas from the spinal cord were removed: lesion epicenter (0.5\u2009cm), rostral (0.5\u2009cm), and caudal (0.5\u2009cm). The tissue was washed with cold PBS and immediately transferred to a 1.5\u2009mL microcentrifuge tube containing 700\u2009\u03bcL of the cold extraction buffer (CelLytic MT Lysis/Extraction Buffer [C3228], 1% phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 3, and SigmaFAST\u00ae Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet, EDTA free [all from Sigma]).\nSamples were homogenized using a pellet pestle and then placed in a shaker at 4\u00b0C for 45\u2009min. The samples were centrifuged for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C (20,000\u2009g). The supernatant was collected for protein quantification, using the Bio-Rad protein assay (BioRad). For sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting, 12.5\u2009\u03bcg of protein extracts were separated in 10% SDS polyacrylamide gels and transferred into nitrocellulose membranes using the Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).\nMembranes were blocked with blocking solution (Licor) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary mouse monoclonal antibody against GFAP (1:1,000 BD Biosciences, #cat 556327) and rabbit anti-GAPDH (1:5,000 Sigma) as a loading control. To reduce variability, the GFAP antibody used for immunoblots was the same antibody used for the immunofluorescence experiments. Membranes were washed with PBS/0.1%Tween-20 and incubated with two secondary infrared antibodies: IRDye 800CW goat antirabbit and IR Dye 680RD goat antimouse (1:25,000). Membranes were washed with PBS, and blots were developed using the Odyssey CLx Quantitative Fluorescent Imaging Systems (Licor). Results were quantified with the Image Studio Lite software (Licor).\n\nStatistical analysis\nResults were presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). Differences between groups were considered significantly different if\np\n<\u20090.05. Behavioral data were analyzed by repeated measures (RM) two-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni\npost hoc\ntest. Densitometry analysis (Luxol histology) and immunofluorescence quantification experiments were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey's multiple comparison test. Immunoblotting quantification and behavioral comparisons at 2 DPI between two groups (t\u2009=\u20090 and t\u2009=\u200924\u2009h) were analyzed by two-tailed unpaired\nt\ntest.

    "Methods": "All experimental procedures were approved by the University of California Los Angeles Chancellor's Animal Research Committee and complied with the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.20The timeline for the experimental procedures is shown inFigure 1A. All surgical, stimulation, and behavioral procedures are used routinely in our laboratory.21,22\n\nOverall experimental design\nTen adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (200\u2013250\u2009g body weight) underwent electromyographic (EMG) and epidural stimulating electrode implantation procedures and complete spinal cord transection at spinal segment T8 as previously described.\n22\nAll surgeries were performed under aseptic conditions with the rats deeply anesthetized with isoflurane gas (1.0\u20132.5% via facemask as needed). Surgery was performed with the rats on a water-circulating heating pad maintained at 37\u00b0C to maintain body temperature. All incisions were closed in layers using 4.0 Dexon for the muscle and fascial layers and 4.0 Vicryl for the skin. After surgery, the rats were placed in an incubator until they fully recovered and antibiotics and analgesics were administered once or twice per day as needed for 3\u20134 days. Thereafter, the rats were housed in a room maintained at 26\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C and 40% humidity and on a 12:12\u2009h light:dark cycle with access to food and water\nad libitum.\nThe cage floors were covered with CareFresh bedding. Pieces of fruit were given once daily. After the spinal cord transection surgery, the bladders of all rats were expressed manually three times daily for the first 2 weeks and two times thereafter throughout the study.\n\nEMG implantation procedures\nA small incision was made at the mid-line of the skull. The muscles and fascia were retracted laterally, small grooves were made in the skull with a scalpel, and the skull was dried thoroughly. Two Omnetics connectors with Teflon-coated stainless steel wires (AS632; Cooner Wire, Chatsworth, CA) were attached securely to the skull with screws and dental cement as previously described.\n22\n,\n23\nA skin incision was made in the mid-dorsal region of the back and wires from the connector were routed subcutaneously. Four wires were coiled subcutaneously for later implantation as epidural stimulation electrodes on the spinal cord (see below). Skin and fascial incisions were made to bilaterally expose belly of the medial gastrocnemius (MG) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. Wires were routed subcutaneously from the back incision to each muscle site. Bipolar intramuscular EMG electrodes were formed and secured into the mid-belly of each muscle as described previously.\n23\nThe EMG wires were coiled near each implant site and in the mid-back region to provide stress relief. Stimulation through the connector implanted on the skull was used to verify the proper placement of the electrodes in each muscle. In addition, proper placement of the electrodes was verified post-mortem via dissection. Approximately 1\u2009cm of Teflon coating was stripped at the distal end of an additional wire that served as a reference electrode. This wire was placed subcutaneously on the left side of the vertebral column at the level of the inferior scapular angle.\n\nSpinal cord transection procedures\nSpinal cord transection was performed as previously described.\n22\nA dorsal mid-line skin incision was made from \u223cT6 to T10 and the paravertebral muscles and fascia from \u223cT7 to T9 were reflected laterally to expose the vertebrae. A partial laminectomy was performed via removal of the spinous processes and a portion of the lateral bodies of the T7 and T8 vertebrae, effectively exposing the spinal cord. The dura was picked up using fine forceps and micro-scissors were used to completely transect the spinal cord (including the entire extent of the dura) at \u223cT8 spinal segment. Small cotton balls were used to separate the cut ends of the spinal cord and to clean the transection site. Two surgeons independently verified a complete transection by gently passing a fine glass probe through the transection site and then lifting the cut ends of the spinal cord. Gelfoam was inserted in the transection site to minimize bleeding and to separate (\u223c2\u20133\u2009mm) the cut ends of the spinal cord.\n\nEpidural stimulation electrode implant procedures\nEpidural electrodes were implanted as described previously.\n22\nBriefly, a partial laminectomy was performed over spinal cord segments L2 (between vertebral levels T12 and T13) and S1 (vertebral level L2;\nFig. 1B\n). Two Teflon-coated stainless-steel wires were inserted through an opening made between the T10 and T11 vertebrae and one wire was passed epidurally to each partial laminectomy site. One additional wire that served as a reference electrode for use in monopolar stimulation at the L2 and S1 spinal segments was placed subcutaneously on the right side of the vertebral column at the level of the inferior scapular angle. A small region (\u223c1\u2009mm notch) of the Teflon coating was removed from each wire to form the stimulating electrodes that were then secured to the dura at the mid-line of the spinal cord at each site with 9.0 silk sutures. The wires were coiled at the exit site from the vertebral column to provide stress relief. The two electrodes are at an approximate distance of 14\u2009mm from each other.\n\nLocomotor training procedures\nThe rats were trained in the morning for 3 days/week, 20\u2009min/session for 2 weeks (six training sessions starting 7 days after the spinal cord transection surgery). In each training session, an upper body harness was used to position the rats over a treadmill belt and partially support their body weight during bipedal locomotion.\n22\nBipolar epidural electrical stimulation at L2 and S1 (40\u2009Hz, 200\u2009\u03bcs rectangular pulses) was delivered continuously during the training sessions as described previously,\n22\nexcept that pharmacological agents were not administered in the present study. The treadmill belt speed was increased progressively from 6 to 13.5\u2009cm/sec over the six training sessions.\n\nBehavioral and EMG testing procedures\nKinematics and EMG data were collected from all rats (\nn\n=\u200910) prior to and at 25 days post-transection. Before surgery, testing was done without epidural stimulation, whereas after surgery testing was done with epidural stimulation. Epidural stimulation at L2 at 40\u201350\u2009Hz initiates bilateral rhythmic hindlimb movements in spinal cord\u2013injured rats.\n21\n,\n24\n,\n25\nLow frequency stimulation (3\u20135\u2009Hz) of the caudal lumbosacral cord facilitates postural limb reflexes in spinal rabbits and is accompanied by a predominant extensor activity.\n26\nTherefore, we kept the frequency of stimulation at L2 constant at 40\u2009Hz and varied the frequency of stimulation at S1 (5, 10, 15, 20, or 40\u2009Hz) during stepping to determine any interactions between the rostral and caudal lumbosacral neuronal networks. Thus, each rat was tested with nine different epidural stimulation trials (10\u2009min between trials) during the post-transection testing sessions (\nFig. 1C\n): trial 1, bipolar stimulation from L2-S1; trial 2, bipolar stimulation from S1-L2; trial 3, monopolar stimulation at L2; trial 4, monopolar stimulation at S1; and trials 5 through 9, spatiotemporally-independent monopolar eEmc (SIM-eEmc) at L2 and S1 at five different frequencies of stimulation at S1. The order of the five SIM-eEmc trials was randomized for S1 stimulation frequency.\nA stimulation frequency of 40\u2009Hz with 200\u2009\u03bcsec duration, monophasic rectangular pulses was used during monopolar and bipolar stimulation. For SIM-eEmc, the frequency at L2 was set at 40\u2009Hz with 200\u2009\u03bcsec duration, monophasic rectangular pulses, whereas the stimulation frequency at S1 was varied randomly (5, 10, 15, 20, or 40\u2009Hz with 200\u2009\u03bcsec duration, monophasic rectangular pulses). Additionally, each SIM-eEmc trial chronologically followed five stimulation sequences that were tested as follows: start L2 stimulation, start S1 stimulation at one of the five frequencies (SIM-eEmc), stop L2 stimulation, restart L2 stimulation (SIM-eEmc), and stop S1 stimulation (\nFig. 1D\n). This order was followed to obtain two SIM-eEmc sequences from the same animal per trial. The frequency of S1 stimulation for each SIM-eEmc sequence within a SIM-eEmc trial was kept constant at one of the frequencies listed above. Each SIM-eEmc trial therefore consisted of at least two similar sequences; the tester subjectively determined the best stepping sequence from the video recordings.\nThe timing of one stimulation pulse relative to the other stimulation pulse was not controlled during the SIM-eEmc testing sessions. We identified the effects of the relative timing of the stimulation pulses on stepping ability during analysis of the data. The optimal stimulation intensity to enable stepping was determined by the rat's best stepping ability (determined subjectively by the tester) regardless of stimulation combination: this stimulation intensity (ranging from 1.0 to 3.5\u2009V) then was used during the kinematics and EMG data collection for all trials. Note that we have previously shown that six weeks of training sessions are required for spinal rats to step optimally with monopolar or bipolar epidural stimulation.\n22\n,\n27\nAdditionally, spinal rats step best during the first few minutes of a training session (data not shown). Thus, any improvements in stepping performance in the SIM-eEmc trials (that were conducted after the monopolar/bipolar trials) is not attributed to facilitation from the preceding bipolar stimulation. All outcome measures from kinematics and electrophysiology data were objectively quantified after data collection using standard/customized software and were therefore least likely to be impacted by testers collecting or analyzing data. The investigators were therefore not required to stay blinded to the trials during data collection.\nKinematics data were collected using three-dimensional (3-D) video recordings as described previously.\n22\n,\n28\nThe SIMI motion capture system (SIMI Reality Motion Systems, UntersLHLeissheim, Germany) was used to obtain 3-D coordinates of limb markers attached bilaterally to bony landmarks of the hindlimbs.\n22\nEMG data were collected from eight to 12 consistent consecutive step cycles bilaterally. The EMG signals were filtered (band passed, 30\u2009Hz - 1\u2009KHz) and amplified (\u00d7100) using an analog amplifier (differential AC amplifier; AM-systems Inc.). The signal then was digitized at a 10\u2009KHz sampling rate and stored on a computer using a data acquisition card (NI-DAQ; National Instruments Inc.) using a custom-written program.\n\nData analysis\nThe body was modeled as an interconnected chain of rigid segments and joint trajectories were generated accordingly.\n22\nEight to 12 step cycles taken from when the rats were stepping consistently were analyzed for each stimulation parameter. Joint probability distribution (JPD) plots, a measure of coordination,\n28\nwere obtained from the vertical (y) positions of the left and right metatarsophalangeal markers. Percentage of steps that fell outside the 20% margin (of vertical positions for each limb) for an L-shaped pattern were quantified by normalizing the number of data points that fell outside this margin to the total number of data points.\n28\nA range of kinematic gait parameters, including step height, percentage of plantar steps, and paw drag, were computed for each gait cycle.\n28\nSpatial consistencies of the hindlimb trajectories from the x-y coordinates of the ankle and hip markers were measured as the amount of variance explained by the first principal component.\nAdditionally, the rats were objectively ranked for stepping ability using the following criteria: 1) ability to step rhythmically (unilaterally vs. bilaterally); 2) presence of plantar steps (vs. drags and toe curls); 3) ability to take consecutive steps (12 vs. <12 steps); and 4) x-y trajectory of limb motion (consistent vs. irregular) with adequate step height (low vs. high step height), compared with non-injured controls. Rats with ranks 1\u20133 were grouped as best steppers and those with ranks 4\u20136 were grouped as poor steppers. Grouping ranks across these categories allowed us to run a non-parametric test to determine the relationship between stepping ability and the time delay between stimulation pulses (see statistics below). Activation patterns (EMG amplitude with respect to time) for the TA and MG muscles were obtained by taking an average of 8\u201312 filtered, rectified, and normalized (to the step cycle) EMG bursts from each muscle. Mean peak EMG amplitudes and the time-to-peak amplitude were determined from the rectified linear EMG envelopes for the TA and MG.\n28\nIn addition, the rate at which the MG muscle rose to peak amplitude in a step cycle was calculated. The necessary and sufficient number of animals was determined using standard power calculations based on the mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) from our previous works.\n22\n,\n29\n,\n30\nSignificant differences in measurement outcomes were detected using a two-tailed significance level of\np\n=\u20090.05, sample size of 8\u201312 steps in each animal to maintain a power of 0.90.\nThe electrophysiological characteristics of the MG and TA responses evoked by spatiotemporally-independent S1 and L2 monopolar epidural stimulation pulses (SIM-eEmc) were determined. Firstly, the evoked responses within a single EMG burst for both monopolar and SIM-eEmc combinations (S1 at 5, 10, 20, and 40\u2009Hz) were analyzed. (Note that the 15Hz data set (S1 stimulation 15Hz, L2 40Hz) was not analyzed because the time-interval between L2 and S1 stimulation pulses in a L2-40Hz, S1-15Hz stimulation sequence is random within each muscle burst and can make averaging inaccurate). The start of each 25\u2009msec evoked response (magenta or blue traces in\nFig. 4C\n) within a burst was synchronized with the initiation of the pulse that evoked the response (blue or red dot for L2 and S1 pulses, respectively, in\nFig. 4C\n). For all SIM-eEmc trials, the start time of each L2 pulse (blue dots,\nFig. 4C\n, trials 5, 6, 8, and 9) was taken with reference to the S1 pulse at time \u201c0\u201d (red dot). The magenta trace within the SIM-eEmc bursts represents an \u201cinteraction-evoked response\u201d (i.e., an evoked response influenced by both the S1 and L2 pulse). A blue trace represents an \u201cisolated L2 response\u201d (i.e., an L2 evoked response independent of the S1 pulse;\nFig. 4C, 4D\n). Therefore, with an increasing stimulation frequency at S1 from trial 5 to trial 9, the number of isolated L2 responses (blue traces) decreases within each SIM-eEmc combination such that there are no isolated L2 responses for trial 9. Note that interaction responses were associated with either the L2 pulse following the S1 pulse (S1+L2,\nFig. 4B\n), or the S1 pulse following the L2 pulse if the L2 pulse was delayed more than 18\u2009msec after the S1 pulse (see below).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 4.\nThe locomotor networks for spinal stepping are stimulation frequency dependent.\n(A)\nSchematic of progression of a spatiotemporally-independent monopolar stimulation to electrically-enabled motor control (SIM-eEmc) trial.\n(B)\nThe inter-stimulation pulse interval between L2 and S1 is such that the L2 pulse follows S1 (S1+L2) or precedes S1 (L2+S1; data not shown).\n(C)\nThe modulation of evoked potentials generated for each stimulation pulse in an medial gastrocnemius (MG) electromyographic (EMG) burst in a S1+L2 trial at four different frequencies.

Concurrently, the sum of the rectified EMG\n(F)\nand cumulative integral\n(G)\nof the isolated L2 pulse decreased with an increase in S1 stimulation frequency. The numbers in (E) and (G) in red and blue indicate the total number of S1 stimulation pulses and L2 isolated pulses, respectively, that are summated in each burst for each trial.

Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nSecondly, two epidural stimulation parameters were studied (i.e., the effects of constant L2 and variable S1 stimulation frequency) and the relative timing between the L2 and S1 stimulation pulses on the characteristics of the resultant interaction-evoked responses within an EMG burst during stepping.\nFrequency of stimulation\nThe cumulative integral was calculated from the EMG bursts for each SIM-eEmc trial by separately summing the integral from consecutive interaction-evoked responses and consecutive isolated L2 responses (\nFig. 4\n). Thus, the integral values were separate for an isolated L2, S1+L2, and L2+S1 evoked response. Total cumulative integral values were obtained at every 25\u2009msec within a burst, equivalent to a combination of isolated L2 and the S1+L2 or L2+S1 responses.\nLatency of stimulation pulses (window analysis for relative timing between pulses)\nUpon objectively ranking the rats for their stepping ability at a given S1 frequency in a SIM-eEmc trial, we were able to identify four windows between the L2 and S1 stimulation pulses that best determined the rat's ability to step (\nFig. 5A, 5B\n). In a 25\u2009msec evoked response within each muscle, windows were defined with reference to the S1 pulse (red dot) at \u201c0\u201d and a subsequent L2 pulse (blue dot) that was at a time-interval of: i) 0\u20132.9\u2009msec (window 1, W1), ii) 3\u201310\u2009msec (window 2, W2), iii) 10.1\u201318\u2009msec (window 3, W3), and iv) 18.1\u201325\u2009msec (window 4, W4) after the S1 stimulation pulse. Consequently, W1 was defined as the time window when the L2 stimulation pulse was between 0\u20132.9\u2009msec from the S1 pulse, W2 when the L2 stimulation pulse was introduced at a time 3\u201310\u2009msec from the S1 pulse, W3 when the L2 stimulation pulse was between 10.1\u201318\u2009msec, and W4 when the L2 stimulation pulse was introduced at 18.1\u201325\u2009msec from the S1 pulse. Note that at a S1 frequency of 40Hz, in window 4 (L2 follows 18\u201325\u2009msec after S1) W4 is considered equivalent to L2 pulse preceding the S1 pulse. As such, based on the absence of a prominent polysynaptic response after 18\u2009msec (more than 80% of all traces within a burst) in all of the monopolar combinations tested, the interaction responses for W4 was recognized as an L2+S1 interaction response (i.e., a L2 pulse that precedes the S1 pulse (instead of assigning it as a S1+L2 response).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 5.\nTwo windows with relative time-intervals between the S1 and L2 stimulation pulses result in the best bipedal stepping.\n(A)\nFour windows with inter-stimulation time-intervals were defined with reference to the S1 pulse at \u201c0\u201d and a subsequent L2 pulse (blue dots) that was 1) 0\u20132.9\u2009msec (window 1 [W1]), 2) 3\u201310\u2009msec (window 2 [W2]), 3) 10.1\u201318\u2009msec (window 3 [W3]), and 4) 18.1\u201325\u2009msec (window 4 [W4]) after the S1 stimulation pulse.\n(B)\nThe stepping ability (rank) of a rat in each spatiotemporally-independent monopolar stimulation to electrically-enabled motor control (SIM-eEmc) trial is represented relative to the time delay between stimulation pulses (four time windows W1, W2, W3 or W4) and S1 stimulation frequency (5, 10, 20, or 40\u2009Hz). Each shaded circle therefore represents the stepping ability at a given frequency in a specific time window. The majority of the good steppers (rank 1-3), irrespective of stimulation frequency, fell in the time windows when L2 was at 3-10 (W2) or 18\u201325\u2009msec (W4) after the onset of the S1 pulse. Rank 1 corresponds to the best stepping.\n(C)\nProgression of a SIM-eEmc sequence that consisted of multiple SIM-eEmc trials, each having the same frequency (L2 40\u2009Hz; S1 40\u2009Hz) but different pulse intervals (onset of L2 stimulation pulse at 13ms, 5ms, and 23\u2009msec after the S1 pulse) in the same animal.\n(D)\nLimb kinematics and\n(E)\ncorresponding electromyographic (EMG) signals indicate more a robust stepping pattern (bilateral coordinated steps and trajectory pattern) for the SIM-eEmc segments in W4 and W2 than W3. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nLastly, for each monopolar evoked response and interaction evoked response, the early response was estimated in the window of 1\u20133\u2009msec, the middle response in the window of 4\u20136\u2009msec, and late response in the window of >7\u2009msec, based on previously published data.\n31\n,\n32\nSubsequently, the amplitudes for each evoked response or the interaction-evoked response were calculated from six out of 10 rats that were randomly picked using a coin toss (evoked response from four to six rats is found to be a sufficient number for analysis.\n29\n,\n32\nThe amplitudes of the interaction evoked responses were reported as the percent difference between the amplitudes of the resultant evoked response and amplitudes of evoked responses evoked by L2 alone or S1 alone pulses for that frequency. This was crucial to account for the variation on the frequency of S1 stimulation. All latencies were calculated with respect to the S1 pulse for W1 and W2, to the S1 or L2 pulse separately for W3, and to the L2 pulse for W4.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAn estimate of the variation between trials was first obtained using standard deviations. Normality of distribution was assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Overall significant differences between the stimulation trials were determined using repeated measures one- or two-way analysis of variance measures. Mauchly's Test of Sphericity was conducted to measure the homogeneity of variances for the repeated measures. Bonferroni\npost hoc\ntests were used to identify significant differences between stimulation trials. All data are reported as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD values. Differences between groups were considered statistically significant at\np\n<\u20090.05.\nTo answer the question if the relationship between stepping ability and delay in latency was more than expected by chance, we ran a statistical Fisher's exact test for categorical data.\n33\nAnimals were grouped into two categorical variables: a) stepping ability [good versus poor steppers (ranks 1\u20133\u2009=\u2009good steppers; ranks 4\u20136\u2009=\u2009poor steppers) that formed the rows of a contingency table)] and b) delay between S1 and L2 stimulation pulses during stepping [(W2+W4 vs. W1+W3) that formed the columns of a contingency table]. A two-tailed\np\nvalue was computed from the Fisher's test at \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05. All statistical analyses were performed using MATLAB (Mathworks), STATISTICA (Statsoft Inc.), or GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad, Inc.)."

This system operates using Wintest\n\u00ae\n7.0 closed loop control software, with powerful capabilities for real-time data acquisition and custom waveform generation. A structural support was custom-built to suspend the weight of the actuator (approximately 7.3\u2009kg) over the surgical site, and was secured to a heavy-duty stereotaxic frame (Model 1504; David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA,) on a spinal unit (Model 1780; David Kopf Instruments Tujunga CA;\nFig. 1A, 1C\n). The support structure allowed positioning of the actuator in three dimensions. The impounder rod was fitted with a 15-mm long and 4-mm wide lucite tip (\nFig. 1A inset and 1B\n), and two lasers adjacent to the impactor rod provided crosshairs for positioning the impounder on the exposed dura.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nThe contusion device, its use and the resulting force readout for all impacts.

An example is shown in\nFigure 1F\n; the green line indicates the pre-set waveform. Impact parameters were adjusted with each successive test subject (\nTable 2\n).\nTable\n2.\nLaminectomy Size, Impactor Positioning and Biomechanical Summary\nSubject #1\nSubject #2\nSubject #3\nSubject #4\nSubject #5\nSubject #6\nSubject #7\nSubject #8\nSubject #9\nLaminectomy size AP \u00d7 ML (mm)\n11\u2009\u00d7\u20097\n9\u2009\u00d7\u20097\n12\u2009\u00d7\u20098\n11\u2009\u00d7\u20098\n12\u2009\u00d7\u20099\n11\u2009\u00d7\u20099\n12\u2009\u00d7\u20097.5\n12\u2009\u00d7\u200912\n11\u2009\u00d7\u20099\nDepth from dural surface (mm)\nn/a\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n3.6\n3.0\n3.2\n3.5\n2.8\nML position (mm)\n0.0\n0.0\n\u22121.0\n\u22121.0\n\u22121.0\n\u22121.0\n\u22121.0\n\u22120.5\n0.0\nSet speed (m/sec)\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0.5\n1\n1\n1\n1\nActual speed (m/sec)\n0.27\n0.27\n0.55\n0.55\n0.42\n0.48\n0.51\n0.51\n0.58\nSet displ (mm)\n\u22122.0\n\u22122.0\n\u22123.0\n\u22123.0\n\u22124.0\n\u22124.3\n\u22124.3\n\u22124.3\n\u22124.3\nActual displ (mm)\n\u22121.91\n\u22121.71\n\u22122.66\n\u22122.78\n\u22123.64\n\u22123.68\n\u22123.52\n\u22123.46\n\u22123.72\nTime to max displ (sec)\n0.02\n0.02\n0.02\n0.02\n0.02\n0.02\n0.02\n0.02\n0.02\nPreload force (N)\n\u22120.02\n\u22120.03\n\u22120.30\n\u22120.30\n\u22120.40\n\u22120.56\n\u22120.33\n\u22120.28\n\u22120.18\nForce at max displ (N)\n\u22121.64\n\u22120.16\n\u221212.90\n\u22128.48\n\u221211.07\n\u221211.63\n\u221219.10\n\u221217.97\n\u221213.40\nPeak force (N)\n\u22123.27\n\u22124.48\n\u221214.90\n\u221210.54\n\u221212.50\n\u221223.19\n\u221219.15\n\u221218.73\n\u221213.40\nOpen in a separate window\nAP, anterior-posterior; ML, medial-lateral; N, Newton; displ, displacement; n/a, not available.\nSurrogate testing\nA silicone polymer surrogate spinal cord model (ellipsoid diameter a\u2009=\u20094.8\u2009mm and diameter b\u2009=\u20098.9\u2009mm) was manufactured to match the size and compressive properties of the spinal cord. To mimic the properties of the dura, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and vertebral canal, the surrogate cord was enclosed in a water-filled polyethylene plastic flat tubing and was placed in a metal trough (approximately the size of the vertebral canal) embedded in a Styrofoam block for stability. This surrogate model allowed for initial development of the force reading protocol to identify the dura, cord surface, and entrapment of the cord against the canal. It also allowed for the calibration, tuning, and testing of the impact protocol prior to each surgery. Thus, accurate and consistent force and displacement readouts prior to the actual\nin vivo\nimpact were confirmed.\n17\n\nSurgical procedures\nUnilateral spinal cord contusion injury\nThe animals were sedated with ketamine (10\u2009mg/kg IM; Mylan Institutional LLC, Rockford, IL) and atropine (0.05\u2009mg/kg IM; Baxter HealthCare Corp., Deerfield, IL), intubated, and maintained at a surgical plane of anesthesia using isoflurane (1.5-2.0%; Piramal Critical Care Inc., Bethlehem, PA) and constant rate infusion of fentanyl citrate (7-10\u2009\u03bcg/kg/h intravenously; Hospira Inc., Lake Forest, IL). The surgical site was prepared using standard aseptic techniques. The animal was place in a standard stereotaxic instrument (Model 1780; David Kopf Instruments). During surgery, body temperature, heart rate, respiration rate, and indirect blood pressure were closely monitored and maintained within acceptable ranges. Analgesics, such as oxymorphone hydrochloride (0.15\u2009mg/kg; Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc., Chadds Ford, PA), and antibiotics (cefazolin, 25\u2009mg/kg IM; GlaxoSimthKline, Research Triangle Park, NC) were administered. A complete laminectomy at the fifth cervical vertebra (C5) was made using a Stryker drill (Impaction drill; Surgical Power, Inc. Warsaw, IN; 3.5\u2009mm round drill bit) to expose the dura (which was not opened) and the underlying spinal cord. Laminectomy size was noted for each subject (\nTable 2\n).\nNext, the Bose impactor unit was positioned over the C5 laminectomy site; the vertebral clamps were fixed to the spinous processes of C4 and C6. The impactor rod (tip 4\u2009mm in diameter to match the size of the NHP hemi-cord at spinal level C6-7) was lowered over the right side of the cord onto the dural surface with the tangent to the circular edge of the impounder aligned along the midline (subjects #1, 2, and 9), 1\u2009mm to the left of midline (subjects #3-7) or 0.5\u2009mm to the left of midline (subject #8), then lowered to make direct contact with the dural surface. To confirm accurate positioning of the impounder on the spinal cord, real-time force readouts of the compensated load served as a monitoring tool to identify the dural surface, the cord surface, and the entrapment of the cord against the ventral aspect of the canal (\nFig. 1D, 1E\n). Upon reaching a force readout indicating entrapment of the cord against the canal, the impactor displacement programmed into the TestBench system (set at 2, 3, or 4\u2009mm) was initiated to produce the contusions. The force necessary to produce the set displacement was measured and all impact biomechanical variables recorded were available immediately after the impact (\nTable 2\n). The impounder did not perforate the dura at the impact site.\nIn addition to system readouts, a 7\u2009mm flexible inspection camera (Borescope, Model iT50-BT-BFBA; Brainy Trade, Passaic, NJ) was introduced into the outer margins of the incision to visually monitor the precise placement of the impounder prior to and during contusion of the spinal cord. After the contusion, the wound was closed in anatomical layers and the animal was allowed to recover under veterinary care in the hospital where they received intensive care unit (ICU) care for the first few days of recovery.\nUpon release from the hospital, animals were returned to their home cages equipped with extra bedding materials to prevent pressure sores. The animals were attended every few hours during the day and encouraged to sit up, reach, and stand by offering food rewards (e.g., fruit, raisins, etc.). As soon as the animals were able to enter the transfer box, they were allowed to enter the open field exercise cage. Chairing was initiated shortly thereafter.\nCST labeling\nIn our previous study of NHPs with cervical spinal hemisections,\n11\nmultivariate principal components analysis (PCA) provided evidence for a role of sprouting of the intact CST in recovery. To begin to study this in the NHP contusion injury model, we labeled the CST in three animals (subjects #5, #6, and #8). Fourteen weeks after SCI, the CST was anterogradely labeled using biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) as the tracer, as previously described.\n11\n,\n19\nBriefly, under deep anesthesia as described above for the spinal surgery, a craniotomy was performed and the dura was incised and retracted to expose the motor cortex. A glass micropipette fixed to a picospritzer was used to inject 0.3\u2009\u03bcL of BDA (10%) at 59 sites (127 total injections) throughout the left primary motor cortex serving the hand, trunk, and foot. The wound was closed in anatomical layers and the animals were allowed to recover under veterinary care in the hospital where they received ICU care for the first few days of recovery. Six weeks after labeling, animals were intracardially perfused with fixative under deep anesthesia and processed for histological evaluation.\n\nOpen field behavioral testing\nExercise cage\nAll animals (\nN\n=\u20099) were scored in an open field task developed to assess general motor function and over-ground locomotion, climbing, and object manipulation.\n12\nAnimals entered a large open wire-mesh cage (7 feet [height] \u00d710 ft [width] \u00d76 ft [depth]) through a chute where they had the option of ascending a series of four elevated perches to reach a food reward placed inside a Kong\n\u00ae\n(a hollow rubber toy filled with food such as peanuts, raisins, small pieces of dried fruits, etc.; The Kong Company, Golden, Co), on the top perch. Locomotor activity was evaluated while the animals traversed the perches, as well as on the floor of the open cage. Climbing was assessed during food retrieval from a series of five cups hanging at different heights (1.5, 2.7, 3.5, 4.3, and 4.7 ft) on the front of the cage. Object manipulation was assessed during manipulation of the Kong\n\u00ae\n(hollow toy) and during the consumption of a large food item (e.g., apple or orange). Body and limb posture, wrist, hand, and individual finger movements were assessed during manipulation of the objects both on and off the ground. Scoring of functional recovery was similar to that described by Nout and colleagues,\n12\nwhere behavioral features were assigned 0, 1, or 2 points, with the highest point assignment representing normal function (see\nTable 3\nfor a summary description of the scoring system,\nsupplementary Fig. S1\nfor the data collection sheet, and\nsupplementary Fig. S2\nfor the specific point assignment schema; see online supplementary material at\nwww.liebertpub.com\n). Animals were placed in the exercise cage 4-5 times/week; two testing sessions per week were performed as described above and were recorded; at least one session/week was scored live.\nTable\n3.\nOpen-Field Scoring Scheme\nCategory\nSubscore\nMax score\nScore composition\nLocomotion\n34\nOverground locomotion and walking\nGeneral\n(10)\nForward movement (dragging-walking), number of limbs used, number of perches reached, presence/absence of tremor, ability to touch head/face with forelimb\nMovements and weight support\n(10)\nAbility to move upper (shoulder, elbow, wrist, fingers) and lower joints (hip, knee, ankle, toes), weight support during stance or sitting\nWalking\n(14)\nFoot faults, placement surface, stepping and gait asymmetry\nClimbing\n16\nForelimb (wrist, fingers) or hindlimb (heel, toes) joints used during climbing and retrieval, finger/toe strength, number of cups reached\nObject manipulation\n22\nPredominant joint position of forelimb and hindlimb during object manipulation, forelimb support of object on and off ground, joint and independent finger movements, digit 1 opposition and frequency, pincer grasp\nTotal\n72\nOpen in a separate window\n\nChair tasks\nA subset of animals (subjects #5, #6, #7, and #8) was tested in a primate chair for isolated use of the forelimb ipsilateral to the lesion. Animals were pre-trained to enter and exit the restraint chair using a pole-and-collar system. Upon successful completion of this training, animals were trained to perform the separate tasks described below. For each task, the proportion of trials with successful completions (i.e., successful transfer of food rewards to the mouth) is reported. Chairing occurred three times/week, with the first two sessions being training/re-training sessions and the last session being the testing session.\nAssessment of tone\nAt the beginning of each post-operative chairing session, the affected forelimb was gently massaged, joints were moved through the full range-of-motion, and muscle tone was rated using the Modified Ashworth Scale,\n20\nwhere 0\u2009=\u2009no increase in muscle tone, 1\u2009=\u2009slight increase in muscle tone (manifested by a catch followed by minimal resistance through the remainder [less than half] of the range of motion), 2\u2009=\u2009slight increase in muscle tone (manifested by a catch followed by resistance through greater than half of the range of motion), 3\u2009=\u2009more marked increase in tone throughout most of the range of motion but the affected part is easily moved, and 4\u2009=\u2009the affected part rigid in flexion or extension. An aggregate score was determined by assessing the elbow, wrist, and finger joints.\nPlatform retrieval task\nAnimals were trained to retrieve a small or medium-sized food reward (i.e., raisin, peanut, or grape, apple piece, etc.) from a flat platform positioned so that only the impaired limb could be used for item retrieval. Five trials per reinforcer size per session were conducted.\nStick retrieval task\nAnimals were trained to retrieve a food item (e.g., a grape) from a vertical post/stick positioned in the center of the flat platform. Five trials per session were conducted followed by a second set of five trials with an inverted funnel placed over the stick/post forcing use of a pincer motion for retrieval.\nHandle pull task\nIn this task, animals were trained to pull a U-shaped handlebar attached to a spring with force tension of 20 Newton (N; easy), 60\u2009N (medium), or 98\u2009N (hard). The handle was oriented in a horizontal and then vertical position and the animal's performance was assessed in a total of three trials in each position per session with a constant spring force predetermined by the level of impairment and ability of the animal to perform each task.\nBrinkman board\nIn this task, animals retrieved small-sized food items from a Brinkman board containing 7 slots (3.5\u2009cm long \u00d71\u2009cm wide \u00d70.5\u2009cm deep), four vertical, one horizontal, and two angled at 45\u00b0. The board was loaded twice for a total of 14 trials.\nAssessment of sensory function using an electronic von Frey apparatus\nSubjects were trained with positive reward to sit quietly in the restraining chair adapted with a custom-made winged bib to occlude views to the side and below the subject's neck where a tester was positioned. Five 1\u2009mm stimulation sites on each side of the animal were marked with indelible ink (see schematic in\nFig. 7A\n): shoulder (C4 dermatome), lateral hand (C8 dermatome), mid-thorax (T10 dermatome), lateral knee (L3 dermatome), and lateral foot (S1 dermatome). An electronic von Frey apparatus (Model 2390; IITC Life Science, CA) with a 10-g bending force filament attached was used to stimulate each site (three stimulations /site) in a random order. Alternate false alarm trials were interposed, and responses were recorded for all trials. The inter-trial interval was approximately 15\u2009sec. For video recording purpose, stimulus onset was light-cued using a light-emitting diode positioned behind the animal, out of its field of view. The stimulus was applied with a slow onset and was held for approximately 1.5\u2009sec before being withdrawn. Responses were recorded by an observer positioned in front of the animal with a clear view of the animal's face and body. Maximal force for each stimulation was recorded, as were the following specific responses: vocalization, wince, orientation, activity arrest, flinch/skin contraction, withdrawal, and no response. Preferred food items were given at variable times during the session by another experimenter to reinforce sitting quietly. This bi-weekly session usually lasted between 10-15\u2009min. For analysis, data were binned into three time-points (4 and 5, 9 and 10, and 15 and 16 weeks post-lesion) representing the early, mid, and late recovery periods, respectively. Response data also were binned into four categories: 0\u2009=\u2009no response; 1\u2009=\u2009segmental or spinal responses (withdrawal, skin contraction or flinch); 2\u2009=\u2009suprasegmental or supraspinal responses (orientation, activity arrest); and 3\u2009=\u2009facial supraspinal responses (wince and vocalization).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 7.\nResults of the Von Frey Hair (VFH) sensory assessment.\n(A)\nSchematic drawing of the monkey with the stimulation sites indicated as white dots.\n(B)\nResponse category distribution for the different VFH stimulation sites pre-injury (\nn\n=\u20093) and post\u2013spinal cord injury (\nn\n=\u20094). Response rate (either segmental or supraspinal) was about 50% with the hand stimulation producing the most responses. No wince or vocalizations were ever recorded; thus, supraspinal responses included only orientation or activity arrest. False alarm trials almost never produced a response.\n(C, D)\nThe graphs show the interaction effect between the binned weeks post-lesion (x-axis) and the color-coded locations with the mean maximum force (C) and the mean response (D) on the y-axis (0\u2009=\u2009no response, 1\u2009=\u2009spinal responses and 2\u2009=\u2009supraspinal responses). The thoracic location (D) shows an increase in supraspinal responses at the 9\u201310 weeks post-lesion followed by a decrease at the latest time-point. Data are averaged across all subjects tested (\nn\n=\u20094). Means represent estimated marginal means \u00b1 standard error of the mean.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained post-operatively for four subjects (\nTable 1\n) at 14\u201317 weeks after SCI, and pre-operatively, as well, for cases #8 and #9. Animals were sedated with ketamine (Ketaset 10\u2009mg/kg [to effect range, 5\u201330\u2009mg/kg], intramuscularly (IM); Mylan Institutional LLC) and atropine (0.05\u2009mg/kg IM; Baxter HealthCare Corp.), intubated, and maintained using isoflurane (1.5\u20132.0%; Piramal Critical Care Inc.). Animals were placed in an MRI-compatible stereotaxic device (Model 1430\u2009M; David Kopf Instruments). Pre-operative MRIs were obtained to estimate the cord and CSF space size for matching to the mechanical readouts of the contusion device signaling dural touch, cord touch, and cord stabilization; this is now the standard procedure (\nFig. 2\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nPre-operative magnetic resonance images used to generate measurements of the spinal cord parenchyma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space. Sagittal\n(A)\nand axial\n(B)\nT2-weighted images acquired on a 1.5T scanner indicate the location of the fifth cervical vertebral level (A, red line) and were used to estimate size of the spinal cord (B, green lines) and amount CSF space (A, red lines) at that level. Based on these approximations, a schematic representation for the region of interest was generated\n(C)\n. In this example, measurements of spinal cord (5\u2009\u00d7\u20098\u2009mm) and CSF spaces 1.2\u2009mm above and 0.9\u2009mm below the spinal cord) are shown, as well as a representation of the projected laminectomy, the vertebral canal, and the denticulate ligaments (blue wavy lines). R-C, rostral-caudal axis; D-V, dorsal-ventral axis; L-R, left-right side; W/GM, white/gray matter.\n1.5 Tesla System\nA 1.5-T GE scanner (GE Medical Systems, Waukesha, WI) was used to acquire magnetic resonance images on three subjects, and were collected using two 3-inch round coils placed dorsally and ventrally over C6 (Model 2127315, GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI). In addition, NHPs were imaged with a Knee Array (Model 5114356-5; InVivo Corporation, Gainesville, FL) positioned in a supine/prone position. For the 3-inch coils, the field of view (FOV) was set at 14\u2009mm, 0.0\u2009mm spacing, and a slice thickness of 1\u2009mm. For the knee array, the FOV was 16\u2009mm, 0.0\u2009mm spacing, and a slice thickness of 2\u2009mm. Acquisition of magnetic resonance images started with sagittal and axial T2-weighted fast relaxation fast spin echo at 1\u2009mm slice thickness followed by T1-weighted sequences acquired on both planes and thicknesses.\n3 Tesla system\nTo improve image quality and optimize new MRI protocols, one subject was imaged in a 3T Siemens MAGNETOM Skyra scanner using a custom-built four-channel Clamshell MRI coil (Model P-H04LE-030-01295 V01; Rapid MR International, Columbus, OH). Magnetic resonance images acquired on this system included high-resolution 3D T1- and T2-weighted isotropic scans oriented in the sagittal plane with a slice thickness of 270\u2009\u03bcm.\nThree-dimensional volume reconstruction\nReconstruction of lesion volumes was conducted using OsiriX\n\u00ae\nsoftware (v5.5.2). Briefly, the regions of interest (ROIs), defined as the regions of high intensity signal as observed on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images, were manually traced on each of the MRI slices in OsiriX and were then reconstructed using an automated ROI volume tool.\n21\n\nNecropsy\nSurvival time varied with each subject and was determined by behavioral plateau (#1-4) and then by plateau followed by cortical labeling plus 6 weeks for BDA transport. Animals were sedated with ketamine (5-30\u2009mg/kg IM; Mylan Institutional LLC) followed by induction of a deep plane of anesthesia using pentobarbital (approximately to effect 60\u2009mg/kg intravenously; Vortech Pharmaceuticals, Dearborn, MI). Animals were then transcardially perfused with 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10\u2009min followed by 4% PFA/PBS for 45\u2009min. Tissues were post-fixed in 4% PFA/PBS overnight and transferred into 10% and then 20% glycerol with 0.2% dimethyl sulfoxide/1% phosphate buffer.\n\nTissue processing\nSpinal cords were collected and cut into blocks corresponding to spinal segments identified by locating the entry zone for each dorsal root and cutting just rostral to the entry zone. The arachnoid membrane was removed prior to sectioning. Serial sections were cut at 40-\u03bcm on a Leica sliding freezing microtome (HM-450; Fisher Scientific, Clifton, NJ) and were placed in cryoprotectant solution until processed for histological analysis. Brains also were collected and in cases with cortical labeling, cut frontally into 5\u2009mm blocks and frozen for later sectioning.\n\nHistology\nEriochrome cyanine staining for myelin\nPre-dried slide-mounted sections were placed in 100% alcohol:chloroform (1:1) for 1\u2009h, washed in 100% alcohol (2\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009min), air dried at room temperature (RT), and stained in eriochrome cyanine (EC) solution for 20-30\u2009min, then washed in running tap-water. After washing, slides were differentiated in 5% iron alum solution at RT (15\u2009min), washed in running tap-water, differentiated in borax-ferricyanide at RT (10\u2009min), washed again in running tap-water and counterstained in 0.5% neutral red (NR) for 1-2\u2009min at RT before a final wash in water. Sections were dehydrated in graded alcohols (70%, 95%, and 100%; 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009min each), submerged in xylene (2\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009min) and cover-slipped with Shandon-Mount (#44581; Sigma, Waltham, MA).\nBDA staining for CST tracing\nSections were washed in Tris buffer solution (TBS, pH 7.4; 3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009min), incubated in 0.6% H\n2\nO\n2\n/100% methanol at RT (30\u2009min), washed again in TBS (3\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009min) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in TBS +0.25% Triton-X (BP151-100; Fisher Scientific) containing Vector ABC elite solution (9\u2009\u03bcL/mL reagent A +9\u2009\u03bcL/mL reagent B, PK6100; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The next day, after washing in TBS (3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009min), sections were developed with DAB (2.5\u2009min; SK-4100, Vector Laboratories), washed in TBS (3\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009min), mounted on slides, dehydrated and cover-slipped with Shandon-Mount.\n\nHistological analysis of lesion parameters and tissue sparing\nCalculation of lesion length, volume, and tissue sparing at the lesion epicenter was performed on spinal cord sections co-stained for myelin with EC and for cell bodies with NR. The lesion epicenter, identified by two independent observers, was indicated as the section with the greatest damage (estimated by the overall loss of gray and white matter). Using the epicenter as the starting point, lesion measurements were taken from the section at the epicenter and at \u00b11.6 and \u00b13.2\u2009mm rostral and caudal. Brightfield images were captured (BZ-9000; Keyence, Woodcliff Lake, NJ) at a resolution of 2000\u2009\u00d7\u20091000 pixels and merged using image analysis software (BZ-II; Keyence). Images were divided into sectors in Adobe Photoshop (CS4, v11.0.2, Adobe Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA), using a superimposed 16-split circle (the ventral artery and dorsal median sulcus served as the reference landmarks), and color-coded to represent the ROI (lesion, red; gray matter, blue; white matter, green). Pixel counts were analyzed in MetaMorph(MetaMorph Inc., Nashville, TN) and then converted to mm\n2\nin Excel(Microsoft Office 2010, Microsoft Corp., Santa Rosa, CA; e.g., mm\n2\n=\u2009number of pixel/1872 pixels per 2\u2009mm). Since the lesion produced distortion and shrinkage of the cross-sectional area of the spinal cord, a section 4.8\u2009mm rostral from the lesion epicenter was used as a comparison to derive proportional epicenter calculations. Lesion volume between measured sections was calculated using the formula for determining the volume of a frustrum of a cone as previously described.\n22\nThe total amount of spared tissue is presented as a percentage of the entire cross-sectional area of the spinal cord (spared tissue/cord area \u00d7100).\n\nStatistical analysis\nAs part of the validation of the contusion model, exploratory data-driven analytics were performed to test for associations between biomechanical parameters, lesion pathology and tissue sparing, and functional outcomes. Bivariate correlations were assessed for all pairwise comparisons. In addition multivariate correlation was assessed using PCA or its non-parametric equivalent (categorical PCA), as needed. All analyses were performed in SPSS v.21 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) using base, regression, advanced models, categories and missing values add-ons.\nAshworth scale data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations, with an ordinal link function to measure changes in the ordinal categories of the Ashworth response (0-5) over time (weeks post-lesion, 2-13) using repeated measures. Linear mixed model was used to calculate the estimated marginal means (EMM) for display purposes only. Statistical significance was set at \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05.\nFor analysis of sensory function using the von Frey apparatus, data were binned across three time-points (4 and 5 weeks, 9 and 10 weeks, and 15 and 16 weeks) post-injury. Maximum force data were analyzed using a four-way nested repeated measures general linear model (analysis of variance [ANOVA]). Response category data were first grouped into four categories, with each category having an assigned number: 0\u2009=\u2009no response; 1\u2009=\u2009spinal response (flinch/skin contraction, withdrawal); 2\u2009=\u2009supraspinal response (activity arrest, orientation towards stimulus); and 3\u2009=\u2009facial supraspinal response (wince or grimace, vocalization). These data were then analyzed using generalized estimating equations with an ordinal link function to measure changes in the ordinal categories (0-3) over time using repeated measures. This is the nonparametric equivalent of a 4-way nested repeated measures general linear model (ANOVA). Significant main effects and interactions on the generalized estimating equations were followed up using\npost hoc\nprocedures of cross-tabulated chi-square to assess specific response categories. A generalized linear model was used to calculate the estimated marginal means for display purposes only. The maximal force applied was used as a covariate in both the generalized estimating equations and the generalized linear model procedures. Statistical significance was set at \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Animals\nWild type (WT) C57Bl/6 female mice (6\u20138 weeks) were obtained from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). The ATF6\u03b1\n-/-\nmice on a 100% C57Bl/6 background were provided by Dr. Randal Kaufman (Sanford-Burnham Institute for Medical Research). Procedures were performed with the approval of the University of Louisville Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the Institutional Biosafety Committee and according to the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, National Research Council, 1996).\n\nSCI\nWT and ATF6\u03b1\n-/-\nmice were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 0.4\u2009mg/g body weight Avertin (2,2,2-tribromoethanol in 0.02\u2009mL of 1.25% 2-methyl-2-butanol in saline, Sigma). Lacri-Lube ophthalmic ointment (Allergen, Irvine, CA) was used to prevent drying of eyes and gentamicin (50\u2009mg/kg; Boehringer Ingelheim, St. Joseph, MO) was administered subcutaneously to reduce infection. A laminectomy was performed at the T9 vertebrae, and moderate contusion injuries (50 kdyn force/400\u2013600\u2009\u03bcm displacement) were performed using the IH impactor\n9\n(Infinite Horizons Inc., Lexington, KY) as described previously.\n10\n,\n11\nExperimental controls included sham animals that received only the T9 laminectomy. Post-operation, mice had 1\u2009mL of sterile saline administered subcutaneously, 0.1\u2009mL of gentamicin administered subcutaneously on the day of the surgical procedure and the third and fifth day post-surgery, and 0.1\u2009mL buprenorphine administered subcutaneously on the day of surgery and for the next two days. Animals were placed on a heating pad until full recovery from anesthesia. Post-operative care included manual expression of bladders twice a day for 7\u201310 days or until spontaneous voiding returned.\n\nBehavioral assessment\nOpen field Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) locomotor analyses were performed before injury for each animal to determine the baseline scores and weekly after SCI for six weeks exactly as defined.\n8\n,\n12\nAll raters were trained by Dr. Basso and colleagues at the Ohio State University and were blind to the animal groups.\n\nIsolation of mouse oligodendrocyte precursor cells (mOPCs)\nMouse cortices dissected from whole brains of WT and ATF6\u03b1\n-/-\npost-natal day 5\u20137 pups tissue were dissociated using the Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n13\nOPC-A medium was prepared by adding 2.1\u2009g/L NaHCO\n3\n(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to DMEM-F12 without HEPES powder (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and supplemented with N2 supplement (1%), B27 supplement (2%), penicillin/streptomycin (1%, all from Invitrogen), bovine serum albumin (BSA, 0.01%, Sigma), 40\u2009ng/mL FGF2 (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and 20\u2009ng/mL PDGF\u03b1 (Sigma). OPCs were enriched with O4 hybridoma using magnetic cell sorting (MACS) with rat anti-mouse IgM magnetic beads (10% in MACS Buffer). The average yield was 8\u201310\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n6\ncells/brain with a viability of 85\u201395%. There were 9000\u201315,000 cells/cm\n2\ncells seeded on a poly-D-lysine/laminin-coated 10\u2009cm tissue culture dish and incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO\n2\nfor maintenance.\n\nTunicamycin treatment, MTT assay\nThe WT or ATF6\u03b1\n-/-\n-derived mOPCs were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with 30\u2009nM tunicamycin (Tm), an ER-stress inducing drug. Twenty-four hours later, OPC survival was assayed by measuring the conversion of tetrazolium, MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; Sigma) to formazan at a wavelength of 570\u2009nm.\n\nLactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release\nSamples of culture media were collected from WT or ATF6\u03b1\n-/-\n-derived mOPCs that were cultured in 96-well plates and challenged with Tm. The LDH release was determined using Pierce\n\u2122\nLDH Cytotoxicity Assay Kit (Life Technologies) following manufacturer's recommendations.\n\nWestern blot analyses\nProtein lysates were prepared from WT and ATF6\u03b1\n-/-\n-derived mOPCs in protein lysis solution (20\u2009mM Tris, pH-6.8, 137\u2009mM NaCl, 25\u2009mM \u03b2-glycerophosphate, 2\u2009mM NaPPi, 2\u2009mM EDTA, 1\u2009mM Na\n3\nVO\n4\n, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitor, 0.5\u2009mM DTT, 1\u2009mM PMSF) and quantified using the BCA Kit (Pierce, Rockland, IL). Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman, Schleicher & Schuell, Piscataway, NJ). Membranes were processed as described previously\n8\nand probed with GADD34 (Proteintech, 1:1000, Chicago, IL), GRP78 (Cell Signalling, 1/1000 dilution, Camarillo, CA), XBP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1/500, Santa Cruz, CA), and GAPDH (Chemicon, 1/5000, Temecula, CA).\n\nRNA extraction, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\nTotal RNA was extracted from WT and ATF6\u03b1\n-/-\n-derived mOPCs treated with Tm and spinal cord tissue of sham and contused WT and ATF6\u03b1\n-/-\nmice (\nn\n=\u20094/group) from the injury epicenter (4\u2009mm) using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was quantified by ultraviolet spectroscopy, and RNA integrity was confirmed on an ethidium bromide stained formaldehyde agarose gel. cDNA was synthesized with 500\u2009ng of total RNA using the High Capacity cDNA Synthesis Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in a 20\u2009\u03bcL reaction volume. As controls, mixtures containing all components except the reverse transcriptase enzyme were prepared and treated similarly. All cDNAs and control reactions were diluted 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009with water before using as a template for quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR.\n\nQuantitative PCR analysis\nThe qRT-PCR was performed using he ABI 7900HT Real-time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems). Briefly, diluted cDNAs were added to TaqMan universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) and run in triplicate. Target and reference gene PCR amplification was performed in separate tubes with Assay on Demand\u2122 primers (Applied Biosystems) as follows: ATF4 (Mm00515324_m1), CHOP (Mm01135937_g1), Claudin 11 (Mm00500915_m1), GADD34 (Mm00492555_m1), GRP78 (Mm01333323_g1), MBP (Mm00521980_1), Olig2 (Mm01210556_m1) and XBP1 (Mm00457359_m1). The RNA levels were quantified using the \u0394\u0394CT method. Expression values obtained from triplicate runs of each cDNA sample were normalized to triplicate value for GAPDH (reference gene) from the same cDNA preparation. Transcript levels are expressed as fold changes compared with respective levels in sham controls.\n\nStatistical analyses\nA repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) with fixed effects and Bonferroni\npost hoc t\ntest was performed for functional assessments after injury to detect differences in BMS score and subscores between the sham and injury groups over the six week testing period. Statistical analysis of qRT-PCR data was performed using independent\nt\ntest for means with equal or unequal variances or repeated measures ANOVA (one-way or two-way) followed by\npost hoc\nTukey honest significant difference test. For all other analyses, independent\nt\ntests for means assuming equal variance were performed."

    "Methods": "Animals\nThis study was conducted in a facility accredited by the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, and all experiments were performed in accord with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB; Galveston, TX). Mice were bred at UTMB free of enrichment to prevent any effect on behavioral test performance. Mice and rats were housed at the UTMB animal care facility and maintained according to U.S. Department of Agriculture standards (12-h light/dark cycle, with food and water\nad libitum\n).\n\nExperimental design\nExperimental design is detailed in\nFigure 1\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nFlow chart of experimental design characterizing tau oligomers and toxicity from FPI- and blast-injured rats. AFM, atomic force microscopy; FPI, fluid percussion injury; IF, immunofluorescence; MTT, methylthiazole tetrazolium; SEC, size-exclusion chromatography; TOMA, tau oligomer-specific monoclonal antibody.\n\nParasagittal fluid percussion injury\nMale Sprague-Dawley (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) rats (400\u2013500\u2009g) were anesthetized (4% isoflurane), intubated, mechanically ventilated with 1.5% isoflurane in O\n2\n/air (20:80) using a volume ventilator (NEMI Scientific, New England Medical Instruments, Medway, MA), and prepared for parasagittal FPI, as described previously.\n21\n,\n31\nRectal and temporalis muscle temperatures were maintained within a range of 37.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u00b0C. Rats were placed in a stereotaxic apparatus, and a craniotomy was trephined 1\u2009mm lateral (right) of the sagittal suture midway between the lambda and bregma just before FPI or sham injury. Isoflurane was briefly discontinued until the rat displayed a withdrawal response to paw pinch. Immediately after the return of the withdrawal response, the rat was subjected to moderate (2.0 atmospheres [atm]) TBI using an FPI device (Custom Design & Fabrication, Richmond, VA). The transducer housing on our device is connected to the rat by an 18-mm nylon tube that fits into the cap (modified 20-gauge needle hub cemented into the craniotomy site with cyanoacrylic adhesive and hygienic dental acrylic), perpendicular to the craniotomy site. Sham-injured animals are prepared identically to TBI animals with the exception of the release of the pendulum. The height of the pendulum (set at 15.0\u2009cm) determines the intensity of the injury (between 2.0 and 2.2\u2009atm), and the fluid pressure pulse was recorded on an oscilloscope (TDS1002; Tektronix, Inc., Beaverton, OR). The peak pressure pulse was in the range of 250\u2013360\u2009mV, and the pressure wave duration was 25.0\u2009ms. Post-TBI, the time it takes for the animal to regain three consecutive righting reflexes was recorded and then the animal was given isoflurane, and the skin incision was closed and the rodent was allowed to recover. Twenty-four hours post-TBI or sham injury, rats were humanely euthanized and brains were collected and immediately snap frozen and kept at \u221280\u00b0C.\n\nBlast injury\nAdult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories) weighing 350\u2013400\u2009g were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane in an anesthetic chamber, intubated, and mechanically ventilated with 1.5\u20132.0% isoflurane in O\n2\n/room air (20:80) using a volume ventilator. After intubation, the top of the scalp was shaved and foam plugs were placed into each ear. The ABS device is a shock tube designed by David Ritzel (Dyn-FX Consulting, Ltd., Amherstburg, Ontario, Canada) and produced by Steve Parks (ORA, Inc., Fredericksburg, VA). The ABS uses a compressed air driver to produce Friedlander-type shock over-/underpressure waves\n32\nthat closely replicate those recorded in open-field blasts.\n33\nThe ABS consists of a driver chamber, a blast wave expansion chamber, a specimen chamber, and a blast wave reflection suppressor. The driving chamber is separated from the expansion chamber by a Mylar membrane. Amplitudes of shock waves are determined by thickness of the membrane. The shock wave produced when the Mylar ruptures is propagated down the tube where it interacts with the experimental animal and then passes into a wave reflection suppressor. Just before the blast, each rat was disconnected from the ventilator, placed on a specimen tray with its head inside of the ABS device, and secured with Velcro strips. Immediately after the return of a withdrawal response to paw pinch, the rat was subjected to ABS blast injury (17\u201322 pounds per square inch) and removed from the specimen tray. The duration of the suppression of the righting reflex (RR) was measured as an indicator of injury severity, and the average RR range for mild blast in our lab is between 3 and 6\u2009min. After the return of the RR, rats were placed in a cage in the laboratory and monitored. Twenty-four hours later, they were deeply anesthetized, decapitated, and brains were collected and immediately snap frozen and kept at \u221280\u00b0C.\n\nPreparation of brain-derived tau oligomers\nTau oligomers were immunoprecipitated from brains of injured Sprague-Dawley rats with FPI (\nn\n=\u20095) and blast injury (\nn\n=\u20095), as previously described.\n21\n,\n26\n,\n31\nImmunoprecipitation protocols were also completed for sham rats from both FPI and blast injury cohorts as a control (\nn\n=\u20095). Tosyl-activated magnetic Dynabeads (Dynal Biotech, Lafayette Hill, PA) were coated with 20\u2009\u03bcg of antitau oligomer-specific polyclonal antibody T22 (1.0\u2009mg/mL) diluted in 0.1\u2009M of borate (pH 9.5) overnight at 37\u00b0C. Beads were washed (0.2 Mof Tris and 0.1% bovine serum albumin; pH 8.5) and then incubated with TBI rodent brain homogenate (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] soluble fraction) with rotation at room temperature (RT) for 1\u2009h. Beads were washed three times with PBS and eluted using 0.1\u2009M of glycine (pH 2.8). pH was adjusted using 1\u2009M of Tris (pH 8.0) and then fractions were centrifuged in a microcon centrifugal filter device with a molecular weight cutoff of 25\u2009kDa (catalog no.: 42415; Millipore, Billerica, MA) at 14,000\ng\nfor 25\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. Oligomers were resuspended in sterile PBS. Protein concentration was measured using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). Samples were then centrifuged once more in a microcon centrifugal filter device with a cutoff of 25\u2009kDa at 14,000\ng\nfor 25\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. Oligomers were characterized by various methods, including size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), as previously described,\n21\n,\n31\n,\n34\nand stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Oligomers were resuspended in PBS in order to obtain the desired concentration (0.18\u20131.2\u2009mg/mL) and kept at 4\u00b0C for 15\u201330\u2009min, then at RT for 10\u2009min before use.\n\nStereotaxic injection of brain-derived tau oligomers\nFive-month-old homozygous Htau mice (stock no.: 005491; The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME)\n28\nwere anesthetized with ketamine (80\u2013100\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneally [i.p.]) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) and placed in a stereotactic apparatus (Motorized Stereotaxic StereoDrive; Neurostar, T\u00fcbingen, Germanyt). The scalp of each mouse was then shaved and an incision was made through the midline to expose the skull. A craniotomy was drilled (\u20132.06\u2009mm posterior, \u00b11.75\u2009mm lateral, and 2.5\u2009mm ventral to the bregma) into the skull of each mouse. A 5.0-\u03bcL Hamilton syringe was used to inject 2\u2009\u03bcL of either 0.3\u2009mg/mL of brain-derived tau oligomers or saline (\nn\n=\u200910 for each group) bilaterally into the dorsal hippocampus at an infusion rate of 0.2\u2009\u03bcL/min, as described previously.\n26\n,\n33\n,\n27\nThe skin incision was closed using Vet-Bond, and mice were placed on a 37\u00b0C isothermal pad and continuously observed post-surgery until recovery. Attrition post-surgery left\nn\n=\u20097 for the control group and\nn\n=\u20099 for the oligomer-injected group.\n\nNovel object recognition\nThe novel object recognition (NOR) task utilizes the natural tendency of rodents to preferentially explore novel objects and environments over those that are familiar. This task has been used previously to detect memory impairment in Htau mice.\n30\n,\n35\nOne week after brain-derived tau oligomer injection, animals were habituated to the NOR task (\nn\n=\u20097\u20139 mice per group). Mice were allowed to freely explore a white open-field arena (55\u2009cm in diameter; 60\u2009cm in height) for 15\u2009min on the first day. The next day, mice were placed in the arena for the training phase with two identical objects, either spheres or cubes, and allowed to explore for 15\u2009min. On the third day, mice were placed again in the arena for 15\u2009min with one familiar object previously explored in the training phase and one novel object differing in color and shape, but sharing a common size and volume. After each trial, the apparatus was thoroughly cleaned using 70% ethanol and allowed to dry before placement of a new mouse. Trials were recorded and time spent exploring each object was measured using ANY-Maze software. Exploration was defined by head orientation within 2\u2009cm of the object or physical contact with the object. The percentage of total time spent exploring the familiar object versus the novel object was measured. In order to control for any differences in exploratory behavior, the discrimination index was also calculated as the time spent exploring the familiar object subtracted from the time spent exploring the novel object, divided by the total time spent exploring both objects. Object exploration data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism sofware (version 5.04; GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA) by one-way\nt\n-test with a hypothesized mean of zero for the discrimination index.\n\nY-maze task\nThis task provides a measure of spatial working memory and is based on the innate preference of mice to alternate arms when exploring a new environment. At post-injection day 11, mice (\nn\n=\u20097\u20139 per group) were placed in a symmetrical Y-shaped maze. Arms were 40\u2009cm long, 8\u2009cm wide, and 12\u2009cm high (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA), beige in color, nonreflective, and randomly designated A, B, or C. Each mouse was placed in an arm facing the center (arm A) and allowed to explore the maze for 8\u2009min. The number of arms entered, as well as the sequence of entries, was recorded. A correct alternation occurred when the animal moved from the arm in which it began to the other two arms without retracing its steps (i.e., ABC or ACB). Spontaneous alternation, expressed as a percentage, was calculated by dividing the number of entries into all three arms on consecutive choices (correct choices) by number of arm entries subtracted by two, then multiplying the quotient by 100. A high spontaneous alternation rate is indicative of effective working memory given that animals must remember which arm was entered last in order to know not to re-enter it.\n\nTissue collection and immunofluorescence\nOne week after behavioral testing, mice injected with FPI brain-derived tau oligomers (\nn\n=\u20097\u20139) were anesthetized with CO\n2\nand brains were collected. Brains from both FPI tau oligomer-treated mice and blast-injured rats were processed as follows for immunofluorescence (IF) analysis. Brains were embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound and sectioned using a cryostat. All sections were processed simultaneously under the same conditions. Sections (7\u2009\u03bcm) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. After blocking in bovine serum albumin for 1\u2009h, sections were incubated overnight with antitau oligomer-specific polyclonal antibody, T22 (1:250). The following day, sections were washed in PBS three times for 10\u2009min each and incubated with goat antirabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) Alexa Fluor-488 (1:500; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 1\u2009h. Sections were then washed three times for 10\u2009min each in PBS and either processed for cover-slipping or incubated overnight with total tau antibody, Tau-5 (1:100). Sections were washed in PBS three times for 10\u2009min each before incubation with donkey antimouse IgG Alexa Fluor-568 (1:500; Invitrogen). Sections were washed and mounted using Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL) mounting medium with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen). Sections were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal system (Carl Zeiss GmbH, Jena, Germany). Low-magnification images (20\u00d7) of the hippocampus and cerebellum were acquired for each sample. Three high-magnification images (100\u00d7) were taken at the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and cerebellum of each sample, and six cells were randomly selected from each image for quantification using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD). The total level of T22 fluorescence was measured for each cell, as well as the level of background from three different regions around the cell without fluorescence. In order to correct the level of fluorescence for background and cell size, the background multiplied by the area of the cell was subtracted from the total fluorescence, as described previously.\n36\nThe corrected cell fluorescence was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).\n\nCellular toxicity assay\nCell viability after treatment with ABS blast brain-derived tau oligomers was assessed using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) toxicity assay kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), as previously described.\n27\nSH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and grown to confluence in a 96-well plate. Cells (\u223c10,000 per well) were treated with fresh media alone or containing either 0.5-\u03bcM tau oligomers or 0.5-\u03bcM tau oligomers pre-treated with an equal concentration of tau oligomer-specific monoclonal antibody (TOMA). After incubation for 90\u2009min at 37\u00b0C, the cells were assayed using MTT colorimetric assay according to the manufacturer's directions. All measurements were made in triplicate. Results were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. Cells were also evaluated for morphological changes by microscopy."

    "Methods": "Study centers\nWe conducted focus groups at five geographically dispersed Level 1 pediatric trauma centers in the continental United States that treat 30\u201350 children with severe TBI annually and were affiliated with universities. We identified cases with TBI between June 2012 and May 2013. These facilities were approached for collaboration as part of the Pediatric Guideline Adherence and Outcomes (PEGASUS) study as sites represented in the Pediatric Neurocritical Care Research Group (\nwww.pncrg.org\n). These sites were the most likely to care for children with severe TBI in their region. Study sites were the University of Washington, Seattle, Washington (lead and data coordinating center); Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois; Harbor-University of California, Los Angeles Medical Center, Torrance, CA; and Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio. Two investigators (MSV and MJB) were on the committee that developed the Guidelines. The study was granted a designation of minimal risk (expedited review) and a waiver of written documentation of consent by the University of Washington. Each study site's human subjects' committee approved the protocol and the University of Washington coordinated all study efforts.\n\nParticipants\nPhysicians and nurses (e.g., providers) who provided acute treatment for severe pediatric TBI patients were purposively recruited at all sites. We framed the inclusion criteria in this way in order to recruit providers identified with a variety of subspecialties. At each of the participating sites, participants included providers in the intensive care unit and emergency department. Representation of the following subspecialties were included in the groups: emergency medicine, trauma, neurosurgery, critical care, pediatrics, and anesthesiology. Participation was voluntary, confidential, and uncompensated. Recruitment of additional focus groups continued until we reached saturation, when no new themes emerged.\n7\nSee\nTable 1\nfor details about the number of physician and nurse focus groups at each site.\nTable\n1.\nPhysician and Nurse Focus Groups by Site\nMD focus groups\nRN focus groups\nLurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Illinois\n2\n1\nNationwide Children's Hospital-Columbus, Ohio\n1\n1\nUniversity of Washington\n4\n6\nHarbor-University of California, Los Angeles\n1\n1\nChildren's Hospital of Pittsburg, Pennsylvania\n1\n1\nTotal\n9\n10\nOpen in a separate window\nMD, physician; RN, nurse.\n\nInterviews\nParticipants were given a copy of the 2012 Pediatric TBI Guidelines\n3\nfor reference prior to the discussion. Focus groups were facilitated by trained and experienced moderators. All PEGASUS investigators participated in the development of the discussion guide. The guide included open-ended questions aimed at eliciting perspectives on facilitators and barriers to successful adoption of the Guidelines, as well as organizational factors and local characteristics that impacted adherence to the Guidelines and potential solutions to problems identified.\nSeparate focus groups were held for physicians and nurses to minimize hierarchical conflicts and increase the reliability of the data.\n8\nNo identifying information was gathered. Interviews were facilitated in person on the respective hospital campus at the University of Washington or via video conferencing by the same two moderators. The average duration of each focus group was 32\u2009min (range, 18\u201349\u2009min). Focus groups were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Participants were assigned a number to substitute for the use of names, allowing differentiation in the transcript while preserving anonymity.\n\nAnalysis\nTwo investigators read and independently coded the transcribed interviews using NVivo 9.0 (QSR International Pty, Doncaster, Victoria, Australia) qualitative data analysis software to capture and organize thematic units. Patterns were identified in the data using content analysis.\n9\nBoth deductive and inductive content analysis were used, the former utilizing\na priori\nhypotheses based on theory, the latter to derive themes directly from the data for the creation of a codebook.\n10\nFocus groups were the unit of analysis. Codes were retained for the final codebook if they met a threshold number of references (at least 20) and distribution across focus groups (at least six groups), or were novel to severe pediatric TBI. Exceptional cases were incorporated to ensure the model was credible and comprehensive.\n11\nOn average, codes appeared in 12.5 of the 19 total focus groups. Investigators used the codebook and a selection of transcripts for context to iteratively sort codes and create categories under five\na priori\nand inductively determined domains: environment/institution, communication, staffing, guideline attributes, and individual factors.\n9\nUsing the\na priori\ndomains as scaffolding, we condensed and arranged redundant categories to explore potential mechanisms and relationships between them. Discrepancies were discussed among the team members through a series of in-person meetings until consensus was reached on the preliminary model. The preliminary model was compared again to the data and finalized with input from the larger research group. Data interpretation was enhanced by the presence of an expert interdisciplinary team.\n9\nModels of thematic domains are presented in\nFigure 1\nand illustrative quotes are presented in\nTable 2\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nTriangle of pediatric traumatic brain injury adherence.\nTable\n2.\nFactors Related to Pediatric TBI Guideline Adherence\nTheme\nIllustrative quotes\nGuideline credibility and applicability\nGuidelines' relevance to the patient and injury\n\u201cThey (the Guidelines) don't specifically say they're applicable to them or not\u2026some people might try to use the same criteria for placement of an ICP monitor in a non-accidental trauma patient whereas it might be totally different that the nature of the injury there, a big black brain, can be a different entity, plus they have open fontanels, it's a different patient population.\u201d [Physician]\nStrength of the evidence\n\u201cWe probably never [will] have class I evidence\u2026 we're going to have to use what we've got.\u201d [Physician]\nImplementation and dissemination at institution\nImplementation\n\u201cIt would be helpful if we decided as a group what guidelines to follow.\u201d [Nurse]\n\u201cLocal institutional discussion or at least acknowledgement of where the guidelines are going to fall in local practice practice\u2026one could say a local clinical pathway or protocol (is needed).\u201d [Physician]\n\u201cThe guidelines are posted at the bed side.

    "Methods": "Adult, male, Sprague-Dawley rats (\u223c300\u2009g;n=\u200915) that were on a standard rodent chow and 12/12-h dark-light cycle were used in this study (all methods were approved by the animal care committee of the University of British Columbia [Vancouver, BC, Canada]; protocol no.: A07-0379).\n\nSurgical preparation\nTwelve animals were designated to receive a cervical contusion injury whereas 3 were designated as controls, which received only preparatory surgery. All animals were anesthetized with isofluorane (4% during initiation and maintained at 2% administered by nose cone throughout the entire experiment), the dorsal neck shaved and disinfected, and were stabilized in a stereotaxic frame (model 900; David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA). Soft tissue surrounding the dorsal aspects of the cervical spine and tissues connecting the scapulae to the dorsal aspect of the thorax were resected in all animals for these terminal experiments, in order to make clearance room for the impactor apparatus that had to be placed on the cervical spine. Partial laminectomies over C5 and C6 were performed to create a \u223c3-mm-diameter opening to the dorsal surface of the spinal cord. A custom-made radiofrequency (RF) coil was then placed over the cervical spine, approximately centered at the C5/6 junction, with a thin wax film separating the RF coil from the tissue of the animal. Next, a set of custom clamps were attached to vertebrae C4\u2013C7 via the lateral notches of the vertebrae.\nInjury-designated animals were then removed from the stereotaxic frame and inserted into a custom-designed MR rig\n21\nby inserting the custom clamps into the designed mating interface. Sham animals were not inserted into the MR rig, but were maintained for the experiment duration on the stereotaxic frame. A heating pad (60490-000 Gaymar Mul-T-Pad; Harvard Apparatus, Harvard, MA), rectal thermometer, and respiratory cycle measurement transducer (1025 Small Animal Gating and Monitoring System; SA Instruments, Inc., Stonmy Brook, NY) were used to maintain body temperature of animals and monitor vital signals throughout the experiment.\n\nImaging methods\nWith the animal in the MR Rig, the rig was positioned inside the MR scanner's bore (7T, Bruker BioSpec, T\u00fcbingen, Germany) and a T2-weighted sagittal scan (115\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u2009\u03bcm in-plane resolution, 1-mm slice thickness, and 5-min acquisition time) was performed to ensure proper positioning and orientation. This was followed by a T2-weighted, high-resolution transverse scan (termed \u201cpre-injury\u201d; 140\u2009\u00d7\u2009140-\u03bcm in-plane resolution, 500-\u03bcm slice thickness, and 30-min acquisition time). Once the transverse scan was completed, the pneumatic actuator of the MR rig was activated from outside the MR scanner, producing a contusion injury of the spinal cord and maintaining the impactor tip in the position of maximal extension for the duration of the MRI scan.\n21\nDorsal contusion injuries induced in animals were initially designed to be imposed at the mid-line of the spinal cord and at two distinct magnitudes: a \u201clight\u201d injury (1.1\u2009mm of spinal cord compression) or a \u201csevere\u201d injury (1.8\u2009mm of spinal cord compression). Injury magnitude varied between 0.52 and 1.82\u2009mm and also varied in impact location between mid-line and lateral-right impacts (\nTable 1\n). Contusion injuries had an impact velocity of 1100\u2009mm/s (standard deviation [SD], 250), which was actuated pneumatically by the MR rig,\n21\nand were sustained for 35\u2009min.\nTable\n1.\nPeak Spinal Cord Compression and General Site of Impact for Each Animal\nAnimal ID\nPeak spinal cord compression (mm)\nImpact position\nIV 1\n1.41\nMid-line\nIV 2\n0.80\nLateral-right\nIV 3\n0.99\nLateral-right\nIV 4\n1.29\nLateral-right\nIV 5\n1.58\nLateral-right\nIV 6\n1.52\nMid-line\nIV 7\n1.70\nLateral-right\nIV 8\n1.82\nLateral-right\nIV 9\n1.13\nMid-line\nIV 10\n1.08\nLateral-right\nIV 11\n1.14\nLateral-right\nIV 12\n0.52\nMid-line\nOpen in a separate window\nThe contusion injury was sustained for 35\u2009min, while another sagittal scan was acquired of the deformed spinal cord and column in animals (115\u2009\u00d7\u2009150-\u03bcm in-plane resolution, 1-mm slice thickness, and 5-min acquisition time), followed by another high-resolution transverse scan (termed \u201cinjury\u201d; 140\u2009\u00d7\u2009140-\u03bcm in-plane resolution, 500-\u03bcm slice thickness, and 30-min acquisition time). After completion of the transverse imaging sequence, the rig was removed from the MR scanner. The contusion impactor tip was then retracted and the still deeply anesthetized animal was removed from the rig and immediately transferred to a fume hood for sacrifice by intracardial perfusion and harvesting of spinal cord tissue for histological analysis. Time required to transfer and begin perfusion of animals was approximately 5\u2009min.\n\nHistological preservation methods\nCustom clamps were removed from the spine before perfusion took place. Animals were perfused, intracardially, with 150\u2009mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by 300\u2009mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).\nAfter perfusion, the entire cervical spine was laminectomized, the dural sheath was cut from the base of the skull to the C8/T1 level, and dorsal and ventral roots of the cord were severed at the intervertebral foramina. The cord was then transected at the base of the skull and at the C8/T1 level, removed from the spine, and placed into a vial of 4% PFA overnight. Then, cords passed through a graded sucrose system (12%, 18%, and 24% sucrose, in PBS solution) spending \u223c24\u2009h in each grade. Cords were frozen in a block of embedding medium (Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Compound; Sakura Finetek USA Inc, Torrance, CA) and cut, transversely, into 20-\u03bcm sections and mounted on slides (Fisherbrand Superfrost Plus; Fisher Scientific, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). Slides were kept in a \u221286\u00b0C freezer (model no.: MDF-U71VC; SANYO Electric Biomedical Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan) until histological staining and analysis.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging post-processing\nPost-processing of MR images was described previously.\n22\nBriefly, in the pre-injury and injury image sets, the spinal cord was segmented from surrounding tissues. From the segmented images, the left and right ventral horns of GM were manually traced using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Ventral horns were identified as the region defined by the periphery of the ventral GM, ventrally and laterally, the inflection point between the dorsal and ventral GM, dorsally, and excluding the narrow \u201cbridge\u201d of GM (Rexed lamina X) across the central canal, medially (\nFig. 1\n). The corresponding rectilinear coordinates of the voxels within the ROIs were recorded (x, y, and z represented lateral, dorsoventral, and craniocaudal directions, respectively).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nLabeling ventral horns of gray matter. Left (\nA\n) and right (\nB\n) ventral horns were identified on the pre-injury transverse images of the spinal cord.\nSegmented images were used as inputs for a validated deformable registration algorithm\n22\nthat produced 3D displacement fields that mapped the pre-injury image to the injury image. These displacement fields were used to determine the transverse-plane Lagrangian finite strain magnitudes (i.e., e\nXX\n[lateral normal strain]; e\nYY\n[dorsoventral normal strain]; and e\nXY\n[transverse-plane shear strain]) for each image voxel (Paraview; Kitware Inc., Clifton Park, NY).\n23\nDerived strain values were used to calculate values of maximum and minimum principal strain fields (e\nmax\nand e\nmin\n, respectively;\nFig. 2\n), according to the following basic strain analysis equation (\nEquation 1\n):\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nStrain-type visualizations. Left: In the transverse plane, the three fundamental strain types are the normal strains in the \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019 directions (e\nXX\nand e\nYY\n, respectively) and the shear strains (e\nXY\nand e\nYX\n, where |e\nXY\n|\u2009=\u2009|e\nYX\n|). Right: By rotating the coordinate system by an angle, \u03b8, all strains can be represented by two normal strains, e\nmax\nand e\nmin\n, acting along the new \u20181\u2019 and \u20182\u2019 axes, respectively. These two normal strains, e\nmax\nand e\nmin\n, are referred to as principal strains.\nThe strain fields were used to determine a single average in each of the left and right ventral horns of GM (using the ROIs acquired during the segmentation process that identified 25\u201350 voxels per ventral horn) at the epicenter of injury (visually identified from the MR data), and at increments of 0.5\u2009mm cranially and caudally, up to 3\u2009mm from the injury epicenter. Strain value sampling and averaging was automated using a custom MATLAB routine (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA). The strain data were linearly interpolated from the epicenter and 0.5\u20133.0\u2009mm craniocaudal positions to determine strain values at the locations of the acquired histological data (i.e., 0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 2.0, and 3.0\u2009mm from injury epicenter both cranially and caudally).\n\nStrain field uncertainty analysis\nThe strain fields reported in this study were derived from displacement field data that have reported errors in the mediolateral, dorsoventral, and craniocaudal directions (i.e. \u2018X\u2019, \u2018Y\u2019, and \u2018Z\u2019, respectively). The bias (standard deviation; SD) for X-, Y-, and Z-directions are 0 (78), \u221224 (104), and 9\u2009\u03bcm (157\u2009\u03bcm), respectively. A Monte Carlo approach was used to evaluate the effect of the displacement field errors on the averaged strains observed in the ventral horns in one set of animal data (IV 1).\n24\nThis approach provided insight into the strain field changes that may arise as a result of the image registration-based displacement field errors. Displacement field error values were used to generate a probability distribution function (PDF) for each component of a 3D error vector. A simulation was designed to create random 3D error vectors for every point based on the generated PDFs. The error vectors were then summed with the registration-based displacement vectors at each point. Finally, the new data set (i.e., displacement field plus simulated error) was used to derive the average mechanical strains in the ventral horns of GM, as previously described. The simulation was performed 50 times and the mean and SD for the simulation set were reported for each strain type in the left ventral horn, at the craniocaudal distances of 0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 2.0, and 3.0\u2009mm from the injury epicenter. The Monte Carlo simulations provided a method to ensure that the observed, experimentally derived strain fields were not largely affected by the aforementioned displacement field errors. The results were compared with the original strain data.\n\nHistological analysis\nHistological analysis was carried out for injured spinal cords and sham spinal cords. A neuronal nuclei (NeuN) antibody was used to identify damage of GM neurons at the time of perfusion.\n25\nNeuN has been identified as transcription factor forkhead box protein 3 (Fox-3),\n26\nand disappearance of NeuN staining is widely viewed as a marker for neuronal death; but because NeuN staining is also transiently abolished in axotomized, yet surviving, motoneurons,\n27\nwe refer to it as neuronal damage. Tissue sections mounted on slides were first washed 3\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009min in 0.01\u2009M of PBS. Sections were blocked for 30\u2009min in normal donkey serum before being incubated for 3\u2009h at room temperature in primary antibody dilution (1:200 mouse anti-NeuN; Millipore, Temecula, CA) diluted in 0.01\u2009M of PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100. Sections were washed 3\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009min in 0.01\u2009M of PBS and incubated for 2\u2009h in the secondary antibody dilution (1:200 Alexa Fluor-594 donkey antimouse; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) in a light-opaque container. Sections were washed for 5\u2009min in 0.01\u2009M of PBS and mounted in Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL) to help prevent photobleaching and covered with glass coverslips (No. 1.5, VWR International, LLC, Radnor, PA).\nAll images were acquired using a Zeiss microscope (Axio Observer Z1; Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) with a 20\u00d7 objective (0.65\u2009\u00d7\u20090.65\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009\u03bcm per pixel) and equipped with a Yokogawa spinning disc confocal device (CSU-X1; Yokogawa Corporation of America, Sugar Land, TX) and a motorized scanning stage (MS-2000; Applied Scientific Instrumentation, Eugene, OR). Images at three depths (a range of 10\u2009\u03bcm) were acquired for each tissue section. Exposure settings for image capture were set manually through Zen software (Blue v1.0.1.0; Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany) for each section to ensure that adequate contrast between GM and WM was achieved and that nucleoli in NeuN-positive cells were discernible. The injury epicenter was defined as the section with the largest lesion area. Sections were imaged at 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 2.0 and 3.0\u2009mm both cranially and caudally around the injury epicenter.\nFor each transverse image (\nFig. 3A\n), an ROI was manually drawn around the left and right ventral horns (\nFig. 3B\n), according to the previously outlined protocol for identifying GM.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nSample histological data for NeuN-positive quantification. (\nA\n) Acquired images at 20\u00d7 magnification. (\nB\n) Manually identified regions of interest of ventral horns. (\nC\n) Sample NeuN-positive neurons with nucleoli presenting as a darkened center of the cell nucleus. NeuN, neuronal nuclei.\nWithin each ROI, any neurons presenting with an observable nucleolus were included in a total \u201cNeuN-positive\u201d count. A NeuN-positive cell was characterized by a bright red nucleus, with the nucleolus presenting as a darkened central region in the nucleus (\nFig. 3C\n). The area of each ROI (\u03bcm\n2\n) and the number of NeuN-positive cells were recorded. A measure of NeuN-positive-density (#/mm\n2\n) was determined by dividing the NeuN-positive count by the ROI area (\u03bcm\n2\n) and multiplying by 10\n6\n. NeuN-positive density data from both left and right horns of sham animals (\nn\n=\u20093) were averaged. Mean and SD were determined for each position, craniocaudally with respect to the injury epicenter, to represent noninjury thresholds.\n\nRegression analysis methods\nIn all regression analyses, e\nXY\nwas taken as the absolute value of the transverse-plane shear strain. Further, only positive values of e\nXX\n(i.e., lateral tension) were considered in the regression analyses because preliminary data analysis showed that ventral GM regions predominantly experienced tension, as opposed to compression, and a relationship between strain magnitude and tissue damage was sought after. For each animal, separate linear regression analyses (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05) were performed to determine the dependence of NeuN-positive density, in both ventral horns, on each of the calculated strain types (i.e., e\nXX\n, e\nYY\n, e\nXY\n, e\nmin\n, and e\nmax\n). The same regression analyses (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05) were also performed on data pooled together from all animals, and the strain type on which NeuN-positive density showed greatest dependence was identified.\nFor each animal, craniocaudal distribution of NeuN-positive density and the aforementioned strain type identified from the pooled-data analyses were plotted for left and right ventral horns, separately. The noninjury thresholds (mean and standard deviation) were included in each plot as well."

    "Methods": "Scaling injury mechanics\nThree dimensional (3D) FE models of rat and NHP spinal cords were constructed to simulate the response of the cervical spinal cord to unilateral contusion and to determine the impact protocol for NHPs that would generate a unilateral injury with similar magnitudes of functional and histological outcomes to established rat models.\n19\nMeasurements of spinal cord and column cross-sections of rats (male Long Evans rats,\nn\n=\u20095, 229\u2009\u00b1\u20094\u2009g and 84\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5 days) and NHPs (\nMacaca mulatta\n;\nn\n=\u20097; adult males) were obtained from magnetic resonance image (MRI) scans acquired at the cervical level for previous studies.\n40\n,\n41\nMeasurements were taken at several spinal levels and averaged over C1\u2013C6. The average rat and primate spinal cord cross-sections were then extruded (10\u2009mm in the rat and 20\u2009mm in the primate) to create 3D FE models (\nFig. 1\n) (ABAQUS/explicit version 6.10, Simulia Inc, Providence RI).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nMaterial distribution and spinal cord and column morphology in the (from left to right) rat 2\u2009mm impactor, primate 4\u2009mm impactor closed canal, primate 4\u2009mm impactor intervertebral foramen, primate 6\u2009mm impactor. The spinal cord parenchyma (green\u2013white matter, red\u2013gray matter) was modeled as a uniform material. The cerebrospinal fluid space (beige) was bounded by a dural membrane. The cord complex was surrounded by a rigid shell to represent the bounding effect of the boney spinal canal. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nThe FE models provided an opportunity to study and compare mechanistic differences in the total amount of CSF and extradural space protecting the cervical spinal cord between these two species. The spinal canal was modeled as a rigid body, providing resistance to support the spinal cord during the contusion impact. Although the spinal canal is not precisely rigid during\nin vivo\nimpact, the combined use of a stereotactic frame to fix the spinal posture and spinal clamps on the spinous processes immediately above and below the site of impact stabilize the column and limit bulk spinal motion.\nThe impactor was also modeled as a rigid body for computational efficiency. The impactor stiffness is several orders of magnitude greater than the tissue stiffness, resulting in negligible deformation in the impactor during these impacts. The spinal cord and CSF were modeled with 8-node linear brick, reduced integration elements with hourglass control.\nThe dura mater could not be easily identified in the MRI scans and has thickness ranging from 80\u2013300\u2009\u03bcm in humans\n42\n,\n43\nand was previously modeled as 200\u2009\u03bcm in rats.\n44\n,\n45\nTherefore, dura mater for the rat and NHP models was created by defining a surface around the CSF layer that was 200\u2009\u03bcm thick. The dura was modeled with a four-node doubly curved thin shell element with reduced integration, hourglass control, and finite membrane strains. The gray and white matters were modeled together, because individual characteristics for these materials at high strain rates have not been clearly established.\n34\n,\n35\nSpinal cord elements were tied to CSF elements, and these were then also tied to the dural shell elements to enforce displacement compatibility. The spinal cord was modeled as a cranial/caudal symmetrical structure at the injury epicenter to reduce computational costs. The symmetry condition also limited bulk motion of the spinal cord. Motion at the end of the spinal cord away from the injury epicenter was constrained in all directions to simulate the effect of cord tethering in the spinal canal. Contact between the dura and canal space was modeled as a hard, frictionless contact. Non-linear analysis was used to account for the large deformations in the tissues.\nThe same material characteristics were assigned to both the rat and primate models, because the limited literature for spinal cord material properties shows consistent properties across several species.\n46\nSimilar to previously developed and validated models of rat SCI, the spinal cord and dura were modeled with Ogden hyperelastic material models and Prony series viscoelastic expansions (\nTable 1\n).\n34\n,\n35\nThe CSF was modeled as a viscoelastic Mooney-Rivlin material with low shear modulus and moderate bulk modulus.\n34\n,\n47\nThis assumption was made based on a brain injury model that showed a viscoelastic material model for CSF did not significantly affect overall brain position calculations compared with a fluid model\n47\nand greatly reduced computational time.\nTable\n1.\nMaterial Property Assignments for the Rat and Primate Unilateral Cervical Spinal Cord Contusion Injury Finite Element Models\nMaterial\nHyperelastic law\nHyperelastic constants\nViscoelastic law\nViscoelastic constants\nSpinal\ncord\nOgden\n\u03bc\u2009=\u200932kPa\n\u03b1\u2009=\u20094.7\n\u03bd\u2009=\u20090.45\nProny\ng1\u2009=\u20090.528\nT1\u2009=\u20090.008\u2009s\ng2\u2009=\u20090.3018\nT2\u2009=\u20090.15\u2009s\nDura\nOgden\n\u03bc\u2009=\u20091205\u2009kPa\n\u03b1\u2009=\u200916.2\n\u03bd\u2009=\u20090.45\nProny\ng1\u2009=\u20090.318\nT1\u2009=\u20090.0009\u2009s\ng2\u2009=\u20090.1238\nT2\u2009=\u20090.081\u2009s\ng3\u2009=\u20090.0997\nT3\u2009=\u20090.564\u2009s\ng4\u2009=\u20090.0997\nT4\u2009=\u20094.69\u2009s\nCSF\nMooney-Rivlin\nC10\u2009=\u2009125Pa\nC01\u2009=\u2009125Pa\nv\u2009=\u20090.49999\nProny\ng1\u2009=\u20090.95\nT1\u2009=\u20090.002\u2009s\nOpen in a separate window\nCSF, cerebrospinal fluid.\nSpinal cord compression loading was simulated with flat-tipped impactors to match the impactor size and impact depth of established unilateral contusion injury models of rat cervical SCI and scaled to the NHP model using the anterior/posterior (a/p) diameter of the respective spinal cords. The 6\u2009mm impactor was determined by scaling the impactor size from the rat model (d\nrat\n=\u20092\u2009mm) using the a/p cord diameter; however, the rat spinal cord has a greater medial/lateral to a/p cord diameter ratio than the primate.\nPositioning a 6\u2009mm impactor to avoid contact with the lateral spinal canal to induce a unilateral spinal cord lesion in an NHP model resulted in the medial edge of the impactor crossing the midline and risked affecting the contralateral side of the cord. Therefore, a 4\u2009mm impactor was also evaluated to ensure impact effects could be confined to one side of the cord and thus result in a unilateral lesion.\nThe impact depth needed to create moderate to severe unilateral cervical contusion injuries in the rat ranged from 1.5\u2009mm\u20131.8\u2009mm.\n28\n,\n29\nScaling the contusion depth to the average (a/p) diameter of rat cervical dural sac (2.74\u2009mm), impacts ranged from 55\u201366% of total dural diameter. Scaling the range of compression to the average primate cervical dural sac a/p diameter (8.55\u2009mm) resulted in equivalent primate impacts of 4.68\u20135.62\u2009mm.\nTo fully explore the range of compressive responses in the NHP FE models, peak displacements of 3.8\u20136.3\u2009mm were simulated. The impact epicenter in the\nin vivo\ncontusion was positioned in the rostral/caudal direction relative to the lamina. Therefore, the location of injury relative to the intervertebral foramen was not clear. The variations in the cord constraint relative to the foramen were assessed using two different spinal cord cross sections (\nFig. 1\n).\nPeak forces derived from each impact injury were recorded from the reaction force in the reference node of the impactor. Impact forces in the rat simulations were validated with published experimental results to confirm the accuracy of the current model.\n28\n,\n29\nMaximum principal strains\n35\nand maximum principal stresses\n33\nwere compared between the rat and NHP models and were used to predict injury patterns in the NHP FE model simulations.\nThe impact depth and impactor size were selected for the NHP based on the FE model injury pattern predictions at the injury epicenter that best matched the rat contusion models without crossing to the contralateral cord. Bulk motion of the spinal cord in the canal space was also noted.\n\nDefining a baseline for impact\nExperimentally, a challenging aspect when attempting to generate a unilateral impact to the cord has been the ability of the cord to shift laterally (i.e., away from the direction of impact). This lateral motion is a result of the eccentric impact between the impactor tip and the spinal cord. The center of mass of the impactor is offset from the center of mass of the spinal cord, which results in the cord having a lateral component of motion as well as rotation. Because of this induced lateral motion and rotation, the large canal space and CSF layer around the primate spinal cord, which provide protection by dissipating the impact across the spinal cord,\n36\nalso enable substantial (2\u20133\u2009mm) lateral motion in a unilateral impact. To reduce lateral shift in the spinal cord during impact and to minimize the impact dissipation effect of the dura and CSF, the effect of \u201cpre-loading\u201d the spinal cord before impact was explored in the FE and surrogate cord models.\nA surrogate spinal cord complex was used to confirm the forces associated with dural surface contact, cord contact, and cord impingement against the canal. The transparent polyethylene tubing used for the surrogate dura mater allowed for visualization of the cord throughout the pre-loading protocol to clearly define the points of contact. The surrogate model of the NHP spinal cord, CSF, and dura was constructed following an approach defined for a surrogate cord model of the human spinal cord.\n37\nThe spinal cord was cast from two part silicone, (QM Skin 30, Quantum Silicones, Richmond, VA) and the dura mater was simulated by polyethylene lay flat tubing that was vacuum sealed at a length of 150\u2009mm and diameter of 12\u2009mm.\nThe unique features of this surrogate model were: (1) the use of a geometrically accurate primate spinal cord obtained from 3D reconstructions of MRIs acquired from the NHP spinal cord and rapid prototyping a mold for the spinal cord, and (2) sealing of the cord within a saline-filled polyethylene tubing to simulate a pressurized system without the complications of reservoirs and water columns. The surrogate spinal cord complex was supported in a Styrofoam block with a semicylindrical metal trough (6 inch stainless steel scoopula) embedded to simulate the boundary condition of the spinal canal (\nFig. 2\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nThe surrogate cord model undergoing unilateral contusion with the same impactor as the one used to generate\nin vivo\nprimate contusion injuries. The impact system could be set up on a test cart (\nA\n) or the surgical table. The impact system was driven by a Bose electromagnetic actuator (\nB\n) and could be positioned in three-dimensional space using screw-driven, linear bearing slides. The impactor could be move from the test table to attach to the stereotaxic frame using a single mounting post (\nC\n). To calibrate the impact mechanics, tune the controls of the Bose actuator and verify the behavior of the system before each surgery; the impact protocol was run using a surrogate spinal cord complex (\nD\n). The surrogate spinal cord is visible through the transparent dura (i.e., polyethylene lay flat tubing), making it possible to visualize contact between the dural surface and the cord. Note the local displacement of saline (i.e., cerebrospinal fluid) under the impactor's tip due to pre-loading. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nA Bose Electroforce Actuator system (Model 200N LM1, Bose Corporation) was used to apply the pre-loading protocol to the surrogate cord complex (\nFig. 2\n). Details of the impact system are outlined in the companion article\n39\n; briefly, the impactor system consists of an electromagnetic actuator capable of high precision motion (0.001\u2009mm) at high rates (up to 1\u2009m/sec) and records forces with a precision load cell (100\u2009N). The impactor tip can be positioned to submillimeter accuracy (0.01\u2009mm) in 3D space using manual linear bearing slides mounted with caliper scales. For surrogate cord testing, the system was mounted in a fixed collar attached to a test table. The same mounting collar was used to attach the system to the stereotactic frame for\nin vivo\nimpacts using a press fit with a securing pin for extra support.\nTo establish a baseline for impacts, slow mechanical indentations on the surrogate dural surface were used to define a \u201ctouch\u201d protocol that was indicative of the impactor tip making contact with the dorsal aspect of the dura. The surrogate spinal cord was then pre-loaded by slowly advancing the impactor to temporarily displace the CSF, essentially trapping the spinal cord against the bottom of the vertebral canal before impact. The peak pre-load force that corresponded to the trapped spinal cord was recorded to define the spatiotemporal baseline for the unilateral contusion injury.\n\nPost-impact analysis and iterative model refinement\nTo identify variations in\nin vivo\nimpact parameters, mechanical data from the primate impacts\n39\nwere analyzed to determine the stiffness of the spinal cord. Energy of impact was calculated as the area under the stiffness (force/deformation) curve for each injury. Force traces generated from surrogate and FE tests and the stiffness behavior were compared to the\nin vivo\nresults to determine the accuracy of the models.\nIn any impact or indentation protocol, the force reading from the load cell attached to the impactor tip is affected by the inertia of the mass of the impactor suspended under the load cell. Although the mass of the impactor is small, the acceleration can be high, and thus the inertial effects cannot be ignored. Inertia compensation is therefore required to determine the actual force applied to the spinal cord during injury. A combination of mass correction and air hit subtraction were used to determine the net force acting on the spinal cord during impact.\nTo ensure the initial impacts did not create severe injuries, the first two\nin vivo\nNHP impacts were conducted to generate mild injuries pre-load forces of 0.3\u2009N (approximately 3\u2009mm displacement) with peak impact displacement of 2\u2009mm from the pre-load position (total 5\u2009mm compression). These impacts, however, resulted in no noticeable functional deficits or histological damage\n39\nand low impact forces. In addition, concerns were raised about the lateral shift of the cord observed even with pre-load contact.\nFurther FE modeling and surrogate testing were conducted to determine the effect of impactor alignment on injury predictions. The position of the impactor tip was varied from having the medial edge of the impactor aligned with the cord midline to 0.5\u2009mm and 1.0\u2009mm to the contralateral side to refine the impact protocol for subsequent\nin vivo\nimpacts."

Contusion parameters were not significantly different among the different treatment groups. To perform the surgery, skin and muscles overlying the spinal column were incised and a laminectomy was performed at the thoracic level 10 (T10). Contusions were generated by releasing a weight (10\u2009g, rod diameter of 2\u2009mm) from a height of 12.5\u2009mm on the exposed dura of the spinal cord. Sham animals received only a laminectomy surgery. Post-surgery, muscle layers were sutured and the skin closed with wound clips. Bladders were expressed until voiding reflexes were reestablished. Cefazolin (25\u2009mg/kg, subcutaneously [s.c.]; Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, NY) and Buprenex\n\u00ae\n(buprenorphine; 0.05\u2009mg/kg, s.c.; Reckett and Colman Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Richmond, VA) were given to all rats for 5 and 3 consecutive days, respectively. Animals were allowed to survive for 1 week post-surgery.\n\nMetabolomics-based lipid analyses\nWe used standard unbiased metabolic profiling to detect and determine the spinal cord lipid levels, as previously described by our group\n4\n,\n8\n,\n15\nand others.\n7\n,\n36\u201339\nBriefly, animals were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Spinal cord samples (75\u2013100\u2009mg) were dissected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were immediately stored at \u221280\u00b0C and homogenized in water at the time of analyses. Protein was precipitated with methanol containing four standards to report on the extraction efficiency. The resulting supernatant was split into equal aliquots for analysis on the three platforms. Aliquots were subsequently dried under nitrogen and vacuum desiccated. The metabolomics profiling strategy used for this analysis was based on a combination of three independent platforms: ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS/MS\n2\n) optimized for basic species, UHPLC/MS/MS\n2\noptimized for acidic species, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Aliquots of a well-characterized human plasma pool served as technical replicates throughout the data set, extracted water samples served as process blanks, and a cocktail of standards added to every analyzed sample allowed for instrument performance monitoring. Experimental samples and controls were randomized across platform run days. Metabolites were identified by automated comparison of the ion features in the experimental samples and compared to a reference library of chemical standard entries that included retention time, molecular weight (m/z), preferred adducts, and fragments as well as associated MS spectra. The detected lipid features were curated by visual inspection for quality control using software developed at Metabolon\n\u00ae\n.\n40\n\nRNA extraction\nIntraperitoneal injections of pentobarbital (40\u201350\u2009mg/kg) were administered to induce euthanasia followed by transcardial perfusion with ice-cold 0.01\u2009M of PBS (pH 7.4; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Spinal cord segments compromising the lesion epicenter (5\u2009mm) were collected and total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 260\u2009nm on a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). We used 800 nanograms of the total RNA for the first-strand complimentary DNA (cDNA) synthesis.\nThe first-strand cDNA synthesis was primed using oligo (dT) based on the SuperScript II First-Strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The synthesized cDNA was used as a template for estimation of FABP5 transcription in spinal cord tissue by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). cDNA was amplified by PCR using a pair of primers specific for FABP5 (forward [FWD]: 5\u2032-TTA CCC TCG ACG GCA ACA A-3\u2032; reverse [RV]: 5\u2032-CCA TCA GCT GTG GTT TCA TCA-3\u2032); FABP3 (FWD: 5\u2032-AGG TGG CTA GCA TGA CCA AG-3\u2032; RV: 5\u2032-GTC ATC TGC TGT GAC CTC GT-3\u2032); and FABP7 (FWD: 5\u2032-TGT GAC CAA ACC AAC GGT GA-3\u2032; RV: 5\u2032-AGC TTG TCT CCA TCC AAC CG-3\u2032). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; FWD: 5\u2032-TGC CAC TCA GAA GAC TGT GG-3\u2032; RV: 5\u2032-TTC AGC TCT GGG ATG ACC TT-3\u2032), cyclophylin B (FWD: 5\u2032-CTG TCG ATT CCC TCA CAG GT-3\u2032; RV: 5\u2032-AAA ATC AGG CCT GTG GAA TG-3\u2032), and \u03b2-actin (FWD: 5\u2032- GGG AAA TCG TGC GTG ACA TT-3\u2032; RV: 5\u2032-GCG GCA GTG GCC ATC TC-3\u2032) served as internal controls for normalization. Real-time PCR amplification and analysis were carried out on a CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). SYBR green I (P/N 4309155; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was used as a fluorescent reporter dye for the presence of double-stranded DNA. PCR conditions were optimized and 25-\u03bcL reactions were prepared (SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, 10\u2009\u03bcM of forward/reverse primer, and 50\u2009ng of cDNA). A negative (mock) control reaction without reverse transcription was included in each experiment, and specificity of the FABP5 PCR product was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and melting curve analysis. A single melting curve peak was used to determine specificity for each additional target gene. Relative levels of FABP3, 5, and 7 messenger RNA (mRNA) were calculated using the comparative Ct (crossing threshold) as previously described.\n41\nEach sample was normalized to its GAPDH and/or \u03b2-actin mRNA content. Relative gene expression levels were normalized to sham animals receiving control diets.\n\nWestern blot\nThe spinal cord segment containing the lesion epicenter was dissected and protein extraction performed using adapted protocols from previously published reports.\n26\n,\n28\n,\n42\nBriefly, dissected tissue was homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50\u2009mM of Tris [pH 7.5], 150\u2009mM of NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 1\u2009mM of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) with a cocktail of inhibitors contained in complete minitablets (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). After being centrifuged at 20,000\ng\nfor 10\u2009min, the supernatant (cytosolic) fraction was extracted for analysis. The cytosolic protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad's DC Protein assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad Laboratories).\nForty micrograms of protein (40\u2009\u03bcg) were subjected to a 4\u201312% gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (conditions: 45\u2009min, 200\u2009V constant, at room temperature) and electroblotted using nitrocellulose membranes (conditions: 90\u2009min, 35\u2009V constant, at room temperature). All experiments were performed using NuPage Novex\n\u00ae\npre-cast gels and pre-mixed buffers and the XCell SureLock\u2122 Mini-Cell System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To verify transfer, the nitrocellulose membrane was stained with 0.1% Ponceaus S (in 0.1% glacial acetic acid) for 10\u2009min and then rinsed with 1X Tris-buffered saline (TBS) three times for 10\u2009min each. To reduce background staining, the nitrocellulose membrane was immersed in blocking solution (7.5% nonfat milk, in TBS; pH 7.5) for 2\u2009h at room temperature. The membrane was probed overnight at 4\u00b0C with the previously reported rabbit anti-FABP5 serum polyclonal antibody\n25\n(1:1000) diluted in blocking solution plus 0.1% Tween-20 (1X TBS). Negative control experiments were performed using rabbit pre-bleed serum at the same concentration used to immunodetect FABP5. After, the membrane was washed three times for 10\u2009min each in blocking solution and the secondary antibodies (IRDye 800CW-conjugated donkey antirabbit immunoglobulin G [IgG] and IRDye 680\u2013conjugated donkey antimouse IgG;\nboth\n1:1,000; LI-COR\n\u00ae\nBiosciences, Lincoln, NE) were applied to the membrane and incubated for 1\u2009h at room temperature. The membrane was washed five times with TBS and Tween 20 and once with TBS for 5\u2009min each. Membrane analysis was performed using the Odyssey\n\u00ae\nInfrared Imaging System (LI-COR\u00ae Biosciences). Relative levels of FABP5 protein were normalized to the amount of \u03b2-actin in each sample.\n\nHistology and neuroimaging\nTo prepare tissue for confocal immunofluorescence analyses, we followed previously published procedures.\n13\nBriefly, animals were submitted to fast and humane euthanasia with Fatal-Plus\u2122 (Vortech, Dearborn, MI) and perfused transcardially with PBS, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1\u2009M of phosphate buffer.\nSpinal cord segments containing the lesion epicenter were removed and post-fixed for 3\u20135\u2009h in 4% PFA, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose for 12\u201316\u2009h at 4\u00b0C, embedded in Tissue-Tek\n\u00ae\nO.C.T.\u2122 compound (Sakura, Torrance, CA), and immediately frozen on dry ice. A series of transverse 20-\u03bcm cryodissections were cut on a Richart-Jung Cryocut 1800 cryostat (Leica, Deerfield, IL) and placed on consecutive microscope slides (Superfrost Plus; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) so that each slide contained representative sections from rostral, epicenter, and caudal regions. Spinal cord sections were dried at room temperature for 10\u201315\u2009min, washed with PBS, and post-fixed with 4% PFA for 10\u2009min. Immunofluorescence double labeling has been described in previous work.\n15\nIn brief, a mixture of our custom rabbit polyclonal anti-rFABP5\n28\n(1:500) and mouse anti-NeuN (neuronal nuclei; 1:500; Millipore, Temecula, CA), anti-NFH (neurofilament heavy polypeptide; 1:500; Millipore, Temecula, CA), anti-GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein; 1:500; Millipore, Temecula, CA), anti-CC1 (allophycocyanin [APC]-7; 1:350; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), or anti-CD68 (1:400; AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC) antibodies were used to examine colocalization of FABP5 in neurons, axons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, or macrophages, respectively. Paired antibody solutions were applied to sections overnight at 4\u00b0C. On the following day, sections were incubated with Alexa Flour\n\u00ae\n488\u2013conjugated donkey antirabbit (1:250; Invitrogen) and Alexa Flour 594\u2013conjugated donkey antimouse (1:250; Invitrogen) antibodies. Primary antibody omission controls and pre-bleed serum controls were used to further confirm the specificity of the immunofluorescence double labeling. At least five sections per spinal cord were examined under confocal laser scanning microscope (FV1000, Olympus or LSM710; Carl Zeiss GmbH, Jena, Germany) or fluorescence microscope (BZ9000; Keyence Corporation, Osaka, Japan). Images were analyzed using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD) or BZ-II Analyzer and prepared for publication with Photoshop CS4 software (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA).\n\nBehavioral evaluation of spontaneous locomotion\nSpontaneous open-field locomotion was evaluated using the 22-point Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor scale.\n43\nAnimals were acclimatized to the open-field environment during several sessions before testing. Testing sessions were videotaped and evaluated as previously reported.\n8\n,\n13\nTwo blinded observers assessed the footage and scored the locomotive function (i.e., joint movement, paw placement and rotation, coordination, and tail and trunk position and stability). Briefly, scores range from 0 (flaccid paralysis) to 21 (normal gait). The rating scale involves hindlimb movement (scores range, 0\u20137) and weight support with/without coordination (scores range, 8\u201313), which is a major improvement in recovery. BBB scores higher than 13 are extremely rare at 1 week post-contusion. These scores represent constant forelimb-hindlimb coordination and the appearance of fine motor skills.\n\nDocosahexaenoic acid/albumin complex\nDHA was complexed to human serum albumin (BUMINATE 25%; Baxter, Deerfield, IL). Buminate is manufactured from human plasma by the modified Cohn-Oncley cold ethanol fractionation process, which includes a series of cold-ethanol precipitation, centrifugation, and/or filtration steps followed by pasteurization of the final product at 60\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u00b0C for 10\u201311\u2009h. This process accomplishes both purification of albumin and reduction of viruses. DHA was complexed to human albumin by incubating 20\u2009mL of human serum albumin (25%; Baxter) with 4.0\u2009mg of DHA/g of albumin (molar ratio, 0.2) in a shaking incubator at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min with vortex mixing every 5\u2009min. A previous report showed that this formulation leads to 2.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\u2009\u03bcmol DHA/mL of albumin.\n44\n\nSmall interfering RNA preparation and dosing\nFABP5 siRNA stock solutions (100\u2009\u03bcM) were prepared in RNAse-free reconstitution buffer and stored in aliquots at \u221280\u00b0C. In these experiments, we used a siRNA pool mixture (Smart pool siRNA; pool no.: M-120235-00; Dharmacon Inc.; Chicago, IL). The siSTABLE-modified nontargeting double-stranded RNA were used as controls (no. D-001700-01-20; Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). The siGLO\n\u00ae\ngreen fluorescent oligonucleotides were used as transfection indicators, thus permitting unambiguous visual assessment of uptake into cells. Positive control experiments were performed codelivering siGLO and/or functional cyclophilin B siRNA (ON-TARGETplus\u2122 control siRNA, 1:1 ratio; 50\u2009nM each; Dharmacon). FABP5 siRNA dose-response titration was accomplished using varying doses of oligonucleotides (ranging from 0.5 to 2\u2009\u03bcg). These were delivered locally into the spinal cord of na\u00efve and injured rats by intraspinal injections or intrathecal catheters attached to an osmotic minipump. To facilitate delivery and uptake, siRNA aliquots were mixed (1:5, v/v) with the cationic lipid based transfection reagent i-Fect\u2122 (Neuromics, Edina, MN).\n\nInjections\nA group of animals were placed in a Digital Lab Standard\u2122 stereotaxic frame (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL) and received intraspinal injections containing the FABP5 siRNA. Injections were performed in anesthetized rats using the stereotaxic spinal adapter and clamping system. The custom-made glass micropipette (external diameter\u2009=\u200925\u201335\u2009\u03bcm; Clunbury Scientific, LLC; Bloomfield Hills, MI) was filled with the oligos and iFect (Neuromics) transfection reagent and attached to a Hamilton\n\u00ae\nsyringe connected to a micromanipulator. The tip of the micropipette was lowered into the spinal cord and intraspinal injections were made bilaterally according to the following stereotaxic coordinates (from midline medial-lateral [ML] to dorsal-ventral [DV]; 0.25\u2009\u03bcL per injection): 1) 0.7\u2009mm ML, \u22121.5\u2009mm DV; 2) 0.7\u2009mm ML, \u22121.3\u2009mm DV; 3) 0.7\u2009mm ML, \u22120.9\u2009mm DV; and 4) 0.7\u2009mm ML, \u22120.6\u2009mm DV. siRNA dose and volume selected was based on previous works.\n41\n,\n45\n,\n46\nAfter each injection, siRNA was allowed to disperse over a 2-min period and the micropipette slowly withdrawn. After suturing muscle and skin layers, animals were allowed to recover in heating pads and then returned to the animal care facility. Rats were sacrificed 72\u2009h after the injections and the total RNA was collected from spinal cords.\n\nMinipumps\nIn another set of experiments, animals received a second narrow laminectomy between the T11 and T12 level to expose the spinal cord, as previously reported.\n41\nThe dura was carefully punctured with a 27- to 32-gauge needle, raised with fine forceps, and cut with scissors avoiding damage to the spinal cord. A small s.c. pocket was made over the sacral vertebrae caudal to the incision, and a primed Alzet\n\u00ae\nosmotic minipump (model 2001D; 1-\u03bcL infusion per hour over 7 days; DURECT Corp., Cupertino, CA) was placed in the pocket with the pump flow moderator facing the incision. Pumps were primed with DHA-albumin complex (DHA), FABP5 siRNA, and vehicle controls. Control pumps were filled with the scramble nontargeting oligos or ethanol vehicle. Animals did not show any noticeable signs of hypersensitivity or distress during the infusion period. The intrathecal catheter, consisting of sterile 28-G polyurethane tubing (Alzet\n\u00ae\n; P/N 000740-1), was inserted through the punctured dura and placed in the lesion epicenter. Tubing was attached to the fascia over the paravertebral muscles at the incision margin, secured with Krazy Glue (Elmer's Products Inc., Columbus, OH) onto the proximal portion of the T13\u2013T14, and reinforced with sutures. Muscle and skin layers were closed after the surgery. The surgeon lacked knowledge of the experimental groups.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM), and statistical analysis was performed by repeated measures and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Bonferroni's multiple comparison post-hoc test was used to compare differences among samples. All other data were assessed by Mann-Whitney's\nU\ntest, unless stated otherwise. MetaboAnalyst (\nwww.metaboanalyst.ca\n)\n47\n, and the \u2018R\u2019 program (\nhttp://cran.r-project.org/\n) were used to analyze the metabolomics data sets. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was used to generate heat maps. Partial least squares discriminant analyses (PLS-DA) were obtained using the variation scores of the first two principal components. The point marks in the plot represent the variability in relative lipid metabolite levels detected for each animal. Hotelling's T\n2\nconfidence ellipse, at a significance level of 0.05, revealed no outliers following autoscaling. Differences were consider to be significant when\np\n<\u20090.05."

Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (300\u2013325\u2009g; Charles River, Saint Constant, Quebec, Canada) were assigned to either TBI surgery or control treatment groups. Animals in the experimental group were anesthetized and administered a fluid percussion injury.\nPrimary injury was induced by a direct contusion to the brain delivered to the left cerebral hemisphere by a pendulum impacting a fluid-filled chamber connected to the intact dura through a craniotomy as described previously.\n29\n,\n30\nA fluid percussion injury was induced to a target pressure of <70 pounds per square inch (psi) over a 500\u2009msec period; the pressure was transduced and measured in each surgery. This level allows >90% recovery, defined as ability to maintain upright posture, ambulate, and take oral hydration, and produces a highly reproducible outcome of moderate brain injury severity in those surviving animals. These experimental animals have measurable deficits in sensorimotor coordination,\n30\nalong with significant cardiovascular\n30\nand cerebrovascular\n29\neffects.\n29\n,\n30\nControl animals were subjected to scalp incisions but without the percussion injury. At 24\u2009h after recovery from surgery, animals were euthanized and tissues were collected for experiments.\n\nDiameter measurement in pressurized vessels\nImmediately after euthanasia, a midline laparotomy was performed and the mesentery was dissected out and placed into cold (4\u00b0C) physiological saline solution (PSS) with the following composition: 118.5\u2009mM NaCl, 4.7\u2009mM KCl, 24\u2009mM NaHCO\n3\n, 1.18\u2009mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 2.5\u2009mM CaCl\n2\n, 1.2\u2009mM MgCl\n2\n, and 11\u2009mM glucose (pH 7.4). The mesenteric vessels were then pinned out in a silicone-lined (Sylgard 184; Dow Corning, MI) dissecting dish and washed with cold PSS aerated with a 20% O\n2\n/5% CO\n2\ngas mixture.\nFourth- and fifth-order mesenteric arteries were dissected free from the surrounding adipose and connective tissue. For each experiment, an individual mesenteric artery was cannulated in a pressure myograph (Living Systems Instrumentation, VT) containing cold PSS. The proximal end of the artery was tied to the end of a borosilicate micropipette (OD 1.2\u2009mm; tip diameter 40\u201360\u2009\u03bcm) using nylon sutures. Any blood or debris remaining in the lumen was removed by flushing the artery with 1\u20132\u2009mL of cold (4\u00b0C) PSS. The distal end of the artery was then tied to an opposing micropipette in the same manner. The pressure myograph was placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (AE31; Motif, Canada) and continuously superfused (7\u2009mL/min) with oxygenated 20% O\n2\n/5% CO\n2\nPSS at 37\u00b0C. Temperature was maintained using a circulating heater bath and a water-jacketed glass heat exchanger. Intraluminal pressure during the experiment was controlled by connecting the proximal end of the pressure myograph to a pressure servo system (Living Systems Instrumentation), and blood vessel diameters were measured using edge-detection software (IonOptix, MA).\n\nAssessment of myogenic tone\nAfter cannulating, intraluminal pressure was slowly increased to 80\u2009mm Hg and the vessel was stretched axially to remove any buckling and to mimic physiological stretch. Vessels were allowed to equilibrate and develop spontaneous pressure-induced constriction (myogenic tone). Vessels that leaked, contained branches, or failed to develop myogenic tone were discarded. For endothelial removal, arteries were cannulated on a system in which the proximal cannula and perfusion tubing were pre-filled with 1\u20132\u2009mL of air using a syringe attached to the Luer-Lok inflow port. The vessel was then tied to the proximal cannula only. The pre-loaded air bolus was flushed through using a syringe filled with cold (4\u00b0C) PSS that had been equilibrated with a 20% O\n2\n/5% CO\n2\ngas mixture.\nAfter denuding the endothelium, the vessel was flushed with distilled water and PSS, and subsequently tied to the distal cannula. The effectiveness of endothelium removal was confirmed by the absence of a response to the SK\nCa\nand IK\nCa\nchannel agonist NS309 (1\u2009\u03bcM).\n31\nEndothelium denudation was considered successful if NS309 caused \u226415% dilation of the passive diameter. Myogenic tone at 80\u2009mm Hg was defined as the percentage decrease in the lumen diameter of arteries compared with the passive diameter, calculated as tone (%)\u2009=\u2009[(D\npassive\n\u2212D\nactive\n)/D\npassive\n] \u00d7 100, where D\npassive\nis the (passive) lumen diameter of the artery in Ca\n2+\n\u2010free PSS containing the Ca\n2+\nchannel-blocking vasodilator diltiazem (100\u2009\u03bcM), and D\nactive\nis the (active) lumen diameter of the artery in Ca\n2+\n\u2010containing PSS.\n\nAssessment of endothelial-dependent vasodilation\nEndothelial function was assessed by determining the response of pressurized vessels to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator ACh. Concentration\u2013response relationships were determined in mesenteric arteries from control and TBI rats that spontaneously developed myogenic tone by measuring responses to semilogarithmic increases in the concentrations of ACh (1\u2009nM to 1\u2009\u03bcM). The relative roles of EDH and NO in mesenteric arteries after TBI were tested by incubating arteries with the competitive NOS inhibitor N\u03c9-nitro-\nl\n-arginine (\nl\n-NNA; 100\u2009\u03bcM) for 30\u2009min before and during agonist treatment.\nFor some experiments, arteries were incubated with\nl\n-sepiapterin (1\u2009\u03bcM), the arginase inhibitor N\u03c9-hydroxy-nor-arginine (nor-NOHA; 20\u2009\u03bcM) or the NOS and arginase substrate,\nl\n-arginine (100\u2009\u03bcM), for 30\u2009min, followed by addition of increasing concentrations of ACh (1\u2009nM to 1\u03bcM) in the presence of\nl\n-sepiapterin, nor-NOHA or\nl\n-arginine. The percent vasodilation was defined as the agonist-induced dilation (peak or maximal response to ACh) normalized to the difference between passive and myogenic diameter, calculated as ([D\nagonist\n\u2212D\nbaseline\n]/[DP\u2212D\nbaseline\n]) \u00d7100, where D\nbaseline\nis the lumen diameter before the addition of agonist at a specific concentration.\n\nDetection of NO level\nNO levels in mesenteric arteries were measured by fluorescence microscopy as described previously using DAF-2 DA,\n29\n,\n32\na nonfluorescent compound that yields the highly fluorescent DAF\u20102T on reacting with NO.\n33\nArteries were surgically opened and pinned down to the surface of a custom Sylgard-coated microscope dish with the endothelial surface oriented upward (\nen face\npreparation). Arteries were pre-loaded in the dark with DAF\u20102 DA (5\u2009\u03bcM) in the presence of pluronic acid (0.05%) dissolved in aerated PSS. DAF-2 DA-loaded arteries were allowed to de-esterify for 15\u2009min before imaging. NO levels were determined in vascular smooth muscle superfused with PSS under basal conditions (unstimulated) and with ACh stimulation (10\u2009\u03bcM) at 37\u00b0C. Images were acquired at 30 frames/sec using an Andor Technology Nipkow spinning\u2010disc confocal system coupled to a Nikon Eclipse E600 FN upright microscope equipped with a 60\u00d7 water\u2010dipping objective (numerical aperture 1.0) and an electron\u2010multiplying charge\u2010coupled device camera, as we have described previously.\n29\n,\n34\nDAF-2T fluorescence was detected using an excitation wavelength of 488\u2009nm, and emitted fluorescence was collected using a 527\u2013549\u2010nm band\u2010pass filter. Fluorescence in collected images was assessed offline by measuring the average fluorescence of 10 images from the same field using custom\u2010designed software (A. Bonev, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT).\n34\nThe area of each VSMC surface was determined by drawing a freehand region of interest (ROI) around the outline of the individual cell. Total DAF\u20102T fluorescence was measured over the entire area of each cell, and an average value per cell was calculated for a given field (>10 cells). DAF\u20102T fluorescence was expressed as the percentage change from control baseline levels.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nMesenteric arteries were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1\u2009h and then cryoprotected overnight in 0.1\u2009M PBS (pH 7.2) containing 3% sucrose. Cross-sections of arteries were embedded in optimal cutting temperature (O.C.T.) compound, cut into 10-\u03bcm-thick slices, and mounted on poly-\nl\n-lysine\u2013coated glass slides (Sigma-Aldrich, MO). Sections were pre-incubated with PBS containing 1.6% hydrogen peroxide for 5\u2009min and then washed with PBS containing 0.2% Tween-20. Endogenous biotin or avidin binding sites were blocked by sequential incubation for 10\u2009min with avidin and biotin peroxidase complex (ABC kit; Vector Laboratories, CA). After rinsing, arteries were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20\u2009min, washed with PBS, and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies against arginase-1 (Genetex, CA) or arginase-2 (Santa Cruz Biotech, TX) diluted 1:200 and 1:100, respectively, in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA).\nAfter washing again with PBS, slide-mounted artery sections were incubated with a biotin-labeled secondary antibody for 30\u2009min. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by incubating with the peroxidase substrate 3,3-diaminobenzine. Negative controls were incubated with secondary antibody only (primary antibody replaced with PBS). Images were acquired at 100x magnification.\n\nArginase activity assay\nArginase enzymatic activity was measured in mesenteric artery homogenates obtained from control and TBI rats using a colorimetric assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Arginase activity was quantified by spectrophotometric measurement of urea produced by arginase from\nl\n-arginine.\n\nDetection of O\n2\n-\nproduction in mesenteric arteries\nDihydroethidium (DHE) was used to identify O\n2\n-\nproduction\nin situ.\n32\nMesenteric arteries from control and TBI rats were isolated as described above and incubated with DHE (2\u2009\u03bcM) in the dark in a custom humidifying box at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min, rinsed three times with PSS for 10\u2009min each, and then fixed in paraformaldehyde (4%) for 1\u2009h. Arteries were cryoprotected overnight in 3% sucrose and then embedded in O.C.T. mounting media. Mesenteric arteries were cut into cross-sections (10\u2009\u03bcm thick) using a cryostat, and then immunostained for eNOS (1:2,000; BD Biosciences, CA) used as an endothelial marker. A 4\u2032-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining (1:500; Thermo Scientific) was performed for nuclear acid (nuclei) staining (excitation/emission: 350/470\u2009nm). Images were acquired at 60x magnification using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM510 META) to visualize the fluorescence (excitation/emission: 518/605\u2009nm for DHE-labeled slices). Fluorescence intensity was quantified by ImageJ software.\n\nOxidation-reduction production (ORP) measurements\nRedox balance (integrated measure of the balance between total oxidants and reductants) was evaluated in plasma samples obtained from control and TBI rats by measuring the oxidation-reduction potential, or total oxidizing capacity.\n35\nWhole blood was collected at the time of euthanasia into an evacuated tube containing sodium citrate. Whole blood was immediately centrifuged (2,000\u2009rpm; 4\u00b0C), and plasma samples were collected, aliquoted, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Thawed samples (30\u2009\u03bcL) were tested using the RedoxSYS diagnostic platform, consisting of a micro Pt/AgCl combination redox electrode sensor and benchtop analyzer (Aytu Bioscience, Inc., CO).\n36\n,\n37\nValues were recorded in millivolts (mV) after ORP readings were stable for 10\u2009sec. The diagnostic platform was calibrated before use and validated with hydrogen peroxide (30\u2009\u03bcM) as a positive control.\n\nStatistics\nGraphPad Prism software (version 6.03; GraphPad Software, CA) was used for analysis; values are presented as means \u00b1 standard error of the mean. Agonist concentration-response curves were calculated by fitting the Hill slope from the data (variable slope model) for each individual experiment, and summary data are presented for intergroup comparisons together with representative tracings. The Mann-Whitney nonparametric test was used for comparisons between two experimental groups. Two-way analysis of variance was used for comparisons of multiple group measurements at different concentrations. The \u03b1-value used was 0.05, and statistical significance was reported as\np\nvalues. In a few experimental series, a single control group was used to test multiple hypotheses. To avoid increasing the likelihood of a Type I error, we used the Bonferroni correction to test each individual hypothesis at a significance level determined by \u03b1\u2009=\u20091/m, where m is the number of comparisons."

    "Methods": "Animals\nThree-month-old C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were group housed under standard conditions, with food and water available\nad libitum\nand a 12-h light-dark cycle (lights on at 6:00\nam\n). Subsequent to blast exposure, all mice were individually housed. Studies were approved by the University of South Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and carried out in accord with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\nAir cannon blast\nAir cannon blast was performed on mice anesthetized with a cocktail of ketamine (100\u2009mg/kg), xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg), and acepromazine (2\u2009mg/kg) with imipramine (2.3\u2009mg/kg) administered as a prophylactic analgesic. A 70-liter Martin Hurricane industrial air cannon (Martin Engineering, Neponset, IL) was mounted to a sturdy steel base and charged with compressed air using a Craftsman air compressor to a pressure of 17.5 pounds per square inch (PSI), as measured using the cannon-mounted pressure gauge. A mechanical solenoid discharged 80% of the compressed air over 100\u2009ms through the smaller aperture of the driven chamber, producing an effective surge measuring 50 PSI, which delivered a blast velocity of approximately 22\u2009m/s (50\u2009mph). Mice were secured to a holding device 1.0\u2009m from the solenoid in a prone position with lead wrapped around the body to protect against thoracic injury (see\nFig. 1A\nfor cannon schematic). The holding device was a piece of 1-inch (in) flat steel bent into a U-shape so that it could be attached to the tube by four steel bolts. Extending from the center of the fixture were two 3\u20448;-in threaded steel rods 150\u2009mm in length, spaced 25\u2009mm apart, that were secured to the 1-in flat steel with steel nuts on both sides. A miniature digital gyroscope was mounted on the mouse head to measure head angular acceleration and displacement, triaxially, in response to the air blast. Gyroscopes measured 18\u2009\u00d7\u200914\u2009mm with a mass of 4\u2009g.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nAir cannon blast dynamics. (\nA\n) Schematic depicting air cannon blast system. Animals were placed at the end of the cylinder facing the mechanical solenoid with the body wrapped in a lead jacket, and compressed air was delivered through the solenoid into the driven chamber. P1\u2013P3 indicate locations of pressure sensors along the chambers. (\nB\n) Pressure measurements are given for a representative blast generated by the air cannon. Pressure sensors 1, 2, and 3 (P1, P2, and P3) were mounted perpendicular to the blast to measure static pressure. P1 was located in the driven chamber adjacent to the solenoid, thereby recording the start time of the blast; P2 was located halfway along the driven chamber, 0.5\u2009m from P1; P3 was located at the end of the driven chamber, 0.5\u2009m from P2 and 1.0\u2009m from P1. P4 was oriented normal to the blast and was mounted to the mouse fixture such that dynamic pressure was recorded at the location of the mouse head. (\nC\n) Angular head acceleration in response to the blast was measured using a miniature digital triaxial gyroscope mounted to the mouse head. Ang, angular; Accel, acceleration; PSI, pounds per square inch. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nSham mice were anesthetized and placed outside the area of the blast while the air cannon was triggered to control for aural damage. After the blast, mice were behaviorally tested beginning either 1 (acute post-exposure [APE] mice) or 6.5 weeks (sub-acute post-exposure (SPE) mice) later in order to perform histology at 2 or 8 weeks post-injury, respectively. Behavioral testing for APE mice occurred in the following order: rotarod test; Y maze; and radial arm water maze (RAWM). SPE mice were left alone for 6.5 weeks before behavioral testing, which was run in the order of rotarod, Y maze, and Morris water maze (MWM).\n\nRotarod test\nMotor function and motor learning were assessed using an accelerating rotarod test, as previously described.\n23\nThe rotating bar gradually accelerated from 4 to 40\u2009rpm over 5\u2009min. Mice were placed on the bar, and latency to fall was recorded by a blind observer. Each specimen performed 4 trials per day over 2 consecutive days.\n\nY maze\nSpontaneous alternation, a measure of working memory, was investigated in the Y maze as previously described.\n24\nMice were placed at the center of a three-arm maze, which they were allowed to explore for 8\u2009min. The sequence of arm entries was manually recorded by an observer blind to treatment. Alternation is defined as a triad of arm entries without re-entry into a previously visited arm. Percent spontaneous alternation was calculated as the number of correct triads divided by the maximum possible alternations (total arm entries minus 2)\u2009\u00d7\u2009100.\n\nRadial arm water maze\nThe RAWM was adapted from previous studies.\n25\n,\n26\nBriefly, a circular black tank with a six-arm metal insert was filled with water and a platform was submerged 1\u2009cm below the surface of the water at the end of a designated goal arm. Animals were permitted 60\u2009sec to locate the platform and given 15\u2009sec on the platform before being dried and returned to the home cage to await the next trial. Mice were trained over 2 days with 15 trials per day, which were divided into 5 sessions of 3 trials each. An observer blind to treatment manually scored the number of errors, which were defined as an entry into an incorrect arm. A working memory error was defined as re-entry into an already visited incorrect arm within the same trial.\n\nMorris water maze\nThe MWM was conducted in a black tank with an escape platform placed 1\u2009cm below the surface of the water in the center of one of the four quadrants (target quadrant).\n23\nDuring acquisition testing, mice were permitted 60\u2009sec to locate the platform, after which time they were gently guided to the platform by the experimenter. Mice were given 15\u2009sec on the platform before removal into a heated holding cage. Four trials per day with a 60-sec intertrial interval were conducted until the sham control group reached a criterion mean latency of <15\u2009sec. The probe trial was conducted 24\u2009h later by removing the platform and allowing the animal to swim for 60\u2009sec. The percent time spent in each quadrant was used as a measure of probe trial performance. All trials were recorded by a video camera and analyzed using ANY-maze software (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nFree floating immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously.\n27\nMice were euthanized either 2 or 8 weeks post-blast by overdose of Somnasol (Henry Schein, Dublin, OH) and transcardially perfused with physiological saline. Brains were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24\u2009h. After sucrose gradient cryopreservation, brains were sectioned coronally at 25\u2009\u03bcM on a sliding microtome. Sections were then incubated in a 10% methanol/3% hydrogen peroxide solution to block endogenous peroxidases. After phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) washes, sections were permeabilized by 0.2% Triton X-100 with 1.83% lysine and 4% goat serum for 30\u2009min before overnight incubation with one of the following antibodies: anti-pS199/202 tau (1:20,000; Anaspec, Fremont, CA); anti-pT231 tau (1:300; Anaspec; 1:300); or anti-Iba1 (ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1; 1:3000; Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA). Sections were then incubated in biotinylated goat antirabbit secondary antibodies before more washes and ABC amplification (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). Last, sections were incubated in 0.05% 3,3\u2019-diaminobenzidine with 0.5% nickel sulfate and developed with 0.03% hydrogen peroxide. Sections were slide mounted, dehydrated in alcohol gradients, and cover-slipped before imaging.\nA slide scanning microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) was used to image all tissue before analysis with Neuroquant IAE software (Zeiss). Six sections per mouse were used for each antibody stain. Regions of interest were outlined and a segmentation analysis was performed to evaluate the area ratio of positive cells within each region by an experimenter blinded to conditions. Area ratio was then averaged for all six sections per mouse.\n\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical significance for each analysis was determined with Student's\nt\n-tests or two-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni's post-tests to compare groups, where appropriate. All figures and statistics were generated using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA); each graph represents the mean \u00b1 the standard error of the mean (SEM)."

    "Methods": "Animal care\nMice (C57/BL6) were housed with a 12\u2009h/12\u2009h light/dark cycle and had free access to food and water\nad libitum\naccording to the principles outlined in\nGuidelines for Care and Use of Experimental Animals.\nThey were used in experiments at an age of 8\u201310 weeks. All procedures were approved by the research institution's IACUC.\n\nControlled cortical impact traumatic brain injury\nMale mice at 8\u201310 weeks old were subjected to moderate controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury or sham treatment, as we previously described,\n4\n,\n39\nwith the following exceptions: the amount of deformation was set at 1.0\u2009mm and the piston velocity was controlled at 3.0\u2009m/sec. These modifications resulted in a moderate level of injury using an electromagnetic model (Impact One TM Stereotaxic Impactor for CCI; Leica Microsystem). Briefly, the mice were anesthetized with avertin and placed in a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA) prior to TBI. Using sterile procedures, the skin was retracted and a 4\u2009mm craniotomy centered between the lambda and bregma sutures was performed. A point was identified midway between the lambda and bregma sutures and midway between the central suture and the temporalis muscle laterally. The skullcap was carefully removed without disruption of the underlying dura. Prior to the injury, the impacting piston was angled so that the impacting tip (3\u2009mm in diameter) was perpendicular to the exposed cortical surface. Then, the mice received the impact. Sham (non-injured) animals received the craniotomy, but no CCI injury.\n\nDHF treatment\nBoth TBI mice (total 15) and sham-injury mice (total 15) were randomized into three groups (\nn\n=\u20095 each group), and then were administered DHF (5mg/kg), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. The DHF was dissolved in 17% DMSO, so the DMSO group was used as vehicle control. The injection was given 1\u2009h after CCI surgery, and then given daily for the next 2 weeks following surgery.\n\nPulse-labeling of the proliferating cells following TBI\nThe mice subjected to moderate TBI or sham surgery received DHF, DMSO, or PBS treatments as described above (\nn\n=\u20095, each group). Four hours before perfusion, mice received one injection of 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 100\u2009mg/kg in saline, i.p.; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) to pulse-label the proliferating cells. The animals were then deeply anesthetized and perfused transcardially with saline, followed by a cold fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS.\n\nBrdU injection to label the birthday of immature neurons in the adult hippocampus following TBI\nFor labeling the newly-generated immature neurons, mice (\nn\n=\u20093 for sham mice and\nn\n=\u20093 for the TBI group) received one injection of BrdU (100\u2009mg/kg in saline, i.p.) within 1\u2009h after TBI surgery. These mice were sacrificed 2 weeks after TBI surgery. The BrdU labeled immature neurons with doublecortin (DCX) staining were selected for the dendrite quantification with 3-D imaging reconstruction.\n\nTissue processing\nAfter perfusion, the brains were removed, post-fixed overnight in PFA, and cryoprotected for 48\u2009h in 30% sucrose. Serial 30-\u03bcm thick coronal sections were cut using a cryostat (Leica CM 1950), and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. The sections were then processed for immunohistochemical analysis.\n\nImmunochemistry\nFree-floating sections were washed three times in PBS, and then the sections were incubated in blocking solution (0.1% Triton X-100, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 5% normal goat serum in PBS) for 2\u2009h at 4\u00b0C, followed by 48\u2009h incubation with primary antibody at 4\u00b0C. After 48\u2009h, the sections were washed again with PBS (three times), and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 2\u2009h with the secondary antibody. After treatment (10\u2009min) with 4\u2032, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, the sections were washed with PBS (three times), and attached to the slide. Finally, the dried slide was mounted using Fluorescent Mount G. For the BrdU staining, sections were pretreated with 2N HCl for 1\u2009h at room temperature, and then soaked in 0.1\u2009M borate buffer for 10\u2009min (pH 8.4). After washing with PBS (three times), sections were ready for immunostaining. Primary antibodies and their final concentrations were as follows: anti-BrdU (1:400, rat, Accurate Chemical and Scientific), anti-DCX (1:1000, guinea pig; Millipore). Secondary antibodies and their final concentrations were as follows: goat anti rat, Alex 488, 1:800 (Invitrogen); goat anti guinea pig, Cy3, 1:800 (Jackson Laboratory).\n\nCell counting\nImmunohistochemistry was performed simultaneously on sections to detect the target cells. For DCX-positive cell quantification, three sections at the epicenter were selected and images of dentate gyrus were taken. Every DCX-positive cell was counted with quantification results expressed as average cells/mm\n2\n(\nn\n=\u20095).The experimenter was blinded to the treatment conditions.\nFor quantification of BrdU cells, series of every sixth section (30\u2009\u03bcm thickness, 180\u2009\u03bcm apart) through each hippocampus were processed. Every single BrdU positive cell (even the partial BrdU-positive nuclei at the borders of sections) in the dentate gyrus throughout the entire 30\u2009\u03bcm sections was counted under a fluorescent microscope using the 40\u00d7 objective through a whole series of sections (\nn\n=\u20095).The experimenter was blinded to the treatment conditions.\n\nDendrite quantification\nDCX-stained sections were then used for dendrite morphology analysis; 40\u00d7 images containing whole neurons and dendrite branches were taken. For neurons evaluated, all branches of the dendritic tree were reconstructed at 40\u00d7 magnification using a motorized microscope (Zeiss Imager M2) with Neurolucida software (Microbrightfield, VT). A three-dimensional analysis of the reconstructed neurons was performed using NeuroExplorer software (Microbrightfield). More than 20 neurons were studied for each of the five animals in the six treatment groups. Several aspects of dendritic morphology were examined. To assess overall changes, total length of dendrite trees, average length of dendrite branches, and number of dendrite branches were compared across groups using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The complexity of dendrite trees was assessed using Scholl analysis. The number of intersections of dendrites was calculated with concentric spheres positioned at radial intervals of 20\u2009\u03bcm.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe collected data were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error.

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll procedures were approved by the University of British Columbia (UBC) Committee on Animal Care in accordance with the\nGuide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals\nby the Canadian Council on Animal Care.\n20\nThirty 16-day-old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were purchased within the university. Male rats were chosen because of the male preponderance for SCI clinically.\n1\nThe animals were acclimated to our facility at 22\u00b0C and indoor humidity (30\u201350%) on a reverse light cycle (12\u2009h/12\u2009h) with standard chow and filtered water\nad libitum\nand handled in the first 5 days. An additional five 340\u2009g male SD rats were used as uninjured controls for the histological analysis (i.e., weight-matched to injured rats).\n\nBehavior\nThe animals were trained to perform several behavioral tasks for the next 17 days. The Martinez locomotor rating scale was used to assess the forelimb and hindlimb locomotor functions after cervical SCI based on movements of forelimb and hindlimb articulations, weight support of the limbs, digit position, stepping, forelimb-hindlimb coordination, and tail position in an open-field arena.\n21\nThe forelimb locomotor assessment scale (FLAS) was used to assess forelimb dysfunction based on predominance of the joints, digit position, paw placement, forelimb activity, four-limb coordination, and balance during alley crossing.\n22\nThe grooming test was used to assess forelimb grooming function based on the ability of the animals to contact the paw with any part of the face or head after water was applied to their head and back.\n23\nThe grip strength test measured the maximum grip strength when the animals grasped a metal bar with each forelimb and was steadily pulled away until the grip was broken.\n24\nThe Montoya staircase was used to assess skilled forelimb reaching and grasping by measuring the number of pellets taken and pellets eaten over a 15\u2009min period with the animal contained within a staircase box with left and right stairs filled with color-coded food pellets.\n25\nThe ladder rung walking test was used to assess skilled walking by measuring forelimb and hindlimb placing, stepping, and interlimb coordination, when the animals walked along a horizontal ladder with unevenly spaced rungs.\n26\nThe CatWalk Gait Analysis (Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, The Netherlands) was used to perform an automated quantitative gait analysis during walkway crossing.\n27\nEach task was performed at the same time of day during the dark cycle with at least 4\u2009h of rest between the tasks. The Martinez locomotor rating scale and the FLAS were performed on the same day. In the Martinez locomotor rating scale, the scoring spreadsheet, originally for unilateral injury, was expanded to evaluate bilateral injury. In the FLAS, nonfunctional, partially functional, and normal digit positions would earn a score of 0, 1, and 2 (i.e., instead of 1, 2, and 3) respectively, and nonplantar paw placement would earn no score (i.e., instead of 1), so that the scaling system was adjusted from 4\u201364 to 0\u201360. The grip strength and the ladder rung walking test were always the last task of the day. The Montoya staircase was always the only task of the day, and in preparation for this test, the animals were fasted for 14\u2009h before the task to motivate them. The food pellets in the top two stairs were neglected in the analysis, because the animals could reach these pellets with the tongue.\n28\nThe animals accomplished five trials of the Montoya staircase and four trials of each of the other tasks at the end of the training period. Baseline assessment was performed in the following 4 days. Puffed wheat and nutrition shake were provided to the animals in the next 3 days of rest before surgery and also after surgery.\n\nSurgery/injury production\nThe animals were 46 days old and 282\u2009\u00b1\u200917\u2009g at the time of surgery. They were anesthetized with inhalational isoflurane. Their backs were shaved and disinfected. Analgesics pre-medication of 2% lidocaine (subcutaneous [SC]) 0.5\u2009mL into the area of skin incision) and buprenorphine (0.05\u2009mg/kg in 0.5\u2009mL, SC) were given to the animals and Ringer lactate (10\u2009mL, SC) was also injected to prevent dehydration. Lacrilube ophthalmic ointment was applied to their eyes to prevent the eyes from drying.\nThe animals were kept on a heating pad between 36\u201337\u00b0C to avoid hypothermia during surgery. Animal temperature, heart rate, and blood oxygenation were monitored throughout surgery.\nA cervical SCI was induced because of the preponderance of cervical injuries in clinical SCI.\n1\n,\n2\nThe animals' spinal columns from C2 to C7 were exposed dorsally by incision and splitting the muscles along the midline. Moderate contusion (\nn\n=\u20098), dislocation (\nn\n=\u200911), and distraction (\nn\n=\u200911) injuries were produced between C5 and C6 (\nFig. 1\n) using our UBC multimechanism SCI apparatus as described previously.\n6\n,\n19\n,\n29\nFor contusion, the spinal cord between C5 and C6 was exposed by laminectomy. Custom vertebral clamps held the spinal column rigidly at the transverse processes on a stereotaxic surgical frame. An electromagnetic linear actuator applied a small pre-load to the surface of the dura mater (0.03\u2009N) with a custom 2-mm\u2013diameter tip. The injury was produced by retracting the actuator 6\u2009mm above the dura mater and accelerating it into the spinal cord to a maximum displacement of 1.6\u2009mm (\nFig. 1b\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSchematic diagrams of the three spinal cord injury (SCI) mechanisms. The spinal column orientation for (\na\n) the normal animal and (\nb\u2013d\n) the three SCI mechanisms is shown. To produce contusion injury, external displacement was applied to the dorsal spinal cord between C5 and C6 by an actuator with a 2-mm\u2013diameter tip after laminectomy. To produce dislocation injury, external displacement was applied to the transverse processes at C6 and C7 dorsal to C5 by the actuator with vertebral clamps after facetectomy. To produce distraction injury, external displacement was applied to the transverse processes at C6 and C7 caudal to C5 by the actuator with the vertebral clamps after facetectomy.\nFor dislocation and distraction, the animals' posterior ligaments between C5 and C6 were transected, and a C5/6 facetectomy was performed. Custom vertebral clamps were used to securely hold the transverse processes at C4-C5 on the stereotaxic frame and at C6-C7 on the actuator, respectively. The actuator then acutely translated C6-C7 relative to C4-C5, either dorsally by 1.8\u2009mm (to simulate anteroposterior dislocation), or caudally by 5.6\u2009mm (to simulate distraction) (\nFig. 1c, 1d\n). An initial pre-load of 2\u2009N was applied to the spinal column for both the dislocation and distraction injury mechanisms.\nThe peak displacements were intended to produce a moderate SCI, based on preliminary testing under the same ethics protocol. To maintain some consistency in the severity of injury across different mechanism groups, the peak velocity for all injuries was intended to be approximately 1\u2009m/sec. This velocity was deemed to be clinically relevant, based on previous work in our laboratory and that of others.\n30\u201332\nMost of the surgical procedures and tools have been described in more detail in our acute studies.\n6\n,\n19\n,\n29\nSince the dislocation and distraction injuries ruptured the C5/6 intervertebral discs, a custom fixation device was applied to the C5 and C6 vertebrae to provide mechanical rigidity to the spinal column after inducing the SCI.\n33\nPost-injury, the musculature and skin of each animal was sutured, and the animal was placed in an incubator (37\u00b0C) until regaining consciousness. Two doses of buprenorphine (0.05\u2009mg/kg, SC) and Ringer lactate (10\u2009mL, SC) were given to each animal daily, and it was caged individually with oats bedding for the first 2 days post-injury. Ringer lactate was still injected twice a day to animals that exhibited a tendency toward dehydration. The animals were hand-fed and their bladders were manually expressed when needed. Two contusion-, five dislocation-, and five distraction-injured animals reached the humane end-point within 1 week post-injury because of severe weight loss, porphyrin, respiratory distress, and/or paleness. The remainder of the animals (\nn\n=\u20096 in each injury) performed the behavioral tasks over the next 8 weeks post-injury.\n\nHistology\nThe animals weighed an average of 340\u2009\u00b1\u200938\u2009g at 8 weeks post-injury, immediately before perfusion. These animals and the controls were euthanized by an overdose of 5% chloral hydrate (intraperitoneal injection). They were perfused with fixative solution (4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline), and the spinal cords were harvested and post-fixed overnight in fixative solution. After several changes of sucrose (12%, 18%, and 24%) every 24\u2009h, the spinal cords were frozen in optimal cutting temperature compound. They were cut every 0.02\u2009mm in the cross-sectional plane and divided equally into 10 sets of sections.\nOne set of spinal cord sections was stained with Luxol fast blue (LFB). One set was blocked with normal donkey serum (1:10, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and triple stained with primary antibodies against neurofilament H (NF) (rabbit host, 1:1000, AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC), neuronal class III \u03b2-tubulin (Tub) (rabbit host,1:1000, Covance, Princeton, NJ), and myelin basic protein (MBP) (mouse host, 1:20, Millipore, Billerica, MA) in combination with secondary antibodies conjugated with DyLight 594 (donkey host, rabbit antigen, 1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and DyLight 488 (donkey host, mouse antigen, 1:400, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories).\nOne set was blocked with the same normal donkey serum and then stained with primary antibodies against NeuN (mouse host, 1:200, Millipore) in combination with secondary antibodies conjugated with DyLight 594 (donkey host, mouse antigen, 1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and green fluorescent Nissl (Fluoro Nissl) (1:200, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Each set of sections was stained at the same time and under the same conditions to avoid procedural variation. Standard staining procedures were followed as described previously.\n34\n,\n35\nThe LFB-stained sections were examined under a light microscope (Axioplan 2, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) (5x, NA 0.15) while the NF/Tub/MBP-stained sections and the NeuN/Fluoro Nissl-stained sections were examined under a fluorescence microscope (Axio Observer Z1 inverted confocal, Carl Zeiss) (myelinated axons: Plan-Apochromat 63x, NA 1.4, dorsal horn cells: Plan-Apochromat 20x, NA 0.8, ventral horn cells: Plan-Apochromat 10x, NA 0.45). Brightness and contrast were kept constant for all images within each set of sections.\nThe cross-sectional area of spared tissue (blue-labeled pixels that were darker than the background, representing myelin), the density of myelinated axons (NF/Tub/MBP staining), and the number of surviving cells (NeuN/Fluoro Nissl staining) were measured in the regions of interest (ROIs) in these sections (\nFig. 2\n). In addition, the cross-sectional area of spinal cords, including the anterior median fissure and central canal, was outlined and measured from the LFB-stained sections. The central lesion cavity in the LFB-stained sections was also outlined to calculate the volume and rostrocaudal extent of the lesion. Sections at certain distances from the epicenter were selected from each set of spinal cords for analysis (see\nFig. 5\n,\n\u200b\n,6,\n6\n,\n\u200b\n,9\n9\nfor the specific locations).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nHistological regions of interest. (\na\n) To measure area of spared tissue in Luxol fast blue (LFB)-stained sections, the dorsal, lateral, and ventral white matter and the gray matter were segmented. The lateral white matter was separated from the dorsal and ventral white matter by drawing straight lines along the lateral sides of the dorsal and ventral horns. (\nb\n) To calculate density of myelinated axons in neurofilament H/\u03b2-tubulin/myelin basic protein-stained sections, several boxes (65\u2009\u03bcm \u00d7 65\u2009\u03bcm) were placed. One box was positioned in the center of the gracile fasciculus. Another box was positioned in the middle right of the dorsal corticospinal tract. A third box was positioned in the right cuneate fasciculus 50\u2009\u03bcm away from the gracile fasciculus and the dorsal corticospinal tract. A fourth box (100\u2009\u03bcm \u00d7 100\u2009\u03bcm) was positioned in the right lateral white matter next to the dorsal horn. One box (100\u2009\u03bcm wide) was positioned in the right ventral white matter medial from the ventral nerve root. The size and position of the boxes could be adjusted to avoid large artifacts and horizontal axons. (\nc\n) To count the number of surviving cells in NeuN/Fluoro Nissl-stained sections, images were taken in the right dorsal horn (20x) and the right ventral horn (10x) with their sides aligned with the edges of the horns.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 5.\nThe density of myelinated axons for the different spinal cord injury mechanisms. All data are presented as median with quartiles and offset horizontally for clarity. The position along the spinal cord extends from \u22125\u2009mm (rostral) through +5\u2009mm (caudal) from the epicenter (0\u2009mm). All statistical differences reported are\np\n<\u20090.05.

Representative confocal micrographs of the regions of interest used in the quantitative analysis of white matter damage immunostained for neurofilament H/\u03b2-tubulin for axons (in red) and myelin basic protein for myelin/myelin debris in green. The normal control tracts show a dense packing of small myelinated axons in the gracile fasciculus (GF) and even smaller ones in the dorsal CST. These intact fibers display the typical green myelin rings surrounding a red axon in the middle. Contusion and (somewhat less so) dislocation injuries destroy both tracts from the epicenter distally, leaving in the wake of Wallerian degeneration myelin debris (green dots) and a few large axons (displaced or sprouted). Distal is rostral in the ascending GF and caudal in the descending CST. The damage proximal to the epicenter is indicative of some dieback in both tracts. The damage after distraction is less focal in the GF showing a gradual thinning of this ascending tract from caudal to rostral and appearance of a few larger profiles in the rostral segments that are likely displaced axons from the cuneate fascile (entering the spinal cord rostral to injury). The CST shows a loss of the typical small myelinated axons at all levels with some partial preservation rostrally. The apparent preservation of the CST in the caudal segments is from displaced/sprouted larger sensory axons. Scale bar 20\u2009\u03bcm. MBP, myelin basic protein.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 9.\nMicrographs of surviving cells in the (\na\n) dorsal horn and (\nb\n) ventral horn. Representative micrographs of the regions of interest used in the quantitative analysis of neurons immunostained for NeuN/Fluoro Nissl. Contusion and even more pronounced dislocation lead to a loss of dorsal horn neurons as well as dorsal horn tissue around the lesion epicenter, which is partially occupied by cavity in this location. This loss of neurons in the dorsal horn is far less pronounced after distraction injury. In the ventral horn, the loss of large neurons is most pronounced after contusion and dislocation at the epicenter and more widespread after dislocation injury, and some cavitation is still visible 1\u2009mm caudal to injury here. The number of large ventral horn neurons after distraction is somewhat more variable and in some animals nil rostal to the presumed epicenter. Scale bars 100\u2009\u03bcm for dorsal horn and 200\u2009\u03bcm for ventral horn images.\n\nData processing and statistical analysis\nHistological analysis (i.e., outlining/segmenting areas, placing ROIs, and counting myelinated axons and cells) and behavioral analysis (i.e., assigning scores and labels) were performed in Photoshop (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA), Zen (Zeiss), Picture Motion Browser (Sony, Tokyo, Japan), and CatWalk (Noldus Information Technology). All analyses were conducted by observers blinded to the SCI mechanism. Calculations were performed in Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) and MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (IBM, Chicago, IL).\nData were not normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk test,\np\n>\u20090.05), thus necessitating nonparametric statistical methods to be used. Given that our main research question was on the differences between injury mechanisms, we used the one-way nonparametric analysis of variance (ANOVA) Kruskal-Wallis test at locations along the spinal cord for the histopathologic data and at times post-injury for the behavioral data. We followed each ANOVA with the Mann-Whitney\nU\ntest (two-tailed,\np\n<\u20090.05), where appropriate.\nFunctional improvement across post-injury time points was analyzed using the Friedman test (\np\n<\u20090.05). Given that this approach yielded many statistical comparisons, we have listed those in the Figure legends rather than in the text. To facilitate reading of the results, statements of \u201cless, lower, smaller, did not improve or more, higher, greater, improved\u201d indicate that the difference was statistically significant (\np\n<\u20090.05).\nThe existence of linear relationships between the histological and behavioral outcomes was assessed by Pearson correlation analysis (\np\n<\u20090.05). For these analyses, the number of myelinated axons (area of spared tissue \u00d7 density of myelinated axons) in the dorsal, lateral, and ventral white matter between 5\u2009mm rostral and caudal, the number of dorsal neurons between 1\u2009mm rostral and 0.6\u2009mm caudal, and the number of ventral motoneurons between 2.2\u2009mm rostral and 1.6\u2009mm caudal were averaged and used as histological outcome measures. These ranges were used because this is where histological differences existed across the three SCI mechanisms with respect to the epicenter."

    "Methods": "Spinal cord injury\nFemale Sprague-Dawley rats (\nn\n=\u200910 total; Harlan Labs, Indianapolis, IN) weighing approximately 230\u2009g were housed in the Biomedical and Biological Sciences Research Building animal facility at the University of Kentucky, and allowed\nad libitum\naccess to food and water. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, University of Kentucky, and performed according to National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines. Animals were randomly assigned into two experimental groups prior to surgery in a manner such that on any given day, the experimenters were blinded to the experimental groups, which were equally numbered per injury cohort. Rats were anesthetized with ketamine (80\u2009mg/kg; Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg, Lloyd Laboratories, Shenandoah, IA). A dorsal laminectomy of the 12th thoracic vertebra was performed to expose the 1st and 2nd lumbar spinal levels as described previously,\n20\nafter which animals were subjected to a moderate (150\u2009kDyn) or a severe (250\u2009kDyn) spinal cord contusion injury using the Infinite Horizon impactor device (PSI, Lexington, KY).\n21\nImmediately following injury, the wounds were irrigated with saline, the muscle layers were sutured together with 3-0 Vicryl (Ethicon, Inc., Somerville, NJ), and the skin closed together with surgical wound clips (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL). Hydrogen peroxide and betadine were used to clean the surgical site and animals were injected subcutaneously with 10\u2009mL pre-warmed lactated Ringer's solution (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL), Cefazolin (33.3\u2009mg/kg; WG Critical Care, LLC, Paramus, NJ), and yohimbine (3.2\u2009mg/kg; Lloyd Laboratorie) before being returned to their cages on a heating pad maintained at 37\u00b0C. Once rats regained consciousness, buprenorphine hydrochloride (0.03\u2009mg/kg; Reckitt-Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc., Richmond, VA) was administered subcutaneously every 8\u2009h for 72\u2009h. Animals continued receiving cefazolin every 12\u2009h through 5 days post-injury (DPI).\n\nBehavioral assessment\nThe Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan Locomotor Rating Scale (BBB LRS)\n22\nwas used to assess hind limb locomotor function of all rats. After pre-injury assessments, testing began at 2 DPI and continued weekly at 7 DPI through 28 DPI by individuals blinded to injury severity.\nAdditionally, at 28 DPI, all rats underwent gait analysis by recording from underneath using a high speed camera (Basler scA640; Basler AG, Highland, IL) while walking linearly across a transparent Plexiglas walkway. Step cycles were analyzed by demarcating when each foot was in contact with the Plexiglas frame by frame in order to determine the Regularity Index (RI), the Coordinated Pattern Index (CPI), and the Plantar Stepping Index (PSI), as we have described previously.\n23\n\nMRI acquisition\nBefore and weekly after SCI, all rats underwent multi-parametric MRI scans in a 7T Clinscan MRI animal scanner (Bruker Biospin, Billerica, MA). Rats were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane and placed in the supine position on a heated bed with a constant \u223c2% isoflurane flow. A temperature probe and respiratory gating module were placed in order to monitor physiology throughout the scan. The L1/L2 spinal region was centered over a rat brain receiver coil with a 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 array prior to inserting the bed into the scanner body. First, a localizer in the three orthogonal planes was used to verify the L1/L2 spinal level and determine slice positioning for subsequent scans. Next, a relaxometry multi-spin echo (MSE) sequence was run to acquire 14 slices over 9.8\u2009mm spinal cord centered on the injury epicenter (field of view [FOV], 19\u2009mm \u00d719\u2009mm \u00d70.7\u2009mm; matrix, 192\u2009\u00d7\u2009192\u2009\u00d7\u200914 zero filled to 384\u2009\u00d7\u2009384\u2009\u00d7\u200914) at multiple echo times in order to generate maps of proton density (PD) and T2 relaxation times (repetition time [TR]\u2009=\u20092000\u2009msec; echo time [TE]\u2009=\u200923.1, 30.8, 38.5,\u2009\u2026, 115.5, 123.2; number of sample averages\u2009=\u20095; total scan time, \u223c32\u2009min). An echo-planar imaging DTI sequence was then acquired twice with two sets of six slices for a total of 12 slices spanning 9.6\u2009mm centered on the injury epicenter (FOV, 17\u2009mm \u00d723\u2009mm \u00d70.8\u2009mm; matrix, 96\u2009\u00d7\u2009128\u2009\u00d7\u20096 zero filled to 192\u2009\u00d7\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u20096) from which the FA images were derived (TR\u2009=\u20091700\u2009msec; TE\u2009=\u200932\u2009msec; b\u2009=\u20090, 800; number of b\n0\nscans\u2009=\u200910; number of diffusion encoded scans\u2009=\u200996; number of sample averages\u2009=\u20094; total scan time\u2009=\u2009\u223c24\u2009min [12\u2009min \u00d72]). The same acquisitions were completed prior to injury and at 7 DPI, 14 DPI, 21 DPI, and 28 DPI.\n\nMRI analysis\nAll MRI post-processing, unless otherwise stated, was completed using the FSL FMRIB Software Library v5.0 (Analysis Group; FMRIB, Oxford, UK).\n24\nPD and T2 maps were generated from multi-spin echo (MSE) acquisitions by fitting the intensity for each voxel over time to the T2 decay curve\nusing the Analysis of Functional NeuroImages MRI analysis suite (National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD), where\nI\nt\nis the intensity at time\nt\n,\nI\n0\nis the initial intensity (or the PD),\nt\nis the time in milliseconds, and\nT2\nis the T2 relaxation time for the given subvolume. These reconstructed maps were utilized in place of single PD-weighted or T2-weighted images in order to nullify the effects of variable signal intensity at different distances from the coil. The spinal cord was then demarcated from the T2 map by manually overlaying a user generated mask (\nFig. 1\n). Masks were generated using PD images as a reference, due to their enhanced morphometric clarity. For each cord, the mean and standard deviation of the T2 parameter throughout the entire cord (including the injury) was calculated and a threshold applied such that any voxel with a value greater than 3 standard deviations (SD) above the cord mean was considered T2 hyper-intense, where the total volume of T2 hyper-intense voxels within a subject represents the T2 lesion volume. The T2 maps demonstrated negligible T2 hypo-intensities; therefore, they were excluded from quantification of T2 lesion volume. A threshold of 3 SD was chosen by experimentation, as it yielded the greatest noise reduction without additionally excluding appropriately T2 hyper-intense regions. When 2 SD was applied, it resulted in increased noise that could have classified healthy tissue as T2 hyper-intense. On the other hand, 5 SD resulted in virtually no T2 hyper-intensities. The same was done for hypo-intense regions with low T2-relaxation times; however, there was negligible detection with this method.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nFractional anisotropy (FA;\nA\nand\nB\n) and complementary proton density (PD;\nC\nand\nD\n) images for a single rat captured pre-injury (A, C) and at 28 days post-injury (B,D) at the same L1/L2 spinal level, with associated spinal masks (blue). The spinal cord masks (blue) are applied after image acquisition to specifically analyze only spinal tissue and not surrounding tissues. Lighter color for FA is indicative of more anisotropic flow, whereas brighter color in the PD is indicative of higher proton concentration. Scale bars\u2009=\u2009500\u2009\u03bcm. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nFinally, inclusion or exclusion of the injury site (epicenter) for this threshold determination did not affect determination of T2 lesion volumes, as any arbitrary threshold value chosen was effectively either too low so as to include noise or too high so as to exclude clearly pathological tissue. The generated masks also were used to calculate cord volume on a slice-by-slice basis in order to assess spinal cord atrophy over time. FA maps were generated in-line on the Clinscan using the Syngo MR Software suite (Syngo MR B17; Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany). The captured spinal cord slice images were then extracted using a manually generated mask (\nFig. 1\n) and the average cross-sectional FA was determined for each slice, as well as averaged for the entire spinal cord.\n\nHistology\nFollowing 28 DPI behavioral assessments and MRI, animals were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1\u2009M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). To maintain consistent sampling, each spinal cord from the L1/L2 injury cohorts was transected at the rostral T11 spinal root and a 30-mm spinal cord segment was immediately dissected and post-fixed for 2\u20134\u2009h in 4% PFA/PBS at 4\u00b0C. This was followed by overnight washing with 0.1\u2009M PBS at 4\u00b0C before cryo-protecting in 20% sucrose/PBS at 4\u00b0C and embedding tissues as we have described.\n25\nFrozen spinal cords were then serially cryo-sectioned at 20\u2009\u03bcm and subjected to eriochrome cyanine staining to differentiate white matter and gray matter.\n25\n,\n26\nThe lesion volume and volume of spared tissues were calculated using a modified Cavalieri method from a series of seven evenly-spaced sections (1\u2009mm apart) centered at the injury epicenter in order to represent the length of spinal cord used for MRI analysis (a series of nine evenly-spaced slices, 0.8\u2009mm apart, 7.2\u2009mm total centered on injury site). As we have detailed previously, for each 20\u2009\u03bcm spinal cord cross-section, the area of lesion, spared gray matter, and spared white matter were quantified, and the respective sub-volumes within the assessed cords were determined by summation, in addition to quantifying tissue sparing at the injury epicenter.\n20\n,\n25\nAs we have reported, spared tissue was identified by positive staining of myelin in white matter and the cyto-architecture of gray matter representative in na\u00efve animals, whereas lesions were identified as regions lacking normal characteristic traits.\n27\nAll morphometric quantifications were completed using a Nikon microscope (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and Scion imaging analysis software (Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD).\n\nStatistical analysis\nLong-term BBB LRS was analyzed using a repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Holm-Sidak\npost hoc\nanalysis when warranted, while histological and gate assessments were analyzed by one-tailed unpaired t-tests using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). FA throughout the rostro-caudal spinal cord were analyzed relative to time, spinal level, and injury severity using repeated measures ANOVA with one between subject factor (injury) and two within subject factors (time and spinal level) with Fisher's LSD\npost hoc\nanalysis in the SAS software suite (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). For all data analysis, significance was set at\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Patients\nSixteen patients with acute TBI were prospectively enrolled in the Co-Operative Studies on Brain Injury Depolarizations (COSBID) at Virginia Commonwealth University. Inclusion criteria were the clinical decision for neurological surgery for lesion evacuation and/or decompression and age \u226518 years. Patients with fixed, dilated pupils were excluded. Research protocols were approved by institutional review boards, surrogate informed consent was obtained for all patients, and research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Data from patient 12 have been reported previously.\n35\n\nProcedures\nFor electrocorticographical monitoring of SD, a single electrode strip was placed on the surface of the brain in the operating room following lesion evacuation and hemostasis. The strip consisted of six platinum electrodes (4.2\u2009mm\n2\nexposed area) spaced at 10\u2009mm (Wyler, Ad-Tech Medical, Racine, WI). The strip was targeted to viable peri-lesional cortex judged to be at highest risk of secondary injury and was placed along a single gyrus when possible.\n24\n,\n36\u201338\nA microdialysis catheter (CMA70 Brain Microdialysis Catheter, 10\u2009cm flexible shaft, 10\u2009mm membrane length, 20\u2009kDa cutoff, and an external diameter of 0.6\u2009mm, CMA, Stockholm, Sweden) was inserted 1.5\u20132.0\u2009cm into the parenchyma within 1\u2009cm adjacent to the electrode strip to monitor the same tissue. The microdialysis catheter was connected to a portable, battery-driven syringe pump (CMA 107 Microdialysis Pump, CMA Microdialysis) that perfused sterile normal saline at the rate of 2\u2009\u03bcL/min. As the perfusion flow rate is inversely related to relative recovery, at the given perfusion rate of 2\u2009\u03bcL/min, the expected recovery of the analytes glucose, lactate, pyruvate, and glutamate is some 40% of the true extracellular concentration.\n39\n,\n40\nMicrodialysis samples were collected in 60-min intervals in all patients except patients 1\u20133 and 6 (90\u2009min) and immediately frozen (\u201320\u00b0C) in air-tight vials.\nThe subdural electrode strip was connected to two AC-coupled Dual Bioamp amplifiers (high pass cutoff: 0.02\u2009Hz; ADInstruments, New South Wales, Australia) in a sequential bipolar fashion and ground was provided by a self-adhesive Ag/AgCl patch electrode on the shoulder. Electrocorticography data were digitized and recorded at 200\u2009Hz sampling with Powerlab 16/SP and Chart 5 software (ADInstruments, Inc.). During monitoring, patients were sedated, ventilated, and pharmacologically immobilized as required. Sedation was maintained with propofol or midazolam and analgesia was provided with fentanyl or morphine. Phenytoin was administered for seizure control or prophylaxis in all patients. Intracranial pressure (ICP) was monitored in all patients through a ventricular drainage catheter or intraparenchymal transducer (Codman, Raynham, MA). Neurocritical care followed the Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines\n41\nand aimed to maintain ICP <20\u2009mm Hg and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) >60\u2009mm Hg. Neuromonitoring was terminated and devices were removed at the patient's bedside when invasive neuromonitoring was no longer clinically required or after a maximum of 7 days. Clinical outcome was assessed at 6 months during telephone interview or at the clinical visit according to the Glasgow Outcome Score-Extended (GOS-E).\n\nData analysis\nFrozen microdialysis samples (\nn\n=\u20091214) were analyzed in a batch fashion each week using standard reagents on the CMA microdialysis analyzer (CMA 600, Solna, Sweden) for concentrations of glucose, lactate, pyruvate, and glutamate.\n40\nThe absolute concentrations of the neurochemicals should not be affected by this freeze/thaw procedure as prior work has shown this did not significantly alter the concentrations.\n42\nThe bedside nurse and the research team maintained a detailed patient event log to identify important events and to record times of vial sampling. To allow for stabilization of the probe after placement, the first sample was excluded from analysis. Samples were classified as \u201cabnormal\u201d based on established thresholds\n2\n: glucose <1.0\u2009mmol/L, lactate >4\u2009mmol/L, pyruvate <50\u2009\u03bcmol/L, glutamate >10\u2009\u03bcmol/L, and LPR >40. \u201cNormal\u201d values for human microdialysis have been reported previously.\n3\nElectrocorticography recordings were analyzed for SD according to methods described previously.\n24\n,\n37\n,\n38\nBriefly, SDs were identified by (1) the occurrence of slow-potential changes, reflecting high-pass filtering at 0.02\u2009Hz of the 5\u201315\u2009mV negative shift in DC potential,\n43\n(2) amplitude depression of high-frequency spontaneous activity (0.5\u201350\u2009Hz) lasting at least several minutes, with onset synchronous with the slow-potential change in the same channel, and (3) the sequential occurrence of slow-potential changes and depressions on adjacent channels, demonstrating spread across the cortex at 1\u20138\u2009mm/min. The time of the first slow-potential change in any channel was used as the time stamp for that SD. Day 0 was defined as the first 24\u2009h after injury.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData were sorted and analyzed with custom programs written in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Natick, MA). Data are presented as medians (interquartile range) and statistical significance was defined as\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Anesthetic regimen, closed cranial window technique, and fluid percussion brain injury\nJuvenile pigs (4 weeks old, 6.0\u20137.0\u2009kg) of either sex were studied. All protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania. The anesthetic regimen consisted of: pre-medication with dexmedetomidine (20\u2009\u03bcg/kg im), induction with isoflurane (2\u20133%), isoflurane taper to 0% after start of total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with fentanyl (100 ug/kg/h), midazolam (1mg/kg/h), dexmedetomidine (2\u2009\u03bcg/kg/h), and propofol (2\u201310\u2009mg/kg/h), and maintenance of TIVA for the balance of the surgical and experimental portions of the pig preparation. A catheter was inserted into a femoral artery to monitor blood pressure and femoral veins for drug administration. The trachea was cannulated, the animals were ventilated with room air, and temperature was maintained in the normothermic range (37\u00b0C\u201339\u00b0C), monitored rectally.\nA cranial window was placed in the parietal skull of these anesthetized animals. This window consisted of three parts: a stainless steel ring, a circular glass coverslip, and three ports consisting of 17-gauge hypodermic needles attached to three pre-cut holes in the stainless steel ring. For placement, the dura was cut and retracted over the cut bone edge. The cranial window was placed in the opening and cemented in place with dental acrylic. The volume under the window was filled with a solution, similar to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), of the following composition (in mM): 3.0 KCl, 1.5 MgCl\n2\n, 1.5 CaCl\n2\n, 132 NaCl, 6.6 urea, 3.7 dextrose, and 24.6 NaHCO\n3\n. This artificial CSF was warmed to 37\u00b0C and had the following chemistry: pH 7.33, pCO2 46\u2009mm Hg, and pO2 43\u2009mm Hg, which was similar to that of endogenous CSF. Pial arterial vessel diameter was measured with a microscope, a camera, a video output screen, and a video microscaler.\nThe closed cranial window technique was also used for collection of CSF for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis.\n17\n,\n18\nAn Integra Camino monitor was used to measure ICP. A laser Doppler probe was placed near the cranial window. CBF was measured in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus using radioactively labeled microspheres.\n17\nThe method used to induce moderate (2 atm) brain FPI has been described previously.\n17\n\nProtocol\nPial small arteries (resting diameter, 120\u2013160\u2009\u03bcm) were examined and similar sized pial arteries were used in male and female pigs. For sample collection, 300\u2009\u03bcL of the total cranial window volume of 500\u2009\u03bcL was collected by slowly infusing artificial CSF into one side of the window and allowing the CSF to drip freely into a collection tube on the opposite side.\nForty pigs in eight groups (four male, four female) were randomized to one of each experimental intervention group (all\nn\n=\u20095): (1) sham control, (2) FPI untreated, (3) FPI post-treated with NE, and (4) FPI post-treated with NE + the ERK MAPK antagonist U 0126 (1\u2009mg/kg intravenously [IV]). CPP was targeted (65\u201370\u2009mm Hg, per 2012 Pediatric Guidelines) to determine the dose of the IV infusion (in \u03bcg/kg/min) of NE, and NE treatment was started when CPP decreased below 45\u2009mm Hg. The MAP of a 4-week-old pig was typically 65\u201380\u2009mm Hg under sham conditions. After brain injury, MAP increased transiently and then typically decreased and was allowed to reach \u224855\u2009mm Hg within 30\u2009min after injury. ICP was allowed to increase to \u224810\u201316\u2009mm Hg. From the equation CPP\u2009=\u2009MAP \u2013 ICP, when CPP decreased below 45\u2009mm Hg the NE infusion (0.7\u20131.3ug/kg/min IV) was then started and the dose was increased until the target CPP was reached; this approach is typically used in the clinical setting. The FPI untreated group did not receive either fluids or vasoactive agents to normalize CPP.\n17\n,\n18\nCerebral autoregulation was tested via two techniques. The\nfirst method\ndetermined the transient hyperemic response ratio (THRR), a technique often used clinically,\n20\u201323\nthereby making these studies conducted in a basic science animal model of TBI more translatable. The THRR is calculated by observing the change in mean laser Doppler flow after the release of 10-sec compression of the common carotid artery, as described previously.\n20\u201323\nTHRR was calculated using the formula: THRR\u2009=\u2009F3/F1 where F1 and F3 are the flow immediately before compression and after the release of compression, respectively. Compression ratio (CR) was defined as the magnitude of decrease in flow during carotid compression and was calculated as: CR (%)\u2009=\u2009(F1-F2) \u00d7 100/F1 where F2 is the flow immediately after compression. THRR was tested twice in each animal with an interval of 5\u2009min between the tests. The mathematical averages of THRR and CR derived from the two tests was used for statistical analysis.\nThe\nsecond method\nto test cerebral autoregulation was the traditional one used by this laboratory and was included both for comparison with the newer THRR technique but also for comparison with studies that used Phe, DA, and NE as vasoactive agent treatments following FPI in newborn pigs. Hypotension was induced by the rapid withdrawal of either 5\u20138 or 10\u201315\u2009mL blood/kg to induce moderate or severe hypotension (decreases in MAP of 25 and 45%, respectively). Such decreases in blood pressure were maintained constant for 10\u2009min by titration of additional blood withdrawal or blood reinfusion.\nThe vehicle for all agents was 0.9% saline, except for the MAPK inhibitor, which used dimethyl sulfoxide (100\u2009\u03bcL) diluted with 9.9\u2009mL 0.9% saline. In sham control animals, responses to THRR, hypotension (moderate, severe), and papaverine (10\n\u22128\n, 10\n\u22126\nM) were obtained initially and then again 1h later. In drug post-treated animals, drugs were administered after FPI and responses to THRR, hypotension, and papaverine, and CSF samples were collected at 1h post-insult. The order of agonist administration was randomized within animal groups. A wait period of 20\u2009min occurred between each set of stimuli to allow CBF, pial artery diameter, and biochemical indices of outcome (ERK MAPK) to return to control value.\n\nELISA\nCommercially available ELISA kits were used to quantity CSF ERK-MAPK (Assay Designs) and IL-6 (Abcam) concentration.\n\nHistological preparation\nThe brains were prepared for histopathology at 4h post-FPI. The brains were perfused with heparinized saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. For histopathology, staining was performed on paraffin-embedded slides and serial sections were cut at 30\u2009\u03bcm intervals from the front face of each block and mounted on microscope slides. The sections (6\u2009\u03bcm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). Mean number of necrotic neurons (\u00b1 standard error of mean [SEM]) in CA1 and CA3 hippocampus in vehicle control, FPI, and FPI + NE treated animals were determined, with data displayed for the side of the brain contralateral to the site of injury (the side where pial artery reactivity was investigated). Morphological criteria for a necrotic neuron are: 1) pyknosis, 2) granulation of the cytoplasm, and 3) the emergence of an area between the nucleus and the cytoplasm that is unstained. The investigator was blinded to treatment group.\n\nStatistical analysis\nPial artery diameter, CBF, CSF ERK MAPK, and IL-6 values were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures. If the value was significant, the data were then analyzed by Fisher's protected least significant difference test. An \u03b1 level of\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered significant in all statistical tests. Values are represented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM of the absolute value or as percentage changes from control value. Power analysis from prior studies shows that a sample size of 5 for hemodynamic datasets yielded statistical significance at the\np\n<\u20090.05 level with power of 0.84. Similar analysis for histopathology and biochemical indices (ERK MAPK) had powers of 0.82 and 0.85, respectively."

Blood samples from those with chronic TBI were collected at the indicated time point. Plasma was extracted as supernatant after centrifugation of whole blood in ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (EDTA) blood tubes for 5\u20137\u2009min at 4000\u2009rpm according to the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke TBI Common Data Elements Biospecimens and Biomarkers Working Group recommendations.\n32\nIn addition, 16 commercial control plasma samples collected with EDTA blood tubes (Bioreclamation Inc., mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation [SD] 39.1\u2009\u00b1\u200917.2 years old) were age-matched with the acute (\nn\n=\u2009196; 42.1\u2009\u00b1\u200918.1 years old) and chronic TBI (\nn\n=\u200921; age 44.4\u2009\u00b1\u200920.5 years old) samples and assayed for AutoAb[GFAP].\n\nMeasurement of AutoAb[GFAP]\nTo detect and quantify AutoAb[GFAP] levels in biosamples, we used our previously published manifold autoantibody immunoblotting assay format\n26\n(see\nSupplementary Fig. 1\nfor assay set-up; see online supplementary material at\nftp.liebertpub.com\n). Briefly, human brain GFAP protein or human brain fraction enriched in GFAP protein (20\u2009\u03bcg) were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 4\u201320% Tris-glycine 1-well gel and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. PVDF membranes were then clamped into the Mini-Protean II Multiscreen apparatus (Bio-Rad), and individual lanes were blocked and probed with human sera diluted at 1:100, unless otherwise noted.\nThis manifold autoantibody immunoblot assay\n26\nrequires only a 1/100 dilution (e.g., 1\u2009\u03bcL in 100\u2009\u03bcL). We serially diluted the plasma to verify that the signal is plasma concentration-dependent provided that it is within the optical density (OD) readings for the spectrometer. Secondary antibodies used were either alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated goat antihuman immunoglobulin G (IgG) or AP-conjugated donkey antihuman IgG diluted 1:10,000 (Jackson ImmunoResearch).\nBlots were developed at room temperature with substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3'-indolyphosphate p-toluidine salt and nitro-blue tetrazolium chloride solution for 10\u2009min. We also routinely performed in-solution pre-absorption with GFAP protein (2\u2009\u03bcg/100\u2009\u03bcL) as a control study. The bands of interest on the blotting membrane disappear after pre-absorption (data not shown). Quantification of autoantibody reactivity on immunoblots was performed via computer-assisted densitometric scanning (Epson 8836XL high-resolution scanner and NIH Image J densitometry software). Autoantibody levels were expressed in arbitrary densitometry units.\nValues are reported as mean and standard error (SE) unless stated otherwise. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for multigroup analysis; Tukey\npost hoc\ntest used to assess mean differences between subgroups as well as distinguish homogeneous subsets. Statistical significance was assessed at\np\n<\u20090.05. Statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) and Statistical Analysis System (SAS) version 9.2, (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) unless stated otherwise."

    "Methods": "Instrument\nThe FIM instrument is an 18-item measure of burden of care associated with physical and cognitive functioning. Clinicians rate items on a 7-point scale that ranges from total assistance (1) to complete independence (7). The FIM assesses problem solving, memory, expression, comprehension, social interaction, eating, grooming, bathing, dressing\u2013upper body, dressing\u2013lower body, toileting, bowel management, bladder management, transfers to bed, chair, or wheelchair, transfers to toilet, and transfers to shower/tub, locomotion, and stair climbing. FIM instrument data are collected by TBIMS clinicians at admission and discharge from rehabilitation, and certified data collectors record scores by telephone interview 1, 2, and 5 years post-discharge and every 5 years thereafter.\n\nAnalytic approach and analysis\nThe MRM described in this article was developed in two stages: unidimensional Rasch model development and MRM building. The initial sample included 8909 TBIMS participants but was reduced to 8136 after dropping participants with extreme scores, which are not estimable in the Rasch model. All analyses were performed using standard Rasch/IRT analysis software packages: Winsteps Version 3.80.1 and ConQuest Version 3.0.1.\nThe sample was randomly split into three independent equal-sized subsamples before analysis. The subsamples contained FIM item information for one person at one time point\u2014admission, discharge, and 1 year follow-up, respectively, using the method described by Mallinson.\n12\nThese three samples were recombined before calibration so that the transformed measure is applicable to both cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis.\nThe collection of information was limited to admission, discharge, and 1 year follow-up time points because: (1) it is within these time points that the majority of change occurs and (2) sample size was maximized.\n18\nAnalysis of differential item functioning conducted before calibration demonstrated no sufficient differences (>0.5 logits) between clinician-rated (i.e., admission and discharge) and telephone-administered (i.e., 1-year follow-up) FIM items.\nThe analysis focused on establishing the dimensionality of the FIM and assessing the extent to which item responses were monotonic (rating scale categories increased as patient ability increased). The initial calibration included all 18 FIM items. The data were fit to the Rasch-Masters Partial Credit model, because the assumption of a common threshold structure (i.e., identical distances between response options for each item) made by the Rasch-Andrich Rating Scale model was not expected.\nMonotonicity was evaluated by comparing the average person ability measure associated with each item response. Unidimensionality was evaluated by principal components analysis (PCA) of residual variance not accounted for by the unidimensional Rasch model.\n2\nIn combination with PCA, unidimensionality was established by way of parallel analyses, which were conducted to determine whether the separate dimensions accounted for more variance than similar dimensions in random data that fit the Rasch model.\n19\nSpecifically, three data sets were simulated based on estimated model parameters from the initial Rasch calibration and were analyzed using the same approach as described above. Finally, using the original sample, fit of the item responses to the Rasch model was examined using item infit and outfit statistics where values less than 1.5 indicate items perform well relative to the expectations of the model. Joint maximum likelihood estimation was used to calculate logit estimates and their corresponding standard errors.\nOn confirmation of the multidimensional nature of the FIM, we proceeded to fit the MRM under the Rasch-Masters Partial Credit paradigm. We compared deviance statistics from the MRM to its unidimensional counterpart\u2014i.e., a single model that ignores subscales. In addition, we examined item infit and outfit using the same criterion noted above and investigated step disorder within items using item probability curves\u2014i.e., Rasch-Andrich thresholds. Finally, we examined the separation reliability, coefficient alpha, and correlations between subscales."

    "Methods": "To investigate the relation between oscillations at all frequency bands and TBI, 16 (5\u20138 weeks old, 24\u201328\u2009g) C57BL/6J male mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were anesthetized (ketamine and xylazine mixture) and LFPI was performed, as previously described.6All experimental procedures and protocols for animal studies were approved by the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accord with the international guidelines on the ethical use of animals (National Research Council, National Academy Press, Washington DC, 1996).8On day 1, a craniectomy was performed over the right parietal area between bregma and lambda keeping the dura intact. On day 2, the injury was induced by a brief pulse of saline onto the intact dura at a pressure of 1.5 atm, generating a mild brain injury. Sham animals received all of the above procedures except the fluid pulse.\n\nSix to 8 days post-LFPI, injured (n=\u20098) and respective time-matched sham (n=\u20098) animals were reanesthetized (ketamine and xylazine), and three electrodes (monopolar 0.004 inch stainless steel; A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA) were guided into the hippocampal area CA1 using stereotaxic coordinates (2.2\u2009mm posterior to the bregma, 2\u2009mm lateral to the midline; seeFig. 1A). The recording electrodes were implanted only ipsilateral to the injury location directly above the craniectomy. A reference and ground electrode were placed in the cerebellum and in the skull behind the lambda suture, respectively. Two support screws were positioned over the anterior aspect of the skull, and the entire ensemble was secured with dental cement (Plastick One, Roanoke, VA).\n\nPost-surgery, all animals were allowed to recover on an electric heating pad until spontaneously mobile and were returned to their home cage. After at least 24\u2009h, animals were transferred to the recording cage (same dimensions as the home cage). Animals were allowed free access to food and water in the recording cage.In vivorecordings were obtained for at least 24\u2009h. All encephalography (EEG) recordings were performed at 8\u201310 days post-LFPI. All recordings were performed using a Stellate-Harmonie (Stellate Inc., Montreal, Quebec Canada) 16-bit, 24-channel digital EEG amplifier, sampling at 2000\u2009Hz with a hardware 1000-Hz low-pass antialiasing filter. Unity gain pre-amplifiers were constructed in-house from TI LM2478 quad operational amplifier integrated circuits (Texas Instruments, Dallas, TX). After recording, animals were sacrificed and processed for histological assessment of electrode location. Animals were anesthetized with 5% chloral hydrate, and the electrode positions were marked by passing 15\u2009\u03bcA for 15\u2009sec through each electrode (Fig. 1B). Immediately after current injection, animals were perfused with saline followed by 3% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Brains were post-fixed with PFA 3%, and 50-\u03bcm-thick coronal sections were cut with a VT 1000S vibratome (Leica Microsystems Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL).\n\nThe recorded local field potential was analyzed post hoc in the following manner. First, video of the rodents was manually parsed and periods of exploration, defined as sniffing and/or walking, were selected. From these exploratory time periods, the data were further segmented into nonoverlapping epochs of 3000\u2009msec duration. These epochs consisted of 2000\u2009msec duration with two 500-msec flanking buffers on each end in order to diminish edge effects during the analysis. To generate an instantaneous power and phase spectrum, these epochs of EEG were convolved with a bank of 100 Morlet wavelet filters, logarithmically spaced from 2 to 800\u2009Hz.18For the power analyses, we averaged the instantaneous, log-transformed, power across the 2000\u2009msec interval to obtain an estimate of the power spectrum for that trace. The power spectrum for each animal was determined by averaging each power spectrum across all time epochs for each animal. We compared the distribution of average power spectra across TBI and sham conditions using a two-tailedt-test."

    "Methods": "We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis according to the methods of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and we report according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement.21,22\n\nEligibility criteria\nWe included all randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled observational studies that compared MPS against placebo or no treatment in adult patients with acute TSCIs. Studies that reported exclusively on pediatric patients (less than 18 years of age) and studies of corticosteroids other than MPS were excluded. Studies that combined pediatric patients with adult patients were included. No exclusions were made on the basis of open versus closed injuries, language, publication status, timing of outcome assessment, setting, or regimen of MPS.\n\nIdentification of studies\nWe searched MEDLINE (1946 to present), EMBASE (1974 to present), and The Cochrane Library (no date limit) on June 6, 2015 using MeSH and EMTREE headings and subheadings in various combinations, supplemented with free text (\nAppendix 1\n). We also reviewed reference lists from included studies and previous reviews, consulted with experts, and used the \u201crelated articles\u201d feature in PubMed. To identify potential unpublished studies, we searched clinicaltrials.gov and reviewed annual conference proceedings from 2012 to the present for the North American Spine Society, the Spine Society of Europe, and the Canadian Spine Society.\nTwo reviewers (N.E., E.B.C.) independently screened all titles and abstracts and then screened the full texts of potentially eligible studies for final inclusion. Studies in languages other than English were translated. All discrepancies were resolved by consensus.\n\nData extraction\nThe two reviewers independently evaluated risk of bias for each study using the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias tool for RCTs and the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) for observational studies, and all discrepancies were resolved by consensus.\n21\n,\n23\nWe classified outcomes by consensus as critical, important but not critical, or of limited importance to patients and decision makers, and we extracted data for those outcomes considered critical or important.\n21\nMotor recovery and specific AEs (mortality, sepsis, pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding, decubitus ulcer, urinary tract infection, venous thromboembolism, and surgical site infection) were considered critical or important based on clinical significance and previous literature.\n24\u201326\nSensory recovery, length of stay, hyperglycemia, and other outcomes were considered of limited importance.\nThe two reviewers independently extracted the following data points using piloted electronic data forms: study design; first author; journal; year of publication; patient characteristics; surgical cointervention and surgical timing; injury severity; sample size and losses in each group; duration of follow-up; MPS regimen; motor recovery outcomes; and AEs. Scales for motor recovery outcomes included International Standards for Neurologic Classification of Spinal Cord Injury American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) total motor scores (continuous) and improvement by one grade or more on the Frankel or ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS; dichotomous).\n27\nWe contacted authors and reviewed data reported in previous meta-analyses for clarifications when needed.\n8\nWe estimated standard deviations (SDs) for motor score improvement, when necessary, by imputing the median SDs for all patients that received the same treatment (steroids vs. no steroids) from all studies that reported on the same outcome (motor score improvement).\n21\nWhen studies investigated additional interventions, we extracted outcome data only for comparisons of MPS versus placebo or no treatment.\n\nData synthesis\nWe pre-specified that we would not pool data from RCTs with data from observational studies,\n21\n,\n28\nand we pre-specified subgroup hypotheses that we would test to explain potential high heterogeneity: cervical versus thoracolumbar injuries; complete (AIS A) versus incomplete (AIS B/C/D) injuries; presence and timing of surgical cointervention; and risk of bias.\n16\n,\n29\u201331\nWe also planned subgroup analyses for motor recovery outcomes including only studies in which MPS was administered within 8\u2009h of injury regardless of heterogeneity because of established clinical interest.\n1\n,\n8\nWe pooled motor recovery data at follow-up durations of 6 months or earlier (short-term) and greater than 6 months (long-term), and AE data at final follow-up from each study.\n1\n,\n6\n,\n24\n,\n30\n,\n32\nWe used the numbers of participants reported as followed up at each specific time point in each trial, where possible.\nWe used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to evaluate confidence in the pooled effect estimates.\n16\n,\n33\nAccording to GRADE, data from RCTs are considered high-quality evidence, but can be rated down according to risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, or publication bias. Data from observational studies are considered low-quality evidence, but can be rated up because of a large treatment effect, evidence of a dose-response relationship, or if all plausible biases would not undermine the conclusions. We rated down for imprecision if the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) failed to exclude benefit or harm and if the pooled sample would have been underpowered to detect the point estimate (Optimal Information Size criterion).\n34\nWe rated down for inconsistency if statistically significant heterogeneity could not be explained by our pre-specified subgroup hypotheses.\n35\n\nStatistical analysis\nWe quantified interobserver agreement for the reviewers' assessments using Cohen's kappa and interpreted values according to Landis and Koch as: 0, poor; 0.01\u20130.20, slight; 0.21\u20130.40, fair; 0.41\u20130.60, moderate; 0.61\u20130.80, substantial; and 0.81\u20131.00, almost perfect.\n36\nWe combined outcome data according to the inverse variance method using a random effects model.\n21\nWe report pooled estimates as mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs for continuous outcomes and risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs for dichotomous outcomes. We constructed funnel plots to assess for publication bias; we quantified heterogeneity using the chi-squared test and the I\n2\nstatistic. We planned sensitivity analyses to test the importance of estimated data by omitting studies requiring estimation and to test the importance of losses to follow-up across a range of plausible assumptions about the nature of any losses.\n37\nTests of significance were two-tailed and\np\nvalues <0.05 were considered significant. All analyses were performed using IBM SPSS (version 21; SPSS, Inc., Chicago IL) and Review Manager software (version 5.3; The Nordic Cochrane Center, The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark)."

    "Methods": "This review was conducted and reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement.14Details of the protocol for this systematic review were registered on PROSPERO (registration number 2014: CRD42014015517) and can be accessed atwww.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.asp?ID=CRD42014015517.\n\nThis review was prepared as a \u201cliving systematic review\u201d as part of the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) project. CENTER-TBI is a European project aiming to improve outcomes for people with TBI through better classification, characterization, and management of this injury.15A living systematic review is a high quality, up-to-date online summary of health research that is updated as data from new relevant research that meets study inclusion criteria becomes available.16In practice, this means that the searches will be re-run frequently, any new studies incorporated into the review, and updates will be regularly published.17\n\nInformation sources\nThe following databases were searched: PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, and EMBASE from 1960 up to January 15, 2015. For each of these, searches were performed in March and April 2014 with a combination of key words and subject headings (\nAppendix 1\n). The same searches were re-run in January 2015. To reduce the risk of publication bias, searches also were undertaken in gray literature and references of included studies.\n\nStudy selection/inclusion criteria\nRetrospective and prospective descriptive studies that reported on the epidemiology of TBI in Europe were included. To be eligible for the review, studies must have been an original study (i.e., not a review or duplicate of previously published data) that measured and reported incidence, mortality, or case fatality of TBI in Europe, and was published in English. Study size was not restricted and data collected from hospitals or official statistics were eligible. There were no limitations regarding the dates of data collection, study performance or publication, participant age, or TBI severity.\nFor some of these terms, such as TBI, incidence, mortality, and case fatality, the definition used by authors can vary. For the purposes of this review, these terms were defined in the following ways:\nTBI: Defined as an injury to the head, by either blunt force or penetrative means, which causes sufficient damage that the patient suffers a change in brain function; or more recently, as an alteration in brain function, or other evidence of brain pathology, caused by an external force.\n11\nAscertainment of a TBI case could be by any of the following:\nInternational Classification of Diseases\n(ICD) in its 8th, 9th and 10th revision codes, Abbreviated Injury Score for head injuries (AIS\nHead\nor HAIS), the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), or clinical signs (such as loss of consciousness, post-traumatic amnesia, or pathologies found in computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging scan).\nIncidence: Rate of TBIs recorded per 100,000 population per year. These were usually first-time events.\nMortality: Total number of fatal TBIs in a given population per 100,000 population per year.\nCase fatality: Proportion of people with TBI who subsequently died due to a cause related to the TBI at certain time-points.\nTBI severity: Categories of severity (severe, moderate, mild), as defined by the GCS (e.g., 3\u20138 [mild], 9\u201312 [moderate], and 13\u201315 [severe],\n5\nor other classification system used by the authors.\nTwo authors (WP, VB) independently screened citations on titles and abstracts, excluding any obviously irrelevant or duplicate citations. Results were compared and disagreements discussed with a third author and/or with members of an expert panel. Agreed citations were retrieved in full text and screened independently by two authors (AB, VB, MM, VR, MT) using the same process. Screening was undertaken using Covidence, a not-for-profit web-based tool designed to assist in conducting systematic reviews.\n18\n\nData collection and assessment of methodological quality\nTwo authors (AB, VB, MM, VR, or MT) independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality of selected studies. Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion.\nThe following items were extracted from each study: study authors, year of publication, study time period, type of data source, method and completeness of case ascertainment, criteria for identifying TBI, source population, number of TBI cases reported, reported data on TBI incidence, mortality, and case fatality, broken down by sex, age, severity, and mechanism of injury.\nMethodological quality was assessed using the Methodological Evaluation of Observational Research (MORE) checklist, as previously used in reviews of non-therapeutic studies.\n19\n,\n20\nThe following domains of bias or quality are assessed with the MORE checklist: funding of study, conflict of interest, study design, sampling, definition of cases, source of data, and reliability of estimates. Each domain was judged according to specific criteria and scored as \u201cOK, Minor Flaw, Major Flaw, and Poor reporting\u201d (\nAppendix 2\n) No studies were excluded from the review based on methodological quality.\n\nData synthesis\nTo facilitate appropriate comparisons, studies were first grouped according to whether they reported country-level data (derived from national hospital or mortality registries) or regional-level data, denoting smaller populations within studies (derived from regional/country or hospital catchment areas). Other stratifications\u2013for example, by study design and retrospective/prospective data collection\u2013were considered, but the strata generated by this means were too small to make meaningful comparisons.\nFindings are described overall, and also broken down according to age, sex, severity of TBI, and mechanism of injury. Time trends of incidence and mortality of TBI also are described.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented in tables and figures. Meta-analysis of incidence and mortality rates was not possible, as too few studies reported age-adjusted data and it was not possible to obtain the raw data from study authors to perform standardization. A funnel plot was generated to consider small study effects in regional-level studies; the country-level studies were not plotted as there were too few studies (fewer than 10)."

    "Methods": "Mouse controlled cortical impact\nAll CCI protocols were approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and complied with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Male C57Bl/6 mice (10\u201312 weeks of age) were used for this model, as reported previously.\n25\nBriefly, mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane (Anaquest, Memphis, TN) in 70% N\n2\nand 30% O\n2\nand positioned in a stereotaxic frame. A 5-mm craniotomy was performed over the right cerebral hemisphere between the bregma and lambda by the use of a trephine drill, and the bone flap was removed. After craniotomy, mice were subjected to injury by a pneumatic cylinder with a 3-mm flat-tip impounder, 4.8\u2009m/s of velocity, 0.6\u2009mm of depth, and 150\u2009ms of impact duration. Post-CCI, the scalp was sutured closed and mice were returned to their cages to recover from anesthesia. To confirm reproducible injury, mouse brains were cut and standard hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) stains were used to assess the distribution of traumatic injury.\n\nPreparation of brain microvessels\nMice were sacrificed 24\u2009h post-injury. After perfusion with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), brains were harvested. Two sides of hemispheres (contra- and ipsilateral sides) were separated, removing the core lesion areas (which fall apart quite easily) and underlying white matter, then rolling on the filter paper to get rid of meninges and the remaining loose debris. After this, cortical tissue from each hemisphere was pooled from 4 mice, homogenized in cold PBS on ice with Knote Dounce glass tissue grinder (Part 885300-0002; Kimble Chase Life Science, Vineland, NJ), then centrifuged at 4\u00b0C, 500\ng\nfor 5\u2009min. The tissue pellet was suspended with 18% Dextran solution (molecular weight 60\u201390\u2009kDa; USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH) in PBS and then centrifuged again at 4\u00b0C, 2500\ng\nfor 20\u2009min. The resulting pellet from this Dextran gradient centrifugation provides the raw sample of brain microvessels, as previously described.\n26\nTo increase yield, the supernatant was centrifuged again and the pellets from two centrifugations were pooled, washed once in PBS, and then resuspended in PBS. The final suspension was filtered through a 40-\u03bcm cell strainer to get rid of remaining single cells or small cell clumps. The resulting microvessels on the top of the cell strainer were used directly for RNA extraction. To confirm purity, isolated microvessels were subjected to immunostaining for endothelial, smooth muscle cell, and glial markers. Primary antibodies anti-CD31, alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were used. Texas Red\u2013labeled lycopersicon Esculentum (tomato) Lectin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was also used to stain vessel fragments. Note that in this study, we collected brain microvessel fragments using dextran gradient centrifugation, unlike the original vasculome paper where enzyme digestion and CD-31 magnetic bead isolation were required for the structurally tougher tissue from heart and kidney. We acknowledge that the comparative purity of endothelial cells may be different between these two methods. But according to reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) verification, sufficient purity of microvessels was still obtained here.\n\nQuantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction\nRelative expressions (ipsilateral vs. contralateral [Ipsi/Cont] and ipsilateral vs. normal condition [Ipsi/Norm]) of some selected genes were verified by RT-PCR, a commonly used technique to quantify relative gene expression. First-strand complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized with the SuperScript VILO synthesis system (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY), consisting of SuperScript III reverse transcriptase and Oligo(dT) primers. Specific gene expression level was quantified by real-time PCR on an ABI-7500 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) thermal cycler using predesigned Taqman primers with FAM fluorescent labeling (Applied Biosystems). Data normalization was performed by quantification of the endogenous 18S ribosomal RNA, and fold change was measured with 2\n-\u0394\u0394Ct\nmethod.\n\nHematoxylin-eosin staining\nTo check the histomorphological condition of mouse brain hemisphere, standard H&E staining was processed by Massachusetts General Hospital Histopathology Research Core (Boston, MA).\n\nMicroarray sample analysis\nTotal RNA was extracted from the fresh preparation of brain microvasculature with the RNeasy Plus Micro kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Concentration of RNA was measured by Nanodrop, and integrity of RNA was tested with the RNA integrity number (RIN) score on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CAQ). All samples had RIN scores larger than 8.0. Microarray hybridization and scanning was done by Expression Analysis Corporation with Affymetrix murine whole genome microarray M430 2.0, with 3-IVT (\nin vitro\ntranscription) and Encore Biotin Module for amplification, fragmentation, and labeling. Raw expression data from each chip for each sample were summarized and normalized using the Robust Multi-Array algorithm. The quality of each chip was determined by manually checking mean values, variances, and paired scatter plots as well as principal component analysis plots. All chips passed the quality check. All statistical analyses were performed with the statistics software R (version 2.6.2; available from:\nhttp://www.r-project.org\n) and R packages developed by the BioConductor project (available from:\nhttp://www.bioconductor.org\n).\n\nMicroarray data analysis\nAfter normalization and quality checking, samples were clustered using an unsupervised clustering method based on Pearson's correlation coefficient-derived distance matrix using all probes on the chip. Distances between clusters were determined using the complete link method. Next, differentially expressed genes were identified, based on both statistical significances, which were determined using the significance analysis of microarrays algorithm (a variant of\nt\n-test and specifically designed for microarray data), and fold change threshold. The genes with\np\n<\u20090.01 and fold change >2 or <0.5 were considered as differentially expressed. The combination of fold change threshold and\np\nvalues serves to eliminate most false positives, producing a more stringent list. Third, significantly changed gene sets in whole transcriptome were identified using the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) method.\n27\nThe GSEA method requires two inputs: 1) a master list of genes ranked according to expression differences between two states and 2)\na priori\n\u2013defined gene sets (e.g., pathways) that consist of specific function-related genes. In this study, input 1 is a list of all genes presented on the Affymetrix mouse M430 2.0 platform and ranked according to the fold changes between two groups; input 2 is the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database (\nhttp://www.genome.jp/kegg/\n) or Gene Ontology (GO) database (\nhttp://geneontology.org/\n).\n28\n,\n29\nEnrichment scores were calculated with standard parameters."

    "Methods": "Participants\nParticipants are a subset of individuals who were consecutively admitted to a Level I Trauma Center after sustaining a TBI and who were then enrolled in a seizure prophylaxis clinical trial within 24\u2009h of admission.\n29\nInclusion criteria for the original study were age 14 and older at time of injury and the presence of at least one of the following: depressed skull fracture, penetrating head injury, computed tomography (CT) evidence of cerebral contusion, or intracerebral, subdural, or epidural hematoma, or a seizure within 24\u2009h of the injury.\nParticipants in this study were randomized to one of the following treatments: 1 month of valproate, 6 months of valproate, or 1 week of phenytoin. All participants took study medications for 6 months (active or placebo).\n29\nResults from the clinical trial found that valproate did not prevent post-traumatic seizures and did not have any effect, positive or negative, on neuropsychological functioning or health-related quality of life.\n30\nThe severity of injuries in these participants ranged from complicated mild (i.e., Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score of 13\u201315 with CT abnormality) to severe (GCS score 3\u20138). The original clinical trial was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University of Washington. This project was approved by that IRB as well as the VA Puget Sound IRB.\nThe present study includes 170 persons who sustained a TBI, were at least 18 at the time of injury, and provided information on their pre-injury alcohol consumption, as well as the quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption at each of four time points post-injury (1 month, 6 months, 12 months, and 3\u20135 years). This represents a subset of the 316 eligible consenting survivors who were over the age of 18 when enrolled in the study. Ninety-four participants were lost to follow-up at some point during the study. An additional 52 participants were not followed at 1 year or 3\u20135 years post-injury because of budgetary constraints. Thirty-three persons died before the 1-month assessment and are not included in the total number of eligible consenting survivors.\nThe persons who were lost to follow-up, those not followed because of budgetary reasons, and the participants included in the current analyses did not significantly differ in terms of age, injury severity (GCS), or blood alcohol level (BAL) on admission. Group differences were present for race and sex. In particular, those included in the current study were more likely to be Caucasian (\np\n=\u20090.006) than those not included, and those lost to follow-up were more likely to be male than those included or not followed because of budgetary reasons (\np\n=\u20090.048).\nAlcohol consumption data collected as part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 1997 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)\n31\nwere used to estimate rates of alcohol consumption in the general public. This survey assesses a wide range of health information from a representative sample of households in the United States each year. The sample size for the data used in this article was 35,223. A subset of individuals (\nn\n=\u2009837) was excluded from the analysis because of incomplete information about alcohol use. The NHIS is completed every year, but data from the1997 survey were used for this study because of its proximity to the time that the data from the TBI participants was collected.\n\nMeasures\nBrain injury severity indices\nBrain injury severity was evaluated with the GCS\n32\nin the emergency department (first post-resuscitation assessment) and with Time to Follow Commands (TFC), operationally defined as time from injury to consistently following simple commands (i.e., GCS motor scale score of 6). GCS scores are missing from 17 participants, generally because of the presence of pre-hospital paralytics.\nDemographic information and pre-morbid characteristics\nA structured interview at 1-month post-injury gathered demographic data and information about pre-injury characteristics. For the majority of participants, this information was provided by either the participant alone (9%) or by the participant with confirmation by their significant other (SO, 68%). In 15% of cases, the information was provided by the SO only because of the severity of the injury of the subject, and in 7%, the SO provided information that was confirmed by the participant.\nAssessment of alcohol use among persons with TBI and in the general population\nIn the TBI group, pre- and post-injury alcohol use was measured in terms of the quantity and frequency of alcohol consumed. At an interview that took place at 1 month post-injury, participants were asked about both pre-injury alcohol use and current alcohol use. Three additional follow-up interviews took place at 6 months, 12 months, and 3\u20135 years post-injury. At 1, 6, and 12 months, participants were asked to report on their alcohol use since the injury. At the 3\u20135 year follow-up, they were asked to report on their alcohol consumption over the past year. Average number of drinks per week at each time point was calculated by multiplying together the responses from the following two questions: (1) How often a week do you drink any kind of alcoholic beverage, and (2) how many drinks do you have per sitting on average? BAL was collected in the emergency department after their injury.\nFor the general population, the average number of drinks per week was calculated based on responses to the following questions on the NHIS: (1) \u201cIn the past year, how often did you drink any type of alcoholic beverage\u201d (this information is provided in the NHIS database in terms of number of days per week), and (2) \u201cIn the past year, on those days that you drank alcoholic beverages, on the average, how many drinks did you have?\u201d\nQuantity frequency index\nAlcohol consumption among the participants with TBI was divided into four discrete categories (abstinent, light drinking, moderate drinking, and heavy drinking) for descriptive purposes. The categorization was based on the classification parameters reported by Bombardier and coworkers,\n9\nwhich were developed to be consistent with the classic quantity frequency index created by Calahan and colleagues.\n33\nOne modification to these criteria was made for the purposes of this study. In particular, the definition of abstainer was broadened to include participants who endorsed drinking 0 days per week and/or an average of 0 drinks per sitting. This modification was made for two reasons; we thought that it better captured the reported level of alcohol consumption and it permitted more consistency in categorization between the TBI and general populations groups given differences in the questionnaires completed by these two groups. Light drinking was defined as 1\u20132 drinks up to twice a week while moderate drinking was defined as 1\u20132 drinks between three and six times per week or 3\u20134 drinks on 1\u20134 occasions per week. Consuming alcohol seven or more times a week was considered heavy alcohol consumption, regardless of amount. In addition, consuming five or more drinks on a single occasion at least once a week was considered heavy drinking.\n34\nOf note, the NHIS includes questions about alcohol consumption during the past year, as well as lifetime. All participants who indicated that they had consumed 12 or more alcohol drinks in their life were asked the questions about quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption. Participants who reported that they had consumed less than 12 alcohol drinks in their life and persons who reported no alcohol consumption in the past year were categorized as abstainers. For the remaining persons in the NHIS database, the criteria described above were used to categorize persons as abstainers, light drinkers, moderate drinkers, or heavy drinkers for the purposes of this study.\nNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) recommended daily drinking limits\nTo consider gender effects on alcohol consumption, alcohol use in the mTBI group was also categorized according to the percent of persons who exceeded the recommended daily drinking limits that have been established by the NIAAA.\n34\nThis was defined as men who reported drinking \u22655 drinks per sitting and women who consumed \u22654 drinks per sitting.\n\nStatistical analyses\nPaired sample\nt\ntests were used to compare post-injury alcohol consumption with pre-injury alcohol consumption. A series of paired sample\nt\ntests was used to evaluate the number of drinks per week post-injury (1 month vs. 6 months, 6 months vs. 12 months, 12 months vs. 3\u20135 years). Chi-square tests were used to evaluate the relationship between injury severity and post-injury alcohol consumption. A McNemar-like test\n35\ncomparing heavier to lighter drinking was used to evaluate change in consumption categories over time in the group with TBI. Comparisons between the mean number of drinks reported by the TBI sample and the general population (NHIS data) were performed using blocked Wilcoxon tests,\n36\nstratified by both age and sex to adjust for the demographic differences in the composition of the two samples."

    "Methods": "Patients\nWe prospectively studied cranioplasties performed at the 12 de Octubre Hospital in Spain from November 2009 to January 2014. Demographic data (e.g., age, sex, and medical comorbidities) were collected. Patients who underwent DC because they had medically refractory intracranial hypertension due to their underlying pathology were included. Patients who underwent DC for either tumor infiltration of the bone or infection of the bone flap after a scheduled craniotomy were excluded. The defective area was calculated by measuring the largest diameter (D1) and the diameter perpendicular to D1 (D2) inputted into the following ellipse formula: (D1/2 \u00d7 D2/2 \u00d7 \u03c0). Patients who underwent a bifrontal craniectomy were considered to have two defective sides, whereas the remainder of the patients had one defective side and one healthy side.\nA score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the Barthel index were recorded for every patient the week before the cranioplasty and between 24\u2009h and 72\u2009h after the surgery. Objective improvement was defined as an improvement of either at least 1 point in the NIHSS or 5 points in the Barthel index, and it was considered to be a trephined syndrome case. Members of the research team blinded to the Doppler and PCT results performed the assessment in a standardized interview.\nConcurrently, subjective improvement was recorded by either asking the patient directly or speaking with his/her caregivers if the patient was unable to answer. To quantify this improvement, the unpleasant symptoms for the patients who were not amenable to objective measure were recorded but the aesthetic improvement was disregarded. The more diverse symptoms (i.e., headaches, dizziness, insomnia, vague discomfort, etc.) were grouped under the term \u201csubjective symptoms.\u201d\n\nSurgical procedures\nSwab cultures were taken from the bone during the DC, then the bone flap was stored at \u221280\u00b0C in a tissue bank. The durotomy was either C or X shaped, and the dura was closed with a biological substitute as either an onlay (DuraGen\n\u00ae\n;) or with stitches (Tutopatch\n\u00ae\n;) based on the surgeon's preference. For patients undergoing a bifrontal DC, the falx cerebri was sectioned. No biological glues or any other sealants were routinely used.\nThe cranioplasty was performed a variable amount of time after the DC depending on the amount of time necessary to resolve the underlying pathology that led to the decompression.\nThe material used for the cranioplasty was the autologous bone flap, unless either the swab cultures were positive or the bone flap deteriorated during harvesting. If the bone flap was unavailable, then either computer-designed polyetheretherketone implants or manually shaped implants constructed from acrylic cement were used. A subgaleal drain was routinely used 24-72\u2009h after the procedure. Antibiotic prophylaxis (2\u2009g of cefazolin) was administered 15-60\u2009min prior to skin incision and 6\u2009h after completion of the surgery. Depending on the surgeon's preference, antibiotic administration may be extended for up to 72\u2009h after the surgery.\nThe use of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) was reserved for patients who present with obvious preoperative ventricular enlargement, and it was performed simultaneously with the cranioplasty. Patients with either a ventricular size at the higher limit of the normal range (Evan's index between 0.3 and 0.4) or subdural fluid collections were operated upon without VPS implantation. In these cases, either a lumbar drain or ventricular puncture was used before or during the procedure to avoid excessive pressure on the brain parenchyma) because in our experience, most of these CSF derangements resolve after the surgery.\n22\nIn cases involving a persistent or progressive ventricular dilatation, a shunt was placed during a second operation. To avoid confounding effects of DVP implantation, patients who underwent both a cranioplasty and DVP implantation at the same time were excluded from the analysis.\nThis study was revised and approved by the ethical committee at the hospital (reference, CEIC n\u00b0: 11/083).\n\nPCT technique and measurements\nPCT was performed one week before the procedure and within 72\u2009h after the operation. All of the imaging studies were performed on a six-slice spiral CT scanner. PCT consisted of a 25-sec series of two slices during intravenous administration of contrast medium. PCT studied a 2.4-cm slice of brain centered on the third ventricle, obtaining two consecutive 1.2-cm thick images corresponding to regions of the basal ganglia and main cerebral arteries. These brain slices were continuously scanned, acquiring two consecutive 1.2-cm thickness images during each cycle. A total of 10 cycles for each slice were acquired at a rate of one cycle every 2.4 seconds after the intravenous administration of an 80-mL bolus of contrast (Omnipaque 300\u2009mg/mL; General Electric,) into the cubital vein (18-gauge needle) at a flow rate of 4\u2009mL/sec. Image acquisition began 5\u2009sec after the injection of contrast. The acquisition parameters were 120 kvp and 80 mA using a 512\u2009\u00d7\u2009512 matrix. All images were analyzed using perfusion software developed by Philips (), which produces quantitative PCT data based on temporal changes in signal intensity during the first pass of a bolus of an iodinated contrast agent. This software relies on the central deconvolution principle to obtain different flow parameters. Deconvolution requires an operator to identify an artery and a vein.\nFour regions-of-interest (ROIs) were drawn on each hemisphere corresponding to white matter related to the territory of the major cerebral arteries (anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries [ACA, MCA, and PCA, respectively]), as well as to basal ganglia (BG). Measurements of the mean transient time (MTT), time to peak (TTP), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and cerebral blood flow (CBF) were performed in each ROI. An average value of the four ROIs of each hemisphere was calculated for every measurement (MTT, TTP, CBV and CBF). Each ROI was named according to the cerebral artery responsible for their irrigation (\nFig. 1\n). PCT quantitative data were obtained by two independent neuroradiologists who were unaware of the patients' clinical status.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nPerfusion computed tomography. Left: a slice centered on the third ventricle. Regions of interest are placed over brain parenchyma perfused by the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries (ACA, MCA, PCA), and basal ganglia (BG). An artery and vein are selected for software processing. Right: Cerebral brain perfusion map obtained with the partial deconvolution paradigm.\n\nTranscranial Doppler sonography\nAll patients were evaluated by transcranial Doppler sonography (TCDS) 1 week before and within 72\u2009h after cranioplasty. Every study was performed at the patients' bedside with the patient relaxed, and maintenance of a consistent environment was attempted (e.g., room temperature, humidity, visual stimuli, noise, etc.). In every study, both the MCA and internal carotid artery (ICA) were insonated first with the patient in the sitting position; then the patient was placed at the supine position for 5\u2009min, and the measurements were repeated.\nIn this study, we recorded TCDS measurements with a hand-held transducer in a range-gated, pulsed-wave mode at a frequency of 2-6\u2009MHz (ProSound Alpha 6, Aloka\n\u00ae\n;). The MCA was examined through the temporal window at a depth of 45-55\u2009mm using a 300-600 insonation angle with angle correction. We used the lowest setting for sample size and wall filter. Aliasing artifacts were eliminated by optimum baseline correction. After a frozen stable waveform was obtained, the peak systolic velocity (PSV), end diastolic velocity (EDV), and mean blood flow velocity (MV), as well as the pulsatility index (PI\u2009=\u2009PSV-EDV/MV) and resistance index (RI\u2009=\u2009PSV-EDV/PSV), which are automatically calculated by the transducer software, were obtained by cursor pointing. The ICA was insonated through the submandibular window at a depth of 40-60\u2009mm, and the PSV, EDV and MV were obtained. The Lindegaard ratio (LR\u2009=\u2009MCA-MV/ICA-MV) was calculated for both sides in the sitting and supine positions. For every value obtained, a variation value (\u0394\u2009=\u2009variation) was calculated by subtracting the value in the supine position from the value in the sitting position. For example, the LR variation was calculated as follows: \u0394LR\u2009=\u2009LR sitting \u2013 LR supine (\nFig. 2\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nDoppler studies are performed in the sitting position, then the patient is positioned supine and the measurements are repeated after 5\u2009min. The Lindegaard ratio (LR) is obtained in each position, and a variation value is calculated by subtracting the supine from the sitting values (\u0394LR\u2009=\u2009LR sitting \u2013 LR supine). The \u0394LR is greater in the defective side of patients who had neurological improvement. After the surgery, the variation is negligible on both sides.\n\nStatistical analysis\nSPSS\n\u00ae\nstatistical software (version 20.0;) was used for the data analysis. All TCD and PCT values are presented as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation. An unpaired\nt\n-test was used for parametric statistics analysis between quantitative parameters and the presence of objective clinical improvement; if the distribution did not allow the use of the\nt\n-test, a non-parametric test, such as the Mann-Whitney U test, was used. Comparisons of the changes between the groups were computed with Student's\nt\n-test. Associations with categorical variables were explored using either the \u03c7\n2\ntest or the Fisher's exact test (the latter when expected cell sizes were smaller than five). A bivariate correlation was used to investigate the relationship between the NIHSS improvement (as a continuous variable) and the quantitative parameters. Results with\np\n<\u20090.05 were considered to be statistically significant, whereas\np\n<\u20090.08 was considered to be a trend. A 95% confidence interval is given when considered appropriate.\nA multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent predictors for clinical objective improvement after cranioplasty using a binary logistic regression. Variables with significant\np\nvalues in univariate analyses, as well as pre-surgical variables, were considered to be independent variables in the multivariate analysis."

    "Methods": "Participants\nMale student-athletes from a National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I American-rules football program, noncollision collegiate sport athletes, and nonathletes were recruited for this study. Exclusion criteria included a past or current diagnosis of mood/anxiety disorders or alcohol/substance abuse, based on participant self-report. Concussion history was based on self-reported incidents of concussion that were medically diagnosed by a clinician at the time of injury.\nA total of 25 current or former football athletes with at least one self-reported incidence of a clinician-diagnosed concussion (Ath-mTBI) and 24 football athletes without a self-reported history of clinician-diagnosed concussion (Ath) were included for this study. One track and field athlete had a history of concussion and extensive football experience (9 years) and was included in the Ath-mTBI group. Complete resolution of symptoms from previous concussions as determined by clinicians trained in sports medicine was an additional inclusion criterion for athletes with a history of concussion. Twenty-seven male noncollision sport athletes and nonathletes with no self-reported history of concussion or football experience were enrolled as a HC group.\nAll participants provided written informed consent approved by a local Institutional Review Board.

T1-weighted anatomical images were collected using a parallelized magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence (MPRAGE) with sensitivity encoding and the following parameters for all participants: FOV\u2009=\u2009240\u2009mm, 130 axial slices, slice thickness\u2009=\u20091.1\u2009mm, image matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, voxel size 0.9375\u2009\u00d7\u20090.9375\u2009\u00d7\u20091.1\u2009mm, TR/TE\u2009=\u20095/1.948\u2009msec, acceleration factor R\u2009=\u20092 in the phase encoding direction, flip angle\u2009=\u20098 degrees, TI\u2009=\u2009725\u2009msec, sampling bandwidth\u2009=\u200931.25\u2009kHz, scan time\u2009=\u20095:05\u2009min.\nCortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation was performed using the FreeSurfer image analysis suite version 5.1.\n21\nThe total subcortical gray matter volume from the subcortical segmentation was used in subsequent analyses. An automated hippocampal segmentation algorithm available in the FreeSurfer software was used to estimate subfield volumes using Bayesian inference and a probabilistic hippocampal atlas based on\nin vivo\nmanual segmentations.\n22\nThis software estimates volumes of CA1, CA2-3, DG-CA4, pre-subiculum, subiculum, fimbria, hippocampal fissure, and a nonspecific hippocampal tail. The results for the smaller and less reliably segmented hippocampal fissure and fimbria and the nonspecific hippocampal tail subfield are not assessed individually here.\n22\n\nBlood collection and processing\nNonfasting afternoon blood was collected in two, 6\u2009mL K2 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid BD Vacutainer\u2122 tubes (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Blood was collected within 1 month of the scanning date, but on the same day of scanning for the majority of participants (see\nResults\n). Blood was centrifuged at 1300\u2009g for 10\u2009min at room temperature, and plasma was collected. Blood was then either aliquoted into microfuge tubes and stored at \u221280\u00b0C that day, or stored at 4\u00b0C overnight and then aliquoted into microfuge tubes and stored at \u221280\u00b0C the next morning (see\nSupplementary Information\n; see online supplementary material at\nftp.liebertpub.com\n). Frozen plasma samples were shipped overnight on dry ice to Brains Online (\nwww.brainsonline.org\n) for analysis of KYN metabolites. Concentrations of KYN, QUIN, 3HK, and KYNA in plasma samples were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) detection according to their standard protocols.\nBlood samples were not collected from all participants. One Ath was excluded from blood metabolite analyses because of a sinus infection necessitating medication, and one Ath-mTBI was excluded from blood analyses because of a nonhead injury at the time of blood draw.\n\nStatistics\nAll statistical analyses were performed in SYSTAT Version 13 (Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA). One-way analyses of variance were performed to determine whether age, education, subcortical gray matter volume, or body mass index (BMI) differed between groups. A two-tailed independent samples\nt\ntest was conducted to determine whether football groups differed in the years of tackle football experience.\nMultivariate analyses of covariance (MANCOVAs) were used to reduce the number of tests and control for false positives. Age was used as a covariate because of differences in age across groups and the developmental trajectory of hippocampal volume.\n23\nSeparate MANCOVAs were performed for left and right hippocampal subfield volumes (subiculum, pre-subiculum, CA1, CA2-3, DG-CA4), with total subcortical gray matter included as an additional covariate.\n24\n,\n25\nA MANCOVA, with age as a covariate, was performed to assess group differences in KYN pathway measures (KYN, QUIN, 3HK, KYNA, the ratio of KYNA to QUIN [KYNA/QUIN], and the ratio of KYNA to 3HK [KYNA/3HK]). Protected univariate analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were performed after significant (\np\n<\u20090.05) or trending toward significant (\np\n<\u20090.10) multivariate group effects. Hypothesis-based\na priori\nANCOVAs were performed for left and right CA2-3 and DG-CA4 volumes. Two-tailed planned contrasts of Ath-mTBI versus Ath, and both football athlete groups versus HCs were performed after significant or trending toward significant ANCOVAs.\nFinally, the association between hippocampal volume and KYN metabolites was assessed within each group using two-tailed Spearman rank correlation coefficients. To control for type I error, all subfield volumes from each hemisphere were summed into left and right total hippocampal volume and\na priori\ncorrelations focused on the correlation between left and right total hippocampal volumes with each KYN metabolite."

    "Methods": "Animals\nStudies were performed using young adult male\nC57Bl/6\nmice (3 months old, 22\u201326\u2009g), which were housed in the animal care facility at the University of Maryland School of Medicine under a 12\u2009h light-dark cycle, with\nad libitum\naccess to food and water. All surgical procedures were carried out in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\n\nCCI\nOur custom-designed CCI injury device consists of a microprocessor-controlled pneumatic impactor with a 3.5\u2009mm diameter tip.\nC57Bl/6\nmice were anesthetized with isoflurane evaporated in a gas mixture containing 70% N\n2\nO and 30% O\n2\nand administered through a nose mask (induction at 4% and maintenance at 2%). Depth of anesthesia was assessed by monitoring respiration rate and pedal withdrawal reflexes. Mice were placed on a heated pad, and core body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C. The head was mounted in a stereotaxic frame, and the surgical site was clipped and cleaned with Povodine-Iodine Prep pads (Professional Disposables International, Inc., Orangeburg, NY) and alcohol pads (Dukal Corporation, Ronkonkoma, NY). A 10-mm midline incision was made over the skull, the skin and fascia were reflected, and a 4-mm craniotomy was made on the central aspect of the left parietal bone. The impounder tip of the injury device was then extended to its full stroke distance (44\u2009mm), positioned to the surface of the exposed dura, and reset to impact the cortical surface. Moderate-level CCI was induced using an impactor velocity of 6\u2009m/sec and deformation depth of 2\u2009mm as previously described.\n20\nAfter injury, the incision was closed with interrupted 6-0 silk sutures, anesthesia was terminated, and the animal was placed into a heated cage to maintain normal core temperature for 45\u2009min post-injury. Sham animals underwent the same procedure as CCI mice except for the impact.\n\nStudy 1\nSham-injured (\nn\n=\u20097) and CCI (\nn\n=\u20095/time-point) mice were anesthetized (100\u2009mg/kg sodium pentobarbital, intraperitoneally [i.p.]) at 1\u2009h, 6\u2009h, 24\u2009h, 72\u2009h, and 7\u2009d post-injury and transcardially perfused with ice-cold 0.9% saline (100\u2009mL). Ipsilateral cortical tissue was rapidly dissected and snap-frozen on liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction.\n\nStudy 2\nSham-injured and CCI mice were anesthetized (100\u2009mg/kg sodium pentobarbital, i.p.) at 24\u2009h, 72\u2009h, and 7d post-injury and transcardially perfused with ice-cold 0.9% saline (100\u2009mL). Ipsilateral cortical tissue was rapidly dissected and processed for CD11b positive selection and flow cytometry analysis. Three independent experiments were performed with\nn\n=\u20093 per group per time-point.\n\nStudy 3\nSham-injured and CCI mice (\nn\n=\u20095/time-point) were anesthetized (100\u2009mg/kg sodium pentobarbital, i.p.) at 24\u2009h, 72\u2009h, and 7\u2009d post-injury and transcardially perfused with ice-cold 0.9% saline (100\u2009mL), followed by 300\u2009mL of 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose for histological analysis.\n\nStudy 4\nStarting at 24\u2009h post-injury, gp91ds-tat (5\u2009mg/kg) or equal concentration of ds-tat scrambled peptide (AnaSpec Inc. Fremont, CA) was delivered by intraperitoneal injection to moderate-level CCI mice (\nn\n=\u20098/group), with repeated intraperitoneal administrations at 48\u2009h and 72\u2009h post-injury. Dosing of gp91ds-tat was based on reported therapeutic effects in mice.\n21\nThe ds-tat scrambled- and gp91ds-tat-treated CCI mice were anesthetized (100\u2009mg/kg sodium pentobarbital, i.p.) at 7\u2009d post-injury and transcardially perfused with ice-cold 0.9% saline (100\u2009mL), followed by 300\u2009mL of 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose for histological analysis.\n\nReal-time PCR analysis\nTotal RNA was extracted from snap-frozen sham and TBI cortical tissue using a RNeasy isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with on-column DNase treatment (Qiagen). Complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis was performed on 1\u2009\u03bcg of total RNA using a Verso cDNA RT kit (Thermo Scientific, Pittsburg, PA); the protocols used were according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCR was performed using TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) on an ABI 7900 HT FAST Real Time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems). TaqMan assay IDs were as follows: inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), Mm00440502_mL; tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, Mm00443258_mL; arginase 1, Mm00475988_mL; Ym1, Mm00657889_mH; Fizz1, Mm00445109_mL; CD206, Mm00485148_mL; TGF\u03b2, Mm00441724_m1; SOCS3, Mm00545913_s1; IL12, Mm00434174_m1, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), Mm99999915_g1. A total of 20\u2009\u03bcL volume was added to each well (9\u2009\u03bcL cDNA, 1\u2009\u03bcL primer, and 10\u2009\u03bcL Taqman\n\u00ae\nUniversal PCR Master Mix; Applied Biosystems). Samples were assayed in duplicate in one run (40 cycles), which was composed of three stages, 50\u00b0C for 2\u2009min, 95\u00b0C for 10\u2009sec for each cycle (denaturation), and finally the transcription step at 60\u00b0C for 1\u2009min. Gene expression was calculated relative to the endogenous control sample (GAPDH) to determine relative expression values (2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct, where Ct is the threshold cycle).\n\nIsolation of CD11b-positive cells\nA magnetic-bead conjugated anti-CD11b antibody was used to isolated microglia/macrophages cells from ipsilateral brain tissue using MACS\n\u00ae\nseparation technology (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Ipsilateral cortical and hippocampal tissue from sham-injured and CCI mice was rapidly micro-dissected and a single-cell suspension was prepared using enzymatic digestion (Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit; Miltenyi Biotec) in combination with the gentle MACS dissociator. Tissue was processed immediately to remove myelin (Myelin Removal Beads II and LS column; Miltenyi Biotec), and CD11b-positive selection was performed using magnetic microbeads separation (CD11b Microbeads and MS column; Miltenyi Biotec). Briefly, tissue was incubated with CD11b microbeads and loaded onto a MS column placed in the magnetic field of a MACS separator. The negative fraction (flow through) was collected, the column washed three times with MACS buffer (Miltenyi Biotec), and CD11b-positive cells were eluted by removing the magnetic field. This procedure resulted in the isolation of approximately 93% viable CD11b-positve cells from sham-injured and TBI mice.\n\nCell staining and flow cytometry\nStaining of cell surface markers was performed as follows: CD11b-positive cells were resuspended in MACS buffer (Miltenyi Biotec), and stained using anti-mouse CD11b-APC (1:10; Miltenyi Biotec), CD45-FITC (1:10; Miltenyi Biotec), or anti-mouse CD206-APC (1:50; BioLegend, San Diego, CA) for 30\u2009min at 4\u00b0C in the dark. Control staining with appropriate matched isotype control antibodies (Biolegend) was performed. Cells were washed three times in 1\u2009mL of MACS buffer and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, and then flow cytometry analysis was performed as detailed below.\nFor intracellular staining CD11b-positive cells were incubated with protein transport inhibitor (BD Golgi Stop; BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) and fixation and permeabilization solutions (Cytofix/Cytoperm Kit; BD Biosciences). Briefly, CD11b-positive cells were resuspended in Golgi Stop solution and incubated for 1\u2009h at 37\u00b0C, washed three times in 1\u00d7 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), resuspended in Cytofix/Cytoperm solution and incubated for 20\u2009min on ice. Cells were washed in permeabilization and wash buffer (Perm/Wash Solution, BD Biosciences), and blocked with 10% goat serum and 20% fetal bovine serum (in perm/wash) for 30\u2009min at room temperature. Cells were then washed with perm/wash solution and resuspended in perm/wash solution containing anti-mouse iNOS (1:50; BD Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA), anti-mouse IL-12 (1:50; R&D Systems, MN), anti-mouse arginase 1 (1:50, BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-mouse Ym1 (1:50; Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, British Columbia), or anti-mouse TGF\u03b2 (1:50, Biolegend), and incubated for 1.5\u2009h at room temperature. Cells were washed with perm/wash solution, and incubated in perm/wash solution containing Alexa Fluor conjugated (488) secondary antibodies (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) for 20\u2009min at room temperature. Finally, cells were washed two times with 1\u2009mL of perm/wash solution, and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for flow cytometry analysis.\nFlow cytometry was performed using a BD FACSCanto II cytometer (BD Bioscience), and 20,000 events were recorded. Data was analyzed using FlowJo Software (v.X; TreeStar, Inc., Ashland, OR), and gating was determined based on appropriate negative isotype controls. SSC(A) and FSC(A) was used to identify mononuclear cell populations, and doublets/triplets were removed by SSC(A) and SSC(W) to yield single cell populations for subsequent analysis of M1/M2-like protein expression (MFI). In addition, cell populations were analyzed using SSC(W) (y axis) and M1/M2-like staining (x axis) to discriminate low versus high cell populations based on defined gates for sham-injured control samples.\n\nImmunofluorescence analysis\nFor semi-quantitative analysis, 20-\u03bcm coronal brain sections series from \u22121.70\u2009mm bregma position were selected and standard immunostaining techniques were employed. Briefly, 20-\u03bcm brain sections were washed three times with 1\u00d7 PBS, blocked for 1\u2009h in goat serum containing 0.4% Triton X-100, and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with a combination of primary antibodies, including rat anti-CD16/32 (1:1000, BD Biosciences), rabbit anti-TGF\u03b2 (1:500; Torrey Pines Biolabs Inc., Secaucus, NJ), rabbit anti-iNOS (1:400; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), goat anti-arginase 1 (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse anti-gp91\nphox\n(1:200; BD Transduction Laboratories), rat anti-CD68 (1:200; AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC), rabbit anti-Iba1 (1:200; Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA), rabbit anti-H2AX (1:2000; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO). Sections were washed three times with 1\u00d7 PBS and incubated with appropriate Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technologies) for 2\u2009h at room temperature. Sections were washed three times with 1\u00d7 PBS, counterstained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1\u2009\u03bcg/mL; Sigma, Dorset, UK), and mounted with glass coverslips using Hydromount solution (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA). Images were acquired using a fluorescent Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope (Nikon Instrument Inc., Melville, NY), at 10\u00d7 (Plan Apo 10X NA 0.45;) or 20\u00d7 (Plan APO 20X NA 0.75) magnification. Exposure times were kept constant for all sections in each experiment. All images were quantified using Nikon ND-Elements Software (AR 4.20.01), and co-localization of M1- and M2-like markers, as well as with gp91\nphox\nexpression was performed by binary operation intersection followed by thresholding. 6,000\u201310,000 positive cell body areas were quantified per mouse per experiment (\nn\n=\u20094), and expression levels were expressed as binary area per region of interest (ROI) \u00d710\n6\n.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nImmunohistochemistry was performed on 60\u2009\u03bcm coronal sections and standard immunostaining techniques were employed. Sections were incubated with anti-Iba-1 (1:1000; Wako Chemicals), overnight, washed in 1\u00d7 PBS (three times), and incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 2\u2009h at room temperature. Sections were incubated in avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase solution (Vectastain elite ABC kit; Vector Laboratories) for 1\u2009h and then reacted with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories) for color development and mounted for immunohistochemical analysis using a Leica DM4000B microscope (Leica Microsystems; Exton, PA).\n\nUnbiased stereological assessment of neuronal survival\nCresyl violet\u2013stained 60\u2009\u03bcm coronal sections were used for neuronal loss analysis. For TBI-induced cortex and hippocampal neuronal cell loss, the optical fractionator method of stereology was used as previously described.\n24\nBriefly, every fourth 60\u2009\u03bcm section between \u22121.22 and \u22122.54\u2009mm from bregma was analyzed beginning from a random start point (i.e., the section where different hippocampal subregions were distinctly visible). A total of five sections were analyzed. The optical dissector had a size of 50\u2009\u00d7\u200950\u2009\u03bcm in the x-axis and the y-axis, respectively, with a height of 10\u2009\u03bcm and a guard zone of 4\u2009\u03bcm from the top of the section. The sampled region for cortex and each hippocampal subregion was demarcated in the injured hemisphere and cresyl violet\u2013stained neuronal cell bodies were counted using Stereoinvestigator Software (MBF Biosciences, Williston, VT). For the cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) and CA3 subregions grid spacings of 75\u2009\u03bcm in the x-axis and 100\u2009\u03bcm in the y-axis were used, resulting in an area fraction of 1/12. For the dentate gyrus subregion, a grid spacing of 175\u2009\u03bcm in the x-axis and 100\u2009\u03bcm in the y-axis was used, resulting in an area fraction of 1/28. The volume of the cortex and hippocampal subfields was measured using the cavalieri estimator method with a grid spacing of 50\u2009\u03bcm. The estimated number of surviving neurons in each field was divided by the volume of the region of interest to obtain the cellular density expressed in counts/mm\n3\n. According to best stereologic practice, all stereologic probes were optimized to obtain a Gunderson coefficient of error (m\u2009=\u20091) value of less than 0.10 for the TBI tissue.\n\nStatistical analysis\nReal-time PCR, flow cytometry, image analysis, and stereological data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by\npost hoc\nadjustments using Student-Newman-Keuls test, and were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism Program, Version 3.02 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). A\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "General study design\nThe present study included data from 45 subjects with mild to severe TBI and 45 age- and sex-matched control subjects with no TBI. During a first 2-h session, all subjects underwent imaging (MRSI) and completed a neuropsychological evaluation. Only the control subjects recruited in the latter part of the study (\nn\n=\u200921) were assessed with respect to cognitive function, anxiety, depression, and apathy. During a second 1-h session, only TBI subjects completed a structured pain history interview including pain-relevant psychosocial measures. The data presented in this article represent a subset of data focused on pain and are part of a larger study approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine in Miami, Florida.\n\nParticipants\nFifty-one subjects with a mild to severe TBI were recruited from persons presenting to the Jackson Memorial Hospital Emergency Department or admitted to Jackson Memorial Hospital after a closed head injury. Further inclusion criteria included a modified Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 6 to 15 on admission, a loss of consciousness, and standard MRI prescreening clearance. The GCS score at the time of admission to the trauma center, loss of consciousness as recorded by paramedic personnel and reported to the trauma center or at the time of admission to the trauma center, cause of injury (e.g., motor vehicle accident, fall), medical history, and medication data were taken from the subjects' medical chart.\nGCS scores were used to classify the subject as having mild (between 13 and 15), moderate (between 9 and 12), or severe TBI (between 3 and 8). Subjects with a history of previous TBI, psychiatric illness, or neurological disease, an inability to undergo a 3 Tesla (3T) MRI scan or neuropsychological evaluation were excluded.\nOf this sample, two subjects withdrew and four did not provide useful MRS data, because of motion artifacts, or other essential data. Of the remaining 45 subjects, the modes of injury were 25 motor vehicle accidents as occupants, 9 assaults (three struck on the head with an object), 6 struck by a motor vehicle while a pedestrian or swimmer, 3 struck by objects not involving an assault, and 2 falls.\nAll control (non-TBI) subjects included in this study were recruited from the same local community as that of the subjects with TBI. We used the same standards to clear these subjects for MRI. Exclusion criteria applied to this group included previous head injury or surgery, history of epilepsy or a seizure disorder, neurodegenerative (e.g., Alzheimer, Parkinson) and neurological (e.g., cancer, stroke, multiple sclerosis) diseases, regular use of hard drugs of abuse (e.g., cocaine, heroin), current and long-term heavy alcohol use, taking medication for a psychiatric problem (e.g., depression), chronic liver disease, and HIV+ status.\n\nMRI and MRS\nMR data were acquired at 3T (Siemens, Tim-Trio), using eight-channel phased-array detection. The protocol included a T1-weighted MRI with 1-mm isotropic resolution (magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo sequence, echo time [TE]/repetition time [TR]\u2009=\u20094.43/2150\u2009msec, 160 slices). Volumetric MRSI data were obtained using a spin-echo acquisition with selection of a 135-mm slab covering the cerebrum and cerebellum, echo-planar readout with 1000 spectral sample points, and a spectral bandwidth of 1250\u2009Hz, TR/TE\u2009=\u20091710/70\u2009msec, spatial sampling of 50\u2009\u00d7\u200950\u2009\u00d7\u200918 points over 280\u2009\u00d7\u2009280\u2009\u00d7180\u2009mm\n3\n, and an acquisition time of 26\u2009min.\nData were processed in a fully automated manner using the MIDAS package\n48\nto provide metabolite images for NAA, Cr, choline, and their ratios, with a 1\u2009mL resultant voxel volume. Processing included signal intensity normalization of individual metabolite images to institutional units (IU) using tissue water as a reference, and correction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) partial volume based on tissue segmentation of the T1-weighted MRI. All images were then spatially registered to a T1-MRI template in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space\n49\nand interpolated to 2-mm isotropic voxels. Additional details of the processing have been reported previously.\n50\nThe T1-MRI images were segmented into WM, GM, and CSF maps using FSL/FAST,\n51\nwhich were converted to SI resolution and, together with the spectral-fit metabolite maps, were registered to a T1-MRI template in MNI space.\n49\nA modified atlas\n52\nin the MNI space was then used to obtain mean values of the MRS measures over left and right sides of the insula, anterior, mid-, and posterior cingulum, and the thalamus. For cortical regions, the relative GM volume fraction (GM\nvol\n/[GM\nvol\n+WM\nvol\n+CSF\nvol\n]) was also calculated to determine the relationship between decreased NAA concentrations and GM because NAA concentrations are higher in GM.\n53\n\nNeuropsychological examination\nThe Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination, 2nd edition, standard version (MMSE-2)\n54\nis a brief mental status screen that assesses Orientation, Registration and Recall, Attention and Calculation, Language (Naming, Repetition, Three-Stage Command), Reading, Writing, and Copying. It is a widely used, well validated, and reliable measure for individuals 18 years of age and older. The MMSE-2 was used to detect gross cognitive impairments. A score \u226525 (out of 30) was considered normal cognition. The cut score is adjusted for educational attainment and age.\n\nAssessment of pain and psychosocial factors\nDemographic factors and pain history\nIn addition to standard demographic information\u2014e.g., age, sex, mode of injury etc.\u2014a standard pain history with an anatomical drawing was used to obtain information regarding the subject's pain experience (i.e., each pain's location, onset relative to TBI, temporal pattern, quality, severity, and any medications taken for relief). In addition to the pain history, the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI)\n55\nand the Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI)\n56\nwere obtained. All measures were obtained via interviews by trained staff.\nNPSI\nThe NPSI\n55\nassesses average severity in the previous 24\u2009h of 10 descriptors associated with neuropathic pain using a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale. These reflect spontaneous ongoing and paroxysmal pain, evoked pain (i.e., mechanical and thermal allodynia/hyperalgesia), and dysesthesia/paresthesia. Subscores are calculated to allow discrimination and quantification of five distinct and clinically relevant dimensions of neuropathic pain.\nA total intensity score can also be calculated by summation of the 10 descriptor responses (maximum score of 100); the two temporal items are not scored. The five subscales are scored by taking the arithmetic mean of the subscale's constituent item responses\u2014e.g., the evoked pain subscore is the mean of the three severities of pain that are provoked or increased by: (1) brushing, (2) pressure, and (3) contact with cold on painful areas (maximum subscore of 10). The NPSI has been shown to be both valid and reliable.\n55\nThe NPSI subscores were used to cluster subjects into subgroups.\nMPI\nThe MPI\n56\nis a comprehensive psychometric instrument designed to assess pain and a range of self-reported behavioral and psychosocial factors associated with chronic pain. Responses are given on a numerical rating scale ranging from 0 to 6. The MPI consists of three sections: Pain Impact, Perceived Social Support, and Activities, consisting of 52 scored items from which 12 subscales are obtained\u2014e.g., the Pain Impact section has 20 items and 5 subscales: PS, Life Interference (LI), Affective Distress (AD), Life Control, and Support. All subscales are scored by taking the arithmetic mean of the constituent item responses (maximum subscore of 6). For example, the PS subscore is the mean of three items relating to: (1) present overall severity, (2) average overall severity in the past week, and (3) suffering due to pain.\nThree of the MPI Pain Impact subscales were used to compare potential neuropathic pain subgroups: PS, LI, and AD. These specific subscales were selected to reflect the key domains recommended by the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) group.\n57\nBeck Depression Inventory, 2nd edition (BDI-II)\nThe BDI-II\n58\nassesses the severity of depressive symptoms in adolescents and adults based on\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,\n4th edition, criteria. The BDI-II is a 21-item self-report multiple-choice questionnaire that asks subjects to rate depressive symptoms on a scale of 0 to 3 based on how they have been feeling over the past 2 weeks, with increasing scores reflecting greater symptomatology. This instrument is widely used in clinical and research settings as a brief screen for depression and has been validated for use in a number of populations, including college students,\n58\nclinically depressed outpatients,\n58\n,\n59\nand those with neuropathic pain.\n60\nInternal consistencies (0.86 for psychiatric patients and 0.81 for nonpsychiatric patients) are good and test-retest reliability is greater than 0.60.\n61\nScores over 13 indicate the presence of clinically significant symptoms. Scores ranging between 14 and 19 are rated as mild depression, 20\u201328 as moderate depression, and scores between 29 and 63 are rated as severe depression. We used the BDI-II as an external validator to confirm the validity of the TBI neuropathic subgroups.\nBeck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)\nThe BAI\n62\nis a 21-item self-report multiple-choice questionnaire that asks subjects to rate their anxiety symptoms based on how they have been feeling over the past week. The BAI was designed to assess emotional, physiological, and cognitive symptoms of anxiety. It has been shown to be a useful screening measure for anxiety and able to discriminate between depressive and anxious symptoms. Similar to the BDI-II, it uses a 0 to 3 rating scale, with higher scores reflecting greater levels of anxiety. Scores over 8 are considered to be clinically significant with 8\u201315 rated as mild anxiety, 16\u201325 as moderate anxiety, and 26\u201363 as severe anxiety. The BAI is widely used in both adolescents\n63\nand adults\n64\nincluding those with intellectual disabilities.\n65\nThe internal consistency is excellent (\u03b1\u2009=\u2009.92) with test-retest reliability (r\u2009=\u20090.75).\n66\nApathy Evaluation Scale, self-rated version (AES-S)\nThe AES-S\n67\nis a self-rating measure of apathy symptoms consisting of 18 questions in which a person describes his or her thoughts, feelings, and actions during the past 4 weeks. Items are scored as \u201cNot at all\u201d (1 point), \u201cSlightly\u201d (2 points), \u201cSomewhat\u201d (3 points), and \u201cA lot\u201d (4 points). The AES-S may be used in adolescent and adult populations. Cut scores vary between studies depending on the clinical sample; however, it is generally accepted to be two standard deviations above the mean\u2014i.e., 36.5\u201337.5, for the self-rated version.\n67\n,\n68\n\nStatistical analysis\nA two-step cluster procedure was used to define homogeneous subgroups or \u201cclusters\u201d inherent in the data set based on the NPSI subscores. The two-step clustering procedure has been previously used and described in more detail in previous work.\n69\nThe number of clusters was automatically determined by the IBM SPSS Statistics 22 for Windows default criterion (Schwarz Criterion).\n70\nOnce the number of clusters was determined, these were compared with respect to NPSI subscores, NAA/Cr concentrations, pain measures, demographics, and psychological/neuropsychological measures to define and externally validate the clusters.\nIndependent\nt\ntests, chi-squares, and Pearson correlations were used to determine pairwise differences and correlations. A hierarchical linear regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between the NAA and PS and the potential influence of age, sex, days since injury, and insular GM volume. Statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS 22 for Windows. A probability of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Experimental design\nAll research involving use of male C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories Inc., Wilmington, MA) and C57BL/6Ai-[KO] Inos N12 (iNOS KO) mice (Taconic, Germantown, NY)\n31\nat approximately 8 weeks of age was approved and monitored by the Thomas Jefferson University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee to assure compliance with the provisions of federal regulations and the National Institute of Health's \u201dGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\u201d All animals were housed under a 12-hour light/dark cycle in the Thomas Jefferson University (Philadelphia, PA), Laboratory Animal Services Facility (Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care accredited). All animals underwent a 1-week period of acclimation after arriving at Thomas Jefferson University animal facility before handling.\nSixty wild-type (WT) male mice were randomly assigned to CCI injury (\nn\n=\u200944) or incision-only controls (\nn\n=\u200916) groups for a 3-day or 2-week study endpoint (\nFig. 1\n). There were two experimental arms for the CCI groups: 1) pharmacological modulation and 2) genetic modulation. In the pharmacological modulation study arm, CCI groups were randomly assigned to receive vehicle (\nn\n=\u200920), sumatriptan (\nn\n=\u200912), or MK8825 (\nn\n=\u200912). In the genetic modulation study arm, CCI or incision control procedures were performed in iNOS KO mice (\nn\n=\u200911) and compared to WT CCI mice (\nn\n=\u200914) at either a 3- or 14-day endpoint. Na\u00efve WT and iNOS KO were also included as controls (\nn\n=\u20094). The incision control group received a skin incision without craniotomy for CCI because craniotomy results in transient cutaneous and dural hypersensitivity, neuroinflammation, and increases in CGRP, indicating a mild tissue injury.\n8\n,\n32\n,\n33\nIn order to determine whether a treatment returns an outcome measure to \u201cnormal levels,\u201d an incision control group was necessary for this study. All groups underwent behavioral testing and tissue assessments for respective outcomes, as described below. To test the effects of CGRP on iNOS, iNOS messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein synthesis were assessed for the pharmacologic arm because MK8825 and sumatriptan inhibit the actions of CGRP. To test the effects of iNOS on CGRP, CGRP levels were assessed in iNOS knockouts and WT with CCI.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExperimental design diagram shows group assignment, treatment, and outcomes along with the experimental paradigm, including endpoints. There were two experimental arms for the CCI groups: 1) pharmacological modulation and 2) genetic modulation. In the pharmacological modulation study arm, CCI groups were randomly assigned to receive vehicle, sumatriptan, or MK8825. In the genetic modulation study arm, CCI or incision control procedures were performed in iNOS KO mice and compared to wild-type CCI mice with either a 3- or 14-day endpoint. Na\u00efve wild-type and iNOS KO were also included as controls. All groups underwent behavioral testing and tissue assessments for respective outcomes. To test the effects of CGRP on iNOS, iNOS mRNA and protein synthesis were assessed for the pharmacologic arm because MK8825 and sumatriptan inhibit the actions of CGRP. To test the effects of iNOS on CGRP, CGRP levels were assessed in iNOS knockouts and wild-type with CCI. CCI, controlled cortical injury; CGRP, calcitonin gene-related peptide; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; KO, knockout; mRNA, messenger RNA; TNC, trigeminal nucleus caudalis.\nAll behavioral tests and euthanasia occurred between the hours of 9\nam\nand 12\npm\n. Animals were allowed to recover from anesthesia and kept in separate cages postoperatively with unrestricted food and water. Animals were euthanized with isoflurane overdose for postmortem analysis and cervical dislocation\n\nSurgical procedure\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI) was induced in mice using a mild CCI injury model as described previously by our laboratory.\n8\n,\n9\n,\n34\u201336\nAnimals were anesthetized with isoflurane (3% induction; 2\u20132.5% maintenance), and body temperature was maintained at 37+ 0.5\u00b0C. A right-sided, 4-mm craniotomy at 1.0\u2009mm posterior to bregma exposing the right somatosensory cortex was performed. CCI was induced using an electromagnetic stereotaxic impactor (Leica Biosystems Richmond, formerly MyNeuroLab, Richmond, IL) at 1.0-mm depth and 3.0-m/sec velocity (100-ms contact time) at an impact angle perpendicular to the cortical surface. Duration of surgery was approximately 20\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009min plus 5\u2009min for induction. To control for the effects of anesthesia, incision controls were kept under anesthesia for approximately the same duration (20\u2009min) as experimental animals. Postinjury, the bone flap was replaced, sealed with permanent cyanoacrylate-based fast-acting adhesive, and the skin sutured. A single dose of short-acting buprenorphine (0.05\u2009mg/kg; subcutaneous injection) was administered before removal from isoflurane to facilitate postoperative recovery.\n\nTreatments\nWT mice were treated with a 100-\u03bcL intraperioteneal injection of either sumatriptan (1\u2009mg/kg; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), a CGRP antagonist (MK8825; 100\u2009mg/kg in 0.9% NaCl; Merck and Co. Inc., Summit, NJ), or vehicle (0.9% NaCl; Ricca Chemical Company, Arlington, TX). MK8825 is a rat-specific CGRP receptor antagonist with suitable potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetics to clarify the\nin vivo\neffect of the CGRP receptor.\n37\nSumatriptan is a migraine therapeutic, a serotonin (5-HT1) agonist, and reduces the release of CGRP from trigeminal ganglia neurons.\n38\n,\n39\nDoses for MK8825\n37\nand sumatriptan\n28\n,\n40\nwere selected based on the literature and pilot studies in our laboratory. Treatments were administered on 2 consecutive days in postoperative week 2, on days 13 and 14 before euthanasia. The 2-week delayed time point for treatment administrations was selected to allow local tissue ischemia to resolve considering the potential for cerebral vasoconstriction elicited by sumatriptan and a CGRP antagonist. Treatment administration at week 2 post-injury was also selected for clinically relevance given time to see the headache symptomology persist beyond the first week of injury, and in consideration of the fact that there may be a narrow therapeutic window to prevent the chronification of PTH. On the day of euthanasia, a final treatment dose of either vehicle, or the experimental drug, was given at 1\u2009h before behavior testing and approximately 2\u2009h before euthanasia procedures for either enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay/quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (ELISA/qRT-PCR) or immunohistochemistry (IHC).\n\nvon Frey mechanical allodynia testing\nCutaneous sensory testing with von Frey monofilaments were used to measure allodynia\u2014a painful response characterized by cutaneous hypersensitivity to a mechanical stimulus that is otherwise innocuous under normal conditions. von Frey sensory testing is a validated method to test for allodynia in humans and rodents to evaluate sensory changes after central nervous system injury.\n41\nThe periorbital region was tested in this study because this region is innervated by the ophthalmic (V1) division of the trigeminal nerve and trigeminal allodynia is implicated in headache disorders. Periorbital allodynia was correlated with persistent increases in CGRP post-CCI in mice\n8\n,\n9\nand has been a useful outcome reported for patients with PTH and migraine.\n5\u20137\nA trained technician performed von Frey (North Coast Medical Inc., Gilroy, CA) testing blinded to experimental conditions. Testing was performed during the morning daylight portion of their circadian cycle (9\nam\nto 12\npm\n), as described previously.\n8\n,\n9\nA universal plastic tube rodent restraint was used for periorbital testing in which mice entered in a gentle guided, unforced manner; there was a 5-min acclimation period to the test chamber. Animals that show signs of excessive stress, such as prolonged (>5-min acclimation period) biting or clawing at restraint, vocalization, or baseline allodynia were to be omitted from periorbital testing. Note to readers: When using restraint to test mice, handling before testing is of utmost importance to prevent meeting the exclusion criteria. Periorbital thresholds (grams) were determined by applying the von Frey monofilaments over the rostral portion of the eyes distal from the suture site for five stimulations bilaterally. The smallest force that elicited a limb withdrawal was considered the threshold force. The filament must make firm perpendicular contact with the skin causing the filament to bend, thereby producing a precise bending force as calibrated by the manufacturer. A positive response for testing was characterized by the following: vigorous forepaw strokes of face; head withdrawal from the stimulus; or head shaking. Force thresholds were defined as greater than a 60% (3 of 5) response frequency for a von Frey stimulus.\nThe normal baseline thresholds for mice determined from our previous studies include 0.07 and 0.16.\n9\nvon Frey forces that induce a positive response in the ophthalmic trigeminal zone in na\u00efve mice are typically lower (<1.0\u2009g), compared to that of rats (<10\u2009g).\n8\n,\n9\nAllodynia was defined as a reduction in threshold below baseline \u22640.04\u2009g because mice normally do not respond at this stimulation force. The goal of treatments in this study was to alleviate allodynia as shown by an increase in threshold. In general, for a change in threshold to be considered significant, there should be a change in threshold of\nat least\ntwo steps in filament grade; for example, moving from 0.02 to 0.04\u2009g (one filament) would not qualify as a significant change, whereas moving from 0.02 to 0.07\u2009g would be considered significant.\n9\n\nPhotosensitivity testing\nTesting for photosensitivity was adapted from methods by Russo and colleagues in which aversion to bright light has been shown in mice overexpressing CGRP receptors.\n10\n,\n42\nMice were acclimated for at least 1\u2009h in their cages with the lights on (\u223c400 lux inside the cage). The light-dark test apparatus consists of an open-topped rectangular plexiglass box divided into a small (27\u2009\u00d7\u200928\u2009\u00d7\u200919\u2009cm) and a large (45\u2009\u00d7\u200929\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u2009cm) compartment with an entryway/opening (8\u2009\u00d7\u20098\u2009cm) located in between the two compartments. The small compartment is black, whereas the large compartment is white plexiglass illuminated with either ambient ceiling lighting at approximately 400 lux, or with an additional bright light of approximately 4000 lux measured using a Digital Light Level Meter LX1010B Illuminance Meter (SF Cable, Inc., Hayward, CA). Average light intensity for normal office spaces is estimated to be 500 lux, whereas full daylight to sunlight conditions can range from 1000 to 10,000 lux or greater.\nEach test session begins with the mice placed in the center of the light compartment facing away from the opening and allowed to explore for 5\u2009min. Mice are tracked and behaviors, including time spent in the light compartment, the number of transitions between the light and dark compartment, and the number of rears, were recorded and analyzed using the ANY-maze\n\u2122\nsoftware (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL). In separate experiments, an ambient light trial was included to distinguish between photosensitivity and anxiety behaviors post-TBI. Two testing sessions of an ambient light and a subsequent bright light session were separated by a 15- to 20-min break in between sessions. Mice have stereotyped behavior of spending more time in the dark compared to light, which becomes more pronounced when anxious based on the concept that rodents find novel environments and large, open spaces stressful or anxiety provoking. The ambient light test was included as the first session of the test to determine the presence of anxiety. The bright light test was conducted second, once mice had acclimated under ambient conditions, reducing novelty and making the chamber less stressful.\n\nEnzyme-linked immunoassay for calcitonin gene-related peptide\nAfter mice were euthanized with overdose of isoflurane and cervical dislocation, fresh frozen specimens of brainstem tissues were rapidly created in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Brainstems were sectioned according to the mouse brain atlas by Frankin and Paxinos (\u22125.8 to \u22128.2\u2009mm bregma) to include the spinal trigeminal nucleus (i.e., trigeminal nucleus caudalis; TNC). All brainstem samples were homogenized and unpooled with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid\u2013free complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablets using 50\u2009\u03bcL/10\u2009mg of tissue (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Homogenates were centrifuged at 14,000\u2009rpm for 15\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. Total protein content for each sample was determined using BCA-200 protein assays (bicinchoninic acid [BCA]; Pierce, Rockford, IL). Tissue lysates were analyzed for CGRP according to the manufacturer's protocol (CGRP Elisa Kit, catalog no.: 589001; Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI). Each sample was run in duplicate and data (pg CGRP protein) was normalized to milligrams total protein, then reported as fold change above control levels. MK8825 was not included in the CGRP ELISA as treatment with MK8825 because it was not expected to reduce the CGRP levels in the TNC; the CGRP antagonist mechanism of action works by blocking the CGRP receptors and this was confirmed by our lab with pilot data.\n\nQuantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction\nThe pellets from ELISA samples were used for RNA isolation. Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) with iScript reverse transcriptase (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and then measured by qRT-PCR with gene-specific primers and probes.\n88\nThe sequences of the primers were: L13 forward, 5\u2032-AGATTGGCCGGACTCCCTAC-3\u2032; L13 reverse, 5\u2032-AGTATCATGCCATTCCGGCT-3\u2032; iNOS forward, 5\u2032-AACCCAAGGTCTACGTTCAGG-3\u2032; iNOS reverse, 5\u2032-TGGCCACCAGCTTCTTCAAT-3\u2032. All primers were run using an annealing temperature of 59\u00b0C. SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix and the C1000 Thermal Cycler real-time detection system were also used for quantification (Bio-Rad). Thermal cycle conditions were: 3\u2009min at 95\u00b0C; 40 cycles (15\u2009sec at 95\u00b0C, 30\u2009sec at 59\u00b0C, and 30\u2009sec at 72\u00b0C); and a melt curve from 55 to 95\u00b0C at 0.5\u00b0C increments. All samples were run in triplicate and compared to cDNA gene standards to determine copy numbers, which were normalized to the copy number of each sample's housekeeping gene (L13).\n\nImmunohistochemical analysis and cell counting\nIsoflurane euthanized mice were treated with heparinized saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) treatment. Brains and trigeminal ganglia were postfixed in 4% PFA for 24\u2009h then transferred to 30% sucrose for storage. Frozen sections were cut coronally with a cryostat at \u221224\u00b0C (20-\u03bcm thickness) and air dried overnight. Sections \u22122.0 to \u22122.5\u2009mm to bregma were used to assess the meningeal changes, whereas sections \u22125.8 to \u22128.4\u2009mm to bregma were used for the TNC. Tissues were incubated in 10% normal goat serum in 0.3% Triton-100 for 30\u2009min. Alternate sections were labeled using the following primary antibodies overnight at room temperature: rabbit anti-CGRP (1:200; Sigma-Aldrich); rabbit anti-iNOS (1:100; Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY); rabbit IBA-1 (1:250; Wako, Richmond, VA); rabbit glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:200; Millipore, Billerica, MA); and rabbit NeuN (1:1000; Millipore). Slides were incubated in fluorescent secondary antibodies DyLight 488\u2013 or 549\u2013conjugated AffiniPure Goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) (diluted 1:100 in 1\u00d7 phosphate-buffered saline) for 2 hours at room temperature. 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen Life Science, Carlsbad, CA) mounting media was applied to visualize the nucleus for cell counting. Negative control staining was performed by omitting the primary antibodies. Each IHC experiment includes both controls and experimental groups processed at the same time to control for variability with processing.\nStereological methods were used to count cells positive for iNOS or CGRP in trigeminal ganglia cells (right trigeminal ganglia ipsilateral to injury only) by an observer blinded to experimental conditions. Cell counts were measured using a Nikon NIU microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) at a 20\u00d7 objective for three sampling frames (100\u2009\u03bcm\n2\neach frame) from two serial sections for each animal (six total counting frames).\n43\nA grid overlay was used to count cells, and only cells with a DAPI-labeled nucleus were counted per frame. When capturing images, exposure times were held constant between specimens and cells with fluorescent staining selected using the thresholding tool from Nis-Elements software (Nikon). All six frames per section were averaged and are reported as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) number of iNOS-positive ganglia cells. For CGRP cell counts, mean percentage of CGRP-positive cells \u00b1 SD out of all cells in the ganglia were reported. Although bilateral changes were observed in the trigeminal ganglia and TNC, only the right side (ipsilateral to the injury) was included in the analysis with the exception of the side comparisons for CGRP\nQuantification of CGRP percent immunoreactivity was performed, as described previously, by our laboratory.\n8\n,\n44\nBriefly, the ophthalmic (V1) region of the TNC was imaged using a Nikon NIU microscope and a 20\u00d7 objective in which three frames from three sections were captured for two sections per animal. When capturing images, exposure times were held constant as was done for cell counting. Threshold parameters were set to select the immunofluorescent CGRP product while omitting the background using the Nis-Elements software (Nikon) slider tools. The pre-set threshold levels were held constant for measuring pixels counts for both control and experimental groups to avoid experimenter bias. The total number of pixels was then measured by selecting all the pixels in the region of interest to ensure consistent sampling between specimens. Percent immunoreactivity was calculated as the measured threshold CGRP immunofluorescent product in pixels divided by the total pixels in the V1 region of interest. Percent immunoreactivity for the six sampling frames (two sections \u00d7 three frames) were averaged and are reported as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD.\n\nStatistical analysis\nTo determine the group effects on mechanical von Frey thresholds and histological outcomes, one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used at matched time points. ANOVAs were followed by Bonferroni's post-hoc tests for multiple comparisons with adjusted\np\nvalues. A Student's\nt\n-test was used to determine side differences for von Frey thresholds. All data were analyzed using the GraphPad Prism 5 statistical program (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). Significance levels were set at\np <\n0.05 for all statistical analyses, adjusted\np\nvalues are reported, and data are reported as the mean and standard error of the mean."

    "Methods": "Animal subjects\nA total of 26 female Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Hollister, CA) were used for this study, age 84 days (range 83\u201386 days) at the initiation. Rats were housed individually in cages and maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle. All animals had\nad libitum\naccess to food and water. All animal experiments were conducted after approval by the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee of University of California, San Francisco, and were performed in compliance with National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines and recommendations.\n\nAnimal surgery procedures and post-operative care\nSurgeries were performed with aseptic technique under deep anesthesia induced and maintained by inhalation of isoflurane (IsoFlow; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL; 2\u20133%). Anesthetic plane was assessed with foot pinch. Lacrilube ophthalmic ointment (Allergan Pharmaceuticals, Irvine, CA) was applied to the eyes before surgery. Body temperature monitoring during surgery was performed with a rectal thermal probe and maintained at 37.5\u00b0C using a heating pad.\nEB injection\nFollowing induction of anesthesia, dorsal laminectomies were performed at the C4-C5 vertebral levels. The dura was carefully opened transversely at two sites 2\u2009mm apart along the craniocaudal axis. Unilateral stereotactic injection (1 uL/injection at each coordinate depth) of 0.1\u2009mg/mL EB was delivered at pre-defined coordinates targeting the lateral funiculus (1.2\u2009mm lateral to midline and depths of 0.9 and 1.2-mm) at two separate craniocaudal locations 2\u2009mm apart based on stereotactic coordinates derived from a rat neuroanatomical atlas. EB injections were performed using custom-pulled and beveled glass micropipettes attached to a picospritzer.\n24\n,\n25\nThe wound was closed in anatomical layers and analgesic (buprenorphine, 0.05\u2009mg/kg [Buprenex]; Hospira, Inc., Lake Forest, IL) along with antibiotic (Cefazolin, 50\u2009mg/kg; Henry Schein, Melville, NY) were administered.\nCervical hemi-contusion\nFollowing induction of anesthesia, dorsal laminectomy was performed at C5. Unilateral 100 kdyne contusion injuries were produced using the Infinite Horizon Impactor (Precision Systems and Instrumentation LLC, Fairfax, VA) with a modified impactor tip 2\u2009mm in diameter. Injury severity was severe (100 kilodynes). Wound closure and postoperative care were performed as for EB surgeries.\n\nIn vivo\nMRI\nIn vivo\nMRI was performed using a 7 Tesla Varian narrow-bore MRI system (Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) with 60 mT/m gradient insert. A custom-made receiver coil designed for the rat cervical spine was used. All MRI was performed with respiratory gating. Scout images were obtained to confirm alignment of the cervical spinal cord reference frame (from C2-C7 vertebral segments) with the MRI reference frame. In some cases, padding was placed along the ventral aspect of the neck to straighten the cervical lordosis and align the spinal cord with the magnetic reference frame. For diffusion-weighted imaging, a Stejskal-Tanner spin-echo multi-slice sequence with gradients applied in three separate orthogonal orientations matching the \u201cx\u201d (1, 0, 0), \u201cy\u201d (0, 1, 0), and \u201cz\u201d (0, 0, 1) axes of the main magnetic field were performed. A b value of approximately 890\u2009sec/mm2 was applied for diffusion in the \u201cx\u201d and \u201cy\u201d planes, while a b value of approximately 400\u2009sec/mm\n2\nwas used in the \u201cz\u201d plane. Lower b value in the \u201cz\u201d axis was used to maintain signal-to-noise ratio. A T2-weighted sequence with no gradient application served as the B0 image (0, 0, 0). Additional imaging parameters included a repetition time\u2009=\u2009\u223c2000 msec (variable, dependent upon respiratory rate), echo time\u2009=\u200935 msec, and field of view\u2009=\u20092.56\u2009cm\n2\n, with 128\u2009\u00d7\u2009128 matrix for in-plane resolution of 200\u2009\u03bcm. Slice thickness was 1.5\u2009mm.\nADC values in the longitudinal (D\u2225) and transverse (D\u22a5) gradient directions were calculated based on the degree of signal attenuation of the diffusion-weighted sequence, compared with the B0 sequence, according to the mono-exponential\nequation (1)\nwhere D\u2009=\u2009apparent diffusion coefficient, S0\u2009=\u2009signal without diffusion-sensitizing gradients (b\u2009=\u20090), Sn\u2009=\u2009signal with diffusion sensitizing gradient applied, and b\u2009=\u2009b value. D\u2225 was calculated directly from gradients applied in the \u201cz\u201d axis while D\u22a5 was calculated as the mean average of ADC with gradients applied in the \u201cx\u201d and \u201cy\u201d planes (D\u22a5\u2009=\u2009[Dx + Dy]/2). As previously described,\n26\nan AI based on directional ADCs was derived according to\nequation (2)\nFor acute EB lesions, manual region-of-interest (ROI) was drawn to approximate the area of T2-weighted signal hyperintensity in the lateral funiculus at the injury epicenter as identified on the B0 and diffusion-weighted image with longitudinal gradient orientation (z-axis;\nFig. 1\n). ROI analysis at levels cranial and caudal to the injury epicenter were selected to match the location in the transverse cord plane of epicenter signal abnormality, with utilization of identical sized ROI used at the epicenter. For chronic EB lesions, no appreciable residual T2 hyperintensity was evident in any animal; therefore, ROIs were selected at the level of the laminectomy at the stereotactic targeted sites.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nIn vivo\ndiffusion magnetic resonance imaging of the normal adult rat cervical spinal cord. Axial T2\n(A)\n, DWI-\u2225\n(B)\n, and DWI-\u22a5\n(C)\nimages are shown with excellent gray\u2013white matter contrast appreciated on the diffusion-weighted images. Calculated ADC maps for D\u2225\n(D)\n, D\u22a5\n(E)\n, and AI\n(F)\nat the same level also are shown. Dashed oval in F approximates the area of the lateral funiculus sampled for measurements in control and injury models. DWI-\u2225, longitudinal diffusion-weighted image; DWI-\u22a5, transverse diffusion-weighted image; ADC, apparent diffusion coefficient; D\u2225, longitudinal apparent diffusion coefficient; D\u22a5, transverse apparent diffusion coefficient; AI, anisotropy.\nFor the hemi-contusion lesion, similar sized ROI as utilized for EB lesions were used to sample T2-hyperintense regions of the lateral funiculus at the injury epicenter. Care was taken to not include regions of T2-hypointense signal (which was largely confined to gray matter) in the ROI so as not to sample hemorrhagic regions that may interfere with diffusion analysis. Control diffusion measurements of lateral funiculus white matter was measured in the EB lesion animals, contralateral to the side of EB injection (\nn\n=\u200910). To confirm the validity of these internal control measurements, D\u2225 and D\u22a5 were measured in the bilateral lateral funiculi of three na\u00efve age-matched rats. Imaging from one of these animals was used for the creation of\nFigure 1\n. Quantitative measurements of the EB and hemi-contusion injury dimensions were manually obtained on the T2-weighted B0 sequence. Volumes were calculated by the formula for approximate ellipse volume\u2009=\u2009(\u03c0/6)*length*width*height. All image post-processing was performed with ImageJ software (ImageJ; NIH, Bethesda, MA). Motion correction between sequences was manually performed using the translation function in ImageJ software platform prior to diffusion analysis.\n\nTissue processing\nAnimals were sacrificed at 7 (\nn\n=\u200910), or 65 (\nn\n=\u20095) days post-injury (dpi) for EB demyelination and 3 (\nn\n=\u20095) or 65 (\nn\n=\u20093) dpi for contusion SCI. Tissue processing was as previously described.\n24\nBriefly, animals were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (60\u2009mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with 100\u2009mL of 0.1\u2009M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 300\u2009mL of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1\u2009M PBS. Spinal cords were carefully dissected and post-fixed overnight at 4\u00b0C, then transferred to 30% sucrose at 4\u00b0C for cryoprotection (48\u2009h). Specimens were cut transversely at the epicenter of the lesion and mounted with cut surfaces facing down in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) tissue freezing medium (Triangle Biomedical Sciences, Durham, NC).\n\nImmunohistochemistry and fluorescence microscopy\nAfter tissue embedding, 20-\u03bcm thick transverse sections were cut on a cryostat device and mounted on microscope slides. Before incubation with primary antibodies, sections were permeabilized and blocked with 0.3% Triton X-100/10% normal donkey serum in 0.1\u2009M TBS (pH\u2009=\u20097.4) for 30\u2009min. Primary antibodies were then applied for 48\u2009h at 4\u00b0C. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-myelin basic protein (1:20; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for intact myelin, anti-phosphorylated neurofilament H (1:300, SMI-31-Sternberger Monoclonals, Lutherville, MD) for intact axons, anti-\u03b2APP (1:200; Chemicon Inc., Temecula, CA) for damaged axons, anti- glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:200; Dako, Cupertino, CA) for astrocytes, and anti-degMBP (1:800; Chemicon Inc.) for degenerated myelin. Appropriate secondary antibodies were used. Sections were then rinsed in TBS and cover-slipped with antiface mounting media (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Staining was visualized with a Keyence BZ-900 all-in-one fluorescence microscope with built-in monochrome CCD camera (Keyence Corporation, Itasca, IL). Figures were assembled using ImageJ and Adobe Photoshop software (San Jose, CA).\n\nHistological analysis\nHistological analysis was performed on 1-\u03bcm thick plastic toluidine blue\u2013stained sections as previously described.\n24\nFor luxol fast blue (LFB) staining, cryostat sections were dehydrated in graded alcohol and placed in 0.1% LFB at 37\u00b0C overnight. Sections were then differentiated in 0.05% LiCO\n3\nfor 4\u2009min, dehydrated in graded alcohol and xylene, and cover-slipped.\nAxon density was quantified for acute EB lesions based on density of SMI-31\n+\naxon counts. Cryostat sections from the epicenter of early EB lesions from three different animals were analyzed. Digitized images of the lesion, as well as areas of normal contralateral spinal cord, were obtained at 40\u00d7 magnification. Axon density within the lesion and contralateral normal spinal cord was assessed by manually counting the total number of SMI-31\n+\naxons in a 60\u2009\u03bcm \u00d7 60\u2009\u03bcm square. Five squares were randomly sampled per section. Results are reported as axons/mm\n2\n.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using MedCalc for Windows, version 14.8.1 (MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for lesion volume, D\u2225, D\u22a5, and AI at each location to assess differences between groups. As part of ANOVA, a Levene's test was performed to assess for a normal distribution and if necessary, the data was log-transformed to achieve a normal distribution for analysis. If the ANOVA was statistically significant then Tukey-Kramer pairwise comparisons were performed. In order to keep an overall study alpha of 0.05, a Bonferroni\npost hoc\ncorrection was applied to the ANOVAs and the\nt\n-test, requiring a\np\n<\u20090.003125 for statistical significance. A\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant for Tukey-Kramer tests within a statistically significant ANOVA as these tests account for multiple comparisons. For quantitative axon density analysis, a two-tailed Student's\nt\n-test was used to compare measurements of axon density in early EB and normal white matter samples. A\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant."

The hospitals were composed of Level 1 and 2 trauma centers, a nontrauma center, and included both U.S. and European sites (\nTable 1\n). Eligible patients were those with an initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 9\u201315 who underwent emergency head CT scan for evaluation of the head injury as deemed necessary by the attending ED physician.\nTable\n1.\nDescription of Study Site Hospitals\nStudy site\nLocation\nAnnual ED volume\nDesignation\nWashington University, Barnes-Jewish Hospital\nSt. Louis, MO\n95,000\nLevel I\nUniversity of Florida, Shands Hospital\nGainesville, FL\n66,000\nLevel I\nGwinnett Medical Center\u2013Lawrenceville\nAtlanta, GA\n100,000\nLevel II\nDekalb Medical\u2013North Decatur\nAtlanta, GA\n92,000\nNon-trauma\nWayne State\u2013Detroit Receiving Hospital\nDetroit, MI\n90,000\nLevel I\nUniversity of P\u00e9cs Medical Center\nPecs, Hungary\n25,000\n\u03a9\nLevel 1\n*\nAlbert Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi Medical Center\u2013University of Szeged\nSzeged, Hungary\n90,000\nLevel 1\n*\nOpen in a separate window\nED, emergency department.\n\u03a9\nThe ED volume is >25,000/year, and the facility cares for more than 2000 neurotrauma cases/year.\n*\nThis is equivalent to a Level 1 facility in the United States.\nNo formal rules for obtaining a CT were used so as to best reflect current practice in the United States or Europe, but all sites were aware of and considered available clinical decision rules to guide the need for brain imaging. Included patients presented within 4\u2009h of injury, completed the required CT scan as part of routine care, and had blood drawn for analysis within 6\u2009h of injury.\nTable 2\ndetails the full inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nTable\n2.\nInclusion/Exclusion Criteria\nInclusion criteria\n\u2022\u2002The subject was \u226518 years of age and no more than 80 years of age.\n\u2022\u2002Acceleration or deceleration closed injury to the head that was either self-reported or witnessed.\n\u2022\u2002Presented to an emergency department (ED) within 4\u2009h of injury.\n\u2022\u2002An initial Glasgow Coma Scale score of 9\u201315 in the ED performed by the Principal Investigator (PI) or trained study personnel.\n\u2022\u2002ED workup included a head computed tomography (CT) scan (based on standard practice and/or decision rules).\n\u2022\u2002Informed consent was obtained from the subject or his or her legal representative; oral consent for the initial blood draw and/or deferred consent to 24\u2009h was allowed for patients who were unable to consent at initial evaluation or exception from the informed consent requirement by use of \u201ccommunity consent\u201d if approved by an Institutional Review Board.\n\u2022\u2002The PI deemed the subject to be an appropriate study candidate.\nExclusion criteria\n\u2022\u2002Participation in another clinical study that may affect the results of either study.\n\u2022\u2002Time of injury was not able to be accurately determined.\n\u2022\u2002Head CT not done as part of clinical emergency care.\n\u2022\u2002Primary diagnosis of ischemic or hemorrhagic infarct.\n\u2022\u2002Not available for 35 day follow-up visit.\n\u2022\u2002Venipuncture not feasible.\n\u2022\u2002Blood donation within 1 week of screening.\n\u2022\u2002The subject was otherwise determined medically unsuitable for study participation.\nOpen in a separate window\nInstitutional Review Board approval was obtained at each study site, and each site also obtained approval by the ethics board of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) Office of Research Protections (ORP) Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) Department of Defense. Baseline patient data collected included demographics, medical history, substance use, GCS scores, and circumstances related to and the mechanism of injury. This was used to describe the study patient's general characteristics only.\n\nSerum sampling and handling\nBlood samples were collected at time of study enrollment and every 6 hours up to the time of discharge (either ED or hospital) or up to 24\u2009h (maximum of five samples during index visit). Patients who were seen at follow-up (Day 35\u2009\u00b1\u20095 days) had another sample obtained when feasible. Blood samples were processed and the resulting serum was stored at \u221280\u00b0C and then shipped on dry ice to a central repository for storage until time of testing as per a pre-defined specimen handling procedure.\n\nSerum analysis for GFAP, UCH-L1, and S100B\nSerum samples were analyzed for UCH-L1 and GFAP concentration by the Banyan enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at a later time by technicians blinded to clinical data and CT results. The assay was performed as follows: the test sample was added to the well of a 96-well microtiter plate that had been coated with a capture antibody specific to the antigen of interest (UCH-L1 or GFAP). Following a set incubation period during which any antigen present in the sample binds to the capture antibody, unbound material was removed by washing with buffer. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated detection antibody was then added to the well, binding to a second site on the antigen. Following a set incubation period, excess detection antibody was removed by washing with buffer.\nA chemiluminescent substrate was then added to the well. The HRP enzyme catalyzes a specific reaction with the chemiluminescent substrate, which produces light that was detected with a 96-well plate-based luminometer. The amount of light generated is proportional to the amount of detection antibody and thus UCH-L1 or GFAP in the test sample and was compared with light generated from wells containing known antigen concentrations representing a calibration curve. Samples were tested in duplicate, and high and low positive controls were included with each plate. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) and lower limit of detection (LLOD) for UCH-LI are \u226430\u2009pg/ml and \u226410\u2009pg/mL and for GFAP \u226430\u2009pg/ml and \u226420\u2009pg/mL, respectively.\nS100B concentrations were determined using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay designed for\nin-vitro\ndiagnostic testing (Roche, Cobas 6000). Results are given as S-S100 in \u03bcg/L with the standard normal reference intervals of 0.00\u20130.09\u2009\u03bcg/L. Although various cutoff values have been proposed, for the purposes of this study, an S100B \u22650.10\u2009\u03bcg/L (100\u2009pg/mL) was considered to be abnormal and could indicate a traumatic abnormality on head CT.\n17\n,\n24\nAssay results were not available to the treating clinician and were not used to guide treatment. For this main analysis, we only considered results for the first sample collected within 6\u2009h of injury. For all biomarkers, results were reported in picograms/milliliter (pg/mL). Because other studies used different units of measurement\u2014we provided the units in the original referenced manuscripts and the equivalent in pg/mL for the above S100B sample measurement section and in the following results and\ndiscussion\nsection where needed.\n\nHead CT scans\nEach subject's head CT images were reviewed by an independent committee consisting of three blinded board-certified neuroradiologists. The neuroradiologists determined whether a CT scan was positive\u2014defined as the presence of an acute trauma-related intracranial lesion.\nTable 3\nlists the criteria for what was deemed a positive finding. A procedure outlining the criteria and process to be followed for scoring the CT scans was developed before the reading and interpretation of any of the CT images. Two of the neuroradiologists who had no access to any other clinical or laboratory data, except subject age and sex, reviewed all of the study subjects' CT scans. Any discrepancy with respect to CT-positive or CT-negative was adjudicated by a third blinded radiologist and, in those instances, was the final interpretation. Interrater reliability between the two primary radiologists was determined using the Cohen Kappa statistic.\nTable\n3.\nDefinition of Acute Intracranial Lesion\nAcute intracranial lesion is defined as any trauma induced or related finding. Acute lesions may include the following and the number of each finding:\nN\nExtra-axial lesions\n\u2022\u2002Acute epidural hematoma (EPH)\n3\n\u2022\u2002Acute subdural hematoma (SDH)\n21\nCortical contusion\n10\nVentricular compression\n3\nVentricular trapping\n0\nBrain herniation\n0\nIntraventricular hemorrhage\n1\nHydrocephalus\n1\nSubarachnoid hemorrhage\n27\nPetechial hemorrhagic or bland sheer injury\n0\nBrain edema\n0\nPost-traumatic ischemia\n0\nIntracerebral hematoma\n0\nDural venous sinus injury and/or thrombosis\n0\nOpen in a separate window\n\nOutcomes\nFor this study, the primary clinical outcome of interest was the results of the head CT scan (positive/negative) among patients with the first blood sample drawn within 6\u2009h of injury.\n\nData analysis and reporting\nA descriptive analysis for all subjects was performed. Patient groups (CT positive and CT negative) were described using proportions and means or medians where appropriate. For data analyses, any biomarker value below the detectible limit was coded as 0\u2009pg/mL. The exception to this was for the scatter plots that used a log linear y-axis for which a value of 0.01\u2009pg/mL was used (0\u2009pg/mL is not a valid value using the log scale). The Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated for each biomarker pairing. Logistic regression was used to determine area under the receiver operator characteristic (AUROC) curve for all three biomarkers independently and also for a single model with all three biomarkers collectively. Probability output from the logistic regression models and graphical displays were used to evaluate clinically relevant cutoff values for positive and negative values for GFAP, UCH-L1, and S100B.\n25\nA nonparametric approach was used to compare the correlated ROC curves without adjustments for pairwise comparisons.\n26\nSensitivity and specificity were calculated for the primary and secondary outcomes. Because there would be little acceptance of missed injury on CT scan, our goal was to maximize sensitivity to 100% at the expense of specificity. This allowed for determination of the number of CT scans that could potentially be safely eliminated when screening using each biomarker. We also examined threshold values that would result in sensitivity \u226595% and \u226590% for comparison of specificity.\n25\nFor GFAP and UCH-L1, we calculated individual sensitivity and specificity values. We also implemented a combined biomarker strategy: if either GFAP was \u2265100 or UCH-L1 \u226540 (chosen based on our data for optimal UCH-L1 sensitivity), the test was considered positive. For the reporting of S100B, we used the Scandinavian recommendation of >0.10\u2009\u03bcg/L (100\u2009pg/mL) for patients injured within 6\u2009h of serum sampling as the standard cutoff value.\n17\nA sensitivity analysis (in this instance meaning varying the assumptions of the diagnostic tests) that examined patients with an initial sample obtained within 4\u2009h (ACEP guidelines) of injury was performed to evaluate for diagnostic capability of the biomarkers at times closer to injury and times that may be more favorable to the standard S100B values.\n7\nBecause the cut points for UCH-L1 and GFAP were optimized to our data, we also re-examined the AUROC curves and graphical data to determine whether a different cut point value for S100B would improve the diagnostic capability of that test for our data. This was done so not to \u201cfavor\u201d the new diagnostic markers (GFAP and UCH-L1) over S100B.\nThere were no formal hypotheses for this study, and it was not designed to provide a definitive assessment of the studied biomarkers' test characteristics. The study was, rather, descriptive and exploratory in nature, and the results will be used as an adjunct to help derive biomarker cutoff values for a future validation trial. The analysis included proportions with associated exact Clopper-Pearson 95% confidence intervals (CIs), means with standard deviation (SD), and medians with 25th and 75th percentiles where appropriate. The\np\nvalues were only used for comparing AUROC curve data.\nRecommended guidelines for reporting results of diagnostic tests were followed.\n27\n,\n28\nThese results are not to be considered as evidence to reject a null hypothesis. All data analyses were performed using SAS\n\u00ae\n9.4 and R 3.1.0."

In addition, on January 1, 2015, a second search was performed using the following key words \u201cspinal cord injury motor recovery\u201d AND each of the following: \u201ccell therapies,\u201d \u201celectric stimulation,\u201d \u201cpharmacology,\u201d and \u201crehabilitation.\u201d A filter was applied to limit the search to studies performed in humans. Studies were considered for eligibility if they were written in English and were published from 1990 until the search date (01/10/14). The remaining criteria for inclusion and exclusion can be seen onTable 1, and the protocol for the present review is publicly available.11Abstracts were screened for eligibility, and relevant studies were reviewed in full by two independent trained examiners (JGO and MC), and discrepancies were resolved in monthly meetings with a third author (APL). Reference lists of the included articles were screened to identify potential articles not captured by the initial search.\n\nThis review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement.12Data extraction of the included studies was performed in adherence to the population intervention comparison outcome framework,12wherein recommended study characteristics were collected (methods, interventions, participants, and outcomes) using the Revman 5 software (version 5.1, Cochrane Collaboration, Canada) and tables using Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA).

    "Methods": "Subjects\nTwenty-six male Long Evans hooded rats (3.5-month-old; Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) were housed in pairs at the Animal Resource Center at The University of Texas (Austin, TX) on a 12/12-h light/dark cycle. Rats were tamed by gentle handling and then were placed on scheduled feeding (15\u201317\u2009g daily) of standard chow. Animals were trained to proficiency on the single-pellet reaching task with their preferred limb, and then a unilateral CCI was performed over the CMC opposite their preferred reaching limb. Based upon post-CCI behavioral performance and injury severity, animals were then assigned randomly to treatment condition, with the exception that they were carefully matched for initial severity of lesion-induced impairments. Equivalency in injury severity was based upon postinjury day 3 percent of successful retrievals on the single pellet retrieval task (\nFig. 1\n) and subsequently validated with reaching abnormality scores (\nFig. 2\n). There were no significant differences between groups in these two behaviors on day 3 (\np\ns\u2009>\u20090.05). Further, there were also no significant differences in the size of the contusion produced by the injury in either of the two groups.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSuccess rate on the single-pellet reaching (SPR) task with the impaired forelimb.

Post-CCI, both groups have an increase in the average number of abnormal reaching strategies during successful reaching on the SPR task. RT significantly reduces the abnormal reaching score over weeks of training compared to NoRT. Data are means \u00b1 standard error of the mean; *\np\n=\u20090.05. CCI, controlled cortical impact; RT, rehabilitative training; NoRT, no rehabilitative training.\nAnimals either underwent combinatorial rehabilitative motor training (RT) or yoked treatment controls (no rehabilitative training; NoRT). All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the University of Texas, Austin Animal Care and Use Committee (Austin, TX).\n\nControlled cortical impact\nAll rats were anesthetized with a cocktail of ketamine and xylazine (90\u2013100 and 10\u2009mg/kg; intraperitoneally [i.p.]), a 4-mm craniotomy was created, centered over CMC (0.5\u2009mm anterior and 4\u2009mm lateral to bregma) opposite the preferred reaching limb, then a CCI was induced with a 3-mm diameter impact tip angled 18 degrees away from the vertical (Benchmark Stereotaxic Impactor; Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL), depressing the brain at 1.7 D.V, at 3.0\u2009m/s for 300\u2009ms. After the impact, the wound was covered with gel film and sutured. There was a fairly even split in preferred limb use, and thus side of injury, within and between groups (RT\u2009=\u20095 right, 8 left CCIs; NoRT\u2009=\u20096 right, 7 right CCIs).\n\nSingle-pellet retrieval task\nThe single-pellet reaching (SPR) task is a sensitive test of forelimb skill and dexterity that can be used to reveal quantitative and qualitative injury-induced forelimb deficits and recovery of forelimb function.\n27\u201330\nBefore CCI surgery, animals were trained to reach with the preferred limb through a narrow window to retrieve a banana-flavored food pellet (45\u2009mg; Bio-Serve, Frenchtown, NJ) from a well 1\u2009cm from the opening. A wall was placed 0.5\u2009cm from the window within the chamber and ipsilateral to the preferred limb to encourage reaching with only the preferred limb. The number of successes, failures, and drops were recorded for 30 trials, or 10\u2009min (whichever came first). A success occurred when the animal reached through the window, grasped the pellet, brought the pellet into the cage, and ate it. Animals were pre-operatively trained approximately 18 days until they had a stable (5 consecutive days) reaching success rate above 60%.\nQuantitative reaching performance was measured on post-CCI days 0, 3, 7, 10, 21, 28, 35, and 41 and reported as the percent of successful reaches out of the total number of reach attempts [(total successes/total reach attempts) *100] with the preferred/impaired forelimb. Data presented are the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM) percent successful reaches. The experimenter was not blind to group assignment in the collection of the SPR data because the forelimb constraint condition was evident.\n\nAbnormal reaching score\nThe reaching task was also qualitatively assessed using frame-by-frame analysis of successful reaches recorded on post-CCI days 0, 3, 21, and 41. The Abnormal Reaching Score was calculated based on the average number of abnormal reaching movements made during 5 successful reaches per time point. Movements were analyzed using an adaptation of a rating scale developed by Whishaw and colleagues, which is based upon Eshkol\u2013Wachman movement notation.\n31\u201334\nThis movement analysis is sensitive to compensatory forelimb movements that reveal enduring impairments or compensatory strategies in reaching and grasping motor action patterns after brain injury.\n31\u201333\n,\n35\nBriefly, the eight components of reaching movements that were analyzed included: 1) aim: the elbow is adducted while the digits are aligned with the mid-line of the reaching window and are oriented toward the food pellet; 2) advance: the limb is advanced directly through the reaching window, initially above and beyond the food pellet; 3) digits open: as the limb is advanced, the digits open and extend toward the pellet; 4) pronation: the wrist pronates over the pellet; 5) grasp: the pads of the palm or the digits touch the food and the food is grasped by closure of the digits around the pellet. 6) supination 1: the paw is dorsiflexed and supinated 90 degrees as the limb is withdrawn through the reaching window; 7) supination 2: the paw is supinated again by approximately 45 degrees to bring the pellet to the mouth; and 8) release: the digits are opened and the pellet is released into mouth. Each movement was rated with a score of 0 (normal), 0.5 (slightly abnormal), and 1 (absent or highly abnormal). Data were analyzed as the total abnormality score across all the reaching components (averaged over trials). One animal from the yoked control group was excluded because of poor video quality. Experimenters collecting these data were blind to group assignment.\n\nMotor rehabilitative treatment\nThe rehabilitative treatment (RT) protocol for the treatment group (RT;\nn\n=\u200913) included tray reach training, voluntary exercise on a running wheel, and less-impaired (ipsilateral-to-CCI) forelimb constraint. Yoked controls (NoRT;\nn\n=\u200913) participated in control procedures at the same time as their matched pairs in the RT group.\nTray-reaching task\nAnimals in the RT group trained with their impaired forelimb on a tray-reaching task starting on post-op day 3. The tray-reaching task is different from the single-pellet task in that a greater variety of reaching distances and trajectories is required and grasping more than one banana pellet at a time is allowed. For tray-reach training, rats were placed in a clear Plexiglas reaching chamber (as described for SPR). Five days per week, CCI+RT rats (\nn\n=\u200913) reached through the 1-cm-wide window with their impaired limb for 100 banana-flavored pellets (45\u2009mg; Bio-Serv) placed in a tray with a 25-degree incline outside of the reaching chamber, or for 20\u2009min, whichever occurred first. The CCI+NoRT controls (\nn\n=\u200913) were placed in the reaching chamber and ate 100 pellets off of the chamber floor.\nVoluntary exercise\nStarting on day 14 post-surgery, animals in the RT group were individually placed in cages with access to a running wheel for 6\u2009h/day (3\u2009h light/3\u2009h dark), 5 days/week until post-surgery day 41. Cages were connected to exercise wheels by wire-mesh tubes. During the period of time the rehabilitative group had access to running wheels, the CCI+NoRT controls were individually placed into cages attached to wheels, but their wheels were locked to prevent rotation. All animals had access to food (17\u2009g) and water during the 6\u2009h in their individual cages. After each session, rats were returned to their home cage with their cage mate and given their remaining food.\nForelimb constraint\nOn post-injury day 10, RT animals had the forelimb ipsilateral to the CCI constrained using a limb-restricting vest (soft customized two-holed jackets with athletic tape used to wrap around the forelimb; Lomir Biomedical, Malone, NY). The vests were worn continuously for 10 days and were gently removed on day 20 post-injury. The NoRT control group wore a two-holed vest only, which allowed movement of both limbs.\n\nIntracortical microstimulation\nStandard ICMS methods were used on all animals.\n13\n,\n36\u201339\nOn day 42 post-CCI, animals were anesthetized (120\u2009mg/kg of ketamine and 60\u2009mg/kg of xylazine, i.p.) and received a craniotomy and dura removal over the injured motor cortex. Supplemental doses of ketamine (0.05\u20130.2\u2009mg) were given as needed. A digital image of the cortical surface was taken and a 500-\u03bcm grid was superimposed onto the image. Using the cortical image and grid as a guide, a glass microelectrode (controlled by a hydraulic microdrive) was used to make systematic penetrations across the caudal forelimb area of the injured motor cortex. We also collected motor maps in the cortex contralateral to the injury in a subset of animals (RT\u2009=\u20092; CCI\u2009=\u20093) for illustrative purposes. The electrode was lowered into cortical layer V (\u223c1550\u2009\u03bcm below cortical surface) at each penetration site, and current pulses were delivered. Because of death during this second surgical procedure, mapping data from\nn\n=\u20099 animals in the RT group and n\u2009=\u200912 controls were analyzed.\nThe stimulation current consisted of 13,200-\u03bcs cathodal pulses delivered at 350\u2009Hz. If motor movements were detected at \u2264100\u2009\u03bcA, they were recorded. Forelimb movements were labeled as either distal (wrist/digit) or proximal (elbow/shoulder), whereas nonforelimb movements were noted as jaw, whisker, hindlimb, or trunk. We denoted whether movements were elicited at either \u226460 or 100\u2009\u03bcA. The site was deemed nonresponsive if no movement was detected at \u2264100\u2009\u03bcA. The motor maps were constructed by systematically bordering the forelimb and jaw/neck sites with other motor or nonresponsive sites\nICMS-derived movement representations in injured cortex were analyzed by first using skull landmarks (bregma, mid-line, lamda, and the plane of the interaueral line) to align maps from across animals relative to stereotaxic coordinates, as described previously.\n38\nMovement representations were generated by filling in grid squares with colors coding for the response at the center and then overlaid with a fixed 0.5 by 0.5\u2009mm increment grid of lines aligned with bregma and mid-line. Areas of movement representations per each grid square were then measured using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD).\n40\nExperimenters were blinded to the group assignment of the animals.\n\nEuthanasia\nAnimals were euthanized immediately after the motor map was generated by an overdose of pentobarbital. Animals were transcardially perfused with 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffer followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in the same buffer. Brains were removed, post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and then six sets of 50-\u03bcm coronal were collected and Nissl stained using Toluidine blue.\n\nContusion volume estimation\nNissl stained sections which contained the CCI were examined using a Leica Microscope (Leica Microsystems, Jena, Germany) and CCD camera at 2.5\u00d7 magnification, and the images were observed and analyzed using Neurolucida (MBF Bioscience Inc., Williston, VT). For all brains, perimeter tracing was used to calculate the area of cortex in the ipsi- and contrainjury cortex. The sum of the area of nine sections was multiplied by the average distance between sections (600\u2009\u03bcm) to obtain the estimate volume of cortex. Ipsi-injury cortical volume was subtracted from contrainjury cortical volume to obtain the estimated contusion size. Data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM.\n\nStatistical analyses\nBehavioral data were analyzed using repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with SPSS software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). To assess the severity of injury-induced behavioral impairments, paired-sample\nt\n-tests were used to compare pre- and post-CCI performance on each behavioral task across groups. ICMS motor mapping data was analyzed using one-way ANOVAs. Results were considered significant at\np\n\u2264\u20090.05. All statistics were performed using SPSS software (SPSS, Inc.)."

    "Methods": "Participants\nForty-two middle and high school student-athletes (52% male, mean age\u2009=\u200914.9, standard deviation [SD]\u2009=\u20090.87, range\u2009=\u200913\u201316) diagnosed with an SRC were selected for this study. The diagnosis of concussion was initially made by the referring medical providers (athletic trainer, physician) using current clinical criteria (American Academy of Neurology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and confirmed at the time of the clinic visit, using the same diagnostic standards. The two study groups were defined as follows:\n1.\u2002Additional-impact group: Twenty-one participants sustained a significant blow to the head that caused concussion-related symptoms followed by an additional head impact, occurring >1\u2009min and <24\u2009h after the initial head impact. An additional head impact was defined as a direct blow to the head that caused additional symptoms or worsening of existing symptoms at the time of the second event. The second discrete blow to the head was required to occur >1\u2009min after the initial injury for inclusion in this group to differentiate a distinct second head impact from a single injury involving two immediate hits (e.g., body to head contact, followed by head hitting the ground).\n2.\u2002Single-injury group: A control group of 21 age- and gender-matched student-athletes who sustained a concussion from a single blow to the head were selected. Detailed and thorough interview of the athlete and parent determined definitively that no additional impact exposure was sustained.

Exclusionary criteria included a major medical condition (e.g., sickle cell, heart disease, etc.), developmental delays, abnormal brain imaging findings (if performed), or the second head impact occurring >24\u2009h after the initial blow prior to recovery. Gender, age, and type of sport were evenly distributed between the groups. Multiple sports were represented in this sample, including soccer, football, lacrosse, wrestling, and ice hockey. According to parent and child report of the concussive events, zero athletes in the additional-impact group and 11 athletes (52%) in the single-injury group were immediately removed from play after the initial blow to the head (see\nTable 1\n). As previously noted, the 10 athletes in the single-injury group who continued to participate did not sustain additional head impacts.\nGiven the retrospective design of this study, multiple measures were taken to reduce threats to internal validity associated with potential selection bias in this study. First and most significant, the selection process for all study participants, in both the additional-impact and single-injury groups was fully blinded to the dependent variables (length of recovery [LOR], symptom status). To minimize the likelihood of biased selection of the single-injury control group, two different samples of 21 gender- and age-matched control participants were selected for analysis relative to the additional-impact group. Finally, to further enhance the variability of the control group (and reduce the error of estimate), a third control group was generated with two age- and gender-matched control participants selected for every one of the 21 additional-impact athletes.\n\nProcedure\nAs part of standard care, all participants underwent a clinical evaluation including a detailed account of the injury and review of relevant pre-injury risk factors for protracted recovery using the structured Acute Concussion Evaluation (ACE).\n9\nPost-injury symptom breadth and severity was collected using the Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI) using both the parent form (PCSI-P) and the adolescent (ages 13\u201318) self-report form (PCSI-SR13).\n10\nThe PCSI is a developmentally sensitive parent, and child and adolescent (5\u201318 years) graded symptom checklist validated for assessing post-concussive symptoms. Symptom ratings on both the 20-item parent PCSI form (PCSI-P) and the 21-item adolescent self-report PCSI form (PCSI-SR13) have exhibited strong internal consistency in youth with (Total score \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.90\u20130.94) and without concussions (Total score \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.79\u20130.90), and a satisfactory 2-week test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]\u2009=\u20090.79\u20130.89).\n9\nAt the time of the first clinic visit, parents and adolescents provided ratings of current symptom status on the PCSI, rating the severity of each post-concussion symptom over the time frame of \u201cyesterday and today.\u201d Scores were computed through summing symptom severity ratings for the parent and adolescent forms, producing a PCSI Total Symptom score as well as four symptom subscales (physical, fatigue, emotional, cognitive). To control for the presence of \u201csymptoms\u201d pre-injury, participants also provided retrospective rating of these same symptoms prior to the injury, generating a retrospective baseline (RBL) score. Post-injury scores were statistically adjusted, via regression analyses, controlling for the RBL scores.\nParticipants in each group received the same process of individualized treatment based on their unique post-concussion symptom profile using an active, progressive model of symptom management and rehabilitation.\n11\nApproval for the study was obtained from the hospital Institutional Review Board.\n\nStudy design\nIndependent variable\nStudent-athletes were divided into the single-injury or additional-impact group based on the above criteria of sustaining either a single or additional blow to the head, respectively.\nDependent variables\nTwo dependent variables were defined in this study: (1) Athlete symptom burden was defined as the RBL-adjusted PCSI Total Symptom score on the adolescent (PCSI-SR13) and parent (PCSI-P) forms; (2) Athlete LOR was calculated as the days elapsed between the date of initial injury and the date of recovery. Date of recovery was determined by clinician based on child and parent report of the resolution of symptoms, along with supportive data indicating cognition, balance, and school performance having returned to normal functioning.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe effect of additional head impact exposure on athlete-reported symptom burden at the first clinic visit was analyzed using two separate analyses: (1) one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) examining group differences in PCSI-SR13 Total Symptom score, covarying the PCSI-SR13 RBL Total Symptom score; (2) one-way multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) examining group differences (single-injury vs. additional-impact) in the four PCSI-SR13 post-injury subscale totals (physical, cognitive, emotional, and fatigue), controlling for the PCSI-SR13 RBL Total Symptom score. Identical analyses were conducted with the PCSI-P scores. The effect of injury status (single vs. additional) on LOR was analyzed using a one-way ANCOVA, controlling for age. A one-tailed alpha of 0.05 was set for all analyses, given the unidirectional hypotheses. Effect sizes were calculated using Cohen's d\n12\n(conventional interpretation of effect sizes:\nd\n=\u20090.2, small;\nd\n=\u20090.5, medium; and\nd\n=\u20090.8, large)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nNineteen female Sprague-Dawley rats were used (\u223c200\u2009g; Harlan). Animal procedures and care was in accordance with the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health and were approved by the University of Louisville Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals habituated to their cages for a minimum of 7 days and were given free access to food and water except during behavioral testing.\n\nGeneral surgical procedures and post-operative care\nAnimal surgeries were performed according to a standardized protocol as described elsewhere.\n8\nIn short, after intramuscular (i.m.) injection of an anesthetic mixture containing ketamine, acepromazine and xylazine, opthalmic ointment was placed on the eyes and 5\u2009mL saline was injected subcutaneously before and after surgery. Surgery and recovery was performed on a 37\u00b0C heating pad. After surgery, the wound was rinsed with sterile saline and closed in layers, and bacitracin applied topically and gentamicin injected i.m. immediately and 2 and 4 days later. Buprenorphine was injected i.m. for pain relief once each animal awoke and four times every 12 hours. Bladders were manually expressed twice a day until spontaneous voiding occurred.\n\nSpinal cord injury and intrathecal drug delivery\nContusive SCI was performed as described elsewhere.\n8\nBriefly, after a skin incision, the T9 vertebra was stabilized, a laminectomy performed and a 120\u2009kdyn contusion delivered using the Infinite Horizons impactor (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, LLC, Lexington, KY). Sham animals were treated similarly, but not contused.\nIntrathecal polyethylene catheters with 100\u2009\u03bcm diameter tips attached to Alzet osmotic pumps (model 2001, 7d, 1\u2009\u03bcL/h; Durect, Cupertino, CA) were prepared and implanted at vertebral level L5/6 as described elsewhere.\n9\nThe only differences were that the pumps were incubated overnight in sterile saline before being filled immediately before surgery, under sterile conditions, with sterile 0.1\u2009M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or with PBS containing freshly dissolved ALC (1\u2009mg/day; 41.67\u2009mg/mL, Cat#A6706, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). After SCI, the thin part of the catheter was inserted into the subarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid space through a small hole in the dura, the thick part of the catheter sutured to the muscles, and the pump placed subcutaneously. Sham operated rats received a catheter attached to a PBS-filled pump. Drug treatment was randomized beforehand, but the sequence altered as needed to ensure that the impactor displacement (a measure of injury severity) between groups was not significantly different. On post-operative Day 6, after the first behavioral assessments, the subcutaneous pump was removed by cutting and cauterizing the catheter.\nThis intrathecal route and dose (1\u2009mg/day) is similar to that used by others (0.9\u2009mg/day) to show neuroprotection of motor neurons after L5 hemisection in rats.\n17\nOthers have found protective effects of intraperitoneal injection of 300\u2009mg/kg ALC (\u223c60\u201375\u2009mg per rat) after a severe spinal cord injury on mitochondrial function during the acute injury phase, as well as white matter sparing and improved locomotor function.\n15\nThis seems comparable to our 1\u2009mg/day dose because drugs can be similarly active after intrathecal administration at 100-fold lower doses than after intraperitoneal injection, probably due, at least in part, to the much smaller enclosed spinal cord tissue volume, compared with the whole body. An example is the daily dosing of our intrathecal protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor (0.485\u20131.455\u2009\u03bcg/day),\n9\ncompared with that of a closely related inhibitor administrated intraperitoneally (40\u2013100\u2009\u03bcg/day).\n18\n\nLocomotor assessment\nRats were acclimated to handling and the testing equipment three times prior to baseline assessments. To assess overground locomotor function, rats were placed in an 85\u2009cm diameter circular tub and allowed to walk for 4\u2009min while two certified examiners scored locomotor performance according to the BBB scale.\n19\nNinety minutes later, grid walking was assessed on a sensitive elevated plastic chain link fence grid as described elsewhere,\n8\na task we have shown is dependent on the dorsal column.\n8\n,\n9\nRats walk voluntarily for a total of 90\u2009sec and footfalls are counted. Observers were blinded to treatment condition.\n\nAscending sensory axon tracing\nAfter the second behavioral assessment (Day 12; 3 days before analyses), ascending dorsal column sensory axons from the sciatic nerves projecting to the gracile nucleus that pass through the injury site were traced bilaterally with cholera toxin B (CTB) as described previously.\n20\nBriefly, CTB was injected into both sciatic nerves at mid-thigh level and the nerve crushed to increase tracer uptake.\n21\nA ligature around the nerve prevents CTB leakage.\n\nIntravital perfused blood vessel labeling and preparation for histology\nTwenty minutes before processing for histology, perfused blood microvessels were labeled by injecting 200\u2009\u03bcg of Texas Red conjugated lycopersicon esculentum agglutinin (LEA; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) into the left jugular vein as described elsewhere.\n8\nInjected LEA only binds to endothelial cells in perfused microvessels.\n22\n,\n23\nAfter 20\u2009min, the rats were perfused with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Tissue was post-fixed overnight and then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose.\n\nHistological analyses\nEleven millimeter spinal cord segments centered on the injury epicenter from all subjects were mounted together in a block to obtain 20\u2009\u03bcm transverse sections using a cryostat and perform the different histological staining procedures as described in detail elsewhere.\n8\nUnless otherwise noted, each histological assessment used slides with sections spaced 200\u2009\u03bcm. Spared white matter was identified by eriochrome cyanine (EC) staining and was used to determine the maximum injury epicenter for each rat and alignment of sections from other histological markers. To identify cell bodies of lower motor neurons in the ventral horn at the injury site, cresyl violet staining was performed as previously described.\n7\nTo identify blood vessels, double immunofluorescence was performed as described\n8\nusing goat anti-Texas Red immunoglobulin G (IgG) for perfused and mouse anti-rat RECA-1 IgG primary antibodies for total (RECA-1+) blood vessels, combined with appropriate secondary antibodies. The goat anti-Texas Red antibody was used to amplify the Texas Red-conjugated LEA signal, which helps with counting of the blood vessels. CTB-traced dorsal column sensory axon terminals were identified in 30\u2009\u03bcm sagittal sections through the medulla (gracile nucleus). Lumbar spinal cord sections (L4/5 afferents) were used to confirm successful injection. CTB immunohistochemistry on every third section was performed as described\n8\nusing a well-defined protocol and highly specific primary antibody.\n\nQuantitative measurements\nMosaic images of the entire section were taken at 10\u00d7 (bright field for CTB and motor neurons) or 20\u00d7 (fluorescent) objective and white matter, microvessels and CTB+ terminals quantified as described.\n8\nBriefly, the percentage of EC-stained pixels for each spinal cord section was calculated as a percentage of sham, with the three sections with the lowest percentage defined as the epicenter. Averages of three sections 1\u2009mm rostral and caudal were defined as the penumbra. Dorsal column white matter sparing was measured separately. To quantify motor neuron survival, cresyl violet\u2013stained cell bodies of the ventral horn were counted in the epicenter and penumbra and expressed as a percentage of sham. The percentage of spared ascending dorsal column sensory terminals in the gracile nuclei was determined by the combined number of pixels of all sections on both sides. Only rats with normal CTB staining of the uninjured lumbar enlargement were included. One ALC-treated and three PBS-treated rats were excluded for this reason. To quantify blood vessels, LEA+ or RECA-1+ microvessels were counted in high resolution images of the spinal cord injury site as described previously.\n8\nBriefly, an 800\u2009\u00d7\u2009800\u2009\u03bcm grid with a 100\u2009\u03bcm cell size was centered directly above the central canal (dorsal assessment) or placed directly below with the left side of the grid vertically aligned with the central canal (ventral assessment).\n7\n,\n24\nThin tube-like structures (blood vessels) that intersect the horizontal or vertical grid lines were counted and the average number in three sections at the epicenter and penumbra expressed as a percentage of sham.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll analyses were done blinded to the treatment. Data are group averages \u00b1 standard error of the mean, and in most instances are expressed as a percentage of sham. All images were selected from rats and sections that represented their approximation to the group average. Student's\nt\n-test was used to assess statistical significance, except for BBB and footfall data which was analyzed using two-way repeated measures analysis of variance followed by Tukey\npost hoc\ntests. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 6 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). A\np\nvalue <0.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Study design\nThe overall objective of this study was to characterize the macrophage response to TBI in the presence or absence of accumulating A\u03b2 at both acute and chronic time points. Separate groups of R1.40 and non-Tg mice were used for acute and chronic studies. After surgical preparation, mice from each genotype were randomized to the TBI or sham group. Subsequent data analysis was performed by a separate investigator blinded to the experimental group. Power analyses were performed, and all sample sizes were selected based on a desire to reject the null hypothesis with a probability of 0.8. All subjects surviving to 3 DPI or 120 DPI were included in data analysis and no outliers were excluded.\n\nMice\nTo study the effects of TBI-induced inflammation in promoting AD-like phenotypes, we used the genomic-based R1.40 mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis, which contains the entire human\nAPP\ngene with the K670N/M671L familial AD mutation. This model modestly overexpresses (2.5X) all the different isoforms of human APP under endogenous human APP regulatory elements. R1.40 mice exhibit A\u03b2 deposition and memory impairments at advanced ages (12\u201319 mos), but also exhibit altered microglial activation and aberrant expression of cell cycle proteins within neurons (termed cell cycle events [CCEs]) as early as 6 months of age. Two-month old homozygous R1.40 mice maintained on the C57BL/6J genetic background were used for all studies. Age- and sex-matched non-Tg C57BL/6J animals served as controls for all studies. Animals were housed at the Cleveland Clinic Biological Resources Unit, and all procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nSurgical preparation and injury\nThe lateral FPI model of TBI was chosen for the current studies because FPI remains one of the most extensively used and well-characterized models of TBI. The microglial response after FPI has been well characterized, and evidence shows that there are multiple peaks of microglial activation occurring within the first week as well as several months post-injury corresponding with clinical pathology and behavioral deficits.\n22\n,\n23\nTaken together, these data suggest that the FPI represents an ideal model to study the effects of TBI-induced macrophage activation in promoting AD-like phenotypes.\nBriefly, at 2 months of age, all mice were anesthetized with a combination of ketamine (100\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg) and placed in a stereotaxic frame. Bupivacaine (0.25%, 50\u2009\u03bcL) was administered subcutaneously before midline incision. A 3.0\u2009mm craniotomy was trephined over the right parietal cortex midway between bregma and lambda leaving the dura intact. A modified Leur-Loc syringe (3.0\u2009mm inside diameter) was placed over the exposed dura and held in place by cyanoacrylate adhesive.\nAnimals recovered on a heating pad before being returned to their home cage. Twenty-four hours after surgical preparation, all mice were anesthetized with the same combination of ketamine and xylazine and connected to the FPI device. Animals in the injured group received a moderate level FPI (M\u2009=\u20091.0 atmospheres of extracranial pressure). Animals in the sham group were connected to the injury device; however, no fluid pulse was delivered. After FPI or sham injury, the syringe and adhesive were removed, and the incision was sutured. Mice were sacrificed at either 3 DPI or 130 DPI (1 week after completion of spatial memory testing in the water maze). This resulted in a two (TBI, sham) by two (R1.40, non-Tg) factorial design with four experimental groups (\nTable 1\n).\nTable\n1.\nAnimal Numbers Per Experiment\nPost-injury time point\nExperiments\nNon-Tg Sham\nNon-Tg TBI\nR1.40 TBI\nR1.40 Sham\n3 DPI\nImmunohistochemistry\n6\n6\n6\n6\nFlow cytometry\n3\n6\n7\n4\nWestern immunoblotting\n5\n6\n6\n5\nA\u03b2 ELISA\n4\n4\n4\n4\nMultiplex assay\n6\n6\n6\n6\nTOTAL\n15\n18\n19\n16\n120 DPI\nImmunohistochemistry\n6\n6\n6\n6\nWestern immunoblotting\n6\n6\n6\n6\nA\u03b2 ELISA\n5\n6\n6\n6\nMultiplex assay\n6\n6\n6\n6\nBehavioral testing\n13\n14\n12\n13\nTOTAL\n13\n14\n12\n13\nOpen in a separate window\nAfter traumatic brain injury (TBI) or sham injury, separate groups of mice were aged to 3 or 120 days post-injury (DPI). Brain tissue from the same subjects were used for Western immunoblotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and multiplex assay at 3 DPI as indicated by gray shading. At 120 DPI, half of the mice that completed behavioral testing were used for immunohistochemistry and half of the mice were used for biochemistry. Brain tissue from the same subjects was used for Western immunoblotting, ELISA, and multiplex assay at 120 DPI, as indicated by gray shading. Notably, a few extra samples were included per group at 120 DPI for behavioral testing.\n\nPrimary antibodies\nInflammatory markers\nRabbit polyclonal antibody against ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1; Wako); rat monoclonal anti-CD45 (Serotec); mouse monocloncal anti-F4/80 (Serotec); rat monoclonal anti-CD68 (Abcam); sheep polyclonal anti-TREM2 (R&D Systems); rabbit polyclonal anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, Sigma).\nAPP antibodies\nMouse monoclonal anti-human A\u03b2 (clone 6E10; Signet Labs); rabbit polyclonal anti-APP (clone CT15; kindly provided by Edward H. Koo).\nMicrotubule associated protein tau antibodies\nMouse monoclonal antibody against AT8 (pSer202+Thr205; Pierce), AT180 (pThr231; Pierce), and Tau5 (Invitrogen).\nOther antibodies\nMouse monoclonal antibody against glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Cell Signaling)\n\nWestern immunoblotting\nAt 3 DPI or 120 DPI, half of the mice in each group (\nn\n=\u20095\u20136 per group) were deeply anesthetized with tribromoethanol and transcardially perfused with ice-cold 0.1\u2009mol/L sodium phosphate buffer. Brain tissue was removed after perfusion and sagittally bisected into ispilateral and contralateral hemispheres. Microdissection was used to separate cortices. Ipsilateral cortical lysates were prepared by homogenizing in Tissue-Protein Extraction Reagent (T-PER, 78510; Pierce) with protease (P8340 Sigma-Aldrich) and phosphatase (P5726; Sigma-Aldrich) inhibitor cocktails. Brain protein (20\u2009\u03bcg) was run on a 4\u201312% Novex NuPage gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. The Western blots were then blocked with 5% milk and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in primary antibodies (CT15 1:5000; 6E10 1:5000; GAPDH 1:20,000; AT8 1:5000; AT180 1:2000; Tau5 1:5000).\nAfter incubation, blots were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with respective secondary antibodies. ECL reagent (NEL101001EA; Perkin Elmer) was used to develop the APP blots, and AlphaEaseFC\u2122 Software (Alpha Innotech Corporation) was used to quantify immunoreactive bands. Tau blots were probed with goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies, IRDye (Thermo SA5-10176) for 1\u2009h at a concentration of 1:10,000, and signal was measured and quantified using Odyssey\u00ae infrared imaging system (Li-Cor).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nHalf of the mice in each group (\nn\n=\u20095\u20136 per group) were deeply anesthetized with tribromoethanol and transcardially perfused with ice-cold 0.1\u2009mol/L sodium phosphate buffer at 3 DPI and 120 DPI. Whole brain samples were removed from the cranium and drop-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and stored at 4\u00b0C. The brains were subsequently cryoprotected in 30% surcrose/PBS and then embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound. Free floating, 30\u2009\u03bcm coronal sections were cut with a cryostat and processed for neuropathological analysis.\nThe following dilutions were used for primary antibodies: Iba1 1:500; CD45 1:500; F4/80 1:1000; CD68 1:500; Trem2: 1:50; CT15 1:500; all incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to biotin (Vector Laboratories; 1:200). Sections were incubated with Avidin/Biotinylated enzyme complex (ABC reagent, Vector Laboratories; for immunohistochemistry) reagent for 1\u2009h at room temperature followed by 3-3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB; Vector Laboratories) until a brown reaction was observed. Sections stained with GFAP (1:500) and AT8 (1:500) were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight followed by Alexa Fluor 488 and 546 secondary antibodies (Life Technologies).\n\nIsolation of microglia and monocytes and flow cytometry\nAt 3 DPI, mice from each experimental group were deeply anesthetized with tribromoethanol and transcardially perfused with 1x Hank balanced salt solution (HBSS). Brain tissue was removed and sagittally bisected. Microglia and monocytes were subsequently isolated using an optimized method as described previously.\n24\nThe ipsilateral (injured) hemisphere was collected in 4\u2009mL of HBSS and dispersed with a plunger digestion cocktail (9.5\u2009mL 1x HBSS, 50\u2009\u03bcL collagenase D, 10\u2009\u03bcL N-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethylketone (TLCK), 50\u2009\u03bcL DNase I, 25\u2009mg dispase, 100\u2009\u03bcL 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)) to wash the cells.\nAfter a 15-min incubation at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at 1800 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 7\u2009min at 18\u00b0C. The pellets were resuspended in a HBSS wash to remove the digestion cocktail and centrifuged again at 1800\u2009rpm for 7\u2009min at 18\u00b0C. After removal of the supernatant, pellets were resuspended in 10\u2009mL of 30% isotonic (ISP) Percoll. The ISP/cell suspension was overlaid on 2\u2009mL of 70% ISP and centrifuged at 800 rcf for 30\u2009min at 18\u00b0C. After centrifugation, 2\u2009mL of the 70%/30% interphase was collected in a clean conical tube with 10\u2009mL of HBSS. Samples were centrifuged at 2200\u2009rpm for 7\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. Finally, the cells were resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS containing BSA and sodium azide)/FC block for 5\u2009min at room temperature.\nThe following antibodies were used for cell surface staining of isolated microglia and monocytes: anti-mouse CDllb-PE (eBioscience, 1:100) anti-mouse CD45-APC (BioLegend, 1:500), anti-mouse F4/80 (BioLegend, 1:100). Flow cytometry was performed with a BD LSRFortessa (BD Bioscience) and analyzed using FlowJo software (version 9.3.1, TreeStar, Inc. Ashland, OR). All data were normalized to R1.40 sham for analysis.\n\nA\u03b2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\nThe level of A\u03b21-40 in ipsilateral cortical brain extracts from brain injured and sham R1.40 and non-Tg mice were determined by ELISA (Life Technologies). Homogenized brain tissue (also used for Western blots) was mixed gently at room temperature for 3\u20134\u2009h, diluted five-fold with Biosource sample/standard diluent containing 1xprotease inhibitors (Calbiochem). Samples were further diluted five-fold with sample/standard diluent (containing AEBSF [Sigma] protease inhibitor at 1\u2009mM), and the ELISA was performed as prescribed by the manufacturer. The plate was read using a fluorometric plate reader (Perkin/Elmer). Sample values were compared to a standard curve, and pmole/g brain values calculated.\n\nMultiplex assay\nIpsilateral cortical brain extracts were used for multiplex cytokine analysis. Samples were diluted 1:10, and total protein content was assessed in tissue samples using the bicininchronic acid (BCA) assay, following the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher, Cat# 23225), and cytokine levels were all normalized to total protein concentration. Multiplex analyses were conducted in Greiner, flat-bottom 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, Ref# 655096) according to the manufacturer's instructions using reagents provided with the kit (Invitrogen Mouse 20-plex Cytokine Panel, Cat# LMC0006M). In brief, 25\u2009\u03bcL of antibody-coupled bead solution was pipetted into each well. Samples were diluted 1:4 in assay diluent to a total volume of 100\u2009\u03bcL, with each well containing approximately 200\u2013300\u2009\u03bcg of total sample protein. One hundred microliters of reconstituted standard were serially diluted (1:3) and added to appropriate wells. Twenty-five microliters of T-Per in 75\u2009\u03bcL of assay diluent were used as a blank solution. Finally, 50\u2009\u03bcL of incubation buffer were added to all wells. Plates were kept light-protected during an overnight incubation (4\u00b0C, 16\u201318\u2009h) on a titer plate shaker (Thermo Scientific, model #4625Q) at 600\u2009rpm.\nAfter sample incubation, plates were washed with a mild detergent solution using a magnetic 96-well separator (Invitrogen Cat# A14179) three times (1\u2009min per wash). One hundred microliters of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated detection antibody were added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 1\u2009h (shaking at 600\u2009rpm). Plates were washed three times and 100\u2009\u03bcL of streptavidin-rpe were added to each well. After the 30\u2009min streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin incubation, plates were again washed three times followed by a final addition of 125\u2009\u03bcL wash solution to all wells. After 3\u2009min of vigorous shaking, plates were read on a Luminex Magpix unit (Life Technologies), and initial analyses were performed by Xponent software and results exported into Microsoft Excel for further processing. Sample size was set to 50\u2009\u03bcL, and minimum count was set to 100 events/bead region.\n\nLesion analysis\nSections transversing the lesion cavity from \u22120.20 to \u22123.50\u2009mm from bregma were selected and imaged using Quickscan via Pathscan Enabler IV. Image J was used to create a stack of images from each brain sample. Image Stacks were imported to Reconstruct software\n25\nfor volumetric analysis and three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction. First, the entire coronal section was outlined so that ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres were similar in size. Then the lesion cavity was outlined, and a percentage ratio to the entire coronal section was calculated and compared across groups. The ipsilateral hippocampus from \u22120.20 to \u22123.50\u2009mm from bregma was also outlined, and a percentage ratio to the remaining tissue was calculated and compared across groups (9 sections, 330\u2009\u03bcm apart). A subset of sections was stained with cresyl violet, but because no discernible differences were detected between brain injured groups, final lesion analysis was completed on Iba1 stained sections.\n\nMorphometric analysis of microglia and immunoreactivity\nMorphometric analysis of microglial activation was performed on Iba1-stained sections (-1.94 from bregma). Images were acquired at 20X objective using Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics) as described previously.\n26\nAnalyzed images were taken from the ipsilateral-cortex, both lateral and medial to the injury site, the ipsilateral-thalamus, and the contralateral-CA2 region from six animals per group. Form factor (FF) measures contour irregularity of a cell by the formula (4 x \u03c0 x Ac)/Pc\n2\n, where Ac is the area and Pc is the perimeter of the cell. FF values are higher in activated microglia, which are characterized by large cell bodies with numerous, sparsely ramified processes. To quantify the percent area of immunostaining, stained images were taken at 20X objective and converted to gray scale after background subtraction in Adobe Photoshop. Adjusted gray scale images were then imported into Image J and converted to thresholded binary images for quantification.\n\nBehavioral analysis\nRotarod\nBalance and coordination was assessed with a standard rotarod test (Rotamex, Columbus Instruments). All animals received baseline training on the rotarod 24\u2009h before surgical preparation. Post-injury motor assessment was completed at 1, 3, 6, 30, 60, and 90 DPI. Animals completed three 5-min trials on each testing day. Rod rotation increased from 4\u2009rpm to 30\u2009rpm during each trial. An average latency to fall was calculated for each testing day and compared between groups.\nY maze\nThe y maze was used to evaluate time dependent changes in post-injury spatial working memory. Animals completed one 5-min trial at 7, 30, 60, and 90 DPI. At the beginning of each trial, a mouse was placed in the center of the Y maze and allowed to freely explore for the entire trial. Total arm entries and spontaneous alternations between arms was recorded for each testing day and compared between groups.\nWater maze\nA standard version of the Morris water maze (MWM) was used to assess spatial learning and reference memory beginning at 120 DPI. A traditional version of memory testing was completed 120\u2013125 DPI. Animals were placed in the pool at one of four start locations and given 60\u2009sec to locate a submerged goal platform that remained in the same location throughout memory testing. Animals remained on the platform for 15\u2009sec after 60\u2009sec elapsed or after they located the platform on their own.\nA single probe trial, in which the goal platform was removed, was completed at 126 DPI approximately 24\u2009h after the last memory trial. After the probe trial, four visible platform trials were completed. During visible platform trials, animals were placed in the pool at one of four start locations and given 60\u2009sec to locate a visible goal platform that was placed in a new location for each trial. Mice were sacrificed the following week at 130 DPI.\nAll trials were analyzed with EthoVision XT (Noldus) video tracking software. Two learning indices were used to evaluate within- and between-day learning in the water maze task.\n27\nThe acquisition index measures within-day learning averaged across all training days, where t\nF\nand t\nL\nare the latency to reach the platform from the first and last trials of the day, respectively, and k is the number of days of training in the water maze: ([t\nF\nd\n1\n-t\nL\nd\n1\n] +\u2009\u2026\u2009+ [t\nF\nd\nk\n-t\nL\nd\nk\n])/\nk\n. The savings index measures between-day learning averaged across all training days, where the difference is calculated between the latency to reach the platform on last trial of a day and the first trial of the subsequent day: ([t\nL\nd\n1\n-t\nF\nd\n2\n] +\u2009\u2026\u2009+[t\nL\nd\nk-1\n-t\nF\nd\nk\n])/\nk\n.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). All statistical analysis was completed with SPSS Version 22 or GraphPad Prism 5. A mixed model factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate group differences. Student\nt\ntest (two-tailed, unpaired) was used to evaluate time dependent changes in lesion size and Y maze. ANOVA with repeated measures was used to classify group differences in rotarod and MWM performance. The between factors were genotype and injury, and the within-group factor was day of testing. Main effects and interaction effects were considered. Multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to analyze multiplex data. Non-normally distributed multiplex data was log-transformed before MANOVA. Statistical significance was determined at\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Patients\nThis was a prospective interventional study performed between March 2012 and October 2014 on consecutive patients with severe TBI admitted to the Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland. Subjects had severe TBI (defined by a Glasgow Coma Scale score <\u20099), an abnormal head CT scan (defined by a Marshall score \u2265\u20092), and underwent intracranial monitoring \u2013 consisting of CMD and ICP \u2013 as part of standard care. The present investigation specifically focused on the relationship between the sparing-glucose effect of HL and patient CMD LPR and CBF: a subset of the cohort presented here (15/24 patients) was described in our previous study.\n8\nApproval for the study was obtained from the local Ethical Committee, and informed consent was obtained from each patient's next of kin and from an independent physician.\n\nSystemic monitoring\nPatients were treated according to a written institutional algorithm for the treatment of severe TBI, based on international guidelines and as previously described by our group.\n16\nSedation-analgesia consisted of propofol and sufentanil. Arterial blood concentrations of glucose and lactate were collected hourly, simultaneously to CMD samples, using an intra-arterial catheter.\n\nCerebral microdialysis monitoring\nCerebral metabolic monitoring was performed using an intra-parenchymal CMA 70 catheter with a 20\u2009kDa cut-off, perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid via a CMA 106 pump at a rate of 0.3\u2009\u03bcL/min (CMA Microdialysis AB, Stockholm, Sweden). Brain extracellular samples were collected every 60\u2009min and immediately analyzed at the bedside for concentrations of glucose, lactate, and pyruvate, using a kinetic enzymatic analyzer (ISCUS\nflex\n; CMA Microdialysis AB). The CMD catheter was inserted in the operating room by an experienced neurosurgeon through a multiple-lumen bolt (Integra Neurosciences, Plainsboro, NJ) and was placed in the right frontal lobe, in apparently normal sub-cortical white matter. Adjacent to the CMD catheter, a Codman\n\u00ae\nICP monitor (Codman, Raynham, MA) was inserted for continuous measurement of ICP. The appropriate location of all monitors was assessed by a follow-up head CT scan, performed within the first 24\u2009h from intensive care unit (ICU) admission.\n\nPerfusion CT\nPerfusion acquisitions were realized during the first control head CT scan, using a LightSpeed multi-detector row CT system (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI). Scanning was initiated 5\u2009sec after injection of 50\u2009mL of iohexol (300\u2009mg/mL of iodine; GE Healthcare Europe, Glattbrugg, Switzerland), perfused at a rate of 5\u2009mL/sec with the following parameters: 80\u2009kV, 240\u2009mAs, 0.4 rotations/sec, total duration of 50\u2009sec. The series evaluated 16 adjacent 5-mm-thick sections of brain parenchyma. A dedicated software (Brilliance Workspace Portal\n\u00ae\n; Philips Medical Systems, Cleveland, OH), which employs the central volume principle using deconvolution to measure mean transit time (MTT), was used. Cerebral blood volume (CBV) was calculated from the time-enhancement curves, and global CBF was derived from the equation: CBF\u2009=\u2009CBV/MTT. Three-dimensional reconstruction was processed with Carestream Vue PACS\n\u00ae\n(Carestream Health, Rochester, NY) using a series of the thin-slice enhanced brain CT. Regions of interest (ROI) were selected in line with our previous studies providing an accurate quantitative assessment of CBV, MTT, and CBF of each hemisphere.\n14\n,\n15\nA global value of CBV, MTT, and CBF was calculated by averaging values from right and left hemispheres. Post-processing of PCT data was performed by an experienced neuroradiologist who was blinded to CMD variables.\n\nStudy intervention\nIntervention consisted of a continuous infusion of hypertonic sodium lactate (Na\n+\n1000\u2009mmol/L and lactate 1000\u2009mmol/L, prepared by the Division of Pharmacy, CHUV, Lausanne, Switzerland), administered over 3\u2009h, at a concentration of 30\u201340\u2009\u03bcmol/kg/min, initiated as soon as possible following PCT. Dosing and timing of the therapy were based on previous clinical trials conducted on healthy subjects\n17\u201319\nand critically ill patients,\n20\naiming to reach a steady concentration of arterial blood lactate of about 4\u20135\u2009mmol/L.\n\nData collection and processing\nPatient characteristics and radiological variables included age, admission Glasgow Coma Scale score, Marshall CT-scan score, time from TBI to CMD monitoring and to the start of HL, time from PCT to the start of HL, and duration of intracranial monitoring.\nPatients were categorized into two subgroups according to a) baseline CMD LPR, using LPR >25 as the threshold of impaired cerebral oxidative metabolism and increased energy demand, in line with previous studies\n9\n,\n10\n; and b) baseline global CBF, dichotomized as normal versus. oligemic, defined by a CBF <32.5\u2009mL/100\u2009g/min. This cut-off for global CBF was based on our previous PCT studies in TBI patients and was set to be at least 2 standard deviations below normal CBF.\n14\n,\n15\nCMD samples were analyzed hourly, simultaneously to arterial blood gas analysis. Baseline CMD values were defined as the single value taken from the sample immediately preceding the start of HL. Systemic values were recorded continuously and were then matched to timely CMD samples.\n\nStatistical analysis\nDynamic hourly changes of arterial blood and CMD glucose and lactate concentrations from baseline (T0), during HL (T0\u20133\u2009h), and up to 12\u2009h were first graphically plotted. For comparisons, longitudinal data analysis was used to account for repeated measures of physiological variables over time across different patients. Statistical analysis was conducted with a mixed-effects multi-level regression model, with time entered as an independent variable and allowing it to have a random intercept and a random slope according to the patient. A correlation coefficient (with 95% CI) was obtained, which corresponded to the change of the variable during the time of HL. This analysis was conducted in the total population and in predefined sub-groups. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 12 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX), and statistical significance was set at\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Animals\nSixteen rats were used (female Sprague-Dawley; Harlan, Inc., San Diego, CA) that were 210\u2013240\u2009g (222.68\u2009\u00b1\u20092.16\u2009g) at the beginning of the experiment and between 3 and 4 months of age. All the rats were right-paw dominant as determined by their preference to pull with the right hand during the GSM assessments and interaction with RUE. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California, Irvine, approved all experimental protocols utilized in this experiment.\nRats were handled for three weeks prior to device acclimation. They were maintained on a food-restricted diet in which they received 85% of a normal daily intake as a means to incentivize them to participate during training sessions. Rats were weighed weekly to monitor overall health.\n\nRobotic rehabilitator of the rodent upper extremity (RUE)\nWe designed a robotic system, RUE, to assess and train the forelimb strength of rats in a self-initiated task that consisted in reaching for and pulling on a bar to retrieve a food reward. The system includes a one degree-of-freedom resistance-based trainer, an automated food reward mechanism, and an acrylic box (15.25\u2009\u00d7\u200930.50\u2009\u00d7\u200930.50\u2009cm) to house the rats during training (\nFig. 1A\n). The width of the box is divided into two halves by means of an opaque acrylic divider to force the rat to pull the bar with a specific forelimb. All assessments in this study were carried out using the right paw.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nRobotic Rehabilitator of the Rodent Upper Extremity (RUE).\n(A)\nThe device is composed of a low-friction, backdriveable linear actuator, automated food dispenser, and an acrylic box to house the animal during training. Animals were trained to retrieve a food reward,\n(B)\nplaced outside of the acrylic box and out of their reach, by pulling on a bar\n(C)\nthat was coupled to the linear actuator. Once the animal pulled the food through the window, the animal could retrieve it with the mouth\n(D)\n. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nRats interacted with the trainer by means of a custom-made metal bar coupled to a voice coil actuator (VCS10-023-BS-01-MH; H2W Technologies Inc., Santa Clarita, CA) that generated the prescribed forces during the assessments. In its resting position, the bar was placed 3\u2009cm above the floor of the acrylic box and in its resting position was within reach for the animals inside the acrylic box (\nFig. 1\n). A linear potentiometer (LCP12A-25-10K; ETI Systems, Carlsbad, CA) was coupled to the voice coil actuator to measure its position. The resistance-based trainer was programmed to behave as a linear spring where resistance force was controlled by varying the spring's stiffness coefficient.\nSuccessful trials were defined as those where the animal pulled past a distance of 2.3\u2009cm and were rewarded with 20\u2009mg chocolate-flavored food pellets (Bio Serv, Frenchtown, NJ). The pellets were delivered to a custom-made food tray placed on the opposite end of the metal bar (\nFig. 1B\n) using an automatic food pellet dispenser (ENV-2030-20; Med Associates Inc., St. Albans, VT) or by placing them in the tray by hand. In its resting state, the bar was retracted so that the food tray remained out of reach behind the front acrylic panel. The reinforced behavior was to bring the food tray within reach by pulling on the bar (\nFig. 1C\n) far enough forward to retrieve the food pellet with the mouth (\nFig. 1D\n). We programmed the robot to hold the bar in the feeding position for two seconds once the rat pulled the food into the chamber and past the 2.3\u2009cm distance. After this period, the robot retracted to its resting position with a large force. There was a possibility that if the animal refused to let go the paw would have been dragged into the window and injured. However, we did not see evidence of this, and the rats never stopped engaging with the device.\nWe used a USB Data Acquisition board (NI-6009; National Instruments, Austin, TX) interfaced with MATLAB (The MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA) to control the robot and record data at a sampling rate of 1000\u2009Hz. A custom-made user interface was created in MATLAB for the animal trainers to set up and run the assessments.\n\nMeasuring forelimb force production\nWe measured the forelimb force production of each rat once per week using both the GSM and RUE. Concurrent assessments were conducted for 87 days pre-lesion and 200 days post-lesion. On 2 other days each week, all rats performed 3\u2009min strength training sessions with RUE. Briefly, rats were trained with either a constant force\u2014set at a value much lower than their maximum strength\u2014or with an adaptive algorithm that progressively required increasing force production so as to assess maximum strength.\n11\u201313\nGSM\nWe followed the procedure previously developed for use with the GSM in SCI models.\n14\nBriefly, the rats were held around the midsection with one forearm restrained by the experimenter and the unrestrained forepaw was brought in contact with the GSM (TSE Systems; Sci Pro, Inc., Sanborn, NY). The rat was held in place until it grasped the bar and then was gently pulled away from the bar by the experimenter. To discount the possible influence of spasticity, the experimenter performed a visual inspection of the hand after the rat released the bar, as specified previously for this assessment.\n15\nIf the fingers remained in a clawed position, then the experimenter registered the measurement as a zero.\n15\nIf the fingers did not remain in a clawed position, the grip strength was defined as the maximal force recorded by the GSM before the rats released the bar. This maximal force was recorded for four attempts and its average computed in each assessment.\nRUE\nThe procedure for the robot-based assessments on the assessment day was as follows. First, the rat was allowed to pull for four to five times without resistance on the bar to reinforce the task-reward pairing. The bar was then blocked by increasing the stiffness coefficient of the robot to a value above the rat's pulling capability. Finally, the rat was allowed to pull for three to five repetitions while the bar was in the blocked state. We then recorded the maximum pulling force exerted during the blocked trials as the rat's maximum forelimb strength for each assessment session. Because the rat voluntarily reached for and gripped the bar and therefore had to voluntarily extend its digits and wrap them around the bar before pulling, it would have been unable to properly complete the task if spasms were present. We therefore did not exclude trials due to the rats' paw configuration after pulling.\n\nLesion of the spinal cord\nFor surgery, rats were anesthetized with 1.5\u20133.0% isoflurane (Western Medical Supply, Inc., Arcadia, CA). Hair overlaying the cervical vertebra was removed by shaving with clippers, the skin was treated with betadine and incised, and the multiple muscle layers overlaying the cervical vertebral column were bluntly dissected. A dorsal laminectomy at C5 was performed with rongeurs. The rat was placed in the stabilizing platform with Addison forceps providing stability rostral and caudal to the laminectomy. The impactor probe (2.5mm probe) was centered over the exposed spinal cord to the right of the dorsal vein. Unilateral mild lesions with 100kD of force were created using the Infinite Horizons (IH) Impactor (Precision Systems & Instrumentation, Lexington, KY). After generating the lesion, the muscle was sutured in layers with 5-0 chromic gut (Henry Schein, Melville, NY) and the skin was closed with 9\u2009mm staples (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA).\nFollowing surgery, rats were immediately placed on a water-circulating heating pad until they recovered from the anesthetic. Post-surgical care included delivery of lactated Ringer's (5\u2009mL/100\u2009g, subcutaneously) for hydration for 3 days and Baytril (enroflaxacin 2.5\u2009mL/kg, subcutaneously; Western Medical Supplies, Arcadia, CA) for 7 days for prophylaxis against urinary tract infections. The analgesic Buprnex (buprenorphine, 0.01\u2009mg/kg; Western Medical Supplies) was given for 3 days for pain management. Staples were removed at 14 days post-injury. Rats were housed three to four per cage and were monitored twice daily for general health, coat quality (indicative of normal grooming activity), and mobility within the cage. Rats with cervical contusion injuries typically resume these activities the day following injury. In addition, signs of paralysis were monitored, including lack of hind limb movement, tail flaccidity, and unstable/uncoordinated movement. Rats also were monitored for skin lesions on the paralyzed limbs or autophagia of the toes.\n\nHistology\nAt the end of the testing period (approximately 321 days post-injury), rats were killed with an overdose of Euthasol\n\u00ae\n(Delmarva Laboratories, Inc., Richmond, VA) and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. Dissected spinal cords were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1\u2009M buffered phosphate at 4\u00b0C. Whole spinal cords were cryo-protected in 27% sucrose prior to embedding in Tissue-Tek\n\u00ae\n(VWR, Radnor, PA) and flash freezing. A 7\u2009mm segment of the spinal cord centered around the lesion epicenter was collected. Cross-sections measuring 20\u2009\u03bcm were taken and thaw mounted onto microscope slides. Sets of three slides were made such that sections on each slide were 200\u2009\u03bcm apart and the full 7\u2009mm length of the spinal cord was represented on each slide.\n\nStaining\nOne set of slides was stained with Ehrlich's Hematoxylin and Eosin. Sections were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (Fisher, Pittsburg, PA), dehydrated through graded ethanols, and de-fatted in Xylenes (Fisher, Pittsburg, PA). Slides were hydrated through graded ethanols to water, stained in Ehrlich's Hematoxylin, washed in water, differentiated in 1% hydrochloric acid in 70% ethanol, washed again in water, blued in 10% ammonium hydroxide, washed again in water, then equilibrated in 95% ethanol before staining in eosin. Excess eosin was removed in 95% ethanol, the slides completely dehydrated in 100% ethanol, cleared in Xylenes, and cover-slipped with DPX.\n\nData analysis\nWe used ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) to measure the areas of healthy and injured gray and white matter. We focused on those sections at or near the lesion epicenter. Values were expressed as a percentage of the ratio between injured to non-injured halves. The reduction in size was calculated as the ratio between the injured to the uninjured side. We calculated this for the overall hemicord, gray matter alone, and white matter alone.\nWe measured the reduction in force capability for each rat using a linear regression model (Equation 1; BPF\u2009=\u2009\u03b2\n0\n+ \u03b2\n1\n* DPI + \u03b2\n2\n* InjuryState + \u03b2\n3\n* DPI * InjuryState), where the BPF was regressed on two factors: 1) the days post-injury (DPI), \u03b2\n1\n; and 2) the injury state (set as 0 pre-injury and 1 post-injury), \u03b2\n2\n, and their interaction, \u03b2\n3\n. The reduction in force capability was thus defined as the absolute change in force (in grams) from pre- to post-injury defined by \u03b2\n2\n. \u03b2\n0\nis the y-intercept of the overall model.\nEssentially, this means we fit a line to the pre-injury measurements over time, then a second line to the post-injury measurement over time, then measured the difference in the values of the lines at the injury time-point. All statistical analyses were done using MATLAB (The MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA). All measurements reported as significant fall below a significance level of \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Patient population\nThis study included prospectively collected data from 40 TBI patients (32 males [80%], 8 females [20%]; population mean age, 35\u2009\u00b1\u200915 years), hospitalized in the Neurocritical Care Unit of Addenbrooke's Hospital (Cambridge, UK) between 2013 and 2015. Patients were sedated, ventilated, and managed in the Neurocritical Care Unit with a therapeutic protocol aiming for an ICP <25\u2009mm Hg and CPP around 60\u201370\u2009mm Hg. The median pre-intubation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of the patients was 6 (range, 3\u201314). The data included daily recordings of ABP, ICP, and TCD, in a total of 66 recordings. Informed consent was obtained from all patients (or their next of kin) for the use of collected data for research purposes. The study was approved by the research ethics committee (29 REC 97/291).\n\nData collection and calculations\nFor ABP recordings, a pressure monitoring kit (Baxter Healthcare Health Care Corp. Cardio Vascular Group, Irvine, CA) at the radial artery was used, zeroed at the level of the heart. ICP monitoring was performed by an intraparenchymal probe (Codman ICP MicroSensor; Codman & Shurtleff, Raynham, MA). Cerebral blood FV was obtained from the MCA, bilaterally when possible, with a 2-MHz probe and monitored with the Doppler Box (DWL Compumedics Ltd, Singen, Germany). TCD recordings were performed for periods ranging from 10\u2009min up to 1\u2009h, starting from the day of initiation of invasive ICP monitoring. An analog-digital converter was used to digitize the raw data signals at a sampling frequency of 50\u2009Hz, which were then recorded using ICM+ software (Cambridge Enterprise:\nhttp://www.neurosurg.cam.ac.uk/icmplus/\n). All calculations, including mean values of ABP, ICP, and FV, were performed over a moving average window of 10\u2009sec. For FV, the right MCA was chosen because the intraparenchymal ICP probe was inserted on the right side, but in recordings which right FV was of poor quality and left side was better, the left side was taken instead.\n\nNoninvasive intracranial pressure methods\nThe four methods used for nICP estimation in this study were:\n1)\u2002Schmidt and colleagues \u201cblack-box\u201d (BB) model\n20\n(\nnICP_BB\n): In this model, the intracranial compartment was considered a black-box system. This mathematical model is based on results from systems analysis, which provides a method to describe systems, in particular, physiological systems, with input and output signals. The outgoing signals are considered the system's responses to its stimulation by incoming signals. In this case, the intracranial compartment was indirectly described by a transfer function approach,\n31\n,\n32\nwhich connected the assumed input signal ABP with the output signal ICP (nICP). The transformation rules between ABP and ICP were controlled and continuously adjusted by selected hemodynamic parameters (TCD characteristics), characterizing patterns of FV as well as the ABP-FV relationship. The output data provide full waveform of nICP (in mm Hg). A constant relationship between FV-ABP and ABP-nICP transformations was derived from analysis of database including 140 TBI patients. Noninvasive ICP estimation using this method was performed using a plugin developed for ICM+ software. An illustrative representation of this model is presented in\nFigure 1\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSchematic representation of the black-box model for nICP estimation. A known transfer function between ABP and FV alongside modification (transcranial Doppler ultrasonography) characteristics is used as a means to continuously find a relationship between ABP and nICP transformations (unknown transfer function). ABP, arterial blood pressure; FV, flow velocity; nICP, noninvasive assessment of intracranial pressure.\n2)\u2002Czosnyka and colleagues\n29\n(\nnICP_FVd\n): TCD ultrasonography offers nonquantitative measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF). Global changes in CBF can be monitored continuously and noninvasively using blood FV.\n33\nOver this concept, some studies have demonstrated that specific patterns of TCD waveform reflect inadequate cerebral perfusion caused by a decrease in CPP.\n29\n,\n34\nIn such cases, there is a drop in diastolic FV, whereas the systolic component remains relatively unchanged (as illustrated in\nFig. 2\n). These characteristics observed in the CBF velocity waveform pattern can be used as indicators of perfusion derangements and have been applied as variables for nCPP estimation. For this method, based on waveform analysis of blood FV measured in the MCA, the diastolic FV was used for the estimation of nCPP. nICP, on the other hand, was calculated as the difference between ABP and nCPP (nICP\u2009=\u2009ABP \u2013 nCPP). The equation for nCPP estimation was (\nEquation 1\n):\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nSystolic and diastolic flow velocities behaviour during a drop of cerebral perfusion pressure. Low FVd component in this case indicates inadequate CPP (resulting from plateau increase of intracranial pressure). CPP, cerebral perfusion pressure; FVs, systolic flow velocity; FVd, diastolic flow velocity.\nFVd\nand\nFVm\n(cm/s) represent diastolic and mean FV, respectively. 14\u2009mm Hg is \u201czero compensation factor\u201d established in a cohort of TBI patients.\n29\n3)\u2002Varsos and colleagues\n30\n(\nnICP_CrCP\n): Similarly, this method calculates nICP based on nCPP, in this case specifically using the concept of critical closing pressure (CrCP). According to Burton's model, CrCP is equal to the sum of ICP and vascular wall tension (WT)\n35\n,\n36\n: CrCP\u2009=\u2009ICP + WT. By definition, CrCP denotes a threshold of ABP, below which the brain microvascular blood pressure is inadequate to prevent the collapse and cessation of blood flow.\n35\nGiven the association of CrCP with the vasomotor tone of small blood vessels (i.e., wall tension), this concept may be able to provide information regarding the state of cerebral hemodynamics in several neurological conditions\n35\n,\n37\u201340\nand for this method was applied as a variable for nCPP estimation.\nFigure 3\nillustrates the concept of CrCP, showing its interaction with ICP and WT in a situation of ICH. The equation for nCPP estimation is (\nEquation 2\n):\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nRepresentation of the CrCP interaction with ICP and WT in a situation of intracranial hypertension (plateau increase of ICP). ABP, arterial blood pressure; CrCP, critical closing pressure; ICP, intracranial pressure; WT, vascular wall tension.\nCVR\n(mmHg/(cm/sec)) represents cerebral vascular resistance,\nCa\n(cm/mmHg) denotes compliance of the cerebral arterial bed, and\nHR\nexpresses heart rate (beats/sec), with ABP and FV as the required measurements. Finally, nICP can be obtained as the difference between ABP and nCPP (nICP\u2009=\u2009ABP \u2013 nCPP). Constant coefficients (0.734, 0.266, and 7.026\u2009mm Hg) are derived from analysis of database of 232 retrospective cases.\n30\n4)\nnICP_PI\n: Pulsatility index (PI) describes quantitatively and qualitatively changes in the morphology of the TCD waveform resulting from cerebrovascular resistance (CVR) changes. It is a relationship between the difference of FVs (systolic flow velocity) and FVd divided by FVm (\nFig. 4\n;\nEquation 4\n). PI-based methods rely on the observation that during rise in ICP, PI increases. However, there are several situations in which PI may increase independently of an increase in ICP. This may occur, for example, during lowering in CPP (which may involve either a rise in ICP or a decrease in ABP) and also during hypocapnia or increase in pulsatility of ABP waveform. nICP estimation based on TCD-derived PI was derived from the linear regression among known values of ICP and PI from a population cohort of 292 TBI patients. The regression equation was based on data analysed by Budohoski and colleagues\n41\nand given by\nEquations 3\nand\n4\n:\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 4.\nRepresentation of the flow velocity components (FVs, FVd, and FVm) used for pulsatility index calculation. CBF, cerebral blood flow; FVs, systolic flow velocity; FVd, diastolic flow velocity; FVm, mean flow velocity.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis of the data was conducted with OriginPro statistical software (version 8; OriginLab Corporation, Wellesley, MA). The analysis included correlations between noninvasive ICP estimators and measured ICP in terms of mean values, with\nR\nrepresenting the Pearson's correlation coefficient, with the level of significance set at 0.05. Results are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). Bland-Altman's method was used to determine the agreement between invasive ICP and the different nICP methods, with their respective 95% CI for prediction and bias. The CI represents the method's estimation performance and contemplates the range of values around the bias (absolute difference between mean values of nICP and ICP) in which data can be found with a significance level of 0.05. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was applied to determine the ability of the noninvasive methods to predict raised ICP (using a threshold of 17\u2009mm Hg). This threshold was chosen because of its proximity to values that would commonly prompt treatment in the clinical setting (normally above 20\u201325\u2009mm Hg\n1\n). The predicting ability is considered reasonable when the AUC is higher than 0.7 and strong when the AUC exceeds 0.8.\n42\nFor recordings in which mean ICP changes were greater than 7\u2009mm Hg, averaged correlation between ICP and nICP methods was calculated in time domain, as well as correlation between \u0394ICP and \u0394nICP. In this case, \u201c\u0394\u201d is the difference between maximum and minimum mean value in each recording during ICP changes."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nAdult male Wistar rats (10 weeks old, 270\u2013300\u2009g body weight), obtained from the animal house of the Department of Pharmacology, Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC, Florian\u00f3polis, Brazil) were used throughout the experiments. Animals were housed in a room maintained at a constant temperature (22\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00b0C) and humidity (60\u201380%), under a 12/12\u2009h light/dark cycle and with food and water available\nad libitum.\nAll procedures were approved by the UFSC Ethics Committee (approval no. 23080.008708/2010-41) and were in agreement with the National Institutes of Health Animal Care Guidelines (NIH Publications no. 80-23).\n\nSurgical procedure\nSCI was induced as previously described\n17\nwith the following modifications: animals were previously treated with a single dose of wide spectrum antibiotic (oxytetracyclinchloridrate, 300\u2009mg/kg, intramuscular). For surgery, rats were anesthetized with a 1:1 mixture of xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg) and ketamine (70\u2009mg/kg) given i.p. A 2-cm incision was made in the dorsal midline and the vertebral body was exposed. The paraspinal muscles were dissected from the T9 to T12 spinous processes and moved laterally with the aid of a forceps. After removal of the spinous process at the T10\u2013T11 vertebral level, a small hole (1.5\u2009mm diameter) at the T11 level was made with the help of a dental drill. This hole allowed the visualization of the spinal cord with the intact dura and the insertion of an embolectomy catheter (2-French Fogarty; Lemaitre Catheters, Burlington, VT).\nBefore each surgical procedure, the catheter diameter was calibrated to 3.0\u2009mm with the aid of a caliper and a syringe pre-filled with distilled water. Following calibration, the catheter was inserted and advanced cranially for 1\u2009cm, so that the center of the balloon rested at the level of the T10 vertebra. Then, the balloon was gently inflated up to a diameter of 3\u2009mm, maintained during 1\u2009min, deflated, and slowly removed. Muscles and skin were sutured in anatomical layers. Sham-operated animals were submitted to the same protocol; however, the catheter was not inserted into the epidural space. During the first 15 to 20 days post-SCI, urinary bladders were manually emptied twice daily, until micturition was restored.\nAnimal care procedures before and after surgery followed protocols previously decribed\n18\nas well as the MASCIS (Multicenter Animal Spinal Cord Injury Study; PMID 8863191). Rats were divided into three experimental groups: na\u00efve (no surgical intervention), sham-operated (surgical intervention, without catheter insertion), and SCI (surgical intervention with catheter insertion and inflation). SCI and sham-operated groups were euthanized at different times following surgery, and accounted for different phases of post-surgery recovery: 1) early phase of recovery (2, 6, and 24\u2009h); 2) intermediate phase of recovery (14 days); and 3) late phase of recovery (28 days).\n\nEvaluation of motor behavior\nBasso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) open-field locomotion scale scoring was performed to evaluate the motor behavior of the SCI and sham-operated groups.\n19\nRats were placed individually in an open field. The 22-point (0\u201321) BBB scale was used to assess hindlimb locomotor recovery including joint movements, stepping ability, coordination, and trunk stability. A score of 21 indicates that an animal has consistent coordination and stability. The early stage of recovery shows paralysis and absence of limb movements and is given a score of 0. The animals were evaluated by two blinded researchers every 2 days from day 0 to day 28 following surgery in 5-min-long sessions.\n\nHistopathology and immunohistochemistry\nSections 4-mm thick were obtained from paraffin-embedded rat spinal cords and immunohistochemistry detection was performed using polyclonal rabbit anti-GIPR antibody (1:300, kind gift of T.J. Kieffer, University of British Columbia, Canada), monoclonal rabbit anti-GIP antibody (1:250, LifeSpan BioSciences, Seattle, WA), or monoclonal mouse anti-nestin antibody (1:100, Millipore/Chemicon, Billerica, MA). Following quenching of endogenous peroxidase with 1.5% hydrogen peroxide in methanol (v/v) for 20\u2009min, high-temperature antigen retrieval was performed by immersing the slides in a holder containing 10\u2009mM trisodium citrate buffer pH 6.0, which in turn was immersed in a water bath at 95\u201398\u00b0C for 45\u2009min, as previously described.\n14\nThe sections were incubated overnight in a humid chamber at room temperature with the primary antibodies described above. Then, slides were processed using the appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody and the streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) complex (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, sections were developed with DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA) in chromogen solution for an identical period and were further counterstained with Harris's hematoxylin. For double staining immunofluorescence reaction, sections were processed as described above, but the primary antibodies (anti-GIP/anti-nestin or anti-GIPR/anti-nestin) were simultaneously incubated overnight at 2\u20138\u00b0C. Next, slides were processed using chicken anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (1:300, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), during 2\u2009h at room temperature. After incubation, sections were rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and coversliped with aqueous mounting media (Vectashield; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Tissues from rats in control and SCI groups were placed on the same slide and processed under the exact same conditions. Negative control experiments included omission of primary antibody as well as substitution of the primary antibody by equivalent dilutions of non-immune rabbit or mouse immunoglobulin (IgG) serum, using the same staining protocol.\n\nImaging and image analysis\nRelative quantification of GIP and GIPR immunostaining was performed as previously described.\n20\nTwo to three images from each section were captured using a Sight DS-5M-L1 digital camera (Nikon, Melville, NY) connected to an optical microscope (Eclipse 50i; Nikon) at 400x magnification. A threshold optical density (OD) that best discriminated staining from the background was obtained using the NIH ImageJ 1.36b imaging software (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Thresholds were determined using the Threshold Colour Plugins tool in NIH Image where images were tested at different thresholds to select the optimal contrast between positive staining and background staining. This threshold was record using the Macro Plugins tool in NIH Image and applied for all images. Total pixel intensity was determined and data were expressed as OD. The immunofluorescence samples were examined in a confocal microscope (DMI6000 B Microscope; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Lahn-Dill, Germany). Data are shown as the average value from images of areas neighboring the site of injury.\n\nRNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR analysis\nSpinal cord tissue from sham-operated or injured-animals were homogenized in 0.1\u2009mL TRIzol\n\u00a9\n(Invitrogen), and ribonucleic acid (RNA) extraction was performed according to manufacturer's instructions. Purity and integrity of RNA were determined by the 260/280\u2009nm absorbance ratio. Only preparations with ratios >1.8 were used in real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments. One \u03bcg RNA was used for complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) synthesis using the Super-Strand III Reverse Transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). Expression of genes of interest was analyzed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) on an Applied Biosystems 7500 RT\u2013PCR system using the Power SYBR kit (Applied Biosystems). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as endogenous control. The following primers pairs were used:\nGIP forw: 5\u2032-CTCTTTGCCCAAGAGCCTCA- 3\u2032, GIP rev: 5\u2032-ATCAGAAGGTCCCTCAGCACA-3\u2032, GIPR forw: 5\u2032-TTCCCAGAAAGATGTGTCTCC-3\u2032, and GIPR rev: 50 -CCCACCCCATAAAGAAGCT-3\u2032.\nCycle threshold (Ct) values were used to calculate fold changes in gene expression using the 2\n-\u0394C\nt method. In all cases, reactions were performed in 15\u2009\u03bcL reaction volumes.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of mean (SEM). The statistical significance between groups was assessed by unpaired Student's\nt\ntest or Mann-Whitney U test.\nP\nvalues <0.05 (\np\n<\u20090.05) were considered to be indicative of significance. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4 software (San Diego, CA)."

    "Methods": "Participants\nWe studied 10 male athletes with a history of amateur and/or professional boxing who ranged in age from 27 to 59 years (\nTable 1\n). We recruited a comparison group through community advertising including 9 males who had a history of participating in predominantly noncontact sports and were 26\u201357 years old. A research coordinator performed a structured boxing history interview with the boxers, including amateur and professional experience and TBI events (\nTable 1\n). A sports history interview covering sports participation and injuries was done with comparison group participants. In addition to diverse noncontact sports, 2 participants in the comparison group had played football and 2 had exposure to soccer. However, no participant in the comparison group had sustained a concussion or other TBI; no events associated with loss or alteration of consciousness or post-traumatic amnesia were reported. The duration of sports participation in the comparison group (mean\u2009=\u200930.89 years; median\u2009=\u200931.0; range\u2009=\u20093\u201350 years) approximated the duration of participation in the boxers (\nTable 1\n), but included more than a single sport. Although all participants underwent MRI, useable DTI data were acquired from 7 of the 9 comparison group participants. Nine boxers fought amateur and professional bouts, and a single boxer had only amateur bouts. Two of the boxers were still active and 8 had retired from the ring.\nTable\n1.\nDemographic Features for Boxers and Comparison Group and Exposure Variables in Boxers\nGroup\nN\nVariable\nN\nMean\nMedian\nSD\nMin\nMax\nBoxer\n10\nAge\n10\n45.70\n47.00\n9.71\n27.00\n59.00\nEducation (years)\n10\n13.00\n12.50\n1.49\n11.00\n16.00\nYears boxing\n10\n35.70\n37.00\n9.15\n16.00\n51.00\nKOs (\nN\n)\n9\n0.89\n1.00\n0.60\n0.00\n2.00\nKOs with LOC (\nN\n)\n9\n0.67\n1.00\n0.71\n0.00\n2.00\nBouts (\nN\n)\n10\n164.00\n132.50\n116.80\n40.00\n386.00\nComparison\n9\nAge\n9\n43.44\n44\n9.11\n26\n57\nEducation (years)\n9\n13.78\n14\n1.92\n10\n16\nOpen in a separate window\nKOs, knockouts; LOC, loss of consciousness; SD, standard deviation; Min, minimum; Max, maximum.\nInclusion criteria for the boxers were: 1) 15 or more years of amateur and/or professional boxing, or at least 20 bouts and a regular schedule of sparring; 2) current age 25\u201360 years; 3) no medical history of a neurological or psychiatric disorder unrelated to boxing (e.g., brain tumor, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder); 4) male; and 5) fluency in English (not all of the neurocognitive measures have been appropriately normed and validated in other languages). Apart from boxing experience and no history of concussion or TBI, the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the comparison group who had engaged in noncontact and contact sports were similar. Other exclusion criteria for both groups included 1) contraindications to undergoing MRI and 2) cognitive deficits that precluded informed consent. Boxers were recruited from local boxing gyms, and the comparison group was recruited through the community by advertisement or referral. The research protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX). Informed consent was obtained from each participant.\n\nImaging protocols\nAll participants underwent MRI without sedation on the same Siemens 3.0 Tesla Trio scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). Regular quality assurance testing was performed, including American College of Radiology phantom testing, and no concerns with quality assurance were noted through the course of the study. Anatomical series to assess neuropathology included a three dimensional (3D) magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo sequence (2600\u2009ms repetition time [TR], 3.02\u2009ms echo time [TE], 900\u2009ms inversion time [TI], 1.0-mm axial slices, 0-mm gap, 176 slices, 256-mm field of view [FOV], 8-degree flip angle, 130\u2009Hz BW/pixel), a T2-weighted gradient echo sequence (668\u2009ms TR, 20\u2009ms TE, 4.0-mm axial slices, 1.2-mm gap, 27 slices, 256-mm FOV, 20-degree flip angle, 199\u2009Hz BW/pixel), a T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence (10,000\u2009ms TR, 105\u2009ms TE, 2500\u2009ms TI, echo train length [ETL] 21, 5-mm axial slices, 1-mm gap, 28 slices, 240-mm FOV, 120-degree flip angle, 191\u2009Hz BW/pixel), and a T2-weighted turbo spin echo sequence (5770\u2009ms TR, 80\u2009ms TE, ETL 9, 5.0-mm axial slices, 0-mm gap, 46 slices, 256-mm FOV, 150-degree flip angle, 200\u2009Hz BW/pixel).\nDiffusion tensor imaging\nTransverse multi-slice spin echo, single shot, echo planar imaging sequences were used (8000\u2009ms TR, 92\u2009ms TE, 2.0-mm axial slices, 0.6-mm gap). A 256-mm FOV was used with a measured voxel size of 2.67\u2009\u00d7\u20092.67\u2009\u00d7\u20092.6\u2009mm. Diffusion was measured along 30 directions (number of b-value\u2009=\u20092; low b-value\u2009=\u20090; and high b-value\u2009=\u20091000\u2009sec/mm\n2\n). To improve signal-to-noise ratio, high b-images were acquired twice and averaged in most cases. Each acquisition took approximately 4\u2009min 44\u2009sec, and 56 slices were acquired.\n\nImage processing\nDiffusion tensor imaging\nA multiple ROI approach to quantitative DTI tractography was applied. After ROIs were selected, an automated Philips 3D fiber tracking tool was utilized to create fiber tracts passing through the ROIs. The algorithm for fiber tracking is based upon the fiber assignment by continuous tracking method.\n19\nTracking terminated if the FA in the voxels decreased below 0.2 or if the angle between adjacent voxels along the track was larger than 7 degrees. Mean FA and ADC for the white matter tracts described below were the DTI measures used to compare the groups.\nWe measured FA and ADC in the following right and left regions: uncinate fasciculus; inferior longitudinal fasciculus; ventral striatum; and cerebral peduncle. The rationale for this selection was: 1) Uncinate fasciculus connects orbitofrontal cortex with the temporal lobe and is implicated in declarative memory\n20\n; 2) inferior longitudinal fasciculus connects hippocampus with the occipital region and is implicated in visual memory,\n20\nwhich is relevant to learning the serial, visual RT task; (3) ventral striatum has an interactive role with hippocampus in feedback-based learning over trials and is also involved in learning habits\n21\n; and 4) cerebral peduncle connects the cortex and the brain stem and is involved in the refined control of body movements. With a cortico-striato-cerebellar-thalamo-cortical loop implicated in motor sequence learning,\n22\nwe postulated that the cerebral peduncle is relevant to serial RT performance used to measure implicit learning. With the exception of the cerebral peduncles, the tractography protocols have been published.\n23\u201325\nThe protocol for the cerebral peduncles is detailed below.\nCerebral peduncles\nTwo ROIs were placed on axial images of the FA map to isolate the right and left cerebral peduncle pathways using protocols illustrated below. The first ROI was selected at the upper brainstem level as the cerebral peduncle appeared in an oval shape. The second ROI was traced in the same area, but two or three slices inferior to the first one.\nAll DTI data were analyzed twice by a single rater to establish intrarater reliability using intraclass correlational coefficients (ICCs). A subset of the images was analyzed by two raters to establish inter-rater reliability. ICCs for all measurements were above 0.95.\nMagnetic resonance imaging\nA senior neuroradiologist (J.V.H.) reviewed and coded the structural MRI findings without knowledge of the participant's group. The ventricle-brain ratio was calculated by dividing the area of the lateral ventricles by the total intracranial area. We also measured the Evan's Index\n26\nby dividing a linear measure of the maximum width of the anterior horns of the lateral ventricles by the maximal width of the internal diameter of the skull at the same level. A higher index value is interpreted as a rough biomarker of ventriculomegaly, possibly owing to normal pressure hydrocephalus or cerebral atrophy. Evans Index varies with age and sex, so interpretation depends on taking these characteristics into account.\n\nCognitive testing\nVerbal Selective Reminding Test\n27\nThe Verbal Selective Reminding Test (VSRT) is a verbal learning and memory test that is sensitive to early dementia, TBI, and memory disorders of various etiologies.\n28\nAfter the examiner serially presented each of the 12 words on trial 1, the participant was asked to recall the list.\n27\nAfter each recall attempt, the examiner selectively presented on the next trial only those words that the participant failed to recall during the preceding trial. VSRT differs from other verbal learning tests in which the examiner presents the entire list of words on each trial. A delayed recall trial was administered without warning 30\u2009min after the sixth and final learning trial.\n29\nDependent variables were: 1) total number of words consistently recalled after having been recalled on two consecutive trials, that is, consistent long-term retrieval, and 2) the total number of words recalled after a 30-min delay (delayed recall).\nSerial Reaction Time Test\n30\nThis test evaluates implicit (procedural) memory, a form of memory that is often robust to mesial temporal pathology and dissociable from declarative memory.\n31\nSubjects make a speeded response to a random number displayed on a screen by pressing the corresponding number on a keypad. There are 120 trials, but embedded within the random number trials is a repeating sequence of numbers that is not mentioned to the participant. RT for the random numbers remains stable across trials, but RT on the repeating sequence decreases.\n30\nThe difference in RT between the random and repeating sequences is interpreted as an index of implicit learning. Because participants are frequently unaware of the embedded nonrandom sequence, the decrease in RT has been attributed to implicit memory processes. Patients with mesial temporal lesions who have a declarative memory disorder as measured on the VSRT or similar tests often exhibit normal implicit learning,\n30\nwhereas motor skill learning may be impaired by lesions in cerebellum and basal ganglia.\n21\n,\n32\nImplicit or procedural learning on the serial RT task is also thought to also depend on a network involving cortical motor regions, a cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loop, and a cortico-cerebellar-thalamo-cortical loop.\n22\nVariables analyzed include 1) mean RT for responding to the random sequences of numbers, 2) mean RT for responding to the repeating sequence, and 3) the difference in RT between random and repeating sequences (corresponding to implicit learning).\n\nStatistical analysis\nFor this pilot study, we used nonparametric methods to compare the groups and assess association between variables. Wilcoxon's tests were used to examine group differences on continuous variables. Fisher's exact tests were used to test group differences on categorical variables, such as sex and ethnicity. Spearman's rank correlations were calculated within the boxer group to examine the relation between the DTI metrics and 1) cognitive scores as well as 2) variables related to boxing history. Effect sizes in terms of Cohen's\nd\nand\nf\nwere used to assess group differences on DTI variables and cognitive measures. Statistical analyses were performed with the SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC), and the threshold for statistical significance was set at\np\n<\u20090.05. Given the exploratory nature of the present study, corrections for multiple comparisons were not applied and exact\np\nvalues along with appropriate effect-size measures are provided."

    "Methods": "Experimental design\nFifty-four adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (10\u201314 weeks old, 200\u2013250\u2009g) were experimental subjects. This strain of rat is outbred, so any non-self cell transplants would eventually be rejected by the immune system. Three groups of animals were studied. All groups underwent T8 severe forceps compression lesions (\nn\n=\u200912 animals per group) followed 48\u2009h later by one of three possible treatments: Group 1 received implants of allogeneic BMSCs into the lesion site, genetically engineered to express green fluorescent protein (GFP); Group 2 received implants of allogeneic BMSCs into the lesion site, genetically engineered to express human BDNF and GFP; and Group 3 received lesions only followed by injection of PBS 48\u2009h later. Animals then underwent weekly Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) and sensory testing and were sacrificed 10 weeks post-lesion. In addition, four animals underwent T8 severe compression lesions and were sacrificed 48\u2009h later for histological assessment of the lesion cavity, to understand the nature of the lesion cavity at the time of cell grafting in other animals. To access the survival of BMSC transplants through early post-grafting time-points, when they are hypothesized to enhance neuroprotection, 24 animals received BMSC transplants expressing either BDNF or GFP (\nn\n=\u20094 per group) at 48\u2009h post-compression, and were sacrificed 3 days, 7 days, or 14 days post-transplant (5 days, 9 days, or 16 days post-compression, respectively).\n\nBMSC isolation and cell preparation\nRat primary BMSCs were isolated according to the method of Azizi and colleagues.\n35\nBriefly, adult Sprague-Dawley rats were deeply anesthetized with a combination (2\u2009mL/kg) of ketamine (25\u2009mg/mL), xylazine (1.3\u2009g/mL), and acepromazine (0.25\u2009mg/mL), and the tibias and femurs were dissected free of overlying muscle tissue. The ends of each bone were removed and 5\u2009mL of BMSC culture media was injected into the central canal of the bone to extrude the marrow. Bone marrow aspirates were gently triturated and plated in BMSC media at a density of 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells/cm\n2\n. Cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C in a mixture of 20% O\n2\nand 5% CO\n2\n. Media was changed every day for 5 days and at that time stromal cells had adhered to the flask. BMSCs were expanded to passage 3, then infected with lentivirus expressing either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or BDNF-ires-GFP, as described previously.\n7\nGFP+ cells were separated by flow cytometry to >95% purity. BMSCs were further expanded in BMSC media contained Minimum Essential Medium alpha +2\u2009mM GlutaMAX +1\u00d7 penicillin/streptomycin (all from Life Technologies), supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Prior to grafting, BDNF secretion was determined by two-site BDNF enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\n36\nBasal levels of BDNF secretion from control BMSCs was determined by ELISA to be 34\u2009ng/106 cells/day for GFP cells and 177\u2009ng/106 cells/day for BDNF-ires-GFP infected cells.\n\nIn vitro\ncharacterization\nFor BMSC immunocytochemistry, passage 7 cells were incubated with alexa-647 conjugated mouse anti-rat CD90 (5 ug/mL; BioLegend), for 30\u2009min at 37\u00b0C. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 20\u2009min at 37\u00b0C. Following PBS washes, cells were permeabilized in 100% methanol for 10\u2009min at room temperature. Cells were washed and blocked in 5% goat serum for 30\u2009min at room temperature. Rabbit anti-GFP (0.5\u2009\u03bcg/mL; Life Technologies) was added and the cells incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Cells were washed and incubated in a mixture of alexa-488 conjugated goat anti-rabbit (2\u2009\u03bcg/mL; Life Technologies) and 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 1\u2009\u03bcg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich), for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Cells were washed and immediately imaged.\nFor flow cytometry, cells were dissociated with 1\u2009mM EDTA (Life Technologies) and incubated with alexa-647 conjugated mouse anti-rat CD90, CD29, CD45 and CD11b (10\u2009\u03bcg/ml: BioLegend) for 20\u2009min at 37\u00b0C. Cells were washed in PBS and fixed in a 2% formaldehyde/PBS solution on ice. Background staining was determined with cells incubated without antibodies or cells incubated with alexa-647 mouse Fc fragments. At least 50,000 singlet events were analyzed on a FACSCANTO II flow cytometry system (BD Biosciences).\n\nSurgery\nNational Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines for laboratory animal care and safety were strictly followed. All surgery was performed under anesthesia with a combination (2\u2009mL/kg) of ketamine (25\u2009mg/mL), xylazine (1.3\u2009g/mL), and acepromazine (0.25\u2009mg/mL).\nFor spinal cord compression lesions, blunt dissection was used to expose the T8 and T9 dorsal processes. Without laminectomy, a blunted, non-graded #55 forceps was lowered between the T8 and T9 vertebral columns and the forceps tips were entirely closed for 1\u2009sec from the lateral aspects of the spinal cord. The muscles were sutured and the skin stapled. Rats were given ampicillin (20\u2009mg/kg, subcutaneously) and banamine (1\u2009mg/kg, subcutaneously), and the bladder was manually expressed twice a day.\nTwo days post-compression, the animals were re-anesthetized with isoflurane gas (instead of ketamine, to reduce potential toxicity from repeated ketamine exposure and to enable more rapid awakening) placed in a spinal stereotax (Kopf) and a laminectomy of the T8 vertebra was performed. Immediately prior to transplantation, BMSCs (passage 7) were concentrated by centrifugation at 200\u2009g for 4\u2009min and re-suspended in 5\u2009\u03bcL of PBS. The lesion was identified by a visible hematoma and a total volume of 5\u2009\u03bcL (500,000 cells) was injected directly into the lesion site using a Picospritzer II (General Valve). Cells were injected into three points (one point at midline and two points 0.5\u2009mm lateral of midline). Control animals received injections of PBS containing no cells. The muscles were sutured, the skin stapled, and the rats were maintained for in a 37\u00b0C incubator until awake and alert. Rats were given daily subcutaneous injections for 3 days of a 3\u2009mL solution containing lactated Ringer's, ampicillin (20\u2009mg/kg), and banamine (1\u2009mg/kg). Bladder was manually expressed twice daily until reflex voiding returned (10\u201314 days post-compression).\n\nBehavior testing\nPrior to SCI, all rats were acclimated to the tester and the testing apparatus. Rat bladders were voided, then 10\u2009min later the animals were placed in the open field. Two independent observers blinded to group identity assessed locomotor activity for 4\u2009min and the open-field score was determined using the 21-point BBB locomotor rating scale.\n37\nNo significant differences were observed when scoring the right and left hind paws at any time-point (analysis of variance [ANOVA],\np\n=\u20090.9); therefore, the values were averaged.\n\nTissue preparation and immunohistochemistry\nRats were transcardially perfused with 0.9% NaCl\n2\n, followed by ice cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Spinal cords were removed and post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA, then transferred to 30% sucrose in 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffer and cryoprotected for 3 days at 4\u00b0C. A 1\u2009cm block of spinal cord tissue containing the lesion site was embedded in tissue cryoprotectant solution (Thermo Fisher) and frozen on dry ice. Horizontal tissue sections were cut on a cryostat set to 16\u2009\u03bcm and thaw-mounted directly onto superfrost plus slides. A subset of slides were stained with 0.25% cresyl violet to label Nissl bodies or immunolabeled, as described below.\n\nFluorescent immunolabeling\nFor glial acidic fibrillary protein (GFAP) and/or green fluorescent protein (GFP) double labeling, slides were place in a slide staining rack (Thermo Fisher), rinsed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS), permeabilized with 100% methanol for 20\u2009min, and rinsed with TBS. Non-specific antibody binding was then blocked for 1\u2009h in a solution of 5% horse serum in 0.25% triton-x in TBS (TBS++). Slides were incubated in a mixture of mouse anti-GFAP (1\u2009\u03bcg/mL; Millipore,) and rabbit anti-GFP (0.5\u2009\u03bcg/mL; Life Technologies) overnight in TBS++. Following TBS washes, slides were incubated in a mixture of donkey anti-rabbit alexa-488 and donkey anti-mouse alexa-594 (4\u2009\u03bcg/mL; Life Technologies) in TBS++ for 1\u2009h at room temperature. All nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (1\u2009\u03bcg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) for 5\u2009min. Slides were air-dried and cover-slipped with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech).\n\nLight level immunolabeling\nFor GFAP immunolabeling, mouse anti-GFAP (0.2\u2009\u03bcg/mL; Millipore) was diluted in TBS++ and added to each slide and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Following TBS washes, slides were incubated for 1\u2009h in biotinylated horse anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG; 7.5\u2009\u03bcg/mL; Vector Labs) diluted in TBS++. Following TBS washes, slides were incubated for 1\u2009h in ABC reagent (1:100 dilution; Vector Labs). Slides were transferred to a coplin jar and washed 3\u00d7 in TBS. The horseradish peroxidase (HRP) reaction product was allowed to react for 10\u2009min with a solution of 0.25\u2009mg/mL 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB), 0.04% NiCl\n2\n, 1.2% H\n2\nO\n2\nin TBS. Slides were rinsed in TBS and dehydrated with a series of increasing ethanol concentrations to citrosolv. Finally, slides were cover-slipped with Entellan mounting solution.\nFor BDNF immunolabeling, slides were placed in a coplin jar and washed in TBS. Slides were then transferred to a 0.01M Tris-HCl, pH 9 solution pre-warmed to 80\u00b0C and incubated for 30\u2009min. Slides were allowed to return to room temperature, then fixed in a solution of 2% paraformaldehyde/0.2% parabenzoquinone in 0.1\u2009M PO\n4\nfor 5\u2009min. Slides were washed in TBS, blocked in TBS++ for 1\u2009h, then incubated for four nights at 4\u00b0C in a mixture of rabbit anti-BDNF (0.1\u2009\u03bcg/mL; Chicago Proteintech) in TBS++. Following TBS washes, slides were incubated for 2\u2009h in biotinylated horse anti-rabbit IgG (7.5\u2009\u03bcg/mL; Vector Labs) diluted in TBS++. Following TBS washes, slides were incubated for 1\u2009h in ABC reagent (1:100 dilution; Vector Labs). Slides were transferred to a coplin jar and washed 3\u00d7 in TBS. The HRP reaction product was allowed to react for 10\u2009min with a solution of 0.25\u2009mg/mL DAB, 0.04% NiCl\n2\n, 1.2% H\n2\nO\n2\nin TBS. Slides were rinsed in TBS and dehydrated with a series of increasing ethanol concentrations to citrosolv. Finally, slides were cover-slipped with Entellan mounting solution.\n\nImaging\nBoth light level and fluorescent images were acquired with an Olympus AX70 microscope equipped with an Optronics Microfire A/R digital camera. Images were imported into Photoshop CS2 and minimally altered for brightness and contrast.\n\nLesion size quantification\nGFAP immunolabeled horizontal sections containing the entire lesion site were used for estimation of lesion size. Lack of GFAP immunolabeling in six sections spaced every 300\u2009\u03bcm was outlined using StereoInvestigator software (MicroBrightField). Live images were received from an Olympus Optical OLY-200 video camera mounted on an Olympus Optical BX60 microscope fitted with a Ludl 99S000 XYZ motorized stage. The lesion volume index was calculated by summing the lesion area from all six sections. The mean lesion volume index was calculated for each group.\n\nGlial scar quantification\nImages magnified 20 \u00d7were acquired of GFAP immunolabeled horizontal sections containing the rostral edge of the lesion cavity. Images were imported into ImageJ (NIH) and a region of interest outlined 100\u2009\u03bcm from the lesion cavity. Percent of area occupied by GFAP immunolabeling was quantified in six serial sections spaced 300\u2009\u03bcm apart. The mean percent of GFAP area was calculated for each group.\n\nStatistical analysis\nIn all quantification procedures observers were blinded to the nature of the experimental manipulations. For histological outcomes, multiple group comparisons were made using one-way ANOVA with a designated significance level of 95%.\nPost hoc\ndifferences were tested by Fisher's least square difference. For behavioral outcomes, multiple group comparisons were made by repeated measures two-way ANOVA (group vs. time, BBB and sensory threshold testing) or one-way ANOVA (conditioned place preference testing) with a significance level of 95% followed by Fisher's\npost hoc\ntest. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). The final numbers of animals per group that were assessed were\nn\n=\u20097 in the BMSC-GFP group,\nn\n=\u200910 in the BMSC-BDNF group, and\nn\n=\u200912 in the PBS control group. Animal numbers were reduced from the original\nn\n=\u200912 per group for the following reasons: five died in the BMSC-GFP group due to excessive weight loss and bladder infections, and two died in the BMSC-BDNF group due to bladder infections."

    "Methods": "Animals\nThree-month-old male mice underwent single blasts, ranging from 0\u201370\u2009psi above atmospheric pressure (i.e., 14.7\u2009psi), and the outcome was evaluated behaviorally and histologically at different time points after the blast. The 0-psi blasts are also referred to here as sham blasts. Two strains of mice were used, C57BL/6 mice and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) reporter mice (on a C57BL/6 background) conditionally expressing EYFP in Thy1-expressing telencephalic neurons of the\nemx1\nlineage.\nThe C57BL/6 mice were used in behavioral and histological studies and were either purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME), and/or taken from a colony maintained from C57BL/6 founders from JAX. We used the reporter mice conditionally expressing EYFP in Thy1-expressing telencephalic neurons of the\nemx1\nlineage to histologically evaluate the effects of blast on excitatory neurons of the cerebral cortex and amygdala, and on various axon tracts of the brain, especially those arising from cortex and from retina.\nCre-driven recombination occurs in nearly 90% of pyramidal cortical neurons.\n41\n,\n42\nThus, in the progeny of a cross between a floxed Thy1-EYFP reporter mouse and an\nemx1\n-Cre driver mouse, nearly all excitatory cortical and many amygdalar neurons express EYFP.\n41\u201343\nAlthough\nemx1\nhas not been reported to be expressed in the retina, we found that about 5% of retinal ganglion cells also express EYFP. The floxed Thy1-EYFP reporter mice (purchased from JAX) and\nemx1\n-Cre driver mice (purchased from the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Consortium, or MMRRC) were maintained as colonies at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC). All animal studies were performed in accordance with an UTHSC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved protocol and complied with the National Institutes of Health and Society for Neuroscience guidelines.\n\nTBI methods\nBlast device\nThe overpressure air blast is delivered by a small horizontally mounted air cannon system,\n40\n,\n43\nconsisting of a modified paintball gun (Invert Mini, Empire Paintball, Sewell, NJ), pressurized air tank, and x-y table secured onto a medium-density fiberboard (\nFig. 1\n). The original paintball gun barrel with a 13-mm aperture was replaced with a machined barrel with a 6.5-mm diameter aperture to increase output pressure. The air blast pressures from the paintball gun are controlled by adjusting the output from a pressurized air tank, as monitored by a gun input pressure gauge.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nAnesthetized mice are secured within a foam rubber sleeve (\nA, B\n) in a narrow polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe with a 2.0-cm opening in one wall (\nC\n), and slid into a just-wider PVC pipe with a 7.5-mm hole bored into its wall (\nD\n). The two pipes are aligned so that the small outer hole exposes the parietal-squamosal region of the mouse skull between ear and eye (the overlying fur is shaved, and a centering white spot marked on the skin). The foam rubber sleeve cushions the nonblast side of the mouse (A, B). The foam rubber is secured on a plastic sled, and the sled has a tab by which the mouse holder can be pulled into the tube. The mouse is secured to the holder with several rounds of surgical tape, red in A and B, but white in C and D. The overpressure air blast in our model is delivered by a horizontally mounted modified paintball gun (\nE\n). No mouse is present in the tube in E. The blast from the gun is regulated by adjustment of input from a pressurized air tank, and desired blast intensity is calibrated using a pressure gauge (inset in E). The inset shows the pressure transducer to the right, with its barrel passing through the region otherwise occupied by the mouse and mouse holder tubes. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nThe part of the mouse exposed to the blast is restricted to a 7.5-mm diameter midcranial area in the following manner (\nFig. 1A\u2013D\n): anesthetized mice are secured within a foam rubber sleeve in a 33-mm outer diameter wide clear polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe (26-mm inner diameter), with the left side of the mouse head apposed to a 20-mm opening in the midpoint of one wall of the tube. This \u201cinner\u201d tube is slid into a 44-mm outer-diameter wide clear PVC pipe (35-mm inner diameter) with a 7.5-mm hole bored into the midpoint of its wall. The inner PVC tube is rotated in the outer PVC tube so that the targeted head region is positioned in the center of the 7.5-mm hole in the outer tube.\nThe outer tube is mounted perpendicular to the blast cannon using two Plexiglas holders that are mounted on an x-y table, which is itself mounted to the medium-density fiberboard base (Velmex Inc., Bloomfield, NY). The outer tube opening is then aligned with the gun barrel opening, using the x-y controls, so the mouse head is 4\u20135-mm from the blast cannon barrel tip (\nFig. 1E\n). This arrangement exposes the parietal region of the left side of the mouse head between the ear and the eye to the blast, while the rest of the mouse is shielded from the blast by the pipe.\nThe blast area encompasses the skull overlying the forebrain (\nFig. 2A\n). The foam rubber sleeve surrounding the mouse cushions the nonblast side of the mouse, to stabilize it and minimize head displacement. Before blast exposure, mice were anesthetized with Avertin (400\u2009mg/kg body weight), the fur of the parietal region of the left side of the head shaved, a white dot painted in the middle of the region (midway between eye and ear), and the mouse secured in the holder as described above. Mice received 35\u2009mg/mL acetaminophen in their drinking water for 24\u2009h after blast.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nImage\nA\nshows the 7.5-mm area of the mouse cranium exposed to blast, in relationship to the eyes, auditory meatus, and brain. Note that the blast area encompasses the forebrain, but does not include the eye or ear. Image\nB\nshows pressure waves for different peak blast levels. Blast durations increase with increasing peak blast amplitude. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nBlast characterization\nIn addition to the 7.5-mm hole that faces the gun barrel, the outer tube possesses an 11-mm hole on the opposite side, allowing the barrel of a model STJE Sensotec pressure transducer (Honeywell, Morristown, NJ) to be inserted so the barrel tip is in the same position that the mouse head occupies during blast.\n40\n,\n43\nThe pressures detected by this transducer are recorded and analyzed using Labview software (National Instruments, Austin, TX). This makes it possible to measure the air blast pressure at the position occupied by the mouse head during a blast session.\nAdjustment of the pressure gauge on the gun to specific levels calibrated by the pressure gauge allowed us to vary the pressure from 0-psi to 70-psi above atmospheric pressure. This range includes pressures that were previously reported to produce TBI in rats and mice exposed to head or whole body blasts.\n20\n,\n21\n,\n24\u201326\n,\n30\n,\n33\nWe also measured the pressure detected by the pressure gauge at increasing distances of the tip of the pressure gauge barrel from the gun barrel tip, at a series of blast gun input tank pressure settings, and determined that the blast gun output pressure was uniform over a distance of 3\u20135\u2009mm from the tip of the blast gun. Accordingly, we measured the pressure waves produced at different peak output blast settings at 4\u20135-mm from the blast gun tip, and mice were also subsequently positioned at this distance.\nTo characterize the speed of the blast wave, we used a typical lens-based Schlieren system,\n44\nin which light from a pin source is collimated through a double-convex lens to visualize variations in refractive index caused by density gradients in a flowing liquid or gas. The collimated light was further converged using a double-convex lens, and a knife-edge was placed at the focal distance of the lens, positioned so as to block half of the light. By visualizing the air pressure wave within this light beam at 1400\u2009fps with a high-speed pco.1200\u2009hs video camera (The Cooke Corp., Romulus, MI), lighter and darker patches corresponding to positive and negative pressure density gradients in the direction normal to the knife-edge are visible. With pressure waves moving at or above the speed of sound, a standing wave pattern is seen in the wake of the blast front, from which the speed of the leading edge of the shockwave can be calculated.\n44\nTo characterize the movement of the head during blast, we videotaped the mouse through the open front end of the mouse holder at 1100\u2009fps during 30-psi and 60-psi blasts. The head center of mass was identified in every video frame, and its position along the horizontal plane was determined in each frame for 24\u2009msec after the blast. Zero time was taken to be the frame when a slight movement of the fur was seen, evidence that the overpressure wave front was just reaching the mouse. This occurred one frame before overt head movement was detected. We then plotted head position over time and fit this with a 6th-order sum of sines equation in MATLAB. The first and second derivatives of this equation described instantaneous head velocity and acceleration during blast, respectively.\n\nBehavioral studies\nGeneral health\nBlood oxygenation, breath rate, and heart rate were measured before and after blast using a MouseOx Plus (Star Life Science, Oakmont, PA). Intraocular pressure was measured with an AccuPen Tonopen (Elkridge, MD) before and after blast. Mice were weighed the day before blast, the day of blast, and then again the day after blast, 1 week after blast, and 2 weeks after blast.\nMotor assessment\nRotarod analysis was performed using a San Diego Instruments (San Diego, CA) rodent rotarod. For the rotarod task, revolutions per minute (rpm) increased from 0 to 30 over a 4-min period, and 30\u2009rpm was then maintained for another 2\u2009min. The first rotarod session was a two-trial training session 2 days before blast, followed by a two-trial test session 1 day before blast. Mice were then tested again the day after blast, 1 week after blast, and 2 weeks after blast. Time to fall was the measure of rotarod performance.\nWe also conducted an automated 30-min assessment of open field behavior, using a Noldus EthoVision video tracking system to record and digitize the mouse movements (Noldus Information Technology, The Netherlands), and the SEE software of Drai and Golani\n45\nto analyze mouse motor behavior. The SEE software uses algorithms to dichotomize mouse movements into lingering episodes and progression segments, and can calculate further parameters for these, such as speed and acceleration, that are robust in characterizing differences among strains, disease states, or treatment groups.\n45\u201350\nEach animal was brought from its housing room, introduced into the open field arena, and returned after the 30-min session. The arena was 200\u2009cm in diameter with a nonporous gray floor and a 50-cm high gray wall. Open field sessions were conducted the day before blast, the day after blast, 1 week after blast, and 2 weeks after blast. A DigiGait Imaging System (Mouse Specifics, Inc) was used to assess gait. The DigiGait system uses a high-speed video camera positioned under a transparent motorized treadmill to capture the movements of the paws as they approach, contact, and move away from the belt surface during locomotion.\nEach mouse was given a few minutes to acclimate to the chamber enclosing the treadmill, and then to the movement of the treadmill, before video tracking of gait. Several seconds of videotape of the mouse maintaining a steady pace in the center of the viewing field were chosen for the software to analyze. DigiGait analysis was performed before blast, and then again 3 weeks after blast, at 20-cm/sec treadmill speed.\nVisual acuity and contrast sensitivity\nWe used a virtual reality OptoMotry System (CerebralMechanics Inc.:\nwww.cerebralmechanics.com\n) that allows rapid quantification of acuity and contrast sensitivity in untrained, unrestrained awake rodents, using the optokinetic head response to horizontally moving vertical stripes.\n51\nIn this system, four computer monitors surround a small square animal platform and create a virtual cylinder in which vertical sine-wave gratings are presented to the animal. A video camera located above the animal provides a real-time display by which the investigator observes the animal response.\nSpatial frequency thresholds can be determined by systematically increasing the spatial frequency of the grating at 100% contrast until animals no longer display tracking behavior. Direction of drum rotation is random from trial to trial, and the experimenter determines from the video display for each stimulus presentation whether the animal moves clockwise or counterclockwise, or not at all. Because the stimulus presentations are computer-controlled and the experimenter is blinded to the stimuli seen by the animal (as well as to the blast pressure the mouse had previously received), the scoring of animal performance by the experimenter is unbiased.\nThe optokinetic response is driven by temporal to nasal stimulus movement. Thus, clockwise movement of the pattern tests the left eye, and counterclockwise pattern movement tests the right eye. Vision testing was performed 3 weeks after blast. Acuity testing was performed at 100% contrast (i.e., white vs. black stripes), while contrast sensitivity testing was performed at 0.042 cycles per degree (c/d).\n\nHistological studies\nTissue fixation\nHistological analysis was performed on fixed tissue to determine the effects of TBI on brain, spinal cord, retina, and optic nerve using a number of approaches: (1) cresyl violet Nissl staining of brain sections; (2) hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of brain sections; (3) immunolabeling of brain, spinal cord, retina, and/or optic nerve sections for NeuN, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), SMI-32, IBA1 (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen, type-2 cannabinoid receptors (CB2), and/or protein kinase C\u2013gamma (PKC-gamma); (4) NeuroSilver staining of brain sections; (5) phenylenediamine staining of optic nerves before plastic-embedding and sectioning at 1\u2009\u03bcm; (6) toluidine blue staining of 1-\u03bcm sections through plastic-embedded retina; and (7) EYFP visualization of neurons and axons in brain, spinal cord, retina, and optic nerve in EYFP reporter mice.\nPost-blast survival times ranged from 2 days to 11 weeks, depending on the specific tissue and histological end-point. Cresyl violet and H&E staining and immunolabeling for NeuN, GFAP, and SMI-32 were used to assess general brain pathology at 2\u201311 weeks after blast. Immunostaining for IBA1, MHC class II, and CB2 were used to assess microglial activation at 2\u201377 days after blast. Further details on the blast groups and survival times for approaches #4\u20137 are described in more detail below.\nMice were deeply anesthetized (Avertin; 0.2\u2009mL/g body weight), the chest opened, and 0.1\u2009mL of heparinized saline (800 U.S.P. units/mL) injected into the heart. They were then perfused transcardially with 40\u2009mL of 0.9% NaCl in 0.1\u2009M sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 (PB), followed by 200\u2009mL of 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1\u2009M lysine-0.1\u2009M sodium periodate in 0.1\u2009M PB at pH 7.4 (PLP). The brains were removed and stored for at least 24\u2009h in a 20% sucrose/10% glycerol solution at 4\u00b0C. A pin was inserted longitudinally into the right side of the brains to distinguish left from right.\nThe fixed brains were sectioned frozen on a sliding microtome in the transverse plane at 35\u2009\u03bcm. Each brain was collected as 12 separate series in 0.1\u2009M PB with 0.02% sodium azide. A one in six series of brain sections from each mouse was mounted as sectioned, and stained for cresyl violet, and an additional series was stained for H&E. Other series were immunostained for the above noted markers (as described in more detail below), or processed by the NeuroSilver method (as described in more detail below).\nAfter perfusion and brain removal, the eyes and optic nerves were removed. Optic nerves were transferred to 4% paraformaldehyde\u20130.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1\u2009M PB, and then embedded in plastic, sectioned at 1\u2009\u03bcm, and stained with 1% p-phenylenediamine in 50% methanol (PPD) as described in Bricker-Anthony and associates.\n52\n,\n53\nFor eyes, the corneas were incised, either PLP or 4% paraformaldehyde\u20130.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1\u2009M PB infused, and the eyes post-fixed for 2\u2009h in the same fixative infused. Corneas were then dissected free and the lens removed. Eyes fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde\u20130.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1\u2009M PB were washed, dehydrated, and embedded in plastic, sectioned at 1\u2009\u03bcm, and stained with toluidine blue. Eyes fixed with PLP were washed, stored at 4\u00b0C in 20% sucrose in 0.1\u2009M PB, and sectioned at 30\u2009\u03bcm using a cryostat. Typically, part of the optic nerve remained attached for all eyes.\nAfter brain/eye removal, the spinal cords were exposed by ventral laminectomy and post-fixed overnight in PLP at 4\u00b0C. The thoracic cord was then dissected free, stored at 4\u00b0C in 20% sucrose in 0.1\u2009M PB, and sectioned at 30\u2009\u03bcm using a cryostat. On-the-slide immunolabeling for eyes and spinal cords was performed as described previously.\n54\nEdema assessment\nWe used six mice to evaluate edema after TBI based on comparing the wet and dry weights of the brain. At 24\u2009h after blast, the brains from three mice with a 0-psi blast and three mice with a 50-psi blast were quickly removed from the skull and meninges dissected away. The olfactory bulbs were removed, and the brainstem and cerebellum was cut just behind the midbrain. The remaining forebrain\u2013midbrain specimen was cut in half at the midline using a fresh razor blade, each half placed on a pre-weighed piece of aluminum foil, and foil and brain weighed together to determine the weight for each specimen. The brain pieces on their piece of aluminum foil were transferred to an oven at 70\u00b0C for 48\u2009h. They were then weighed again to determine their dry weight. The difference between wet and dry weight reflects water content.\nImmunohistochemical studies\nImmunohistochemical single labeling using peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) procedures described previously\n55\nwas used to visualize a variety of markers. Immunolabeling for NeuN was used to detect neuronal perikarya, using a mouse monoclonal anti-NeuN. The specificity and efficacy of the anti-NeuN antibody has been shown previously.\n56\n,\n57\nNote that the NeuN antigen has been identified as Fox-3, a new member of the Fox-1 gene splicing family.\n58\nMicroglial activation is thought to contribute to the progression of brain injury in many neurodegenerative conditions, including TBI.\n59\n,\n60\nWe thus used immunolabeling with an antibody selective for the microglial marker IBA1 to determine whether microglia showed morphological alterations reflective of activation.\n61\nIn addition, we used immunolabeling with antibodies for MHC Class II antigen and CB2 to evaluate microglial activation, because both are elevated in activated microglia.\n62\u201364\nIBA1 was detected with a Wako rabbit polyclonal antibody against the conserved IBA1 C-terminus, and the MHC Class II antigen was detected with the mouse monoclonal OX6 antibody from BD Pharmingen.\n65\nCB2 was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cayman Chemical). The SMI-32 antibody detects nonphosphorylated heavy neurofilament protein, which is abundant in neuronal cell bodies and dendrites, especially those of pyramidal cortical neurons,\n66\nand its abundance is sensitive to cortical neuron disease and injury.\n67\nTo detect corticospinal tract fibers in the spinal cord, we performed immunolabeling for PKC-gamma using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Abcam).\n68\u201370\nFor PAP immunolabeling, sections were incubated for 24\u2009h at room temperature in primary antibody diluted in 0.8% Triton X-100/0.01% sodium azide/0.1\u2009M PB (PBX). Sections were then rinsed and incubated in donkey anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG (depending on the primary antibody) diluted 1:200 in PBX, followed by incubation in the appropriate mouse or rabbit PAP complex diluted 1:1000 in PBX, with each incubation at room temperature for 1\u2009h. The sections were rinsed between secondary and PAP incubations in three 5-min washes of PB.\nSubsequent to the PAP incubation, the sections were rinsed with three to six 10-min washes in 0.1\u2009M PB, and a peroxidase reaction using diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) was performed. Sections were incubated in 5\u2009mL of 0.05\u2009M imidazole/0.05\u2009M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 5\u2009mg DAB for 10\u2009min and then incubated for an additional 10\u2009min after adding 20\u2009\u03bcL of 3% hydrogen peroxide. Sections were then rinsed in distilled water, transferred to 0.1\u2009M PB, mounted on gelatin-coated slides, dried, dehydrated, and cover-slipped with Permount.\n\u00ae\nImmunofluorescence labeling was performed to detect multiple fluorescent markers, typically IBA1 or OX6 in optic tract or nerve in the\nemx1-Thy1\n-EYFP reporter mice. For these studies, we used the rabbit polyclonal anti-IBA1 or the mouse monoclonal OX6 antibody. Slide-mounted cryostat sections of eye and optic nerve or free-floating sections of brain were incubated overnight at room temperature in the primary antibody, as described previously.\n54\n,\n71\nThe sections were then rinsed three times and incubated for 2\u2009h at room temperature (with gentle agitation in the case of free floating) in an Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse or rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes; Eugene, OR).\nSections were rinsed three times in 0.1M PB after incubation in secondary antibody, free-floating sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides, and all slides were cover-slipped with ProLong\n\u00ae\nantifade medium (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Sections were viewed and images captured using a Zeiss 710 confocal laser-scanning microscope (CLSM).\nNeuroSilver\nFree-floating sections from mice sacrificed at 2\u20136 weeks after blast were processed with a commercially available modification of the Gallyas silver method (NeuroSilver kit II; FD Neurotechnologies, Ellicott City, MD), using manufacturer instructions, to detect degenerating axons.\n67\nThy1-EYFP\u2013Emx1-cre reporter mice\nThy1-EYFP\u2013Emx1-cre mice at 2\u201316 days post-blast were transcardially perfused with fixative and sectioned as described above. To examine axon injury, sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides, dried, dehydrated, and cover-slipped with ProLong antifade medium (Molecular Probes) and viewed using the Zeiss 710 CLSM. To study forebrain neuron loss, PAP immunolabeling with a mouse monoclonal anti-GFP from Rockland Antibodies (which cross-reacts with EYFP) was used to render EYFP detectible by transmitted light microscopy.\nMorphometry\nThe extent of cortical neuron labeling for SMI-32 was evaluated at 3 weeks after blast in coronal sections at the level of globus pallidus internus. This level corresponds to Bregma-1.5 in the mouse atlas of Franklin and Paxinos\n72\nand is located at the approximate middle of the blast area. In normal mice at this level, the dendrites and perikarya of neurons in layers 3 and 5 of somatosensory and cingulate cortex are rich in SMI-32. NIH ImageJ software was used to measure the percent of the cerebral cortex occupied by SMI-32 imunoreactivity in mice with a range of blast pressures (six 0-psi, two 20-psi, two 25-psi, two 30-psi, two 40-psi, five 50-psi, five 60-psi).\nIn addition, blinded stereological neuron counts were performed for cerebral cortex in mice 45 days after 0-psi sham blast or 60-psi blast, using a 1-in-12 series of coronal sections immunolabeled for NeuN from the rostral end of striatum to the anterior commissure, as described previously.\n50\nUnbiased stereological counts were obtained using Stereo Investigator (Micro-Brightfield, Colchester, VT) with the optical fractionator method.\nTo evaluate the effects of blast on forebrain volume, blinded image analysis was performed as described previously.\n50\n,\n73\nIn brief, an image of each section through the forebrain in a 1-in-12 cresyl violet series (3\u20136 weeks after blast), or a 1-in-12 SMI-32 immunostained series (2 weeks after blast), from the rostral telencephalic pole to the diencephalon, was captured using an Aperio ScanScope XT scanner. NIH ImageJ software was used to measure the area occupied by the forebrain from the end of the olfactory bulb to the level at which the internal capsule detaches from the diencephalon. Section thickness and spacing were used to calculate volume from the area measurements.\nQuantification of the dorsal corticospinal tract (dCST) used images of PKC-gamma immunostained transverse sections of upper-midthoracic levels of spinal cord from 50\u201360\u2009psi blast versus sham blast mice 1\u20132 months after blast. Blinded image analysis using Image J was then used to threshold the labeled fibers in the left and right dCST and measure the relative fiber abundance in the selected area. To assess the time course of axon pathology, swollen axon bulbs and microglia per unit area were counted blinded in the right optic tract of 0-psi and 60-psi mice at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 16 days after blast, using EYFP reporter mice and SMI-32 immunostained tissue.\nWe determined the number of degenerating optic nerve axons at 2\u20133 weeks and 7\u20139 weeks after various blast pressures, and measured surviving axons at 10\u201311 weeks after sham versus 50-psi blast. For counts of degenerating and healthy axons, plastic-embedded 1-\u03bcm thick optic nerve cross-sections were analyzed using the StereoInvestigator software in a blinded manner. Forty 5-\u03bcm by 5-\u03bcm fields were randomly counted per optic nerve cross-section. Normal axons possess a dark myelin ensheathment surrounding the clearly visible pale cytoplasm of the axon, whereas degenerating axon profiles possessed unraveling myelin sheaths and cytoplasm that was either darkened or pale and full of cellular debris. The cytoplasm of degenerating axons also often looked distended. Two sections were analyzed per optic nerve per mouse to determine axon number and count degenerating axon profiles.\nRetinal thickness was measured in tissue from 50\u201360\u2009psi blast versus sham blast mice 10\u201311 weeks after blast. To measure retinal thickness, images were taken from at least three fields of retina from its midpoint. These images were then measured blinded, for total retinal thickness, inner nuclear layer (INL) thickness, and inner plexiform layer (IPL) to nerve fiber layer (NFL) thickness. Total retinal thickness was measured from the outer edge of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) to the inner edge of the NFL. Inner plexiform layer to NFL measurements were taken from the inner edge of the INL to the outer edge of the NFL. The resulting measurements from each eye were averaged to yield a thickness for each retina, as well as for the sublayers.\n\nStatistics\nParametric\nt\ntests were used to evaluate differences between groups in instances in which only two blast levels were involved. For comparisons of effects among more than two blast levels, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used, followed by individual planned comparisons using the Fisher PLSD test. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel for\nt\ntests and SPSS 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) for ANOVA."

    "Methods": "Experimental subjects and blast exposure\nMice (C57BL6/J, male; Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane in a gas mixture of 30% oxygen and 70% nitrous oxide, fixed on a wire-mesh holder, and positioned at the open end of the shock tube facing the shockwave front. Our blast model was designed to minimize head movement and thus prevent, to the extent possible, acceleration/deceleration injury. Toward this goal, the head was tethered on the mesh through the frontal teeth. Anesthetized animals were exposed to a single mild-moderate blast event (corresponding to 30 psig of membrane rupture pressure) in the supine position in a helium-driven shock tube as previously described.\n35\n,\n36\nAnimals were divided into three groups that were exposed to 1) whole\u2013body blast (\nn\n=\u200912); 2) blast with a polycarbonate jacket for torso protection with chest, abdomen, and limbs covered (\nn\n=\u20095) as described previously\n35\n,\n36\n; and 3) no blast exposure (sham;\nn\n=\u200910). Fifteen minutes after exposure, animals were injected intra-peritoneally with a single dose of 40\u2009mg/kg of MnCl\n2\nand subcutaneously with 200\u2009\u03bcL of neutral phosphate-buffered saline.\n37\nThe MnCl\n2\nsolution was prepared as described previously.\n37\nBriefly, 100\u2009mM of highly purified MnCl\n2\n\u00b74H20 (product number 529680; Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in 100\u2009mM bicine solution and adjusted to pH 7.4. Control mice were not exposed to blast nor did they receive MnCl\n2\n. All procedures involving animals were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committees of Johns Hopkins and Georgetown Universities.\n\nMRI\nMRI was performed in a 7-Tesla horizontal Bruker spectrometer run by Paravision 5.1 as previously described.\n38\u201344\nAnimals were imaged after a 6-h recovery post-blast. Anesthetized mice (1.5% isoflurane in a gas mixture of 30% oxygen and 70% nitrous oxide) were placed on our in-house designed and custom-manufactured stereotaxic device (ASI Instruments, Warren, MI) with built-in temperature and cardio-respiratory monitoring engineered to fit a Bruker 4-channel phased-array mouse brain coil and a corresponding transmit volume coil. T2-weighted rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) sequences were used to identify key neuropathologies such as bleeding, hematomas, edema, or gross changes in brain structure. T1-weighted sequences were then used to visualize changes in contrast related to MnCl\n2\nuptake. The MEMRI imaging protocol was a T1-weighted two-dimensional RARE sequence with the following parameters: repetition time (TR), 1650\u2009msec; echo time (TE), 10.6\u2009msec; inversion time (TI), 650\u2009msec; field of view (FOV), 3.0\u2009cm; RARE factor, 2; matrix, 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256; averages, 1; slice thickness, 1\u2009mm. A custom-designed 0.01\u2009mM MnCl\n2\nphantom was positioned inside the brain coil above the animal head and used as an internal standard.\nThe MRI protocol used for gadolinium experiments was a T1-weighted RARE sequence with the following parameters: TR, 300\u2009msec; TE, 10.2\u2009msec; FOV, 3.0\u2009cm; RARE factor, 1; matrix, 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256; averages, 4; slice thickness, 0.75\u2009mm.\n\nImage analysis\nImage processing, normalization, and quantification were performed with Paravision 5.1 Processing Software (Bruker, Billerica, MA). Regions of interest (ROIs) located on different areas of the brain and on the MnCl\n2\nphantom were selected from the MR images, and the mean contrast in the gray scale was measured at 6, 24, 48, and 72\u2009h and at 14 and 28 days after blast.

    "Methods": "This study is part of the Diagnosing and Evaluating Traumatic Encephalopathy using Clinical Tests (DETECT) study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, to develop biomarkers for thein vivodiagnosis of CTE. Study participants underwent extensive testing, which included neuroimaging, neuropsychological testing, interview on medical history, neurological and psychiatric evaluation, as well as genetic testing and lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein analysis.\n\nRecruitment for DETECT was started in November 2011 by means of e-mails to a mailing list of the National Football League (NFL) Players Association and NFL Alumni Associations, and also a post on the Boston University CTE Center website, presentations held at NFL alumni meetings, and by word of mouth. Details of the study protocol can also be found elsewhere.27,28The study protocol was approved by the Boston University Medical Center Institutional Review Board, and by the Partners Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants before enrollment into the study.\n\nParticipants\nThe DETECT inclusion criteria for former NFL players were: male, age 40\u201369 years, English as primary language, more than 12 years of organized football experience, including a minimum of 2 years in the NFL, and a self-report of mood, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms ongoing for at least 6 months before enrollment. Athletes with contraindication for MRI or lumbar puncture, as well as other diagnosed diseases of the central nervous system, were excluded from the study. At the time of this study, 74 former NFL players were included in DETECT, and 2 had no imaging data. Thus, a total of 72 imaging data sets of former NFL players were included in this study.\nThe DETECT inclusion criteria for controls were: male, age 40\u201369 years, and English as the primary language. In addition, healthy controls had to have participated in organized noncontact sports for at least 4 years, of which 2 years had to have been at the college level or beyond. Control subjects were excluded if they had ever served in the military or had ever participated in any of the following organized sports: football, hockey, rugby, soccer, lacrosse, wrestling, boxing, basketball, gymnastics, martial arts, kickboxing, cycling, or distance running. Medical conditions that led to the exclusion of controls included self-reported history of concussion,\n29\ndiagnosis of dementia, or medication that would make lumbar puncture unsafe.\n\nEvaluation of mood, behavior, and cognition\nAll subjects were administered the following tests: Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB) List Learning; NAB Map Reading; NAB Naming, Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (scored using the Boston Qualitative Scoring System); Trailmaking Test, Parts A and B; Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) Digit Symbol; Wide Range Achievement Test Fourth Edition (WRAT-4) Reading Test; and the Wisconsin Card Sort Test (WCST). The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Brown-Goodwin Lifetime History of Aggression, Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS), and Modified Scale for Suicidal Ideation (MSSI) are assessed as part of the psychiatric interview, while the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version (BRIEF-A), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Hopelessness Inventory (BHI), and Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory (BDHI) were self-completed by the subject in paper form.\n\nData acquisition\nAll subjects underwent MRI at Brigham and Women's Hospital using a 3T scanner (Magnetom Verio, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a 32-channel head coil. A T1-weighted Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) sequence was acquired with the following sequence parameters: TE\u2009=\u20093.36\u2009msec, TR\u2009=\u20091800\u2009msec, inversion time 1100\u2009msec, flip angle 7 degrees, acquisition matrix of 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009176 voxels with a voxel size of 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm.\nOf the initial 15 controls screened, one control was excluded because of motion artifacts, resulting in 14 controls included in this study (\nTable 1\n).\nTable\n1.\nDemographic Data of Study Participants\nNFL players\nControls\nt\ntest\nMean (SD)\nMean (SD)\np\nvalue\nAge (y)\n54.53 (8.03)\n57.14 (7.62)\n0.264\nBMI\n32.04 (4.47)\n28.49 (3.60)\n0.007\nYears of education\n16.39 (0.87)\n17.64 (2.10)\n0.045\n*\nYears of football total\n18.11 (3.49)\nYears in NFL\n7.80 (2.67)\nHistory of concussion\n**\n446.9 (1077.4)\n0.5 (1.53)\n0.001\n*\nOpen in a separate window\nSD, standard deviation; BMI, body mass index; NFL, National Football League.\n*\nSatterthwaite correction for unequal variance.\n**\nBased on self-report after being given a modern definition of concussion using the methods described by Robbins and associates.\n28\n\nPost-processing\nData sets were visually inspected for distortion and motion artifacts. All images were reoriented using 3D Slicer version 3.6 (Surgical Planning Laboratory, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA) after visually identifying the anterior and posterior commissure and the midsagittal plane as landmarks.\n\nRating of CSP\nCSP was defined as CSF being visible between two leaflets of the septum pellucidum on coronal slices of the T1-weighted MRI. The length of the cavum was determined by counting the number of coronal slices where CSP was visible and then multiplying the number of slices by the slice thickness of 1\u2009mm to calculate the overall length of the CSP.\n23\n,\n26\nRaters also evaluated the presence and length of cavum vergae, a posterior variant of CSP. The average amount of time to obtain all measurements was approximately 3\u2009min per data set.\nTo account for possible bias of individual head size and ventricular enlargement, the length of the entire septum pellucidum was measured. Septum length was measured in 3D Slicer version 4.3.0 (Surgical Planning Laboratory) by visually defining the borders of the septum at the genu and splenium of the CC on the midsagittal plane, and measuring the longest distance between these two (\nFig. 1\n). These landmarks were selected because the development of the CC is closely associated with the development of the septum pellucidum.\n30\nTo adjust for individual septum length, the ratio of CSP length to septum length was calculated. Ratings of CSP length and septal length were performed in random order by two different raters for each subject after both agreed on the definitions and procedures described above. Both raters were blinded to the subjects' group and to the rating of the other rater.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nLeft: Illustration of measurement of septum length on a T1-weighted magnetic resonance image in the midsagittal plane; Right: Example of cavum septi pellucidi visible on a coronal slice.\n\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical analyses were performed using SAS (Version 9.4). Results with a\np\nvalue below 0.05 are reported as statistically significant. Interrater reliability was tested using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) of the two raters for continuous outcomes and the Cohen kappa for binary outcomes, and a paired\nt\ntest for the difference between raters. Mean measurement discrepancies between raters by group (NFL-Control) were tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA), as well as for potential association with body mass index (BMI) and age using simple linear regression. A group comparison between the NFL players and controls was performed using a Wilcoxon two-sample test.\nFor estimating the effect of CSP on neuropsychological scores, the group of former professional NFL players was divided in those with CSP \u22642\u2009mm and those with CSP \u22656\u2009mm based on the literature.\n31\nMultivariate linear mixed effects models were run using the vector of neuropsychological scores from each subject as the dependent variable, and CSP as the main predictor of interest adjusted for BMI, age, years of education, and years playing football. Hence, we model two levels of correlations in our outcomes: (1) correlations of all test scores from the same subjects, and (2) correlations of all scores from the same domain (e.g., Trailmaking A and Digit Symbol in the Attention and Psychomotor Speed Domain)."

Nestin-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) mice were kindly provided by Dr. Enikolopov at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories (New York) and described previously.\n36\nAll procedures were conducted under protocols approved by Indiana University's Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nControlled cortical impact traumatic brain injury\nMale C57 BL/6 mice (\nn\n=\u200956) were subjected to mild, moderate, and severe CCI injury or sham surgery as previously described.\n32\n,\n37\nMice were used in experiments at the age of 9 weeks. Briefly, the mice were anesthetized with a solution of 2.5% Avertin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and placed in a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA). Using sterile procedures, the skin was retracted and a 4\u2009mm craniotomy was performed at a point midway between the lambda and bregma sutures and laterally midway between the central suture and the temporalis muscle. The skullcap was carefully removed without disruption of the underlying dura. Prior to injury induction, the tip of the impactor was angled and kept perpendicular to the exposed cortical surface.\nThe mouse CCI model uses an electromagnetic impactor that allows alteration of injury severity by controlling contact velocity and the level of cortical deformation independently. In these experiments, the contact velocity was set at 3.5\u2009m/sec and deformation depth was set at 0.2\u2009mm, 1.0\u2009mm, and 1.2\u2009mm, respectively, for mild, moderate, and severe TBI.

Briefly, sections were incubated in a solution of 0.1% cresyl violet (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20\u2009min. After a quick rinse in distilled water, the sections were then differentiated in 95% ethanol for 3\u2009min and followed by dehydration in 100% ethanol for 5\u2009min, twice. The sections were then cleared in xylene for 5\u2009min twice, air-dried, and mounted with DPX (Sigma-Aldrich).\nSections were stained with Fluoro-Jade B (FJB) to detect dying cells. Briefly, sections were hydrated in distilled water for 5\u2009min. The sections were then incubated in a solution of 0.06% potassium permanganate (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20\u2009min at room temperature. After washing in distilled water for 5\u2009min twice, the sections were incubated in a 0.0004% solution of FJB (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20\u2009min, followed by washing in distilled water three times and incubation in a solution of 0.01% 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma-Aldrich) for 10\u2009min. Sections were then air-dried and mounted with DPX.\nFor immunostaining, free floating sections were washed in PBS three times at room temperature, incubated with blocking buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 1% bovine serum albumin, 5% normal goat serum in PBS), and then incubated overnight with primary antibody at 4 \u00b0C. After washing in PBS three times, sections were incubated with secondary antibody for 2\u2009h at room temperature, followed by DAPI treatment for 2\u2009min. The sections were washed in PBS again three times and mounted with Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL). For BrdU incorporation, HCl pretreatment was performed prior to incubation in blocking buffer as follows: sections were incubated in 2N HCl for 1\u2009h at room temperature, soaked in 0.1M (pH 8.4) borate buffer for 10\u2009min, followed by PBS washing three times and then were processed according to standard protocol in blocking solution. The following primary antibodies and their final concentrations were used: anti-BrdU (1:200, rat; AbDSerotec, Raleigh, NC), anti-Sox2 (1:1000, rabbit; Abcam, Cambridge, CA), anti-GFP (1:1000, chicken; Abcam), anti-doublecortin (DCX; 1:500; guinea pig; Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), anti\u2013neuronal nuclei (NeuN; 1:500, mouse; Millipore), anti\u2013glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP; 1:1000, mouse; Sigma-Aldrich), anti-NG2 (1:200, rabbit; Millipore) and anti-CD11b (1:500, rabbit; Abcam). Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA) secondary antibodies were applied in a dilution of 1:1000.\n\nCortical cavity volume measurement\nSeries of every sixth sections (30\u2009\u03bcm thickness, 180\u2009\u03bcm apart) from covered injured cortex were stained with cresyl violet to show the spare cortex. The boundary contours of the contralateral and ipsilateral spare cortex were drawn with a Zeiss microscope (Jena, Germany) attached to a Neurolucida system (Microbrightfield Inc., Colchester, VT). The contours enclosed volume was measured. The percent cortex of the cavity was calculated with the following formula: percentage of the cortical cavity\u2009=\u2009(contralateral cortex volume \u2013 ipsilateral spare cortex volume)/contralateral cortex volume \u00d7100%.\n\nCell counting\nSections were simultaneously processed for immunostaining to detect target cells. An inverted fluorescent microscopy system (Zeiss Axiovert 200\u2009M) was used to analyze sections. For BrdU incorporated cell proliferation, series of every sixth section (30\u2009\u03bcm thickness, 180\u2009\u03bcm apart, 12 to 16 sections for each animal) from covered injured hippocampus were processed with antibody against BrdU. Cells were counted under the fluorescent microscope using the 40\u00d7 objective through the whole series of sections. The total cell number was determined through the profile count method. Briefly, every single BrdU-positive cell (even partial BrdU-positive nuclei at the borders of sections) was counted in multi-planes throughout the entire dentate gyrus in the 30\u2009\u03bcm section. For cell type specification, series of every sixth section (30\u2009\u03bcm thickness, 180\u2009\u03bcm apart) from covered injured hippocampus were processed with antibodies against BrdU and specific cell type marker. The double-labeled cell was counted using the profile count method as mentioned above and determined as follows. We used BrdU as an indicator. When the BrdU-positive cell showed in the frame, we switched to the channel matching the cell specific marker. If the target cell also had been marked, we considered it as a double-positive cell. For NSC proliferation evaluation, the entire SGZ was examined for the whole series of sections. To quantify surviving proliferated cells and distinguish newly-generated mature neurons, the entire dentate gyrus was examined through the whole series of sections. The total number of quantified cells was adjusted by correction.\n48\nThe volume of granule cell layer or dentate gyrus area was measured by creating contours in Zeiss software (AxioVision v4.8). For NSC proliferation evaluation, cell density was calculated by dividing the total cell number by the volume of the granule cell layer. For surviving proliferated cells and newly-generated mature neurons assessment, cell density was calculated by dividing the total cell number by the volume of the dentate gyrus. Thus cell density was expressed as average number/mm\n3\n.\nFor quantifying immature neurons, three epicentral sections (30\u2009\u03bcm thickness, 180\u2009\u03bcm apart) were processed with antibody against DCX. The total cell number was determined through the profile count method as described above. The volume of granule cell layer was measured in Zeiss software (AxioVision v4.8). Cell density was calculated by dividing the total cell number by the volume of the granule cell layer. DCX-positive cells were expressed as average number/mm\n3\n.\nTo assess proportions of mature neurons and reactive glia in surviving proliferated cells, epicentral sections of each animal were processed with antibodies against BrdU and GFAP, or NG2 or CD11b. BrdU positive cells and double positive cells were quantified as described above. The percentage of target cell type was then calculated. The proportion of each cell type in the whole BrdU positive population was then normalized to match 100% in total.\n\nMicroscopy\nThe inverted microscopy system (Zeiss Axiovert 200\u2009M) mentioned above was combined with an apotome and interfaced with a digital camera (Zeiss Axio Cam MRc5) controlled by a computer. Representative images were captured using the apotome in software (AxioVision v4.8), and stacked as a cut view image in the software. Then, the images were assembled and labeled in Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe System, San Jose, CA).\n\nStatistical analysis\nCell quantification data were shown as average \u00b1 standard deviation and analyzed via One-way analysis of variance followed by\npost hoc\nanalysis with Tukey's honest significance test using SPSS software IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY. Significance was set at\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Female bred-for-research farm piglets (N=\u200930) were delivered to the university at age 21\u201325 days and pair-housed during a 3- to 7-day acclimation and quarantine period. After acclimation, a tri-axial accelerometer (model X6-1A; Gulf Coast Data Concepts, LLC, Waveland, MS) was zip-tied to a close-fitting pet harness or jacket (Lomir Biomedical Inc., Notre-Dame-de-l'\u00cele-Perrot, Quebec, Canada) and positioned directly above and parallel to the mid-thoracic spine of the piglets. Piglets wore the harness or jacket for the remainder of the study. The back position is ideal for measuring normal range of piglet movement at its center of gravity, while preventing device disturbance/removal by limb, hock, or mouth contact. Because the piglets had a tendency to chew on one another's harness or jacket, the piglets were housed for the remainder of the study in separate, adjacent cages, within site, sound, and smell of one another. Each accelerometer required one AA battery. Battery life was variable, typically lasting 3\u20134 days. To prevent inadvertent data loss, batteries were replaced every 2\u20133 days.\n\nFour groups of piglets were studied, as described later in this section: na\u00efve piglets (N=\u20097) to develop the actigraphy thresholds; piglets before and after focal brain injury by controlled cortical impact (CCI) with a rigid indenter (N=\u20098); piglets before and after diffuse brain injury from a rapid nonimpact head rotation (RNR;N=\u20099); and sham piglets before and after anesthesia experience matched to the TBI piglets (N=\u20096). All animal study protocols were approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Care and Use Committee (Philadelphia, PA).\n\nResultant acceleration data were obtained continuously (25\u2009Hz), stored on the reusable USB memory of the sensor, uploaded to computer, and segmented into dark (7pmto 7am, defined as nighttime, NT) and light (from 4pmto 7pm, defined as daytime, DT) periods maintained in the animal husbandry unit. Although the housing unit was light from 7amto 7pm, we defined our daytime period to a reliable 4pmto 7pmportion of the lights-on epoch when animals were consistently in their cages after the end of the husbandry staff shift, to minimize human interaction and distraction. Animals were not sleep-deprived during the study. Animals were fed normally and could move freely, and were allowed to stay awake or fall asleep at will.\n\nDevelopment of porcine actigraphy algorithm\nThe Actigraph Data Analysis Software (ADAS) algorithm\n19\nwas developed for differentiating periods of sleep from wake by correlating human PSG with actigraphy data measured on the wrist. We adapted the human ADAS algorithm to fit the piglet actigraphy data measured on the torso using limited data available for sleeping patterns in pigs\n20\n,\n21\nand other mammals.\n22\nBriefly, acceleration time history is segmented into minute-long epochs and the human ADAS algorithm differentiates epochs as sleep or wake based on a threshold-crossing approach. If the number of times the magnitude of the acceleration exceeds 0.1\u2009g is 10 or fewer \u201ccrossings\u201d in a minute-long epoch, that epoch is defined as \u201csleep.\u201d If more than 10 crossings occur in the epoch, the epoch is categorized as a minute of \u201cwake.\u201d To account for wake-interval post-arousal and false positives from wrist movements during sleep, if fewer than four \u201cwake\u201d epochs occur consecutively, then these \u201cwake\u201d epochs are recategorized as minutes of \u201csleep.\u201d\nWe recorded actigraphic acceleration data as described above from na\u00efve piglets (\nN\n=\u20097) over a 24-h period after acclimation to the husbandry unit. After uploading to the computer, the absolute value of the resultant acceleration was determined, and 1\u2009g was subtracted to account for acceleration resulting from gravity. The data were segmented into minute-long epochs, and the number of 0.1-g crossings in each minute were determined. We found that the human acceleration threshold of 0.1\u2009g was low enough to capture torso movements, yet high enough to exclude any noise or chest wall movement resulting from respiration (\nFig. 1\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nRepresentative 1-min epoch of actigraphy acceleration (g) in a na\u00efve piglet. A 1-min-long epoch is shown and the horizontal line shows the threshold of 0.1\u2009g. With only one crossing in this minute-long epoch, this epoch is defined as inactive.\nTo determine how many threshold crossings/min would distinguish an inactive (or rest) epoch from an active epoch, the inactive efficiency (percent time inactive) per 24-h period for the na\u00efve piglets was calculated for a variety of crossing/min limits. The human ADAS algorithm was applied to the porcine data such that the \u201cinactive\u201d threshold was \u226410 crossings. If 3 or fewer consecutive \u201cactive\u201d minutes occurred, they were reclassified as \u201cinactive\u201d minutes. This method overestimated the inactive efficiency for the pig. This overestimation is likely attributable to the more deliberate manner of torso movement compared to wrist movement, resulting in fewer false positives of \u201cactive\u201d and necessitating a more sensitive threshold to define \u201cactive.\u201d Reducing the threshold for an inactive or rest epoch as a minute with \u22643 threshold crossings and eliminating the requirement for any number of consecutive active periods resulted in an average inactive efficiency that most closely approximated Robert and Dallaire's finding that na\u00efve 4-week-old piglets sleep approximately 55% of a 24-h period.\n21\nImportantly, in the absence of PSG data, the piglet actigraphy algorithm cannot identify sleep; rather, the algorithm distinguishes between activity and inactivity. The piglet threshold for inactivity was validated, and three levels of activity (low, medium, and high) were defined by aligning 30-min long video segments of the behavior of two piglets wearing actigraphs with their time-synced acceleration data. During epochs classified as inactive by the algorithm (\u2264\u20093 crossings over 0.1\u2009g per minute), the piglet indeed appeared to be at rest\u2014lying down, with few, if any, slight movements to shift position. Also, the analysis revealed that the piglet appeared active during epochs classified as active by the algorithm (>3 crossings over 0.1\u2009g/min). This analysis led to the following definitions: inactive epoch (\u2264\u20093 crossings/min); low-activity epoch (4\u20139 crossings/min); moderate-activity epoch (10\u201399 crossings/min); and high-activity epoch (\u2265\u2009100 crossings/min). Low activity was characterized by recumbancy with some movement (e.g., chewing on a toy) or standing stationary (no walking) for a full minute. Moderate activity was characterized by intermittent walking and standing with only brief, if any, intervals of lying down. High activity was defined as constant walking with possibly intermittent running during the epoch. In summary, for the piglet actigraphy algorithm, the data were segmented into minute-long epochs and marked as inactive, low activity, moderate activity, or high activity based on the number of times the absolute value of the acceleration crossed a threshold of 0.1\u2009g.\n\nActigraphy study design\nFemale 4-week-old piglets were housed and acclimated as described above and designated to receive a focal CCI TBI (\nN\n=\u20098), diffuse white matter TBI by a rapid head rotation in the sagittal direction (\nN\n=\u20099; mean velocity and standard deviation [SD] of 124.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.75\u2009rad/s), or served as an anesthetized sham (\nN\n=\u20096). Importantly, a \u201cpiglet week\u201d is developmentally compared to a \u201chuman child month.\u201d\n23\nEach pig wore an instrumented harness for 1\u20132 days before injury or anesthesia to determine a baseline activity and then actigraphy was measured for 4\u20136 days post-injury to account for sustained effects of brain injury. Levels of activity were determined by interpreting data collected from accelerometers strapped to their backs. After sacrifice, 8 days post-TBI, brains (\nN\n=\u20098 CCI,\nN\n=\u20096 RNR) were fixed, sectioned into 3-mm-thick coronal blocks, and 6-\u03bcm slices from each section were stained with beta-amyloid precursor protein (\u03b2-APP) and hemoxylin and eosin (H&E) for traumatic injury. Brains from other subjects were harvested for fresh tissue studies. Briefly, the neuropathologist on our team (C.S., blinded to experimental group) examined every 6-\u03bcm-thick slice from each 3-mm coronal section for gross pathology and documented any hemorrhages, established infarcts (changes in staining intensity), and ischemic neurons (cell shrinkage and eosinophilia) from the H&E slides, and traumatic and ischemic axonal injury from the \u03b2-APP slides. Distribution of axonal and neuronal injury were annotated on the digital photographs for each animal, and regions of white matter damage, infarct, and ischemia were traced in each slice and normalized by slice area. Lesion volume (V\ninj\n) was defined as total injured area (axonal injury plus infarct/ischemic lesions) divided by total slice area. All details regarding anesthesia, injury methods, and immunohistochemistry quantification have been described previously.\n17\n,\n24\nThe nighttime (NT, 7\npm\nto 7\nam\n) and daytime (DT, 4\npm\nto 7\npm\n) patterns of active and inactive periods obtained 1 day pre-injury or anesthesia (day \u22121) and on day 4 post-TBI in focal and diffuse brain-injured piglets were compared to those of time-matched sham piglets experiencing only the anesthesia portion of the protocol. After a full set of data were collected for a piglet, the number of 0.1-g crossings on day \u22121 and day 4 were determined for every minute epoch, and any epoch with \u22643 crossings was designated as \u201cinactive,\u201d and epochs with more crossings were designated as \u201cactive,\u201d with those active minutes with \u2265100 crossings additionally defined as \u201chigh activity.\u201d Because of some battery failures, and a variety of pre-injury days of measurement, these days were selected for analysis to include the most animals in each study group.\nThe most commonly derived metrics from human actigraphy data\n11\nwere evaluated or adapted to capture daytime drowsiness and nighttime active disruptions: \u201csettle\u201d onset time (SOT) after lights-out in the animal facility (NT, 7\npm\nto 7\nam\n), defined as the number of minutes until the first of three consecutive minute-long inactive epochs; the density or number of active periods per hour in the DT and in the NT after SOT; average duration of consecutive active periods in DT and NT after SOT; the inactive efficiency, defined as the percent of NT after SOT or DT spent in inactive; and the fraction of high-activity epochs in DT and NT normalized to total number of active epochs for that day and time. Downloading the data from USB flashdrive to computer, processing and application of the actigraphy algorithm, calculating clinically relevant activity parameters, generating plots displaying results, and exporting the calculated parameters to a user-friendly platform (Microsoft Excel, Redmond, WA) were operationalized and partially automated by using a PigFit, our lab-designed Matlab application.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe data from all 23 animals on day \u22121 was pooled to create a single robust pre-injury or pre-anesthesia experience baseline. All metrics are presented in box and whiskers format, with a horizontal line within the box at the median value, and the 75th and 25th percentile responses represented by the upper and lower dimensions of the box. The ends of the whiskers are the most extreme values, and filled symbols depict outlier values. Box plots were examined qualitatively for increase or decrease in metric variability (box size). Difference between NT and DT values (NT-DT) for each metric were evaluated, and the means and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for those differences were determined. Positive metric difference (NT-DT) values represent instances where nighttime magnitude was greater than daytime, whereas negative differences represent larger daytime values. Significant NT-DT differences were defined when CIs did not include zero (and indicated with an asterisk in box plots and\nTable 1\n). To examine variation across groups, CIs of NT-DT differences were compared (and indicated with a dagger in\nTable 1\n). To examine whether NT and DT values differed significantly within a day, a quantitative Wilcoxon's rank-sum test was performed for four groups: the consolidated group on day \u22121 and for each of the three groups separately on day +4, with significance defined as\np\n\u2264\u20090.05 (and indicated with a horizontal line in the box plots).\nTable\n1.\nNight- and Daytime Differences in Actigraphy Metrics\nMetric\nDay\nGroup\nN\nMean value\n\u00b1\nSD (95% CI)\nInactive efficiency (NT-DT), unitless fraction\n\u22121\nAll\n*\n23\n0.126\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0317 (0.0605, 0.192)\n+4\nSham\n6\n\u22120.055\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0717 (\u22120.239, 0.1295)\n+4\nCCI\n*,\u2020\n8\n\u22120.18\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0736 (\u22120.354, \u22120.0057)\n+4\nRNR\n9\n\u22120.00541\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0476 (\u22120.115, 0.104)\nFraction high activity per active time (NT-DT)\n\u22121\nAll\n23\n\u22120.0481\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0383 (\u22120.127, 0.0313)\n+4\nSham\n6\n\u22120.0199\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0847 (\u22120.238, 0.198)\n+4\nCCI\n8\n\u22120.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1078 (\u22120.355, 0.155)\n+4\nRNR\n*\n9\n0.1058\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0409 (0.0115, 0.2)\nMean active interval length (NT-DT), min\n\u22121\nAll\n*\n23\n\u22123.472\u2009\u00b1\u20090.75 (\u22125.03, \u22121.92)\n+4\nSham\n6\n\u22120.905\u2009\u00b1\u20091.343 (\u22124.36, 2.55)\n+4\nCCI\n8\n0.992\u2009\u00b1\u20091.269 (\u22122.01, 3.99)\n+4\nRNR\n9\n0.267\u2009\u00b1\u20090.964 (\u22121.96, 2.49)\nDensity of active intervals (NT-DT), no./h\n\u22121\nAll\n23\n0.775\u2009\u00b1\u20090.484 (\u22120.228, 1.779)\n+4\nSham\n6\n0.958\u2009\u00b1\u20091.223 (\u22122.186, 4.103)\n+4\nCCI\n8\n0.698\u2009\u00b1\u20090.911 (\u22121.455, 2.851)\n+4\nRNR\n9\n\u22120.444\u2009\u00b1\u20090.794 (\u22122.275, 1.386)\nSettle onset time (NT only), min\n\u22121\nAll\n*\n23\n12.74\u2009\u00b1\u20094.23 (3.97, 21.51)\n+4\nSham\n6\n8.83\u2009\u00b1\u20096.06 (\u22126.74, 24.4)\n+4\nCCI\n8\n22.38\u2009\u00b1\u200916.46 (\u221216.56, 61.31)\n+4\nRNR\n9\n19.33\u2009\u00b1\u200910.44 (\u22124.73, 43.4)\nOpen in a separate window\nAll values are mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD with 95% CI in parentheses.\n*\nNT-DT difference is significantly different from 0.\n\u2020\nValue on day +4 is significantly different from overall group on day \u22121.

    "Methods": "Organotypic hippocampal slice culture\nAll animal procedures were approved by the Columbia University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). OHSC were generated as previously described.\n3\n,\n20\nIn brief, P8-10 Sprague-Dawley rat pups were decapitated, and the brains removed. Hippocampii were excised, sectioned into 400\u2009\u03bcm thick slices, and separated aseptically in ice-cold Gey's salt solution supplemented with 25\u2009mM D-glucose (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Slices were plated onto porous Millipore Millicell\u2122 cell culture membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA) in Neurobasal\u2122 medium supplemented with 2\u2009mM GlutaMAX\u2122, 1X B27 supplement, 10\u2009mM HEPES, and 25\u2009mM D-glucose (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Every 2 to 3 days, half of the medium was replaced with full-serum medium, containing 50% Minimum Essential Medium, 25% Hank's Balanced Salt Solution, 25% heat inactivated horse serum, 2\u2009mM GlutaMAX, 25\u2009mM D-glucose, and 10\u2009mM HEPES (Sigma). Prior to blast injury, cultures were maintained for 10 to 14 days.\n\nPrimary blast exposure\nBlast injury methods have been previously described in detail.\n16\n,\n17\nIn brief, a shockwave was generated with a 76-mm diameter aluminum shock tube with an adjustable-length driver section (25\u2009mm, 50\u2009mm, and 190\u2009mm used for the current studies) pressurized with helium or nitrogen and a 1240-mm long driven section.\n16\n,\n17\nIndividual culture wells were sealed inside sterile, 57\u03bcm-thick, low-density polyethylene bags (Whirl-Pak, Fort Atkins, WI) filled with 10\u2009mL of pre-warmed, serum-free culture medium (containing 75% Minimum Essential Medium, 25% Hank's Balanced Salt Solution, 2\u2009mM GlutaMAX, 25\u2009mM D-glucose, and 10\u2009mM HEPES) that had been equilibrated with 5% CO\n2\n/95% O\n2\n(37\u00b0C) before being placed in the fluid-filled blast receiver, maintained at 37\u00b0C. These bags were selected because their acoustic impedance matched that of water, thus preventing attenuation of the pressure transient, as previously reported.\n17\nThe culture and the bag were submerged 85\u2009mm into the receiver column, oriented perpendicular to the pressure wave propagation. The receiver was sealed (without air bubbles) with a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sheet and positioned directly at the shock tube exit (5\u2009mm gap).\nPiezoresistive pressure transducers (Endevco 8530B-500, San Juan Capistrano, CA) were flush-mounted at the exit of the shock tube and in the fluid-filled blast receiver at the location of the culture and were oriented perpendicular to the direction of propagation to record side-on (incident) pressure. Analog outputs from the transducers were conditioned using amplifiers (gain of 50) and low-pass filters (corner frequency of 40\u2009kHz; Alligator Technologies, CostaMesa, CA). Signals were digitized with an X-series data acquisition card at 125\u2009kHz and LabVIEW\u2122 2010 (National Instruments, Austin, TX). Peak overpressure, overpressure duration, and impulse were calculated with custom MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA) code.\n17\nFor injured cultures, the shock tube was then fired; sham cultures were treated identically except the shock tube was not fired. Four blast exposure levels were utilized (\nTable 1\n; levels referenced to Effgen and colleagues, 2014\n3\n), characterized by the peak pressure (kPa), duration (ms), and impulse (kPa\u00b7ms) of the in-air shockwave and the in-fluid pressure transient. Blast levels (specific parameters given below in the\nResults\nsection) simulated real-world exposures and were chosen both below and above the threshold for causing cell death based on previous studies.\n3\nFollowing blast- or sham exposure, the culture was immediately removed from the receiver and returned to the incubator in fresh, full-serum medium.\nTable\n1.\nBlast Exposure Levels Tested in This Study\nIn-air\nIn-fluid\nExposure level\nPressure (kPa)\nDuration (ms)\nImpulse (kPa\n\u00b7\nms)\nPressure (kPa)\nDuration (ms)\nImpulse (kPa\n\u00b7\nms)\nLevel 1\n106\u2009\u00b1\u20092\n0.25\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\n9\u2009\u00b1\u20092\n134\u2009\u00b1\u20092\n1.50\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\n89\u2009\u00b1\u20091\nLevel 2\n93\u2009\u00b1\u20093\n1.40\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\n39\u2009\u00b1\u20091\n270\u2009\u00b1\u200915\n2.60\u2009\u00b1\u20090.20\n295\u2009\u00b1\u200956\nLevel 4\n336\u2009\u00b1\u20098\n0.84\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\n87\u2009\u00b1\u20092\n598\u2009\u00b1\u200915\n1.85\u2009\u00b1\u20090.30\n440\u2009\u00b1\u200913\nLevel 9\n424\u2009\u00b1\u20096\n2.31\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03\n248\u2009\u00b1\u20093\n1510\u2009\u00b1\u200991\n2.80\u2009\u00b1\u20090.10\n1420\u2009\u00b1\u200987\nOpen in a separate window\nBlast exposures were characterized by three different parameters of the shockwave: peak overpressure (kPa), duration (ms), and impulse (kPa\u00b7ms). Four different exposure levels (in addition to sham exposure) were utilized as previously reported by Effgen and colleagues (2014).\n3\nParameters are reported for the in-air shockwave and the in-fluid pressure transient. These blast pressure histories are similar to those experienced in-theater.\n3\n\nCell death measurement\nPropidium iodide fluorescence was used to measure cell death immediately prior to and 4 days following injury. Previous studies with this injury model have demonstrated that significant cell death does not occur until 4 days post-injury.\n3\nOHSC were incubated in 2.5\u2009\u03bcM propidium iodide (Life Technologies) in serum-free medium for 1\u2009h before imaging. Images were acquired at the indicated time points using an Olympus IX81 microscope (Olympus America, Center Valley, PA) with 568/24\u2009nm (peak/width) excitation and 610/40\u2009nm emission filters. Following imaging, cultures were returned to fresh, full serum medium. Cell death was determined for specific OHSC regions (DG, CA1, CA3), as previously described, using MetaMorph (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA).\n21\nIn brief, the same threshold for fluorescence was used to analyze all images at both pre- and post-injury time points for a given culture. Cell death was quantified as the percentage area of a specific region exhibiting fluorescence above the threshold. To confirm OHSC viability after blast, a subset of cultures were exposed to the highest blast level (Level 9) and subsequently subjected to an excitotoxic injury (10mM of glutamate for 3\u2009h) 4 days following blast exposure. OHSC were returned to fresh serum-free medium following excitotoxic exposure, and cultures were imaged for cell death 24h later. Cell death was analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Dunnett\npost hoc\ntests with statistical significance set at\np\n<\u20090.05 (SPSS version 22, IBM, Armonk, NY).\n\nElectrophysiology\nElectrophysiological activity within the OHSC was recorded using 60-channel MEAs (8\u2009\u00d7\u20098 electrode grid without the corners, 30\u2009\u03bcm electrode diameter, 200\u2009\u03bcm electrode spacing) 4 to 6 days following blast injury (60MEA200/30iR-Ti-gr, Multi-Channel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany). This time point coincided with the observed delay for increased cell death previously measured in this injury model.\n3\nBefore transferring OHSCs to MEAs, the MEAs were plasma cleaned (Harrick Plasma, Ithaca, NY) and coated with 5\u2009\u03bcL of 0.01% nitrocellulose (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) in methanol (Pharmco-AAPER, Brookfield, CT) to adhere the tissue to the electrodes. Individual OHSCs were excised from the Millipore membranes and inverted onto the MEA. A nylon mesh, harp slice grid (ALA Scientific Instruments, Farmingdale, NY) held the OHSC stationary and helped ensure contact with the electrodes. OHSCs were perfused with artificial cerebral spinal fluid (norm-aCSF) containing 125\u2009mM NaCl, 3.5\u2009mM KCl, 26\u2009mM NaHCO\n3\n, 1.2\u2009mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 2.4\u2009mM CaCl\n2\n, 1.3\u2009mM MgCl\n2\n, 10\u2009mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), and 10\u2009mM glucose (pH\u2009=\u20097.40), which was bubbled with 5% CO\n2\n/95% O\n2\nand warmed to 37\u00b0C, as previously described.\n22\nRecordings were acquired with an MEA1060-BC amplifier and data acquisition system (Multi-Channel Systems). The system recorded neural signals at 20\u2009kHz with a 6\u2009kHz analog, anti-aliasing filter. Recordings were further filtered in MATLAB using an eighth-order, digital, low-pass (1000\u2009Hz) and a fourth-order, digital, high-pass (0.2\u2009Hz) Butterworth filter. The sample numbers for each injury group for a given recording protocol are listed in the\nResults\nsection.\n\nSpontaneous activity\nSpontaneous neural activity was measured by recording continuously for 3\u2009min from all electrodes within the hippocampus. The raw data were passed through a 60\u2009Hz comb filter using a custom MATLAB script, before neural event activity was detected based on the multi-resolution Teager energy operator.\n23\u201327\nEvents were characterized by their start time, magnitude, and duration.\nSpontaneous network synchronization was also quantified using previously published methods.\n26\n,\n28\u201330\nCorrelation, c\n\u03c4\n, between neural events was calculated for each electrode pair (\nx\nand\ny\n) given neural event-timing\nand\n(i\u2009=\u20091, \u2026, m\nx\n; j\u2009=\u20091, \u2026, m\ny\n) according to\n28\n:\nin which\n\u03c4\nwas the duration in which two events were considered synchronous (1.5\u2009ms) and\nm\nx\n&m\ny\nwere the total number of events to be compared on each electrode.\nAnactivity correlation matrix,\nQ\nxy\n, was calculated as:\nwith individual entries ranging from 0 (completely uncorrelated) to 1 (perfectly correlated). The eigenvalues,\n\u03bb\nb\n, and associated eigenvectors,\n\u03bd\nab\n, of the correlation matrix provided insight to the structure of the neuronal activity. To identify clusters of simultaneously active electrodes, the participation index (PI) was calculated for each electrode\na\nthat contributed to a cluster\nb\nas:\nwhere\n\u03bd\nab\nrepresented the\na\nth\nelement of eigenvector b. Electrodes contributing to cluster\nb\nwere those with PI\u2009\u2265\u20090.01.\n29\nTo determine statistical significance, randomized surrogate time-series data without correlated activity were generated with an event-rate equal to the measured event-rate of the experimental recordings.\n29\nThe surrogate process was repeated 50 times, and the mean (\n) and standard deviation (SD\nk\n) of surrogate eigenvalues were calculated (k\u2009=\u20091, \u2026, M, where M represented the number of electrodes in the experiment). We identified the number of synchronized clusters that were significantly different from the randomized, asynchronous surrogate clusters as:\nwhere\nsgn\nwas the sign function,\n\u03bb\nk\nwas the eigenvalue of each electrode of the experimental data, and\nK\nwas a constant (\nK\n=\u20093 was chosen to provide a 99% confidence level, i.e.,\np\n<\u20090.01).\nFinally, a global synchronization index (GSI), ranging from 0 (random, uncorrelated activity) to 1 (perfectly synchronous, correlated activity on all electrodes), was calculated for the cluster with the highest degree of synchronization:\nwhere\nwas the mean of the largest surrogate eigenvalues,\n\u03bb\nM\nwas the maximal eigenvalue of the correlation matrix from the experimental data, and\nM\nwas the number of electrodes in the experiment. Active regional percentage in the most synchronized cluster (i.e., the cluster corresponding to\n\u03bb\nM\n) was quantified as the ratio of regional electrodes involved in the cluster to the total number of electrodes in the respective region.\nSpontaneous and synchronization parameters were averaged for a given recording and analyzed by ANOVA, followed by Dunnett\npost hoc\ntests with statistical significance set as\np\n<\u20090.05 (SPSS version 22, IBM). In addition, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed with the built-in MATLAB function\npca.m\non the parameters together to identify significant changes (ANOVA) in the first principal component score (PC1), followed by Dunnett\npost hoc\ntests. Observed power was calculated for the effect of injury severity (impulse) with \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05.\n\nStimulus-response curves\nStimulus-response (SR) curves were generated by applying a constant current, biphasic, bi-polar stimulus (100\u2009\u03bcs positive phase followed by 100\u2009\u03bcs negative phase) of increasing magnitude (0\u2013200\u2009\u03bcA in 10\u2009\u03bcA increments) to electrodes located in either the Schaffer collateral (SC) or mossy fiber (MF) pathways, and the data were analyzed with respect to stimulation site. Evoked responses were recorded from each electrode throughout the hippocampal tri-synaptic circuit. As in previous studies, each electrode's response was fit to a sigmoidal curve\n22\nas:\nR\nmax\nrepresented the maximum amplitude of the evoked response and I\n50\nrepresented the current necessary to generate a half-maximal response. The term\nm\n, which is proportional to the slope of the sigmoidal fit, represented the spread in the firing threshold for the population of neurons.\n22\n,\n25\n,\n27\nData from each electrode were segregated by anatomical region of interest (ROI: CA1, CA3, DG). Each parameter (I\n50\n, m, R\nmax\n) for an electrode was averaged within a region to determine that regional response for any given slice. Data reported for each region are the average across slices within a given experimental group.\nA PCA was also performed to identify significant multivariate changes in the SR parameters. Individual parameters as well as PC1were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Dunnett\npost hoc\ntests with statistical significance set as\np\n<\u20090.05 (SPSS version 22, IBM). Observed power was calculated for the effect of impulse with \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05.\n\nPaired-pulse ratios\nShort-term plasticity was investigated by delivering two successive stimuli of the same intensity (I\n50\n) at interstimulus intervals (ISI) of 20, 35, 50, 70, 100, 140, 200, 300, 500, 1000, and 2000\u2009ms. Paired-pulse ratios (PPR) were calculated as the ratio of the peak-to-peak amplitude of the second response to the peak-to-peak amplitude of the first response. A PPR >1 indicated paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), whereas a PPR <1 indicated paired-pulse depression.\n31\nISIs were assigned to one of four bins that are biologically relevant to short-term synaptic plasticity. Short-term ISI (20\u2009ms) produce paired-pulse depression thought to be mediated by the neurotransmitter \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), specifically via the GABA\nA\nclass of GABA receptors.\n32\n,\n33\nEarly-mid ISIs (35\u2013100\u2009ms) elicit a rebound in excitation thought to be caused by GABA\nA\nmediated disinhibition and activation of\nN\n-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors.\n32\n,\n34\nLate-mid ISIs (140\u2013500\u2009ms) produce late-phase paired-pulse depression thought to be mediated by GABA\nB\nreceptors.\n32\n,\n35\nLastly, long-term ISIs (>500\u2009ms) are not expected to elicit a response resulting from the interaction of the paired pulse stimulation and instead results in two independent and equal responses.\n36\n,\n37\nPPRs for each bin were averaged across a given recording and analyzed by ANOVA, followed by Dunnett\npost hoc\ntests with statistical significance set at\np\n<\u20090.05 (SPSS version 22, IBM). Additionally, PC1 was analyzed to identify significant multivariate changes in PPR. Observed power was calculated for the effect of impulse with \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05.\n\nLong-term potentiation\nIn a separate cohort of cultures, the ability to induce LTP was quantified after blast. Baseline behavior was evoked by stimulating at I\n50\nonce every min for 30\u2009min. LTP was then induced by stimulating across the SC pathway with a high frequency stimulus, which consisted of three trains of 100\u2009Hz pulses applied for 1\u2009sec at I\n50\n, with each train separated by 10\u2009sec.\n38\n,\n39\nImmediately following LTP induction, post-LTP responses were evoked by stimulating at I\n50\nonce every minute for 60\u2009min. LTP induction was calculated as percent potentiation above baseline based on the last 10\u2009min of recording in each recording window. To ensure only stable responses were included for analysis, electrodes were discounted if the coefficient of variance (pre- or post-induction) was greater than 20%.\n40\nLTP induction was averaged among electrodes within the CA1 and analyzed by ANOVA followed by Dunnett\npost hoc\ntests with statistical significance set as\np\n<\u20090.05 (SPSS version 22, IBM)."

Patients were identified using a Department of Neurological Surgery database compiled of patients with a principal diagnosis of SCI (International Classification of Diseases codes 952\u2013957).\nInclusion criteria were: (1) age\n\u2265\n18 years, (2) thoracic and/or lumbar spine MRI including at minimum sagittal and axial T2 imaging, and (3) documented clinical assessments including AIS at admission and discharge. Exclusion criteria were (1) surgical decompression and/or fusion before MRI, (2) MRI that was too degraded by motion or other artifact such that images were nondiagnostic as assessed by an attending neuroradiologist, (3) cervical spinal cord injury, and (4) injuries primarily involving the conus medullaris or cauda equina nerve roots, (5) pre-existing hardware.\nTwenty-five patients met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Clinical data collected included patient age, sex, AIS grade at discharge, time to MRI, time to discharge, mechanism, and whether surgical decompression was performed before hospital discharge (\nTable 1\n). All patients in the study cohort had a principal diagnosis of SCI and underwent our institutional SCI treatment protocol. The five patients classified as AIS grade E on formal admission examination had documented symptoms of truncal/lower extremity sensory deficits and/or had documentation of motor weakness in the field. These deficits had resolved AT neurological examination on admission and therefore qualify as AIS grade E.\nTable\n1.\nPatient Characteristics\n*\nCharacteristics\nAge (years)\n38.32\u2009\u00b1\u200915.74\nSex\n17 male: 8 female\nInjury type\nBlunt\u2009=\u200921, penetrating\u2009=\u20094\nAIS at admission\nA\u2009=\u200911, B\u2009=\u20092, C\u2009=\u20091, D\u2009=\u20096, E\u2009=\u20095\nAIS at discharge\nA\u2009=\u20099, B\u2009=\u20090, C\u2009=\u20092, D\u2009=\u20095, E\u2009=\u20099\nTime to MRI (hours)\n14.68\u2009\u00b1\u200918.56\nTime to discharge (days)\n20.96\u2009\u00b1\u200921.48\nSurgical decompression before discharge\nYes\u2009=\u200916, No\u2009=\u20099\nMechanism of injury\n10 fall from height, 5 motor vehicle collision, 3 crush injuries by large falling objects, 2 gunshot wounds, 2 stab wounds, 1 motorcycle collision\nVertebral body level of epicenter of injury by imaging\n1 T2, 1 T3, 1 T4, 3 T6, 2 T7, 3 T8, 2 T9, 1 T11, 7 T12, 3 T1, 1 without detectable injury\nBASIC score\n1.88\u2009\u00b1\u20091.67\nSagittal grade\n2.32\u2009\u00b1\u20091.22\nLongitudinal extent of injury (mm)\n23.52\u2009\u00b1\u200926.56\nTLICS Score\n5.16\u2009\u00b1\u20092.78\nMCC (%)\n23.38\u2009\u00b1\u200927.36\nMSCC (%)\n18.67\u2009\u00b1\u200924.02\nOpen in a separate window\n*\nResults are expressed as N or mean \u00b1 standard deviation.\nAIS, American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; BASIC, Brain and Spinal Injury Center; TLICS, thoracolumbar injury classification system; MCC, maximum canal compromise; MSCC, maximum spinal cord compression.\n\nMRI\nAll MRI were acquired on a 1.5 Tesla GE Genesis Signa HDxt scanner, software version 15 (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). Routine trauma protocol thoracic spine MRIs were performed including at minimum sagittal T1 and T2 fast spin echo (FSE) sequences and axial T2 FSE sequences. For sagittal T1 imaging, the following parameters were used: slice thickness\u2009=\u20093\u2009mm; time to repetition (TR)\u2009=\u2009between 520 msec and 630 msec; time to echo (TE)\u2009=\u2009between 9 msec and 15 msec; echo train length (ETL)\u2009=\u20093; field-of-view (FOV)\u2009=\u200930\u2009cm\n2\n; acquisition matrix\u2009=\u2009512\u2009\u00d7\u2009512. For sagittal T2: slice thickness, FOV, and matrix size were as above with TR between 3100 msec and 4000 msec and TE between 105 msec and 120 msec; ETL was between 19 and 21.

Sagittal grade was assigned as follows (\nFig. 1E\n): grade 1 represented normal spinal cord signal; grade 2 represented T2 hyperintense intramedullary signal with longitudinal extent confined to a single vertebral level; grade 3 represented >1 vertebral level edema; and grade 4 represented mixed hemorrhage and edema.\n2\n,\n3\nWe also measured the greatest longitudinal extent of injury on sagittal T2 images in mm as described in the SCI common data elements (CDE) version 1.0 (\nFig. 1A\n). MCC and MSCC were also both measured on midsagittal images as described previously, by dividing the anterior-posterior (AP) diameter of the canal (for MCC) and the AP diameter of spinal cord (for MSCC) by the average of the canal or spinal cord above and below as described in the literature with MCC measured on T1 and MSCC measured on T2 (\nFig. 1B,C\n).\n11\n,\n19\n,\n27\n,\n29\n,\n38\nTLICS was assigned as described in the literature after reviewing any necessary computed tomography (CT) imaging and the clinical chart.\n39\u201341\n\nMultidimensional analytical workflow and statistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were performed in SPSS v. 22 (SPSS Inc.; Chicago, IL). To assess the relationship between the different MRI measures, we used a NL-PCA in the general workflow depicted in\nFigure 2\n. NL-PCA is suitable for a set of variables including mixed measurement levels (nominal, ordinal, and numeric).\n42\n,\n43\nIn NL-PCA, variables are assigned numerical values through an automated process called optimal scaling transformation. First, NL-PCA was applied using a six-dimensional solution. The final dimensionality (i.e., number of PCs) of the PCA was defined based on (1) Kaiser rule: eigenvalue >1 and (2), Cattell rule: scree plot.\n44\n,\n45\nThe NL-PCA was then pruned with reduced PC dimensions.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nMultidimensional analytical workflow. Raw magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) variables are fed into a nonlinear principal component analysis (NL-PCA). NL-PCA uses a process called optimal scaling transformation to handle different analysis levels (e.g., ordinal and numeric) in the dataset. Optimal scaling assigns quantitative values to categorical variables optimally, meaning maximizing the variance of the predefined number of principal components (PCs) (i.e., dimensions). The NL-PCA loading pattern shows the weight (i.e., loading) of every single MRI variable on the extracted PCs. In a next step, individual PC scores are used to define the predictive nature of PCs on outcome. An individual PC score is the sum of the multiplied loadings by the individual raw value of every single variable. AIS, American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nTo determine the stability of the NL-PCA solution, we performed a nonparametric balanced bootstrapping procedure using 2000 iterations and Procrustes rotation.\n46\nThe two-dimensional NL-PCA solution was further cross-validated with the bootstrapped solution by using root mean square difference in PC loading patterns, the coefficient of congruence, the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient, and the Cattell salient variable similarity index. Convergence of these mathematically distinct metrics indicates consensus for replication of PC patterns.\nThe sensitivity of the extracted two-dimensional PC scores for predicting AIS at discharge was tested with a linear mixed model. To assess the bivariate relationship between AIS at discharge and MRI measures, separate Spearman rank correlations and an optimal scaled regression were applied. These procedures allow a direct comparison between the univariate correlations from individual variables and multivariable sets with different metric features (i.e., ordinal and numeric).\nAll predictive validity testing was based on individual MRI measures from MRI obtained near time of admission and AIS at time of patient discharge from the hospital. Statistical significance for all analysis was set at \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05. Bootstrapping and power calculations indicated that the N\u2009=\u200925 was sufficient for assessing the predictive validity of MRI with respect to AIS at discharge.\n\nLevels of validity\nValidation of MRI measures involves different levels of validity assessment as described by classical measurement theory. \u201cFace validity\u201d is defined as the concept that the MRI measures accurately reflect what they purport to measure on face value (i.e., an MRI-measured lesion looks like a lesion). \u201cConvergent validity\u201d is the concept that measures that should correlate, do indeed correlate (i.e., lesion length and lesion area do correlate). \u201cDiscriminant validity\u201d refers to the concept that measures that should diverge, do indeed diverge (i.e., measures of ligamentous change diverge from neuroanatomical measures). \u201cConstruct validity\u201d refers to the concept that multidimensional patterns are coherent from a theoretical perspective (i.e., neuroscores coalesce as coherent unit). Construct validity can be considered to involve both discriminant and convergent validity. \u201cPredictive validity\u201d refers to the concept that multidimensional MRI patterns can predict outcome. In the\nResults\nsection, we address which level of validity is addressed by each statistical finding."

    "Methods": "Participants\nParticipants were recruited from an ongoing prospective study of clinical recovery following concussion, Project Head to Head. Project Head to Head enrolled contact and collision sport athletes from nine high schools and four colleges in southeastern Wisconsin from August 2012 through November 2014. For the purposes of this paper, a sample of male football players who sustained concussions (\nn\n=\u200922) in the Fall 2014 sport season were recruited for neuroimaging assessment as part of a concurrent General Electric-National Football League (GE-NFL) Head Health Challenge study, in addition to completing the larger project's standard clinical post-injury protocol. Four concussed patients were excluded due to severe head motion during the imaging procedure; therefore, only 18 patients were included in this report. Also, the non-injured controls (\nn\n=\u200919) were selected to match injured athletes based on age, gender, sport, estimated premorbid level of academic achievement (see Wechsler Test of Adult Reading [WTAR] measure listed below), and grade point average.\nTable 1\nsummarizes the sample characteristics and degree of matching between the groups used in these analyses. All subjects except one reported engaging in a graded program of exertion. The one subject who did not was injured in the last game of the season and therefore did not need to return to play after injury.\nTable\n1.\nSample Characteristics\nConcussed (n\u2009=\u200918) M (SD) or N (%)\nControl (n\u2009=\u200919) M (SD) or N (%)\nBetween groups p\nDemographics\nCollege (vs. high school)\n14 (77.8%)\n15 (78.9%)\n0.931\nAge (years.)\n17.72 (1.53)\n18.00 (1.76)\n0.613\nRace\n0.571\nWhite\n14 (77.8%)\n13 (68.4%)\nBlack\n4 (22.2%)\n5 (26.3%)\nOther/unknown\n0 (0.0%)\n1 (5.3%)\nHeight (inches)\n75.11 (17.54)\n71.37 (2.61)\n0.364\nWeight (pounds)\n217.34 (55.45)\n198.32 (36.40)\n0.230\nADHD\n2 (11.1%)\n2 (10.5%)\n0.954\nLearning disability\n0 (0.0%)\n2 (10.5%)\n0.157\nNumber of prior concussions\n1.00 (1.03)\n.42 (.77)\n0.060\nWTAR standard score\n98.67 (14.87)\n97.42 (15.19)\n0.803\nAcute injury characteristics\nLOC\n1 (5.6%)\n-\nPTA\n1 (5.6%)\n-\nRGA\n4 (22.2%)\n-\nOpen in a separate window\nSample included male football players only.

Participants were compensated $30 for completing pre-season baseline assessments, $50 for each follow-up clinical assessment, and $100 for each MRI session. All testing procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Medical College of Wisconsin.\n\nBaseline and post-injury clinical assessments\nParticipants completed a 90-min clinical assessment protocol at pre-season baseline testing and at each follow-up (i.e., post-injury or control) evaluation. Post-injury testing occurred within 24\u2009h of injury (mean [M]\u2009=\u200920.33\u2009h; range, 14\u201324\u2009h) and at 8 days post-injury (M\u2009=\u20098.39 days; range, 7\u201311 days). Follow-up assessments for controls were performed as soon as possible after identification and 7 days after the first follow-up (M\u2009=\u20097.21; range, 6\u201310 days). Baseline clinical assessments were individually proctored by paid research assistants and included a demographics and health history interview, WTAR, Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 3 (SCAT3) symptom checklist,\n2\nStandardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC),\n41\nBalance Error Scoring System (BESS),\n42\nthe Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM)\n43\n,\n44\nand Immediate Post-Concussion and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) computerized neurocognitive test (CNT) batteries,\n45\nand other self-report and computerized measures. The version of ANAM used in this study was comprised of eight subtests: Simple Reaction Time (SRT), Code Substitution-Learning (CDS), Procedural Reaction Time (PRO), Mathematical Processing (MTH), Matching to Sample (M2S), Code Substitution-Delayed (CDD), Simple Reaction Time 2 (SR2), and Go/No-Go (GNG). The test produces nine indices\u2014one per test and a composite score. ImPACT produces four neurocognitive composite scores: Verbal Memory (VERM), Visual Memory (VISM), Visual Motor Speed (VMS), and Reaction Time (RT). Follow-up assessments were similar to baseline assessments but obtained injury/recovery (rather than health history) information and did not repeat the WTAR.\n\nMRI acquisition\nParticipants were scanned on a GE Discovery MR750 whole\u2013body 3-Tesla MRI scanner with a receive-only 32-channel coil array head coil () at the Center for Imaging Research, Medical College of Wisconsin. CBF measurements were performed using the 3D pCASL sequence with Fast Spin Echo spiral multi-slice readout using the following parameters: repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u20094632\u2009msec; echo time (TE)\u2009=\u200910.54\u2009msec; field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u2009240\u2009mm; matrix\u2009=\u2009128\u2009\u00d7\u2009128; spiral readout of eight arms and 512 samples; number of excitations\u2009=\u20093; post label delay\u2009=\u20091.52\u2009sec; label duration\u2009=\u20091.45\u2009sec; in-plane resolution\u2009=\u20091.875\u2009\u00d7\u20091.875\u2009mm; slice thickness\u2009=\u20094\u2009mm, total 36 slices; and sampling bandwidth\u2009=\u200962.5\u2009Hz. To minimize blurring, the spiral acquisition was short (4\u2009msec), and the required resolution was achieved with eight spiral interleaves. Three pairs of tagged\u2013untagged images were collected. Background suppression pulse was applied to maximize the sensitivity to blood perfusion,\n46\nscan time\u2009=\u20094:29\u2009min. In addition, T1-weighted 3D fast spoiled gradient echo (FSPGR) sequence with sensitivity encoding was acquired for anatomical reference with the following parameters: FOV\u2009=\u2009256\u2009mm; 180 axial slices; slice thickness\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm; voxel size 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm\n3\n; image matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256; TR/TE\u2009=\u20098.124/3.164\u2009msec; acceleration factor R\u2009=\u20092 in the phase encoding direction; flip angle\u2009=\u200912\u00b0; sampling bandwidth\u2009=\u200931.25\u2009kHz; scan time\u2009=\u20093:41\u2009min.\n\nImaging processing\nIndividual T1 FSPGR and ASL image quality was checked for potential distortion and artifact. Three-dimensional pCASL data analysis was conducted with MATLAB software programs developed as described previously.\n47\nImages were corrected for motion, pair-wise subtracted between label and control images followed by averaging to generate the mean difference image. CBF quantification (in mL/100\u2009g/min) was performed for the 3D pCASL based on a single compartment model using the equation:\nwhere \u03bb is the brain-to-blood partition coefficient (0.9\u2009mL/g), PLD is the post label delay, T\n1blood\nis the T1 of arterial blood at 3T (1.6\u2009sec),\n48\n\u03b1 is the labeling efficiency (0.85),\n49\nTL is the labeling duration (1.5\u2009sec), \u0394S is the ASL difference signal, and S\n0\nis the proton-density signal intensity. The term (1-exp[-2.0sec/1.5sec]) in the numerator reflects the presence of a saturation pulse that is applied in the proton-density images and allows conversion between measured MR signal (S\n0\n) and the unperturbed longitudinal gray matter magnetization. The quantified CBF maps were co-registered with anatomical FSPGR, which was segmented into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartments using SPM8 (\nwww.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm\n). Co-registered MRI maps were further normalized using the canonical Montr\u00e9al Neurological Institute (MNI) template, resampled to 2\u2009mm\n3\nvoxels, and smoothed with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) kernel of 6\u2009mm.\n\nStatistical analysis\nFor voxel-wise group comparison on individual CBF maps, the Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI;\nwww.afni.nimh.nih.gov\n) mixed-effects multilevel analysis tool was applied to perform a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures that incorporates both the variability across subjects and the precision estimate of each effect of interest from individual subject analyses.\n50\nSince age has an established effect on CBF,\n35\n,\n51\nwe included age as covariate to control for potential confounds, although no group difference was found in our sample. Since there was a trend for the concussed group to report more prior concussions, compared with the control group (\np\n=\u20090.06;\nTable 1\n), we conducted group analyses twice, with and without number of prior concussions as an additional covariate. For all the CBF analyses described above, the height threshold was set at\np\n<\u20090.05 and the spatial extent threshold was set at cluster volume >1072\u2009\u03bcL, which corresponds to\np\n<\u20090.05 corrected for family-wise error of multiple comparisons according to Monte Carlo simulations (10,000 iterations) implemented in AFNI's 3dClustSim.\n52\n,\n53\nIn additional analyses, results also were evaluated using a more conservative threshold of corrected\np\n<\u20090.01, as determined using 3dCluStim by setting the height threshold at p\u2009<\u20090.01 with the minimal cluster size of 448\u2009\u03bcL.\nStatistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, version 21.0; ) was used to assess differences in demographic and clinical measures between groups. For continuous variables, ANOVAs were employed with correction for multiple comparisons, while \u03c7\n2\ntests were used to examine group differences in categorical variables."

    "Methods": "Experimental animals\nAdult male Sprague-Dawley rats (280\u2013300\u2009g) were obtained from Harlan (Harlan Laboratories Inc, Indianapolis, IN) and were housed in a controlled environment with access to food and water. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the American Physiological Society Animal Care Guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\nAnimals were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (90\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg) via intramuscular injection for all surgical procedures. A total of 32 male rats were randomly assigned to one of three groups: laminectomy (\nn\n=\u200912), unilateral C3 contusion (\nn\n=\u200910), and unilateral C5 contusion (\nn\n=\u200910). An additional three animals were included as an intact nonsurgical sham group for assessment of diaphragm muscle denervation as described below.\n\nDiaphragm EMG recordings\nBased on a previously described technique,\n22\u201333\ntwo pairs of electrodes were implanted into each side of the diaphragm muscle 3\u20134 days before the contusion or laminectomy surgery. Electrodes were made of insulated stainless steel fine wire (AS631, Cooner Wire Inc., Chatsworth, CA) with \u223c3\u2009mm of insulation stripped off for contact with the muscle. Each electrode pair was fixed into the midcostal diaphragm muscle with an interelectrode distance of \u223c3\u2009mm and connected to an implanted telemeter (TR50BB, Millar Inc., Houston, TX), which was secured to the inner face of the anterior abdominal wall using a soft surgical mesh. Telemeters were sterilized using a glutaraldehyde-based solution as recommended by the manufacturer.\nRhythmic diaphragm EMG activity was recorded daily by telemetry in awake, unrestrained animals. Animals were left inside their cages and acclimatized for \u223c10\u2009min before a 10-min recording. The EMG signal was amplified and band-pass filtered using LabChart 5 software (AD Instruments). To assess and quantify the amplitude of diaphragm EMG activity, root-mean-square (RMS) EMG signal was calculated.\nDiaphragm EMG activity was independently measured for eupneic breathing and all spontaneous deep breaths (\u201csighs\u201d) during the 10\u2009min recording period. For both eupnea and sigh, diaphragm RMS EMG amplitude at 0, 1, 3, 7, and 14 days post-injury (DPI) was normalized to the sigh value at 0 DPI for the same diaphragm side and animal.\n\nUnilateral midcervical spinal contusion\nAnesthetized animals were placed on a heating pad (model 1060, K&H Manufacturing, Colorado Springs, CO). Using sterile technique and surgical antisepsis, an incision was made in the dorsal skin of the neck. Dorsal paravertebral muscles between C2 and T1 were incised and retracted and the posterior portion of cervical vertebrae was exposed. A right-sided laminectomy was performed either at C3 or C5 while preserving the facet joints. At either segment, the vertebral column was clamped one level above and one level below the desired contusion segment using an Infinite Horizons Impactor (Precision System and Instrumentation, LLC, Lexington, KY). Rats underwent a single contusion injury just lateral to midline with the 1.3\u2009mm diameter impactor tip and a force of 100\u2009kDynes. Laminectomy animals underwent a laminectomy at either C3 (\nn\n=\u20097) or C5 (\nn\n=\u20093), but no contusion was performed. In all cases, the dura mater was kept intact.\nMuscle and skin layers were sutured using 3-0 polyglactin. Animals were allowed to recover from anesthesia and surgery before transfer to an individual cage. Animals were monitored on a daily basis, and measures were taken to avoid dehydration and to minimize pain.\n\nHistological assessment of contusion injury and phrenic motoneuron number\nRetrograde labeling of phrenic motoneurons was achieved by injecting cholera toxin subunit B (CTB; Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) bilaterally into the pleural space through a transthoracic approach, as described previously.\n9\n,\n29\n,\n30\n,\n33\nEach animal was injected twice with 10\u2009\u03bcL on each side of the thorax 3 days before the terminal surgery. In two animals, intrapleural CTB injections were performed 3 days before contusion injury, and there was no apparent difference in the efficacy of retrograde labeling, consistent with previous results in the C2 hemisection model of cervical SCI.\n9\n,\n29\n,\n30\n,\n33\nAt the terminal experiment (14 DPI), animals were anesthetized, euthanized by exsanguination, and the diaphragm muscle was resected\nen bloc\nand placed in 0.9% NaCl solution. After this, animals were administered heparin and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The spinal cord was resected from C2 to C7, post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24\u2009h, and placed in 25% sucrose in 0.1\u2009M PBS (pH 7.4) at 4\u00b0C for 3 days. Transverse sections of the spinal cord were cut (70\u2009\u03bcm thick) and stored in 0.1\u2009M PBS until use.\nSpinal cord sections were systematically and randomly immunostained (every fourth section). Goat immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-CTB (List Biological Laboratories Inc., Campbell, CA) and Cy3-conjugated donkey antigoat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., Baltimore, PA) were used as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. The specificity of these antibodies has been validated previously.\n34\nAll stained spinal cord sections were visually inspected using a Nikon C1 confocal microscope equipped with a 561\u2009nm solid state laser and appropriate filter combinations (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY). Sections showing histologic evidence of contusion lesion were imaged using a Nikon 20x oil-immersion lens (NA 0.75), and the entire spinal cord section was stitched using NIS-Elements software (Nikon Instruments). The area of contusion injury was determined manually for each section, and the overall volume of contusion comprising a cystic cavity was calculated from the sum of all injury volumes with truncated cone interpolation between consecutive sections.\nIn the present study, the segmental location of the injury site was verified using a rat spinal cord atlas.\n35\nConfocal images were obtained from all selected spinal cord sections using a 40x oil-immersion lens (NA 1.3) with a step size of 0.8\u2009\u03bcm. Retrogradely labeled phrenic motoneurons were individually identified from the image stack and counted manually. The total number of motoneurons for an animal was determined from all randomly sampled sections.\nTo examine the distribution of motoneurons along a rostrocaudal axis, motoneuron counts were binned in 10 equally distributed segments (beginning at C3 and ending at C6). In addition, phrenic motoneuron counts on the contralateral side of the spinal cord were used to normalize the total number of phrenic motoneurons per side for each animal, as done in previous studies.\n9\n\nAssessment of diaphragm muscle denervation\nAt the terminal experiment, the diaphragm muscle was placed on a silicon rubber (Sylgard; DowCorning, Midland, MI)-coated Petri dish and stretched to \u223c1.4\u00d7 resting length. Motor end plates were labeled by incubation in Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated \u03b1-bungarotoxin (0.1\u2009\u03bcg/mL; Invitrogen Corp.). Subsequently, diaphragm muscle samples were washed with 0.1M phosphate buffer, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and stained for pre-synaptic structures using an antisynaptophysin antibody (1\u2009mg/mL; SC-9116, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and a Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (donkey anti-rabbit IgG, Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories). The specificity of these toxins and antibodies has been validated previously.\n34\n,\n36\u201338\nConfocal microscopy was used for morphological analyses of neuromuscular junction (NMJ) denervation as in previous studies.\n36\u201340\nPixel dimensions (0.5\u2009\u03bcm \u00d70.5\u2009\u03bcm) were set to be above the optical resolution for a Nikon 40x water immersion lens (NA 0.8), avoiding oversampling. The Z-axis resolution was empirically determined from image stacks reconstructed in XZ, as reported previously.\n41\nStep size was set to match the Z-axis resolution (0.8\u2009\u03bcm), and sequential images were obtained stepping in only one direction to avoid hysteresis in the stepper motor.\nIndividual NMJs were segregated based on their anatomical location into three zones corresponding to the ventral, middle, and dorsal portions of the diaphragm muscle (zones 1\u20133, respectively), based on the expected segmental innervation by the phrenic motoneuron pool.\n42\nConfocal image stacks were obtained from superficial (within 50\u2009\u03bcm of the surface) and\nen face\nNMJs to minimize fluorescence dispersion and to reduce the impact of anisotropic voxel dimensions on image reconstruction. Superficially located NMJs are not morphologically different from other NMJs located at great depths in the costal region of the rat diaphragm.\n36\n,\n37\n,\n39\n,\n43\u201348\nAs in previous studies,\n38\n,\n40\nthe volume of pre- and post-synaptic structures and the volume of apposition (as a percent of the post-synaptic volume) was obtained using a custom-designed algorithm in MetaMorph (Molecular Devices, LLC, Sunnyvale, CA).\n\nWhole body plethysmography (WBP)\nBarometric plethysmography (Buxco Inc, Wilmington, NC) was used to quantify ventilation in nonanesthetized animals before surgery and at 3, 7, and 14 DPI. The plethysmograph consisted of a Plexiglas chamber in which pressure was constantly monitored. The chamber's pressure, temperature, and humidity were calibrated before each experiment with pressurized gas mixtures flowing through the chambers at 10\u2009L/min, thereby allowing control of inspired gas composition and preventing CO\n2\nbuildup.\nRats were acclimatized for 20\u2009min before recording a 10\u2009min period of eupneic breathing. Rats were then exposed to hypoxic (10% inspired O\n2\n) and hypercapnic (5% inspired CO\n2\n) conditions for 5\u2009min while continuously monitoring CO\n2\nconcentration inside the chamber using a MicroCapStar capnograph (CWE Inc., Ardmore, PA). Plethysmography data for eupnea and hypoxia-hypercapnia were analyzed for 2\u2009min periods after removing movement-related intervals, as in previous studies.\n38\nVentilatory parameters analyzed were minute ventilation, tidal volume (V\nT\n), and respiratory frequency.\n\nBehavioral analysis\nAnimals were weighed on a daily basis up to 14 DPI. Open field Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotion scale\n49\nwas used to assess impairment in hindlimb locomotion. The animals were placed in a transparent and empty cage for 5\u2009min and allowed to freely move around; a score from 1 to 21 was given daily based on the characteristics of the locomotion.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical evaluations were performed using JMP statistical software V 10.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). For measurements performed repeatedly on the same population (e.g., weight, WBP parameters, diaphragm EMG, and locomotion scales), comparisons were conducted using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with time, experimental group, and, when appropriate, motor behavior (e.g., eupnea vs. hypoxia-hypercapnia) as grouping variables. Single outcome measures per animal (e.g., motoneuron counts, contusion force, and volume) were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA.\nAll experimental data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD), unless otherwise specified. Morphological data from individual NMJs were analyzed using a mixed linear model with animal as a random effect, experimental group and diaphragm zone as grouping variables. Least-squares means (\u00b1 standard error [SE]) are reported for morphological measurements, unless otherwise indicated. When appropriate,\npost hoc\nanalyses were conducted using Tukey-Kramer honestly significant difference (HSD). A\np\nvalue <\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Patients, randomization, and blinding\nThe B-HYPO study was conducted as a prospective, multi-center RCT between December 2002 and September 2008. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of each participating hospital, and the trial was registered at the University Hospital Medical Information Network site (UMIN-CTR, No. C000000231) in Japan and at the National Institutes of Health site (Clinical Trials. Gov, Identifier NCT00134472) in the United States.\n5\nBriefly, inclusion criteria were age 15\u201369 years for both sexes and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 4\u20138. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient's legally authorized representative prior to inclusion. If informed consent could not be obtained within 2\u2009h of admission, the consent policy was waived. One hundred fifty patients were randomly assigned (2:1 allocation ratio) to either the MTH group (32\u00b0C\u201334\u00b0C) or the fever control group (35.5\u00b0C\u201337\u00b0C) and intention-to-treat analyses were performed.\n9\nAfter enrollment, informed consent could not be obtained for 2 patients, 7 patients had unstable vital signs before temperature management, and neurological outcomes could not be assessed at 6 months in 6 patients. Therefore, per-protocol analyses were performed in 135 patients (88 treated with MTH and 47 with fever control).\nIn the present post hoc study, we re-evaluated our data based on the severity of brain trauma itself, which was classified as either AIS brain 3\u20134 or AIS 5.\nConsequently, 135 patients were enrolled, whereas 6 patients were excluded because AIS was not recorded. Forty-seven patients with AIS 3\u20134 were allocated to the MTH group and 31 patients to the fever control group, respectively. Thirty-six patients with AIS 5 were allocated to the MTH group and 15 patients to the fever control group, respectively. The Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) evaluated by physicians, who had been blinded to the treatment allocation, and mortality had been compared at 6 months between the two groups.\n\nTreatment\nCore body temperature was measured by a thermistor coupled to an internal jugular venous catheter. If the catheter could not be inserted at the jugular vein, temperature was measured at another site selected in the following order: pulmonary artery, bladder, rectum, and tympanic membrane. All patients were treated based on the guidelines for management of severe TBI of the Japan Society of Neurotraumatology.\n16\nTreatment was performed as described in our original article.\n9\nBriefly, cooling was initiated within 2\u2009h after onset of TBI. Cooling blankets, rapid cold fluid infusion (up to 1000\u2009mL saline, human plasma products, or dextrose-free plasma expanders), and/or cold gastric lavage were used during the induction phase in both groups. The goal in each group was to achieve the targeted temperature within 6\u2009h after onset of TBI and maintain this temperature for at least 72\u2009h, mainly using surface cooling blankets. After 72\u2009h temperature was kept <38\u00b0C for 7 days after the onset of the TBI.\n\nData collection and study outcomes\nAll data, except for CT data, were transmitted to the UMIN-CTR via an Internet-based system. CT on admission was classified based on the Traumatic Coma Data Bank (TCDB) classification.\n17\nHemodynamic data were recorded on days 0, 1, and 3 and 1 day after rewarming (defined as the day on which the core body temperature reached 36\u00b0C). The rates of mortality and favorable neurological outcome in the AIS 3\u20134 and AIS 5 patients were compared between the MTH and fever control groups at 6 months, and complications during and after the treatments were also evaluated. Good recovery and moderate disability in the GOS at 6 months after injury were designated as favorable outcomes.\n\nStatistical analyses\nHemodynamic parameters, ICP, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), favorable outcome rate, and mortality were compared between the two groups. Continuous variables were analysed by Mann\u2013Whitney U test, as appropriate, and categorical variables by \u03c7\n2\ntest. The results are presented as medians (interquartile ranges, IQR). A\np\nvalue of \u22640.05 was deemed significant."

    "Methods": "Participants\nCases initially reviewed for this study included 3294 individuals 18 years of age and older with data obtained on admission to programs contributing data to the\nOutcomeInfo\ndatabase between 2008 and 2014. Although Rasch analysis is tolerant of missing item data, we elected to exclude cases in which more than one item from an MPAI-4 index (i.e., subscale) was missing because we intended to calibrate each index and the number of items in each index is relatively small. Prior to initial item calibration using Rasch analysis, 15 cases (0.5%) with missing MPAI-4 item data at admission were eliminated from the sample; 4 cases with two missing items (not on the same index) and 64 cases with 1 missing item remained in the sample. All other cases had complete MPAI-4 item data. Following this initial calibration, an additional 32 cases (1%) were eliminated in which the MPAI-4 showed significant person misfit (Person Infit or Outfit \u22653), resulting in a sample of 3247 MPAI-4 admission protocols used in final item calibration. Prior to statistical analyses, 13 cases (0.4%) with more than one missing item per subscale for discharge/second assessments were eliminated; 3 cases with 2 missing items (not on the same index) and 54 with 1 missing item at discharge remained in the sample. In addition, 147 cases (4%) with <6 days or >365 days between the admission and discharge/second assessments were eliminated.\nThe final sample used in statistical analyses consisted of 3087 individuals (65% male) with a mean age of 46.56 years (SD\u2009=\u200914.415 years) who were an average of 586.78 days (SD\u2009=\u20091788.594 days) post-injury at the time of program admission. These individuals were injured at an average age of 44.19 years (SD\u2009=\u200915.573 years). All cases submitted to the database were identified by contributing providers as having a history of acquired brain injury (e.g., open or closed TBI, stroke, infection, tumor, anoxia). However, detailed diagnostic information was not available on most cases.\n\nOutcomeInfo database\nOutcomeInfo is a web-based database system, developed through National Institutes of Health (NIH) Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) funding, for monitoring progress and outcomes in post-inpatient programs primarily with the MPAI-4. In addition, this database has the capacity to store demographic and injury-related information about participants as well as additional measures specific to each provider. Provider organizations that contribute data to this database do so on a volunteer basis and pay a subscription fee for data management and reporting back to their organizations. Data are managed at a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) approved level of security. Although each contributing organization has complete access to its own data, analyses, such as this one, that combine data across organizations are conducted with anonymity of both cases and organizations.\nData used in the analyses reported here were provided by 9 organizations that operate 23 facilities in 13 states, including Alaska, in the Northeast, South, Midwest, and West. Because of the size and geographic and provider representation, the sample is believed to be highly representative of individuals who are admitted for post-hospital rehabilitation or supported living services after ABI. This population likely differs from the larger population of individuals admitted for acute care after brain injury. For example, Corrigan and colleagues\n14\nreported that the sample admitted for inpatient brain injury rehabilitation and enrolled in the Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems (TBIMS) database were younger than individuals admitted to a more general U.S. TBI inpatient rehabilitation sample or for acute hospital care after TBI. As displayed in\nTable 1\n, the OutcomeInfo sample tended to have fewer individuals >70 years of age than the general TBI rehabilitation sample and fewer individuals <30 years of age than the TBIMS sample with a larger proportion of those in the 50 to 69 age group than either of the other samples. Gender distribution for the OutcomeInfo sample was similar to that for the general TBI rehabilitation group, which included fewer males than the TBIMS sample.\nTable\n1.\nAge and Gender Comparisons across TBI Rehabilitation Samples\nAge (years)\nOutcomeInfo\nUS TBI inpatient rehabilitation without TBIMS\na\nTBIMS\na\n70+\n4%\n39%\n10%\n50\u201369\n44%\n21%\n19%\n30\u201349\n35%\n20%\n22%\n<29\n17%\n20%\n39%\nGender (% male)\n65%\n65%\n74%\nOpen in a separate window\na\nFrom Corrigan et al.\n14\nTBI, traumatic brain injury; TBIMS, Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems.\nAs part of the development of the database, four major program types were defined through systematic expert inquiry: (1) intensive residential rehabilitation: a goal-directed, therapy-intensive program for individuals with behavioral problems requiring an intensively structured environment with 24-h-a-day onsite supervision and a low staff-to-client ratio; (2) intensive outpatient and community-based rehabilitation: a goal-directed, therapy-focused program for individuals who live in private residences and receive daily to weekly rehabilitation therapies; (3) long-term residential supported living: designed to preserve an optimal level of health and assist participants in their ability to care for themselves, participate in a stable activity plan, and preserve medical, physical, neurocognitive, mood, and behavioral stability in an assisted, supervised residential setting; and (4) long-term community-based supported living: designed to provide ongoing support and structure to individuals who live in private residences to preserve their ability to care for themselves, participate in a stable activity plan, and preserve medical, physical, neurocognitive, mood, and behavioral stability. The most striking difference among these programs is between the intensive rehabilitation programs, which offer patient-centered therapies with a goal of improved functioning, and the supported living programs, which provide structure and support but do not offer therapy designed to improve function. However, the outpatient/community-based intensive rehabilitation programs, which provide therapy and reinforce gains for a limited number of hours per day or per week also differ substantially from the residential intensive rehabilitation programs, which essentially prompt and reinforce therapeutic gains around the clock. Features of each program type are described in more detail in a previous publication.\n12\nBeyond these broad program types, we did not examine for site differences because our agreement with the provider consortium that contributes data precludes this as well as any other reporting that may compromise patient or program anonymity.\n\nMPAI-4\nThe MPAI-4\n15\nconsists of 30 items selected to assess commonly occurring limitations after ABI. It is divided into three subscales: Ability Index, Adjustment Index, and Participation Index. Lower scores indicate lesser impairment and limitations. Prior studies have demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency and construct validity,\n16\u201318\nas well as concurrent\n19\nand predictive validity\n20\u201322\nfor the full measure and its indices. The MPAI-4 has been found to be responsive in the effects of rehabilitation interventions.\n10\u201312\n,\n20\n,\n23\nThe MPAI-4 and a manual for its use are freely available on the Center for Outcome Measurement in Brain Injury (COMBI) website (\nwww.tbims.org/combi/mpai\n).\n\nData calibration: Rasch analysis\nThe sample used in this study was significantly larger and arguably more representative of individuals receiving PBIR in the United States than prior samples on which we have based reference values, that is, T-scores.\n15\nFor this reason, we calibrated the admission MPAI-4 item data using Rasch analysis to develop logit scores that meet parametric assumptions for data analysis with the sample of 3279 persons. For this calibration, items 7A (Verbal Communication) and 7B (Nonverbal Communication) were analyzed as separate items rather than combined as in their original presentation. The initial calibration revealed item misfit for a few items, which was remedied by rescoring Audition, Pain, Transportation, and Employment items as suggested by previous Rasch calibrations. As mentioned previously, following this initial calibration, we also eliminated 32 protocols in which Person Infit or Outfit \u22653 suggested an aberrant response pattern. The final calibration on 3247 cases showed good Person Reliability/Separation (0.89/2.86) and Item Reliability/Separation (1.00/38.16) for the entire scale. Item Infit was acceptable (0.81\u20131.34) for all items, as was item Outfit (0.80\u20131.42). Rasch metrics were also acceptable in analyses of each of the three subscale indices, although because of the reduced item number, not as strong as for the entire scale. For the Ability Index, Person Reliability/Separation\u2009=\u20090.81/2.08; Item Reliability/Separation\u2009=\u20091.00/37.48. For the Adjustment Index, Person Reliability/Separation\u2009=\u20090.81/2.05; Item Reliability/Separation\u2009=\u20091.00/34.69. For the Participation Index, Person Reliability/Separation\u2009=\u20090.77/1.81; Item Reliability/Separation\u2009=\u20091.00/29.69. These metrics were comparable to previous calibrations of the measure.\n\nStatistical analysis\nBecause of the small numbers in long-term residential supported living (\nn\n=\u200974) and long-term community-based supported living programs (\nn\n=\u200927) these two programs types were combined for comparison with the more intensive program types. Cases in each program type included in these analyses were: intensive residential rehabilitation (\nn\n=\u2009205), intensive outpatient/community-based rehabilitation (\nn\n=\u20092781), and supported living (\nn\n=\u2009101). Time between injury and admission (chronicity) was highly skewed (skew\u2009=\u20095.567). Consequently, the log\n10\ntransformation of chronicity was computed to reduce the skew of this variable (skew of transformed variable\u2009=\u20090.981) and used in all analyses. All MPAI-4 scores were logit values derived from the Rasch analysis converted to T-scores. In some analyses, a small proportion of cases (<1%) were deleted due to missing data for covariates. Because of the small number of cases with missing data, we elected to exclude them rather than attempt imputation. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted to compare MPAI-4 Total and Index T-scores at discharge for the intensive residential and outpatient/community-based rehabilitation programs and at the second evaluation for those in supported living programs because individuals may be in supported living programs indefinitely. To control for status on program admission, admission MPAI-4 Total and Index T-scores were used as a covariates in these analyses. In the initial analyses, other covariates included gender, age at injury, age at admission, and log chronicity. However, gender was not significantly related to outcome and age at admission showed strong collinearity (r\u2009=\u20090.93) with age at injury; consequently, gender and age at admission were not included in general linear models reported in the next section."

    "Methods": "Clinical material and methods\nThis prospective study included all TBI patients who had an initial computed tomography scan and underwent surgical evacuation of their brain contusions at our institution between January 2006 and July 2013. Brain specimens were obtained from surgically resected areas of the contusions and stored in a biobank collection of TBI samples at our institution (registration no.: C0002524 at the Carlos III Institute). Mean contusion volume at the time of evacuation was determined using the ABC/2 method.\n27\nAs suggested by Iaccarino and colleagues, in patients with more than one lesion, the volume of each contusion was calculated and then added to get a total contusional volume.\n1\nUsing the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale, clinical outcome for each patient was assessed 6 months postinjury by an independent neuropsychologist (A.R.) blinded to the immunolabeling data.\nThe control group included tissue samples obtained from limited brain resections performed to access extra-axial skull base tumors or intraventricular lesions. These samples were included if the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans did not show any abnormalities in T1-weighted, T2-weighted, or fluid attenuated inversion recovery images. Our research was carried out in accord with the Declaration of Helsinki of the World Medical Association.\n28\nThis study and the tissue collection protocol were approved by the institutional ethics committee of Vall d'Hebron University Hospital (Barcelona, Spain; protocols PR-ATR-68/2007 and PR-ATR-286/2013), and written informed consent was obtained from all of the patients (including the controls) or the patient's next of kin.\n\nCriteria for surgical evacuation of brain contusions\nSurgical indications for evacuation of PTBCs are still controversial, and no evidence-based guidelines are available as yet. The only published guidelines regarding PTBCs, published by the Brain Trauma Foundation in 2006, include other focal or diffuse traumatic parenchymal lesions and thus are too general.\n29\nAt our institution, patients must fulfill at least one of the following criteria to be considered for surgical evacuation: 1) For patients with intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, the ICP exceeds 20\u2009mm Hg, and the total volume of a single contusion or multiple contusions exceeds the 25-mL threshold; 2) for patients without ICP monitoring (mostly moderate TBI), the total contusion volume (hemorrhagic and edematous components) is above the 25-mL threshold; 3) any temporal contusion that produces a significant mass effect and/or compresses the basal cisterns; and 4) contusions that induce a significant mid-line shift (greater than 5\u2009mm) despite having an ICP <20\u2009mm Hg. The surgical approach is usually excision of necrotic tissue without external bone decompression.\n\nBrain tissue collection\nAfter surgical resection, all specimens were transported to the laboratory on ice. Cauterized tissue and excess blood were eliminated by dissection in phosphate buffer. Specimens of a minimum size of 0.5\u00d70.5\u00d70.5\u2009mm were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 48\u2009h. Specimens were selected from areas of resected brain with preserved anatomical structure, corresponding to penumbral zones or the interface of penumbra/core using the terminology described by Kurland and colleagues.\n8\nTissues were cryoprotected using 30% sucrose and embedded in Tissue-Tek optimal cutting temperature compound (4583; Sakura Finetek Europe B.V, Alphen aan den Rin, The Netherlands). From these blocks, 10-\u03bcm sections were obtained using a cryostat (Leica CM3050\u2009S; Leica Biosystems, Heidelberg, Germany), mounted on glass slides, and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until further analysis.\n\nControls\nThe control group included an initial cohort of 8 patients. MRIs of controls were independently assessed by two of the authors (J.S. and J.M.S.) blinded to immunolabeling data. Tissue quality was evaluated in hematoxilin-eosin staining sections by a neuropathologist (E.M.S.) blinded to immunolabeling data using one scale for edema and another for signs of tissue hypoxia/ischemia (0: absent; 1: mild; 2: moderate; and 3: severe). Patients with edema and/or ischemia scores greater than 2 were excluded as controls. An important point to remark on is that because our controls were from patients surgically treated for extra-axial skull base tumors or intraventricular lesions, they should not be considered comparable to the controls used in animal models or those extracted from fresh human cadavers. We think it could be more appropriate to treat them equivalent to \u201csham\u201d animals in experimental models. In addition, the extraction process, even under meticulous microsurgery, adds some degree of unpredictable damage and minimal inflammatory reaction to brain tissue.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nBefore immunolabeling, a pretreatment to reduce autofluorescence was performed by immersing the cryosections for 7\u2009min in 0.1% sodium borohydride (NaBH\n4\n) in 0.1\u2009M of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\n30\n,\n31\nSections were incubated in a blocking solution containing 2% donkey serum (D9663; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 0.1% Triton-X (T8787; Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS 0.1\u2009M for 1\u2009h. Next, cryosections were incubated for 1\u2009h at room temperature and then for 48\u2009h at 4\u00b0C with the following primary antibodies: rabbit/goat anti-SUR1 (1:500; custom anti-SUR1 antibodies described by Woo and colleagues\n15\n), mouse anti-NeuN (1:200; MAB377; Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA), mouse anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:1000; CY3 conjugated; C-9205; Sigma-Aldrich), mouse anti-CD31 (1:100; M082329; Dako, Carpinteria, CA), mouse anti-CD68 (1:100; M081401; Dako), or rabbit anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO; 1:200; A039829; Dako). Fluorescent-labeled, species-appropriate secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR) were used for visualization. Omission of primary antibodies served as a negative control. Sections were cover-slipped with polar mounting medium containing antifade reagent and the nuclear dye, 4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI); (P36935; Invitrogen). Fluorescent signals were visualized using an epifluorescence microscope (FX100 Olympus or BX61 Olympus; Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), depending on analysis requirements.\n\nAnalysis of immunohistochemical findings\nQuantitative immunohistochemistry: neurons and endothelial cells\nTo quantify SUR1-positive neurons and vessels, depending on section size, between 4 and 9 fields were captured for each specimen by using FSX-BSW software with an epifluorescence microscope (FX100 Olympus). For neurons, 600\u00d7450\u2009\u03bcm\n2\nimages were randomly captured from the cortex area of the sample. For vessels, 1200\u00d7900\u2009\u03bcm\n2\nimages were randomly captured from the whole sample. All of the obtained images were exported to ImageJ 1.47v (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Neurons (NeuN-positive cells) and SUR1-positive neurons (NeuN- and SUR1-positive cells) in each image were counted using the Image Cell Counter plugin (Kurt De Vos;\nhttp://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/cell-counter.html\n), and the percentage of SUR1-positive neurons was calculated. For ECs, all of the CD31-positive structures and SUR1-positive vessels (CD31 and SUR1 positive structures) in each image were counted using the same plugin, and the percentage of SUR1-positive ECs was calculated. Percentages of SUR1-positive neurons and blood vessels in the different captured images for each specimen were calculated, and all of the analyzed fields were included in the final statistical analysis for each case.\nSemiquantitative immunohistochemistry\nSemiquantitative analyses were performed for GFAP, CD68, and MPO immunolabeling results. For these measurements, all of the sections were immunolabeled as a single batch for each cell-type\u2013specific marker and observed using an epifluorescence microscope. For this analysis, the presence or the amount of the different cell-type\u2013specific markers was quantified in the whole section by the same observer (T.M.V.) using the following scale: \u2013: absent; +: scanty; ++: moderate; and + ++: numerous. Specific SUR1 immunoreactivity also was evaluated using the similar scale: \u2013: none; +: in a few cells; ++: in many cells; and + ++: in all or almost all cells. Median interobserver agreement of theses scales for two independent observers was 0.83, with a minimum of 0.71 and a maximum of 0.88 depending on the cell analyzed.\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics were obtained for each variable. For continuous variables, the mean, median, range, and standard deviation were used for normally distributed data, and the median, minimum, and maximum values were used for non-Gaussian distributions. The Shapiro-Wilk's test and the inverse probability plot were used to test whether the data followed a normal distribution. Percentages and sample sizes were used to summarize categorical variables. To correlate two continuous variables, the Pearson's correlation test was used for data following a normal distribution, and the more conservative Spearman's rho was used if the data did not follow a normal distribution. For each marker, scatter plots were constructed with time as the abscissa and the percentage/score of positive immunolabeling as the ordinate. A simple linear regression and the ordinary least squares method were used. Adjusted\nR\n2\nvalues were calculated for all of the models to test whether linear or nonlinear models adequately explained the relationships between both variables. Statistical analyses were performed using R software (version 3.0.2)\n32\nand the integrated development environment R Studio (v0.98.945).\n33\nThe car package was used for regression analysis.\n34\nTo calculate interobserver agreement between two independent observers using the immunolabeling ordinal scales, we used weighted kappa with the routine implemented in MedCalc (version 12.2; MedCalc Software, Mariakerke, Belgium). Statistical significance was considered when\np\n\u22640.05. Data are presented graphically using box-and-whisker plots."

Hormone assays were completed within a week of admission to the rehabilitation facility. GST and serum IGF-1 levels were assessed on all patients who qualified for inclusion.\nThe GST was performed after an initial baseline blood draw. Glucagon, 1\u2009mg, was administered intramuscularly, and blood draws occurred at 0 (baseline), 90, 120, 150, and 180\u2009min for GH. Blood was centrifuged, and serum was frozen with dry ice until analysis by an independent laboratory (Esoterix, Inc., Calabasas Hills, CA).\n\nFunctional outcomes\nAll patients were assessed on a variety of functional outcome measures within 2 weeks of the hormone assays. These functional outcomes included the DRS,\n32\nIndependent Living Scale\n33\n(ILS), Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory-4\n34\n(MPAI-4), Community Integration Questionnaire\n35\n(CIQ), Occupational Status Scale\n36\n(OSS), and the Living Status Scale\n36\n(LSS). These outcome scales are indicative of disability (DRS); competence and assistance needed for activities of daily living, initiation, and behavior (ILS); ability, adjustment, and participation (MPAI-4); community integration (CIQ); occupational or avocational status (OSS); and level of supervision (LSS) in the post-acute phase of brain injury.

The protocol was approved by the University of Kansas Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nSpinal cord injury\nAt the time of the spinal cord surgery, ages of the rats ranged from 100\u2013110 days. Surgeries were performed under ketamine hydrochloride (80\u2009mg/kg)/xylazine (7\u2009mg/kg) anesthesia and aseptic conditions. Each of the SCI rats underwent a T9\u2013T10 laminectomy and contusion injury using an Infinite Horizon spinal cord impactor (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, LLC, Fairfax Station, VA) with a 200 Kdyn impact (\nFig.1\n). Displacement distance reported by the impactor software for each contusion was recorded. At the conclusion of surgery, 0.25% bupivacaine hydrochloride was applied locally to the incision site. Buprenex\u2122 (0.01mg/kg, SC) was injected immediately after surgery and 1 day later. All animals were monitored daily until the end of the experiment. On the first week after surgery, the rats received daily injections of 30,000\u2009U penicillin (Combi-Pen 48\u2122, SC) in 5\u2009mL saline to prevent infections and dehydration. The rats' bladders were expressed twice daily until the animals recovered urinary reflexes. From the second week onward, the animals were supplemented with vitamin C pellets (BioServ, Frenchtown, NJ) to avert urinary tract infection.\n\nPost-SCI behavioral assessment\nBBB scoring was performed on 11 rats 4 weeks after SCI as described by other invesigators.\n24\n,\n25\nThis time-point, and the time of the neurophysiological procedures, was chosen because scores typically plateau by4 weeks and behavior is relatively stable.\n23\n,\n26\nA straight alley with a darkened goal box was utilized for the testing. For 1 week prior to BBB scoring, rats were habituated to the apparatus. Left- and right-side scores were averaged and rounded to the nearest integer.\n\nNeurophysiological procedures\nCortical exposure\nSurgical and neurophysiological procedures were conducted under aseptic conditions at various time-points up to 18 weeks post-SCI. At the time of these procedures, ages ranged from 4.5 to 7.5 months and body weights ranged from 250\u2009g to 476\u2009g (mean\u2009=\u2009368\u2009\u00b1\u200957\u2009g standard deviation [SD]). After an initial, stable anesthetic state was reached using isoflurane anesthesia, isoflurane was withdrawn and the first dose of ketamine hydrochloride (100\u2009mg/kg)/xylazine (5\u2009mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneal (IP). The rats were placed in a Kopf small-animal stereotaxic instrument (David Kopf Instruments\n\u00ae\n, Tujunga, CA) and the incisor bar was adjusted until the heights of lambda and bregma skull points were equal (flat skull position). The cisterna magna was punctured at the base of the skull to reduce edema during mapping. A craniectomy was performed over the motor cortex. The general location of the craniectomy was based on previous motor mapping studies in the rat (\nFig. 2A\n).\n27\n,\n28\nThis stereotaxic location matches that reported by others for the somatomotor hindlimb area.\n13\n,\n29\nThe dura over the cranial opening was incised and the opening was filled with warm, medical grade, sterile silicone oil (50% Medical Silicone Fluid 12,500, 50% MDM Silicone Fluid 1000, Applied Silicone Corp., Santa Paula, CA).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nICMS methods.\n(A)\nSchematic diagram of a dorsolateral view of the rat brain showing the location of the hindlimb motor area (HLA) relative to the forelimb motor area (FLA) and face representations in primary motor cortex (M1).

Core temperature was maintained within normal physiological limits using a feedback-controlled heating pad during the entire procedure. Care was taken to maintain a stable anesthetic state. The anesthetic level was assessed by monitoring the respiratory and heart rate, and reflexes to noxious stimuli. The pinch withdrawal reflex and corneal reflex was conducted every 15\u201330\u2009min. Additionally, a sudden increase in respiratory rate or an increase in heart rate (>285 beats/min) indicated the need to test for pinch and corneal reflexes. The presence of the withdrawal reflex to a pinch of the forelimb or hindlimb or the presence of a blink response to corneal stimulation indicated the need for an additional dose of ketamine. ICMS mapping procedures were conducted only during periods of stable anesthesia and were halted during occasional periods of shallow (excessive muscle tone in the limbs and rapid heart rate) or deeper anesthesia (marked by unusually high ICMS thresholds). A single bolus of ketamine hydrochloride (10\u2009mg intramuscularly) was administered when an increased heart and respiration rate, and positive reflexes to noxious stimuli warranted a need for a deeper anesthetic state. Each injection was counted as an additional anesthetic dose.\nA magnified digital photograph of the cortical surface was obtained through a surgical microscope and displayed on a computer monitor. A 250\u2009\u03bcm grid pattern was placed over the image to indicate intended locations for microelectrode penetrations. The precise location of the microelectrode placement in the cortex was based on stereotaxic coordinates relative to bregma, derived in normal rats in a previous study to define the location of the hindlimb area in this strain (\nFig. 2A\n).\n28\nThe center of the hindlimb region in this rat strain is located at 2\u2009mm posterior and 2.64\u2009mm lateral to bregma.\n28\nICMS was conducted at this and surrounding locations in each rat. The stimulating microelectrode consisted of a platinum wire inserted into a pulled glass micropipette filled with 3.5\u2009M NaCl solution and sharply beveled to 15\u201320\u2009\u03bcm at the tip. Microelectrode impedance ranged from 750\u2009k\u03a9 to 1\u2009M\u03a9. Microelectrodes were advanced perpendicular to the cortical surface to a depth of \u223c1700\u2009\u03bcm (the approximate location of layer 5 in this species), using a hydraulic microdrive (David Kopf Instruments\n\u00ae\n, Tujunga, CA). The stimulus consisted of 13, 200\u2009\u03bcs cathodal pulses delivered at 350\u2009Hz repeated at 1/sec from an electrically isolated, charge-balanced (capacitively coupled) stimulation circuit. The electrode was introduced sequentially at interpenetration distances of 250\u2013500\u2009\u03bcm using the grid pattern sited with reference to the surface vasculature.\nMovement fields were defined by movements evoked by ICMS at near-threshold current levels (60\u2009\u03bcA maximum). Forelimb and hindlimb movements were evoked almost exclusively in the contralateral side of the body. The HLA was explored as completely as possible. Microelectrode penetrations (avoiding blood vessels) were made at intersections on the grid pattern until the HLA was circumscribed by sites evoking either forelimb movements, trunk movements, or no visible response. To limit the duration of the procedures, ICMS mapping in FLA was confined to the caudal portion.\nSpike recording\nIn each rat, neuronal recordings were begun at \u223c3\u2009h after initiation of the procedure to control for effects of anesthetic duration on subsequent spike recordings. Anesthetic levels were maintained using the same procedure described above. Neuronal action potentials (spikes) were recorded with a single-shank, 16-channel Michigan-style linear microelectrode probe (Neuronexus, Ann Arbor, MI;\nFig. 3\n). The same probe was used for each rat. Each of the 16 sites on the probe was15\u2009\u03bcm in diameter and 50\u2009\u03bcm apart, with an impedance of \u223c0.9\u2009M\u03a9. One site (site 7) was defective and was not used in the analysis of the results. To analyze mean spike rate per penetration as a function of cortical depth, five recording sites each were combined for superficial (SF), middle, and deep recordings, respectively. Sites 9, 8, 10, 13, and 4 were defined as superficial sites, sites 12, 5, 15, 2, and 16 were defined as middle sites, and sites 1, 14, 3, 11, and 6 were defined as deep sites (\nFig. 3B\n). The tip of the probe was lowered to a depth of \u223c1720\u2009\u03bcm below the cortical surface and recordings began after a 1\u2009min resting period. Activity was recorded at penetration locations in both HLA and FLA. The mean number of penetrations per rat used in the analysis of results was 9.5 (SD\u2009=\u20091.8); the mean number of penetrations was 6 (SD\u2009=\u20090.9) in the HLA and 4 (SD\u2009=\u20091.3) in the FLA.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nActivity recording.\n(A)\nCresyl stained coronal section at the level of the hindlimb motor representation showing the location and depth of the 16-channel Neuronexus recording probe in HLA (Box).

Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nBecause no hindlimb responses were evoked using ICMS in SCI rats, the location of HLA in SCI rats was determined by the stereotaxic coordinates derived in normal rats in a previous study (centered at 2\u2009mm posterior and 2.64\u2009mm lateral to bregma),\n28\nas well as the expected location based on the position of the ICMS-derived FLA. At each cortical location, electrical activity was collected and digitized for 5\u2009min from each of the 15 active sites using neurophysiological recording and analysis equipment (Tucker Davis Technologies, Alachua, FL). Neural spikes were discriminated using principle component analysis.\n32\nSample waveforms (1.3\u2009msec in duration) were collected that passed \u22125.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009SD below root mean square (RMS). After each experiment, the probe was cleaned with Opti-Free solution (Alcon Laboratories, Fort Worth, TX), followed by ethanol and then rinsed thoroughly in distilled water. The electrode impedance of each site remained at \u223c0.9\u2009M\u03a9 for each experiment. At the end of the recording session, rats were humanely euthanized with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (Beuthanasia\n\u00ae\n-D, Schering- Plough Animal Health Corp., NJ).\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe main\na priori\nhypothesis to be tested was that spike rates would be higher in M1 after SCI. Spike rates over the 5\u2009min sampling period for each of the 15 probe sites were averaged for each of the penetration locations. Then spike rates per penetration were calculated for each cortical area and used in the test of the main hypothesis using a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), with Group (normal vs. SCI) and Area (HLA, FLA) as the main factors (alpha\u2009=\u20090.05). Additional secondary analyses were performed to determine whether spike rates were affected by time after SCI, and whether there were laminar differences in spike rates."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committees at the University of Utah, in accordance with U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines and carried out at the University of Utah. All surgical procedures were performed using aseptic technique.\nBriefly, male Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Charles Rivers Laboratories (Raleigh, NC) on P7-P10. We studied only males to eliminate any potential confounding effects of sex. Rats were housed in litters of 10 with the lactating dam until weaning on P21-P23. After weaning, rats were housed three to five per cage and allowed free access to food and water. All cages were kept in a temperature- and light-controlled (12\u2009h on/12\u2009h off) environment.\nRats were divided into two groups: those who received 0.1% DHA rodent diet (DHA) and those who received standard rat chow (REG). The DHA rodent diet (Harlan-Teklad, WI) substitutes 0.1% of the soybean oil in standard chow with purified DHA (U-84-A, Nu-Chek Prep, MN). This substitution results in the same macronutrient content and caloric density (3 kcal/g) as standard rat chow. This 0.1% DHA diet provides DHA as 1.8% of total fat. All dams and pups were kept on REG diet (Harlan Teklad 8640), with the exception of rats in the DHA CCI group. Seventeen-day-old rat pups depend exclusively on dam milk for their intake. Gavage feeding rat pups with DHA soon after surgery carries a significant risk of pulmonary aspiration. Instead, we fed dams the DHA diet 1 d before CCI, guided by data that breast milk DHA peaked at 10\u2009h and lasted 24\u2009h after ingestion of a DHA supplement.\n37\nOnce rats were weaned (at P21) they consumed exclusively the DHA/REG chow for the duration of each experiment.\nThere were three experimental groups: rats who received DHA and CCI (DHACCI); rats who received REG and CCI (REGCCI); and rats who received REG and sham surgery (SHAM). To form the experimental groups, 400 total rats were split equally among the three groups. In order to minimize litter effects in the experimental groups, rats from different litters were culled by Charles River prior to shipment to our laboratory to generate litters of 10 male pups per dam. We further minimized litter effects by randomly selecting seven to eight rats from every 40 rats after CCI or sham surgery to form functional testing groups of 21-24 rats. Different animals were used for all experiments, with one exception: rats used for MWM were subsequently used for post-injury Day (PID) 50 tissue sparing analyses.\n\nCCI procedure\nCCI was carried out as previously described.\n31\nAt P17, rats undergoing CCI were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane for induction. Anesthesia was maintained with 2%-2.5% isoflurane for the duration of surgical preparation using a VetEquip Bench Top Isoflurane Anesthesia System (Pleasanton, CA). The rats' core temperature was monitored via a rectal probe and continuously controlled at 37\u00b10.5\u00b0C using a servo-controlled heating pad. Each rat was placed into a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf, Tujunga, CA). After shaving, prepping with povidone-iodine and incising the scalp, a craniotomy (6\u2009mm\u00d76\u2009mm) was performed over the left parietal cortex (centered at the point 4\u2009mm posterior and 4\u2009mm lateral to bregma). Care was taken to not perforate the dura. Once the craniotomy was complete, anesthesia was reduced to 1% isoflurane for a 5\u2009min equilibration period. CCI was then delivered (Pittsburgh Precision Instruments, Pittsburgh, PA) to the left parietal cortex using a 5\u2009mm rounded tip to deliver a 2.0\u2009mm deformation at 5\u2009m/sec velocity and 100 msec duration. Immediately after CCI, isoflurane was increased to 2%-2.5% and the bone flap was replaced and secured with dental cement (Patterson Dental, Salt Lake City, UT). The scalp incision was sutured and triple antibiotic ointment and bupivacaine 0.5% were applied topically. Isoflurane was stopped and rats were allowed to recover in a temperature-controlled chamber. Once fully awake, rats were returned to their dams and littermates. SHAM rats underwent the same surgical craniotomy, equilibration, and closure procedures without CCI.\n\nOutcomes\nOutcomes were measured at various time-points spanning between PID1 and PID50. We assessed motor outcomes using rotarod testing at PID12 and PID35. Cognitive outcome was measured using Novel Object Recognition (NOR) and Morris water maze (MWM) testing at PID14 and PID41 after CCI, respectively. DHA's effects on oxidative stress and inflammation were assessed at PID1 and PID2 using brain levels of nitrates/nitrites, and of the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, IL-2, IL-10, and chemokine (CC-motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), also known as monocyte chemotactic protein 1. Other outcomes included histology at PID3 and PID50 to assess tissue sparing, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at PID12 and PID28 to assess edema and white matter injury.\n38\u201341\n\nRotarod testing\nWe used the IITC Rotarod, Series 8 (IITC Life Science, CA), to test motor coordination and balance.\n42\nOne set of rats was tested at PID12 and a different set of rats at PID35. Each set was comprised of eight rats from each of the three groups. Each rat was placed on a cylinder that was initially rotating at a slow speed (4\u2009rpm). The rotational speed gradually increased over time (up to 5\u2009min) to a maximum speed of 45\u2009rpm. In order to stay on the cylinder, the rat had to continuously walk forward. Measures included time to fall off the cylinder, the rpm at time of fall, and total meters traveled. Each rat underwent four daily rotarod trials that were repeated for three consecutive days per set of rats.\n\nNOR\nWe used a black Plexiglas\n\u00ae\nNOR chamber (52\u00d752\u00d730\u2009cm) as described for juvenile rats (P29-P40)\n43\nto test rat pups at PID14. Seven rats from each of the three groups were tested. The box was housed in a small room with soft lighting. Objects used for testing were small, plastic, and easily cleaned, and were secured to the box using Velcro\n\u00ae\n. The box and objects were cleaned between rat pups with 70% alcohol to remove odor traces. There were three phases to the NOR: habituation, familiarization, and testing. During the habituation phase, each rat pup was allowed to individually explore the empty box for 15\u2009min per day over 2 d to ensure acclimation to the testing environment. During the 5\u2009min familiarization phase, a single rat was placed in the arena containing two objects. The rat was returned to the arena 24\u2009h later for testing. During the 5\u2009min testing phase, the rat was exposed to one object from the familiarization phase and to one novel object. During testing, the rat's interaction with an object was measured using automated video tracking and data analysis equipment from EthoVision\n\u00ae\nv 7.1 (Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, the Netherlands) and confirmed by dual observer analysis of the videotaped session when needed. The rat's exploration was timed as the duration that the rat's nose was within 2\u2009cm of the object as determined by a digitally drawn arena. Time spent rearing, if present, was not considered exploration. Performance on the testing phase was measured by the percent novel exploration time (100* [N/(N+F)]), where N is the time spent on the new object and F on the familiar.\n\nMWM testing\nSpatial memory and learning were assessed using the MWM. Fourteen injured (DHACCI,\nn\n=7; REGCCI,\nn\n=7) and six SHAM rats were tested starting at PID41. The pool was maintained at 26\u00b12\u00b0C and was located in a dimly lit room, surrounded by visual cues. Rats were placed in a pool of water that contains a submerged platform. The submerged platform was positioned in one of the four equal pool quadrants. The starting quadrant was varied over the four daily trials per day using the same pattern on a given day for all study groups. Serial testing (4 trials per day; maximum swim time, 120\u2009sec per trial; 14\u2009min rest between trials) was performed for 5 d with a submerged platform from PID41 to PID45. Raised platform testing was performed on PID46 and PID47 to assess ability to reach the visible platform. Latency to find the platform, swim speed, swim path, and thigmotaxis (time spent swimming close to the sides of the pool) were recorded for each trial. On PID48, a probe trial (no platform present) was performed in which the time spent in each quadrant over a 60 second trial was recorded. Each trial was recorded using automated video tracking and data analysis equipment from HVS Tracking System. Brains harvested from the 20 rats after completing MWM testing were used for tissue sparing analyses.\n\nMolecular studies\nFor molecular studies, eight rats from each of the three groups were used for each assay and time-point (total of 96 rats). Rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal xylazine (8\u2009mg/kg) and ketamine (40\u2009mg/kg) for tissue collection. For cytokine and nitrate/nitrite analyses, ipsilateral (left) hippocampi and cortices were dissected on ice, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\n\nCytokine levels and nitrate/nitrite concentration in tissues ipsilateral to impact\nTotal protein samples were extracted by homogenizing ipsilateral hippocampi and cortices separately in ice-cold lysis buffer (150\u2009mM NaCl, 50\u2009mM Tris pH 7.4, 1\u2009mM EDTA, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate; 1% Igepal CA-630) with protein inhibitors (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). After centrifugation at 13,000\u2009rpm at 4\n\u00b0\nC for 10\u2009min, the supernatants were stored at \u221280\n\u00b0\nC until use. Protein concentration was determined by a colorimetric assay, the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce Protein Research Products, Rockford, IL) and used to calculate volume for equal protein loading.\nCytokine levels were analyzed using the multiplexing immunoassay Rat Cytokine Magnetic Bead Panel (RECYTMAG-65K, Millipore, MA) for TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-2, IL-10, and CCL-2 as recommended by the manufacturer. Mean fluorescence intensity values were converted into pg/mL and normalized by protein concentration for each sample.\nNitrate/nitrite concentrations were measured using chemiluminescence. Nitric oxide combined with oxidative species, such as peroxide and superoxide, produces nitrogen radicals. The nitric oxide and nitrogen radicals react with tissue and serum proteins, creating nitrates and nitrites in fluid (NO\nx\n). Concentrations of NO\nx\nprovide a measure of acute/subacute nitrosative oxidative stress. NO\nx\nwas measured using a chemiluminescence analyzer (Sievers NOA 280i; GE Analytical Instruments, Boulder, CO) according to manufacturer's protocol. Micromolar NO\nx\nresults were normalized by protein concentration for each sample.\n\nTissue sparing analyses\nWhole fresh brains were removed and snap frozen at PID3 and PID50. At PID3, eight rats from each of the three groups were used. At PID50, brains were taken from all twenty rats used for MWM testing. Starting at the hippocampal commissure, 12 equally-spaced 16\u2009\u03bcm cryosections through the damaged area were obtained from each animal and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Slides were visualized under a light microscope, photographed at low power to cover the entire section and hemispheric area measurements were performed using Image J (v. 1.47; NIH, Bethesda, MD). Tissue sparing was calculated by dividing the hemispheric volume for the injured side of the brain by the mean volume for the opposite hemisphere, contralateral to impact.\n44\n,\n45\n\nImaging\nImaging was done at PID12 and PID28. For imaging at PID12, 18 injured rats (DHACCI,\nn\n=9; REGCCI,\nn\n=9) and six SHAM rats were tested. A separate set of rats\u201410 injured (DHACCI,\nn\n=5; REGCCI=5) and five SHAM\u2014were imaged at PID28. More rats were imaged at PID12 than at PID28 because we anticipated higher variability in T2-measures of edema earlier after injury.\n\nMRI acquisition\nImaging experiments were conducted at PID12 and PID28 using a 7-Tesla horizontal-bore Bruker Biospec MRI scanner (Bruker Biospin, Ettlingen, Germany), interfaced with 12\u2009cm actively shielded gradient insert capable of producing a magnetic field gradient up to 600 mT/m. Rats were anesthetized using 1%-3% isoflurane and 0.8 L/min O\n2\nand their vital signs (respiration, temperature, heart rate, and oxygen saturation) were continuously monitored using magnetic resonance-compatible physiological monitoring system (SA Instruments, Stony Brook, NY). Rats were placed in a 72-mm volume coil for signal transmission and a quadrature surface coil was placed on the head for signal reception (Bruker Biospin, Ettlingen, Germany).\nT2-weighted scans were obtained using a rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement pulse sequence with a repetition time (TR) of 5000 msec, an effective echo time (TE) of 50 msec, 8 echoes per image, two averages, 30 coronal 0.75\u2009mm-thick slices, a field of view of 3.0\u00d72.5\u2009cm, and an in-plane resolution of 117\u2009\u03bcm\u00d798\u2009\u03bcm. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans were acquired using spin echo diffusion-weighted sequence with single-shot echo planar readout, with a TR of 7500 msec, TE of 44 msec, 10 coronal 1\u2009mm-thick slices, a field of view of 3.0\u2009cm\u00d72.5\u2009cm, and an in-plane resolution of 234\u2009\u03bcm\u00d7195\u2009\u03bcm. Thirty diffusion-weighted gradient directions, uniformly spaced over unit sphere\n46\nand five non-weighted images were acquired with two signal averages, with diffusion gradient duration 7 msec, separation 20 msec, and diffusion encoding sensitivity 700\u2009sec/mm\n2\n.\n\nMRI analyses\nEdema volume was quantified using T2-weighted images at PID12 but not at PID28, to avoid confounding effects of late cystic changes in the lesion cavity. Regions of high signal intensities in the T2 images, excluding ventricular zones, were delineated by blinded investigator (MS) using Image J software and expressed as percent of contralateral hemispheric volume.\nWe used two commonly measured directional indices of water diffusivity: axial diffusivity (AD), parallel to the axonal direction; and, radial diffusivity (RD), perpendicular to the axonal fibers in homogeneous white matter tracts. Myelinated, undisrupted axons allow faster water diffusion parallel to the axon than perpendicular to it.\n47\nWe also measured fractional anisotropy (FA), a scalar measure of the anisotropy of diffusion that ranges from zero to one. In the brain, FA is thought to reflect fiber density, axonal diameter, and myelination. Diffusion tensors were estimated on pixel-by-pixel basis using the manufacturer's software (Paravision version 5.1, Bruker Biospin, Ettlingen, Germany) and quantified using the FA index.\n48\nPost-processing for DTI was performed using manual region of interest (ROI)-based analysis in Image J and tract-based analysis in DSI Studio (National Taiwan University:\nhttp://dsi-studio.labsolver.org\n). We used age-matched SHAM rats to control for the normal developmental changes in myelination, and hence FA, in the immature rat. DTI parameters for SHAM rats were similar to those obtained in na\u00efve rats at the same developmental age.\n49\nROI-based analyses were performed on the DTI scalar maps using Image J software. The ROIs (proximal corpus callosum [CC] and external capsule [EC]) were manually drawn by blinded investigator (M.S.) on the FA maps for both hemispheres through five coronal slices per rat, as illustrated in\nFigure 5A and 5B\n, based on the Rat Atlas of Paxinos and Watson as previously described.\n50\nThe CC and EC were chosen because they are known to be affected by CCI and because these two regions can be more reliably identified even in the presence of a large contusion injury.\n40\n,\n51\nThe CC was further subdivided into the genu, body, and splenium (slices 1, 2-4, and 5, respectively, as shown in\nFig. 5C\n) to control for the known variability in axonal diameter and FA signal from anterior (genu) to posterior (splenium).\n52\u201354\nOpen in a separate window\nFig. 5.\nRegion of interest (ROI)-based and tract-based diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analyses.\n(A)\nThis is a schematic illustrating the ROIs (ipsilateral and contralateral corpus callosum and external capsule), drawn at the level of the splenium. For comparison, fractional anisotropy (FA) image number 5 in\n(B)\nis taken at the level of the splenium. (B) FA images of a SHAM rat brain are shown to illustrate the corpus callosum (CC) sections used in ROI-based DTI analyses. Image 1 shows the genu, or anterior CC, and image 5 the splenium, or posterior CC. Images 2-4 show the slices between genu and splenium, or the slices averaged to obtain DTI values for the body of the CC. DTI values for the external capsule (EC) resulted from the average of all slices.\n(C)\nThese FA images illustrate tract-based DTI analysis, using representative sham and controlled cortical impact (CCI) brains. Tract-based analyses of the CC were undertaken to complement ROI-based studies given that the anatomic disruption after CCI, as evident in this image, hindered visual analyses in more lateral regions of the CC and EC. On the FA images, rectangular ROI seeds were drawn in the midline part of the CC in serial coronal imaging slices from genu to splenium. The tracking parameters were empirically optimized to track only CC/EC fibers connecting the two hemispheres. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nTract-based analysis for CC fibers connecting the two hemispheres was used to complement ROI-based analysis, a method dependent on visual inspection, given the anatomic disruption in the most lateral portions of the CC resulting from the CCI impact (\nFig. 5C\n). Tractography was performed using imported diffusion-weighted raw magnetic resonance magnitude images to reconstruct pixel-wise diffusion tensors. On the FA images, rectangular ROI seeds were drawn by a separate investigator (O.A.) in the midline part of the CC in serial coronal imaging slices from genu to splenium. The following tracking parameters were used for all rats: FA threshold, 0.2; angular threshold, 20\no\n; step size, 0.05; minimum tract length, 5; maximum tract length, 10; and number of tracts, 1000. The tracking parameters were empirically optimized such that only CC/EC fibers connecting the two hemispheres were tracked. Any cingulum fibers that were inadvertently tracked were manually segmented out of the final tracking results. For a given tract, DSI studio return averaged measurements of FA, AD, RD, and tract volume for each rat.\n\nStatistical analysis\nMWM and rotarod data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's post hoc tests. NOR results were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. For tissue sparing analyses, significant differences between groups were determined by two-way (treatment x trial) ANOVA. Non-parametric ANOVA was used for all other analyses, using a Kruskal-Wallis test for group first to determine if a difference existed between the three groups and for those with group differences to determine if DHACCI and REGCCI groups differed from each other. Statistical analyses were performed using R version 2.15.1.\n55"

Informed consent for participation in this research study, as well as access to medical records in the ED were obtained from all patients before testing.\n\nSubjects\nA total of 30 subjects between the ages of 18\u201365 years of age were recruited into three groups, including an mTBI group (M), an orthopedic control group (O), and a normal uninjured control group (N). Of the M sample, 11 subjects (average age, 33 years; three female) were recruited from the ED at Memorial Hermann Hospital (Houston, TX) who met the diagnostic criteria for mTBI as defined by the CDC. The inclusion criteria for mTBI included: non-penetrating head trauma, no loss of consciousness or loss of consciousness under 30\u2009min, Glasgow Coma Scale score 13\u201315, and no abnormalities on a CT scan.\n2\n,\n55\nAdditionally, less than 16\u2009h post-injury was also part of the inclusion criteria.\nControl subjects included seven orthopedic patients (O group; average age, 31 years; no females) and 12 normal subjects (N group; average age, 33 years; six female).

The N control subjects were age-matched to the M group and had little to no history of mild or more serious traumatic brain injury. Group N participants were tested in a controlled environment in the adjacent Medical School building.\nAdditional inclusion criteria for participants in all groups were blood alcohol concentration less than 0.08 and no pain medications within 24\u2009h. All subjects also were queried regarding their race/ethnicity, visual status, loss of consciousness status (M group only), history of concussion, and cause of injury (M group only; see\nTable 1\nfor demographic information). Answers from ED patients were confirmed by attending physicians and/or present family members. Additionally, the injuries of the O group and the M group were assessed to obtain an Injury Severity Score (ISS).\n56\nThe ISS is an anatomical scoring system that provides quantitative analysis of injury severity in patients with multiple bodily injuries and is commonly used in the ED. All subjects' ED medical records were obtained and assessed for an ISS by a trained clinician based on the presence and severity of non-head injuries (O group) and head injuries and non-head injuries combined (M group).\nTable\n1.\nDemographic Information of Participants\nVariable\nNormal controls\nn\u2009=\u200912\nOrthopedic controls\nn\u2009=\u20097\nmTBI\nn\u2009=\u200911\np\nAge at injury, mean (SD)\n33 (15.0)\n31 (11.6)\n33 (16.5)\n0.96/0.25/0.67\nGender (male:female)\n6:6\n7:0\n8:3\n0.23/0.89/0.55\n#\nHistory of concussion (yes:no)\n1:10\n+\n0:7\n4:7\n0.12/0.60/0.30\n#\nLOC under 30\u2009min,\nn\n(%)\nNA\nNA\n54.5%\nInjury to assessment interval, hours (SD)\nNA\n5.9 (5.2)\n5.9 (5.2)\n0.98/0.49\nEducation, mean (SD)\n16.5 (3.1)\n13.7 (3.5)\n14.09 (2.1)\n0.07/0.78/0.99\nCause of injury (mTBI)\nMotor vehicle accident\n54.5%\nFall\n18.2%\nStruck by/against\n18.2%\nAssault\n9.1%\nInjury Severity Score, mean (SD)\n4.7 (3.3)\n5.3 (5.1)\n0.80/0.86\nOpen in a separate window\n+One subject's history information was not available\n#p value obtained from a generalized linear model run with group (normal controls [N], orthopedic controls [O], mild traumatic brain injury group [M]) as a fixed factor and using a logit link function and a binomial distribution for the dependent variables gender and history of concussion.\nAll\np\nvalues are obtained using a mixed model analysis with group (N,O,M) as the fixed factor and subject as the random factor.\nOrder of\np\nvalues: All subjects/Only subjects with data from all tests/Only subjects with data from all tests, grouped into un-concussed (N and O) and concussed (M) groups for receiver operating characteristic analysis.\nmTBI, mild traumatic brain injury; SD, standard deviation; LOC, loss of consciousness; NA, not applicable.\nThere were no significant differences between groups in age, education level, history of concussion, or gender (\nTable 1\n). In addition, there were no significant differences between the O and M groups in injury severity (determined by the ISS) or the injury to assessment interval (\nTable 1\n); however, one O participant was within 17\u2009h post-injury at time of assessment. None of the main findings reported changed with this subject's removal. Task administration did not interfere with treatment or standard hospital procedures.\n\nMeasures\nPro-point and Anti-point tasks\nBoth the Pro-point and Anti-point tasks (\nFig. 1\n) were presented on a tablet screen, which displayed a fixation circle (radius 1.4\u2009cm) surrounded by four outlined square boxes (0.8\u2009cm). To start a trial, the participant is required to place their index finger on the fixation circle. Subsequently, with a fixed delay (280\u2009msec), a target stimulus (white square, 0.8\u2009cm) randomly appears in one of the four boxes. The participant is then required to either touch the square box containing the target stimulus (\nFig. 1A\n, Pro-point task) or touch the square box opposite of where the target stimulus appeared (\nFig. 1B\n, Anti-point task) as quickly and accurately as possible. The two tasks are presented in separate blocks until 48 correct trials are completed for each task. Subjects made very few errors in these pointing tasks (average 3.6%).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nRepresentation of display and correct response for the Pro-point and Anti-point tasks on a tablet screen.

Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nWe recorded two key measures of performance on these tasks, initiation time (IT, in msec) and response time (RT, in msec). IT is defined as the duration of time between the appearance of the target stimulus and the lifting of the participant's finger from the fixation circle and is analogous to saccade latency. RT is defined as the duration of time between the appearance of the target to the time of touch response (used in manual response time analyses). The Pro-point task requires a simple stimulus-driven response (i.e., the time to make a hand-point movement to a visual onset stimulus) and reflects sensorimotor function. In addition to the visual processing of a target and motor response (point to a location), the Anti-point task is considered a goal-directed movement and requires additional cognitive processes often referred to as executive functions.\n26\n,\n28\u201330\nNamely, the Anti-point task requires subjects to inhibit the pre-potent or stimulus-driven response (pointing to the target) and willfully produce a goal-directed or voluntary hand movement to the location opposite the stimulus. Thus, performance on the Anti-point task also reflects these additional cognitive demands. For additional description of these tasks, please refer to Zhang and colleagues.\n49\nSAC\nThe SAC includes four measures: orientation, immediate memory, concentration, and delayed recall. The participant is required to perform a series of tasks for each measure and every task answered correctly by the participant receives one point. The score for all points acquired on the tasks is then calculated to obtain a total score (SAC), with a maximum of 30 points possible.\nKD tablet version\nThe KD test assesses the participants' speed of rapid number naming, measuring cognitive function with a task that requires intact eye movements and attention. The participant is presented with a demonstration display on a tablet followed by three test trials, with each display containing different arrangements of numbers. On each trial, the participant is required to read aloud the numbers from left to right and top to bottom as quickly and accurately as possible. For each trial, the participant touches the tablet to initiate the display of numbers and touches the tablet again as soon as they have completed reading the numbers aloud. The three test trials become progressively more difficult to read due to removal of lines and decreased spacing between the numbers. As soon as the third test trial is completed, performance is automatically output as the sum of the time taken for the three trials (summary score). Any errors made by the participant also are noted and recorded by the administrator. Participants were consecutively administered two full KD tests (i.e., two sets, each with three trials) and made very few errors on the first test (average 0.83%) and no errors on the second test. The key measure of performance on this task is the lowest of the two summary scores (KD Best). For our analyses, we also used the summary score from the first full test (KD1) and the second full test (KD2) as additional dependent variables to see whether a different selection of performance measure affected our reported findings.\n\nDesign, procedure, and counterbalancing\nThe dependent variables in this study were as follows: For the Pro-point task, IT and RT; for the Anti-point task, IT and RT; for the SAC test, total SAC score; and, for the KD test, each KD test score (KD1, KD2), as well as the best of the two scores (KD Best).\nAfter obtaining consent, each subject was administered the four tasks consecutively. Overall order of administration between the pointing tasks, KD, and SAC tests was randomized to minimize possible practice or order effects. In initial data collection, four M participants and one O participant completed only the questionnaire and two pointing tasks; all additional participants then completed all four tasks (two pointing tasks, KD, SAC). Additionally, there was one O participant who, due to limited or interrupted time, was missing the exact recording of testing time since injury, but met the general inclusion criterion of less than 16\u2009h post-injury.\n\nStatistical analysis\nIn the Pro-Point and Anti-Point task analysis, all trials containing an error were excluded (3.6%), leaving 48 correct trials per task. ITs and RTs that were greater than 2.75 standard deviations away from the conditional mean (conditional means were calculated by task for each subject) were excluded, removing an additional 3.82% and 5.14% of trials (for Pro-Point and Anti-Point trials, respectively). The remaining trimmed observations for each pointing task were compared among groups used in the mixed effects model analyses for ITs and RTs, where the fixed effect is the group (M, O, N) and the random effect is the study subject. For significant group effects, we followed with mixed effects model\npost hoc\nplanned comparisons among the three groups (M vs. N; M vs. O; and O vs. N) to evaluate group differences. For some subjects, KD and SAC scores were not recorded; therefore, we also conducted the mixed model analyses for the pointing tasks without those subjects. Our analyses showed no difference in the findings when these subjects were included and when they were removed; therefore, we only report the pointing task analyses when all the subjects were included. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare performance between groups for each KD test and SAC score. For significant group effects, we followed with\npost hoc\nplanned comparisons among the three groups (M vs. N; M vs. O; and O vs. N) to evaluate group differences. For all statistical tests, a\np\nvalue less than 0.05 is considered to be statistically significant.\nA receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis also was performed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of each measure in detecting concussions. For this analysis, data from the O and N groups were pooled together to form the un-concussed group. The concussed group was the same as the M group. The ROC curve, sensitivity (true positive rate, y-axis) versus 1 - specificity (1 - true negative rate\u2009=\u2009false-positive rate, x-axis) for each test was plotted and the area under the ROC (AUROC) curves was estimated by logistic regression using a maximum likelihood method. A perfect test for discriminating \u201cconcussed\u201d would have the ROC curve passing through the coordinates (0, 0), (0, 1) and (1, 1), demonstrating 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity with an AUROC value of 1. A value of 0.5 AUROC, with a line passing through (0, 0) and (1, 1), indicates completely random guessing, with 50% false positives and 50% false negatives. The AUROC criteria were: 0.40\u20130.59 failed; 0.60\u20130.69 poor; 0.70\u20130.79 fair; 0.80\u20130.89 good, and 0.90\u20131.00 excellent. Given that the goal of this analysis was to directly compare the sensitivity and specificity of the different tests, we included only those participants that completed all the tests (N\u2009=\u20096, O\u2009=\u20096, M\u2009=\u20097)."

    "Methods": "Animals and testing parameters\nExperiments were conducted according to the Guiding Principles in the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and procedures were approved by the Virginia Tech Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Prior to all experiments, male Sprague Dawley rats (250-300 g; Harlan Laboratories, San Diego, CA) were acclimated 12\u2009h light/dark cycle with food and water provided ad libitum. Animal weights were recorded before blast and weekly following blast.\nThe shock front and dynamic overpressure were generated by a custom-built Advanced Blast Simulator (ABS) as described previously (ORA Inc., Fredericksburg, VA).\n18\nThe ABS, located at Center for Injury Biomechanics of Virginia Tech, consists of a driving compression chamber attached to a rectangular testing chamber with an end wave eliminator (EWE;\nFig. 1\n). A passive EWE was installed at the venting end of ABS, which minimizes the shock wave outflow by means of a grill plate. The EWE was patterned to mirror reflected shocks and rarefactions, which tend to \u201ccancel\u201d each other and diminish unwanted effects within the test chamber. A calibrated peak static overpressure was produced with compressed helium and calibrated acetate sheets (Grafix Plastics, Cleveland, OH). Pressure measurements were collected at 250 kHz using a Dash 8HF data acquisition system (Astro-Med, Inc, West Warwick, RI).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nBlast overpressures are generated with an Advanced Blast Simulator located at Center for Injury Biomechanics, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nThe animals were briefly anesthetized with 4% isoflurane before being placed in a rostral cephalic orientation towards the shock front. Animals were randomly selected to be in a blast or sham group (\nn\n=12/group). The blast group was exposed to a peak static overpressure of 117\u2009kPa for 2.5 msec duration. The sham animals were given the same treatment as the blast group with the exception that they did not experience the blast exposure. Animals were sacrificed at one or three months following blast exposure. Blood samples were taken via cardiac puncture at the time of euthanasia and centrifuged at room temperature in serum-separating tubes. Serum was collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until further analysis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Animals were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane prior to euthanasia and brains were collected from all animals. Half of the animals per group (\nn\n=6/group) were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde for immunohistochemistry while the other half was perfused with cold saline. Brains from paraformaldehyde-perfused animals (\nn\n=6/group) were processed in 30% sucrose solution and fixed in Tissue-Tek\n\u00ae\noptimal cutting temperature embedding medium (Sakura Finetek USA, Inc., Torrance, CA), then frozen on solid CO\n2\n; 40\u2009\u03bcm tissue sections were prepared with a microtome. Brains from saline-perfused animals were stored at \u221280\u00b0C for gene expression analysis. Adipose tissue from the lower jaw and abdomen was collected from the saline-perfused animals at three months following blast and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until analysis.\n\nImmunohistochemistry of hypothalamus\nImmunohistochemistry was performed on tissue sections from the hypothalamus (bregma \u22123.30 to bregma \u22124.30, Paxinos and Watson) for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; an astrocyte specific cell activation indicator), Iba-1 (microglial marker), cleaved caspase-3 (apoptosis), neuronal nuclei staining (Neu N; neuronal marker), and CD31 (endothelial cell marker).\nHypothalamus sections (40\u2009\u03bcm) were initially washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Tissue sections were then incubated with a primary antibody (anti-GFAP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), anti-Iba-1 (Biocare Medical, Concord, CA), anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Invitrogen), anti-Neu N (Millipore, Billerica, MA) or anti-CD31 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) at 1:200 overnight at 4\u00b0C. After PBS wash, the samples were incubated for 1.5\u2009h with fluorescein isothiocyanate-tagged (FITC)-secondary anti-rat IgG antibodies (1:200; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) or Alexa flour-555 anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:200; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA). After a PBS wash, samples were mounted on slides, air dried, and cover-slipped with prolong antifade gold reagent containing 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen). Sections (five representative sections per stain across hypothalamus) were examined with a Zeiss fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Peabody, MA) at 20\u00d7magnification under appropriate filters. Fluorescence intensity of acquired digital images was quantified by ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).\n\nELISA for blood serum protein assessment\nThe protein abundance levels of hormone, pro-inflammatory mediators, and adipokines in serum were determined by using rat ELISA kits for GFAP, adiponectin, C-reactive protein (CRP, Millipore), leptin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), IL-1\u03b2 (Alpco, Salem, NH), and ACTH (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals Inc., Burlingame, CA) following the manufacturer's protocols.\n\nReal-time polymerase chain reaction for fat regulatory gene assessment\nReal-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to measure gene expression from blast and sham samples relative to the internal housekeeping gene control. Adipose tissue was collected from the lower jaw and abdomen of the saline-perfused animals (\nn\n=6/group), rinsed with saline to remove residual blood, and frozen at \u221280 C. After thawing, the tissue was homogenized using a Branson Ultrasonicator (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH) and total RNA was extracted and purified from the tissues using the RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA concentration and purity were estimated by measuring absorbance at 260\u2009nm and 280\u2009nm. Reverse transcriptase using random primers converted the messenger RNA (mRNA) to a complementary DNA (cDNA) template using a thermal cycler (Mastercycler Gradient; Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY). For RT-PCR analysis, cDNA equivalent to 40\u2009ng of total RNA was used. Specific primer pairs for adiponectin and leptin are shown in\nTable 1\n. As an internal control, the house-keeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used. The PCR reactions included 1\u00d7SYBR\n\u00ae\nGreen Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), as well as forward and reverse primers (0.4\u2009\u03bcM each). RT-PCR was conducted in 96-well optical plates using a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The following profile was used: 50\u00b0C for 2\u2009min, 95\u00b0C for 10\u2009min, and 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15\u2009sec, and 60\u00b0C for 1\u2009min. Threshold cycle (Ct) values for each sample and primer pair were obtained and analyzed by the delta-delta (\u0394\u0394) Ct method in order to calculate the fold change in each target gene.\n19\n,\n20\nTable\n1.\nPrimer Sequences for Real-Time PCR\nCategory\nGene\nPrimer sequence\nHousekeeping gene\nGAPDH\n5\u2032-TGGCCTTCCGTGTTCCTACC-3\u2032 (F)\n5\u2032-AGCCCAGGATGCCCTTTAGTG-3\u2032 (R)\nHormone\nLeptin\n5\u2032- TTCACACACGCAGTCGGTATC-3\u2032 (F)\n5\u2032-CCCGGGAATGAAGTCCAAA-3\u2032 (R)\nAdiponectin\n5\u2032- AGGGCCAGGAGCTTTGGT-3\u2032 (F)\n5\u2032-GCCATCCAACCTGCACAAG-3\u2032 (R)\nOpen in a separate window\nGAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical differences between sham and blast animals were assessed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with\np\n<0.05 considered significant using SPSS\u2122 statistical software (IBM, Armonk, NY) as two separate experiments at one month and three months time-points for any unknown residual effects.
