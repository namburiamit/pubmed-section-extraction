    "Methods": "Male Sprague Dawley (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) rats approximately 3.5 months of age at the time of the injury (mean body weight, 364\u2009g; standard error of the mean [SEM]=2) were used for all of the studies. All animal and surgical procedures adhered to the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The Southern Illinois University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all experimental procedures. Before and after injury, animals were housed in a university-maintained, Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care\u2013accredited vivarium, with a 12\u2009h light/dark schedule and a controlled environmental temperature of 22\u00b0C in standard housing cages with food and water available ad libitum.\n\nSurgery\nAll surgeries were performed under aseptic conditions. The CCI model utilized in the present study was based on previous studies and was intended to produce a moderately severe injury.\n8\n,\n9\n,\n12\n,\n41\nAnimals were anesthetized using a mixture of isoflurane (2\u20134%) and oxygen (0.8\u2009L/m). When the animal became unresponsive (no ocular or pedal reflexes) the head was shaved and scrubbed with 70% alcohol followed by betadine and placed into a stereotaxic device. A midline incision was made in the skin as well as through the underlying fascia. A trephine was used to create a circular craniotomy (5.0\u2009mm) centered 0.5\u2009mm anterior to and 3.5\u2009mm lateral (left) to bregma. The unilateral contusion injury was created with a sterile stainless steel impactor tip (4.0\u2009mm in diameter) attached to the Benchmark\u2122 stereotaxic impactor (Leica, St. Louis, MO) at a ten-degree angle towards the midline.\nThe injury was induced with an impact speed of 3.0\u2009m/sec and an impact depth of 2.5\u2009mm. The impact tip maintained contact with the dural surface for 0.5\u2009sec before retraction. To maintain normal body temperature (37\u00b0C) during surgery and recovery, the rats were placed on a warm water recycling bed and pump system (EZ Anesthesia, Palmer, PA). Rats with sham surgeries underwent identical surgical preparation as the injured animals, received craniotomies, were sutured, and were then transferred to recovery. All animals in every group underwent the same anesthesia, regardless of the therapy applied.\nThe mini-pump (Alzet #2ML1, Alzet, Cuperzino, CA) subcutaneous implantation procedure was performed 4\u2009h post-CCI. Gas anesthesia was administered, the surgical site was sterilized and a midline incision was made in the back halfway between the forelimb and hindlimbs. After the incision was made, the underlying fascia and connective tissue were separated from the skin and the osmotic mini-pump was placed within the \u201cpocket.\u201d Afterwards, the incision was closed with skin staples. Under anesthesia, pumps were explanted 3\u2009d later and the incision was sutured closed. Regardless of treatment, all groups were anesthetized in the same manner.\n\nDrug administration\nProg and NAM doses were selected by targeting clinically significant concentrations as described previously.\n23\n,\n41\nProg (Sigma #P3972, St. Louis, MO) was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 10\u2009mg/kg. NAM (Sigma #N5535, St. Louis, MO) was administered with osmotic pumps, which allow for continuous infusion (12\u2009mg/kg/h; 240\u2009\u03bcL/d) plus an intraperitoneal 75-mg/kg loading dose. To control for effects following injections and/or pump implantation, all animals were injected, anesthetized, and implanted with osmotic pumps. Prog was diluted in fresh peanut oil (LouAna, Brea, CA). All animals received an injection 4\u2009h post-injury and an additional injection every 12\u2009h for 72\u2009h post-injury or until sacrifice. Following the 75\u2009mg/kg loading dose (diluted in saline) of NAM 4\u2009h post-injury, NAM-administered animals received injections of peanut oil for the remaining injection time-points. The combination therapy group received both the NAM and Prog treatments. Both the Sham and Vehicle groups were administered intraperitoneal injections of peanut oil and osmotic pumps filled with 0.9% sterile saline (Sigma #14190, St. Louis, MO) for all injection time-points. The behavioral study group comparisons included a NAM/Prog-injured group (\nn\n=9), a NAM-injured group (\nn\n=9), a Prog-injured group (\nn\n=9), a Vehicle-injured group (\nn\n=9), and a Sham (\nn\n=9) group. The anatomical study group comparisons included a NAM/Prog-injured group (\nn\n=6), a NAM-injured group (\nn\n=6), a Prog-injured group (\nn\n=6), a Vehicle-injured group (\nn\n=6), and a Sham (\nn\n=6) group.\n\nSerum analyses\nSerum samples were collected and analyzed to measure the amounts of circulating NAM and Prog in each group. Blood samples (1\u2009mL) were collected from the tail vein 1\u2009h after the final injection. Blood serum was separated by microcentrifuge and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. NAM concentrations were analyzed in serum using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet detection at 254\u2009nm on a Varian Pro Star 210 HPLC system (Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) using a previously-developed assay.\n5\nProg concentrations were analyzed using an enzyme linked immunoassays (R&D Systems Inc, Minneapolis, MN, and VWR International, West Chester, PA).\n\nSensory assessment: Bilateral tactile adhesive removal task\nThis task has been shown to be an effective assessment of somatosensory deficits following injuries to the rodent frontal lobe.\n13\n,\n42\u201344\nTo assess sensory deficits, this test was administered on Days 4, 6, 8, 11, 17, 24, and 28 post-injury. Rats were pre-tested for baseline levels on the two days prior to surgery. A small circular sticker approximately 113\u2009mm\n2\n(Avery Dennison Corporation, Brea, CA) was applied to the radial aspect of each forelimb. The rat was then returned to its home cage and the latency to initially contact the sticker was used as the dependent variable. The trial was terminated when the right and left stickers were both removed or 2\u2009min had elapsed. Each animal received two trials each day with a 15\u2009min inter-trial interval. Researchers who were blind to the treatment condition performed all testing.\n\nMotor assessment: Forelimb asymmetry task\nTo assess the amount of reliance on the \u201cuninjured limb\u201d (ipsilateral to injury), this test was administered on Days 4, 6, 8, 11, 17, 24, and 28 post-injury following methods outlined in previous studies.\n42\n,\n45\nRats were pre-tested for baseline levels on the two days prior to surgery. On each test day, the rats were placed in an empty fish tank (50\u2009cm \u00d725\u2009cm \u00d730\u2009cm) and allowed to explore for 120\u2009sec. Rats were administered one trial per test day, which was recorded with a video camera. Later, the number of right and left forelimb contacts on the vertical surface was recorded as the primary dependent variable of interest. The following formula was used to calculate the reliance on the uninjured limb: Right forelimb contacts/(Right forelimb contacts+Left forelimb contacts) \u00d7100. Researchers who were blind to the treatment condition performed all testing. Inter-rater reliability scores were calculated for approximately 25% of the data collected. Data were chosen randomly and the criterion for acceptance was a correlation coefficient of\nr\n>0.90.\n\nMotor assessment: Locomotor placing task\nTo assess recovery of coordinated, locomotor limb movement, this test was administered on Days 4, 6, 8, 11, 17, 24, and 28 post-injury following methods outlined in previous studies.\n11\u201313\nRats were pre-tested for baseline levels on the two days prior to surgery. On each test day, the rat was placed on an elevated grid floor (56.0\u2009cm \u00d754.0\u2009cm) with openings measuring 3.2\u2009cm \u00d73.2\u2009cm in size and allowed to freely explore for 120\u2009sec. A \u201cfoot-fault\u201d was defined as an inaccurate limb placement through one of these openings. Rats were administered one trial per test day, which was recorded with a video camera. Later, total movement on the grid, as well as foot-faults, were recorded. The total number of foot-faults was the primary dependent variable of interest. The following formula was used to calculate the foot faults as a function of total movement on the grid: (Right forelimb faults-Left forelimb faults)/ lines crossed.\n12\nResearchers who were blind to the treatment condition performed all testing. Inter-rater reliability scores were calculated for approximately 25% of the data collected. Data were chosen randomly and the criterion for acceptance was a correlation coefficient of\nr\n>0.90.\n\nBehavioral data analysis\nBehavioral data were analyzed using a mixed model factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) or one-way between-subjects ANOVA (SPSS v. 15 for Windows). The between factor was Treatment (NAM/Prog-injured, NAM-injured, Prog-injured, Vehicle-injured, and Sham) and the within-group factor was day of testing. Both the main effects and the interaction effects were considered. Huynh-Feldt corrections and Tukey's Honestly Significant Different test (Tukey's HSD) were used to control for type I error in the repeated measures and post hoc means comparison, respectively. Planned comparisons using a\nt\n-test were performed when the interaction effects were not significant to examine differences in performance on each test. A significant level of\np\n\u22640.05 was used for all statistical analyses.\n\nLesion analysis\nAt 29\u2009d post-injury, the rats that were assessed on functional recovery were euthanized with Euthasol (Virbac Animal Health; 0.3\u2009mL intraperitoneally), and transcardially perfused with 0.9% phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by 10% phosphate buffered formalin (PBF). Brains were post-fixed in PBF following removal from the cranium for 24\u2009h and then transferred into a 30% sucrose solution to cryopreserve the brains 4\u2009d prior to frozen sectioning. Serial coronal sections (40-\u03bcm thick) were sliced using a sliding microtome on a frozen stage and collected into a cryopreservative solution and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. Animals in the behavioral portion of the experiment also underwent a cresyl violet lesion analysis. At 24\u2009h post-CCI, the rats in the histological portion of this study were euthanized and underwent identical procedures and were examined for neuron degeneration, as well as astrocyte activation.\nA series of sections were brush mounted on gelatin-subbed microscope slides, stained with cresyl violet, dehydrated, and cover slipped. The extent of the lesion was analyzed with an Olympus microscope (BX-51) and an Olympus 13.5 megapixel digital camera (DP-70). Images of sections throughout the extent of the injury coordinates were captured using the digital capturing system and area measures of the lesioned tissue were determined using the ImageJ software package (1.43u, NIH). The Calvalieri method was used to calculate the volumes of the ipsilateral cortex and the contralateral cortex.\n46\nFour stereotaxic coordinates throughout the lesion, at approximately+1.7, +0.9, +0.1, and \u22120.7\u2009mm relative to bregma, were selected for lesion analysis. The number of sections and the section thickness (40\u2009\u03bcm) were multiplied by the mean area of the remaining cortex. The extent of cortical injury was measured by calculating the percent reduction in the injured ipsilateral cortex, compared with the contralateral cortex at each level using the following formula: 1 \u2212 (ipsi/contra) \u00d7100). We have reliably shown that this technique is sensitive enough to detect treatment-induced reductions in injury size.\n6\n,\n9\n,\n13\n,\n47\nInter-rater reliability scores were calculated for approximately 25% of the data collected. Data were chosen randomly and the criterion for acceptance was a correlation coefficient of\nr\n>0.90.\nA one-way ANOVA was completed where the between-subject factor of Treatment (NAM/Prog-injured, NAM-injured, Prog-injured, Vehicle-injured, and Sham) was used to analyze the lesion analysis data. Tukey's HSD were used to control for type I error and a significance level of p\u22640.05 was used for all statistical analyses. Inter-rater reliability measures were evaluated using the bivariate correlation of scores obtained between the two raters. Post hoc analyses were conducted using Tukey's HSD for comparison of means whenever appropriate. A \u00a3 value of<0.05 was considered significant. All data are shown as mean scores\u00b1SEM.\n\nNeuronal degeneration and astrocyte reactivity\nTwo series of frozen sections throughout the injury cavity (+1.2 and \u22120.2\u2009mm, relative to bregma) were stained for degenerating neurons using Fluoro-Jade (FJ) B stain (Chemicon Int. Billerica, MA)\n48\nfollowing a standard protocol.\n6\n,\n7\nThe tissue went through a rehydration procedure prior to a 0.06% potassium permanganate solution for 10\u2009min under agitation. Following the 0.06% potassium permanganate solution, there was another 1\u2009min rinse before being transferred into the 0.004% FJ staining solution for 10\u2009min. The slides were then rinsed with dH\n2\n0 (3\u00d71\u2009min), allowed to dry for 15\u2009min at 50\u00b0C, cleared in xylene for 1\u2009min, and cover-slipped. Tissue sections were visualized with an Olympus fluorescent microscope (BX-51) system using a green fluorescent protein filter. Each section was viewed at 4\u00d7 magnification, and then increased to 40\u00d7, before the image was captured with a 13 megapixel Olympus (DP-70) digital camera. The region of interest was set to be 300\u2009\u03bcm \u00d7300\u2009\u03bcm. The number of FJ+cells within the captured field of view (90\u2009mm\n2\n) were counted using ImageTool software (\nimagetool.software.informer.com\n).\nAnother series of frozen sections throughout the injury cavity (+1.5 and \u22120.1\u2009mm, relative to bregma) were examined with a protocol for GFAP immunoreactivity to determine astrocyte expression following injury and standard protocol was followed.\n6\n,\n7\nTissue sections were mounted on subbed slides and dehydrated over several steps and placed in a citrate buffer at 90\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. After cooling, the slides were placed in normal goat serum (Vector Laboratory Inc., Burlingame, CA, diluted 1:50) for 24\u2009h, then incubated with a GFAP goat anti-rabbit (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, diluted 1:2000) for 48\u2009h, rinsed in PBS+0.2% Triton-X (TX; 6\u00d75\u2009min) and incubated using goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Vector Laboratory Inc., Burlingame, CA, diluted 1:200) for 90\u2009min. The slides were rinsed again (PBS+0.2% TX, 6\u00d75\u2009min), placed in an avidin biotin complex (Vector Laboratory Inc., Burlingame, CA) for 90\u2009min and then rinsed with PBS+0.2 % TX (3\u00d75\u2009min) followed by a 0.1 PB (3\u00d75\u2009min) rinse. They were then reacted in a nickel-intensified chromagen solution containing acetate-imidizole buffer, 2.5 % nickel ammonium sulfate, 0.05% diaminobenzidine (DAB), and 0.01% H\n2\nO\n2\n. The slides were rinsed with 0.1 PB (3\u00d71\u2009min), allowed to dry for 15\u2009min at 50\u00b0 C., cleared in xylene for 1\u2009min and then cover-slipped.\nTissue sections were visualized with an Olympus microscope (BX-51) system 4\u00d7 magnification, and then increased to 40\u00d7, before the image was captured with a 13 megapixel Olympus (DP-70) digital camera. The regions of interest were set to be 300\u2009\u03bcm \u00d7300\u2009\u03bcm. The number of GFAP+cells within the captured field of view (90\u2009mm\n2\n) were counted using ImageTool software. There were six regions of interest examined; four in the ipsilateral cortex, surrounding the injury and two regions in the contralateral cortex. Cell counts for both the FJ+and GFAP+stained cells used selective process but without the use of unbiased stereology. Cell criterion included distinct cell type morphology and focus clarity of cell bodies of which the entire cell body was within the area of interest. Researchers who were blind to the treatment condition performed all counting. Inter-rater reliability scores were calculated for approximately 25% of the data collected. Data were chosen randomly and the criterion for acceptance was a correlation coefficient of\nr\n>0.90.\nCell counts (FJ+, GFAP+) from the six selected areas of interest for each slice (at two different coordinates) in the ipsilateral and contralateral cortex were used to determine the number of cells in each area. If no population of each cell type were found in an area of interest, tissue images were still captured and used in analysis. Cell counts were performed with ImageTool software.\n6\n,\n7\nCounts were averaged across the slices from each coordinate for each hemisphere. One-way ANOVA tests were performed on all of the data. Independent variables were treatment (NAM/Prog-injured, NAM-injured, Prog-injured, Vehicle-injured, and Sham). Post hoc analyses were conducted using Fischer's Least Significant Difference for comparison of means whenever appropriate. A\np\nvalue<0.05 was considered significant. All data are shown as mean scores\u00b1SEM. Although some of the tasks required subjective scoring, each scoring procedure was well defined with operational definitions. Additionally, 25% of the data were scored by a second, blind experimenter. These data were analyzed with a Pearson's correlation to assess the covariance between the two independent datasets.\n\nGene expression studies\nRats were randomly assigned to five groups and dosed as described above: a NAM-injured group (\nn\n=15), a Prog\u2013injured group (\nn\n=15), a NAM/Prog-injured group, a Vehicle-injured group (\nn\n=15) and a Sham group (\nn\n=5). Animals were sacrificed and tissues collected at 24\u2009h, 72\u2009h, and 7\u2009d after injury according to previously published protocols.\n23\n,\n41\nAt each time-point, five animals from each treatment group were sacrificed. Sham animals were sacrificed at 72\u2009h so that they received an equivalent amount of experience with vehicle administration in order to account for any effects related to the stress response.\nAnimals were put under deep anesthesia with a mixture of CO\n2\n(80%) and O\n2\n(20%), a cardiac blood sample taken, and then decapitated. Brains were then rapidly extracted, sliced into a 4-mm coronal slab and placed on a cold plate, and a 5\u2009mm tissue punch was taken, which included the injured cortex and small amount of peri-injury cortex. Tissue samples were then placed in centrifuge tubes, snap frozen, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Cardiac blood samples were collected at the time of sacrifice and from the tail vein at 72\u2009h in the 7\u2009d group to verify serum drug levels. Blood serum was separated by microcentrifuge, snap frozen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. All samples were shipped by overnight carrier to the University of Washington on dry ice. NAM and Prog concentrations were assayed as described above.\nThe processing and analysis of the ribonucleic acid samples, the microarray analysis using the AffymetrixGeneChip\n\u00ae\n3000 scanner (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) and Bioconductor (Bioconductor, Inc., Seattle, WA) package p.adjust were performed as previously described.\n41\nWe carried out Gene Ontology (GO) category analysis via the cumulative hypergeometric distribution method to determine enhanced GO categories\n49\nusing the Bioconductor package GOstats.\n50\nGO analysis shifts the emphasis from evaluation of single genes to evaluation of pathways, networks, and functions. We used differentially-expressed genes (more than 1.5-fold up or down regulated;\np\n<0.05) for this analysis to identify GO categories by evidence of over-representation of significant genes. The validation of the data obtained with the microarrays was performed using fluorogenic 5\u2032-nuclease\u2013based assay and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as previously described.\n23\n,\n41\nThe RT-PCR data were normalized to the housekeeping genes, \u03b2-actin, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase."

    "Methods": "Subject recruitment\nThis study was approved by both the Human Investigation Committee of Wayne State University and the Institutional Review Board of Detroit Medical Center. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject before enrollment. All subjects were at least 18 years old and able to speak English. All patients with mTBI were recruited from the ED of Detroit Receiving Hospital (DRH), which is a Level-I trauma center. Patient eligibility was based on the mTBI definition by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.\n40\nOnly patients with a lowest-recorded Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 13\u201315 were considered. For a GCS of 15, there must be least one of the following: (a) loss of consciousness less than 30\u2009min, (b) post-traumatic amnesia less than 24\u2009h, or (c) an alteration in mental status (i.e., disoriented, dazed, or confused). Participants, both healthy controls and patients, with a history of a previous brain injury, neurological, neuropsychological, or psychiatric disorder, or concurrent substance abuse were excluded. Moreover, MRI exclusion criteria include metal and/or electronic implants, claustrophobia, pregnant or trying to become pregnant, and subjects weighing more than 300 pounds (136\u2009kg; machine's capacity limit). If the MRI scan could not be performed in the acute setting in a patient, the patient was brought back for an MRI scan within a week of injury.\n\nCognitive assessment\nIn the acute setting, once a patient was conscious and medically stable and came out of post-traumatic amnesia, if any, they would be administered neurocognitive testing and surveyed about their PCS. A short instrument called the Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC)\n41\nwas used as a brief assessment of neurocognitive function. The SAC was originally developed for field assessment of neurocognitive status after a sports concussion.\n42\nIt has been reported that the SAC is sensitive to the acute changes after concussion and requires limited training to administer.\n39\nThe SAC is scored 0 to 30 and assesses four cognitive domains including orientation, attention, immediate memory, and delayed recall. The SAC has demonstrated sensitivity to brain injury in the acute setting, particularly in delayed recall.\n39\nThe Emergency Room Edition of the SAC also includes a PCS questionnaire where symptoms were graded from 0 to 3 (i.e., none, mild, moderate, severe). The PCS score was the sum of symptom scores for the questionnaire.\n\nImage acquisition\nMRI data were collected on a 3-Tesla Siemens Verio scanner with a 32-channel radiofrequency head-only coil. A subject's head was fixed by foam pads to restrict motion. Resting state functional imaging was performed using a gradient echo echo-planar imaging sequence with the following imaging parameters: repetition time (TR)=2000\u2009msec, echo time (TE)=30\u2009msec, slice thickness=3.5\u2009mm, slice gap=0.595\u2009mm, flip angle=90 degrees, pixel size=3.125\u2009mm in-plane, matrix size=64\u00d764, 240 volumes for whole-brain coverage, one average, acquisition time of 8\u2009min. During resting-state scans, subjects were instructed to keep their eyes closed and to stay awake. In addition, structural high-resolution T1-weighted imaging was also performed by using the MPRAGE sequence with TR=1950\u2009ms, TE=2.26\u2009ms, slice thickness=1\u2009mm, flip angle=9 degrees, field of view=256\u00d7256\u2009mm, matrix size=256\u00d7256, and voxel size=1\u2009mm isotropic.\n\nImage processing\nFigure 1\ndemonstrates a pipeline of the comprehensive image processing. We used both ICA and SBA to analyze the resting state fMRI (rsfMRI). ICA was performed at both group and individual levels. Group ICA was performed first in both patient and control groups and then with cross-validation in subgroups. Individual ICA was performed by using two reported methods, \u201cdual regression\u201d\n43\n,\n44\nand \u201cback-projection,\u201d\n43\n,\n44\nand our new atlas-based ICA method to overcome the confounding factors of these two methods. ICA analysis was mainly performed in DMN and the basal ganglia network (BGN). Because the thalamus belongs to BGN, which is an independent network in ICA analysis in published data,\n45\nwe investigated BGN to assess the thalamus in the ICA analysis.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nImage processing pipeline. fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging; TBI, traumatic brain injury; ICA, independent component analysis; SBA, seed-based analysis; ROI, region of interest.\nAfter ICA analysis, SBA was also performed by calculating the Pearson correlation value between major network regions and the whole brain, and the correlation maps were used to compare healthy controls and patients. The network regions were selected for DMN, BGN, amygdala and hippocampus regions based on previous studies.\n27\n,\n28\n,\n37\nSpecifically, the PCC, precuneus, angular, anterior prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area [BA] 10), and orbitofrontal cortex (BA 11) were selected for the DMN; and the putamen, pallidum, thalamus, and caudate were selected for the BGN. Below is a description of major steps.\nPreprocessing\nPreprocessing was performed using the FSL software (\nhttp://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/\n). First, the first five volumes were discarded to reach magnetization equilibrium. A high-pass temporal filtering (100\u2009sec), motion correction, slice timing, brain extraction, and spatial smoothing (full width at half maximum=6\u2009mm) were applied. Grand mean scaling was also applied to the entire 4-dimensional data for each subject. The data were registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute standard space using nonlinear registration with 10\u2009mm warp resolution and resampled to 3\u2009mm isotropic voxel size. Variance normalization was used to rescale each time series. No intensity normalization was performed to prevent false anticorrelation. In addition, for SBA, the white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signal were regressed out using the DPARSF toolbox (\nhttp://www.restfmri.net/forum/DPARSF\n).\nGroup ICA (GICA) analysis\nICA was performed using the GIFT software package from MIALAB (\nhttp://mialab.mrn.org/software/gift/\n) and the MELODIC package, which is included in FSL (\nhttp://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/melodic\n). We chose 52 components for our analysis and applied an automated two-step approach for network selection to eliminate human errors (see\nSupplement 1\nfor further explanations; see online supplementary material at\nftp.liebertpub.com\n). Briefly, the DMN and BGN were determined by using the spatial correlation similarity metric (\nEq. 1\n) between ICA components and a template of the desired RSNs. The template includes 75 components built by Allen and coworkers\n45\nbased on 603 subjects that contains 28 RSNs (see\nSupplement 1\nfor further explanations; see online supplementary material at\nftp.liebertpub.com\n).\nWhere\ni\nis the number of voxels,\nX\nis a desired RSN, and\nY\nis a component obtained from ICA.\nThe GICA was performed on the healthy control and patient groups. The group difference was measured between patients and controls in major network regions of both the DMN and BGN. The reliability and reproducibility of the results were measured by using a cross-validation method. Specifically, for each group (patient or healthy control), seven subgroups were randomly chosen with six subjects in each subgroup. GICA was performed for each subgroup, and the number of voxels in each network region associated with the related network and the voxel dependency were measured. Voxel dependency is a voxel's value of RSN map (the result of ICA) indicating its likelihood of belonging to the network\u2014in other words, the extent to which a voxel belongs to the network.\nIndividual ICA\nIndividual ICA was performed using two reported methods\u2014i.e., dual regression\n43\n,\n44\nand back-projection,\n43\n,\n44\nas well as a new atlas-based ICA approach to evaluate the alterations in patients with mTBI. The common space in both ICA methods was created by using the whole dataset of this study, because extracting the independent components of each group separately may overestimate the difference between groups. Given the relative small sample size in this study, however, the common space may still be different from that of the normal population. To overcome the potential confounding factor, we proposed an atlas-based ICA method.\nProposed atlas-based ICA\nIn the atlas-based ICA, independent components extracted from 603 subjects\n45\nwere used as the common space, and a \u201cspatially constrained ICA\u201d method\n46\nwas used to extract the individual components corresponding to the common space components.\nBecause the common space in the dual regression and back-projection methods is created by using the whole dataset of a particular study, the common spaces are different when the datasets of studies differ from each other. Consequently, RSNs of an individual could be changed depending on the group to which the individual belongs. On the other hand, in the temporal concatenation group ICA, we assume that there is a common space among all individuals; therefore, using the data of a study to find the common space is not ideal, especially when the number of samples is small, as in our study. Therefore, a template or atlas that indicates the common space of a big population is needed.\nIn the atlas-based ICA, unlike the dual regression and back-projection, instead of using the independent components of GICA of our dataset as a common space for individual ICA, the independent components from a large group of healthy subjects are considered as a true common space. In this case, (1) the RSNs extracted from an individual's rsfMRI data are more reliable because independent components were extracted from an atlas that is based on a large population instead of a small group of subjects; (2) independent components and subsequent analysis and results among various studies with different data sets only depend on individual differences rather than the whole data set in an study, because the common space is the same among all of this study. In other words, the difference between various subjects is only the result of the intrinsic variability between each pair of them.\nNote that because this method uses atlas components to extract the individual components in individual subjects, it automatically solves the problem of finding corresponding RSNs across subjects. As previously explained, this method only requires the individual subject's data instead of a whole set of subjects' data, which makes it more applicable for clinical use.\nSBA\nSBA was performed using within-group and between-group analyses. A Pearson correlation coefficient was determined between the average of all voxels in a network region and all brain voxels to create a correlation map for each region.\n37\nThe correlation maps were corrected by using the Fisher z-transformation to calculate a FC map and FC comparisons. The FC map was calculated by applying a one-sample\nt\ntest on corrected correlation maps. In FC comparisons, a correlation mask was first applied to select voxels that are eligible for statistical analysis (see\nSupplement 1\nfor details regarding SBA; see online supplementary material at\nftp.liebertpub.com\n). Then, statistical analysis was performed using two-sample\nt\ntests on corrected correlation maps that were further corrected by spatial thresholding to reduce the false positives and increase reliability.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using MATLAB software (\nhttp://www.mathworks.com/\n). Data normality was assessed by using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. Results for continuous variables are presented as mean (standard deviation [SD]) or median (interquartile range) as appropriate. Frequencies and percentages are presented for categorical variables. Unless specifically stated otherwise, a\np\nvalue<0.05 was considered significant. For ICA, a two-sample\nt\ntest was performed to compare RSNs between two groups when appropriate. For SBA, the correlation value was converted using the Fisher z-transformation to maintain the statistical analysis eligibility (see\nSupplement 1\nfor details; see online supplementary material at\nftp.liebertpub.com\n).\nA two-sample\nt\ntest was performed for FC comparisons, and a one-sample\nt\ntest was performed to determine the FC map for each network region. Statistical maps for both ICA and SBA were corrected with spatial (cluster) thresholding with the MonteCarlo simulation using Alphasim contained within resting-state fMRI software (\nhttp://www.restfmri.net/\n) to decrease false-positive error. In other words, to correct type I error without increasing the risk of type II error, dual thresholding (based on\np\nvalue and cluster size) was performed to give a high reliability for statistical results.\nMoreover, to increase the reliability of the between-group comparison, the healthy subjects were randomly divided into two groups, and a within-group analysis was performed by using the two-sample\nt\ntest. The results were compared with the between-group analysis to improve reliability that the difference, which appears in between-group analysis, is generated from the group difference. Finally, the relationship between imaging analyses and the neurocognitive measurements, including SAC scores and scores of each SAC subcategory, were evaluated with bivariate correlations."

    "Methods": "This prospective observational Canadian multicenter comparative cohort study used data collected in the Rick Hansen Spinal Cord Injury Registry (RHSCIR).41\n\nThe subjects recruited for this study formed a longitudinal cohort of consecutive patients recruited at the time of their initial injury to the RHSCIR beginning at one pilot site in 2005 through to the present; the national SCI registry is currently active in 31 sites in 15 Canadian cities. Spine fellowship trained surgeons provide care at each of these sites, many of which are level 1 trauma centers.\n\nThe sites all obtained Institutional Research Ethics Board approval to enroll patients and enter data elements based ona prioriresearch questions, some of which are outlined in the article describing the registry.41\n\nLocal treating clinicians examined each patient, conducted neurological assessments, and reviewed radiographic images to confirm the diagnosis of acute tSCI.\n\nRegistry coordinators collected data while the patient was in the acute care setting of each registry site. The registry includes data elements collected during the pre-hospital, acute, and inpatient rehabilitation phase, as well as on discharge into the community and at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years post-injury.\n\nWe included only those participants in the RHSCIR who underwent surgery for treatment of their acute tSCI. Patients must have consented to collection of their baseline and follow-up neurological examination results to be included. We excluded anyone with a Glasgow Coma Scale of less than 14 and anyone where timing of surgery and timing of neurological examinations were not specified.\n\nIn RHSCIR, a detailed initial or baseline neurological assessment according to ISNCSCI42is conducted and recorded for all persons with SCI as part of a minimal data set. Coordinators and clinicians at each participating site undergo training on the performance of the ISNCSCI by a team which travels to each site from the central registry site. This ensures the highest possible reliability of the neurological assessments.43Each ISNCSCI record was processed through a customized algorithm that ensures high quality and consistency of the neurological data. The date and time of injury as well as the date and time of each neurological assessment and surgery are recorded so that the time from injury to initial neurological assessment and the time from injury to surgical procedure can be calculated in hours, as can the time to subsequent neurological assessments.\n\nNeurological assessments are performed at multiple time points, but are recorded in the registry on admission to acute care and again on discharge from acute care or inpatient rehabilitation. We included initial/baseline ISNCSCI assessments that were performed within 168\u2009h of injury. What we described as our \u201cfinal\u201d ISNCSCI assessments were generally performed between 3 and 6 months after injury. Although neurological improvement may continue to occur beyond a year after injury,44most neurological recovery is thought to occur within the first 3 months after injury45,46or possibly up to 6 months.47,48Pollard and Apple31have noted that more than 70% of neurological recovery occurs before discharge from rehabilitation. The focus of our analysis was on early neurological recovery.\n\nFactors that we considered potential confounders or effect modifiers based on clinical expertise and the literature include patients' age at injury,49their sex,50the Injury Severity Score (ISS),51the initial AIS grade, (reflecting the severity of the neurological injury) and the neurological level of injury,52rehabilitation LOS, the time from injury to baseline neurologic examination, and the post-surgery interval to the final neurologic examination.\n\nIn the majority of patients with acute tSCI, there is a time dependent improvement in motor recovery. This motor recovery may lead to conversion from one AIS grade to another and this may occur within the first hours and even days after injury.46,53Information bias will occur if the precise time from injury to baseline examination is not accounted for. We included only patients who had a baseline neurological assessment performed before surgical intervention, within 72\u2009h of injury for the analysis on the effect of time to surgery within each AIS group. We performed analyses on the AIS A (n=186) patients separately from AIS B, C, and D patients (n=284;Fig. 1).\n\nWe also investigated the influence of early surgery on the length of acute hospital stay. We selected the time from admission to discharge from an acute care facility as a surrogate for cost and the systems impact of early surgery and analyzed the influence of early surgery on LOS using gamma regression. This analysis was performed on all patients who had time to surgery and acute LOS data, using 4 months as a cut-point based on other research54and clinical appropriateness (n=1410;Fig. 1).\n\nStatistical methods\nAll data were tested for normality using histogram graphical analysis and Kolmogorov-Smirnov numerical analysis. Univariate analysis was performed using\nt\ntests when data were normally distributed, otherwise the Mann-Whitney\nU\ntest was used. For categorical variables, we used the chi-square test. Pearson and Spearman correlation was also used for bivariate association. The Kruskal-Wallis test and a one-way analysis of variance were used to model the development of motor score changes for more than two groups. Outliers, namely those data points that showed variability of at least three standard deviations from the mean of the variable of interest, were also removed.\n55\nTo evaluate the effect of timing of surgical intervention on change in motor score and acute LOS, we used several different types of generalized linear models, including multiple linear regression, gamma regression, and negative binomial regression. We adjusted for covariates including age, sex, AIS, ISS, and neurological level. In a separate analysis, we compared the effect of surgical timing on rehabilitation LOS and the post-surgery interval to the final neurological examination to ensure there were no differences between groups. AIC (Akaike Information Criteria) and BIC (Bayesian Information Criteria) were used for model selection. Alpha was set at\np\n<0.05. Data were analyzed using SPSS Windows version 21 and SAS 9.2."

    "Methods": "Participants\nA total of 51 mTBI participants and 51 HC participated in a series of studies investigating neuronal correlates of semi-acute mTBI. Data from a subset (27 patients) of this cohort has previously been reported using seed-based analyses.\n13\nInclusion criteria for the mTBI group were based on the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine, including a Glasgow Coma Score of 13\u201315 (at first contact with medical staff), loss of consciousness (if present) limited to 30 minutes in duration, and post-traumatic amnesia (if present) limited to 24 hours. All mTBI patients were recruited from local Emergency Rooms. mTBI and HC participants were excluded if there was a prior history of neurological disease, major psychiatric disturbance, additional closed head injuries with more than 5 minutes loss of consciousness, additional closed head injuries within the past year, learning disorder, ADHD or a history of substance or alcohol abuse/dependence. Three mTBI patients were identified as outliers (above 3 standard deviations) on at least 2/6 head motion parameters for frame-wise displacement relative to their cohort.\n33\nThese patients and their respective matched controls were subsequently excluded from further analyses, leaving a total of 48 mTBI (23 males; 28.3 +/\u2212 9.5 years old) and 48 HC (23 males; 27.9 +/\u2212 9.6 years old) participants. Informed consent was obtained from all participants according to institutional guidelines at the University of New Mexico.\nPatients were evaluated both clinically (mean day post-injury=13.9 +/\u2212 4.9) and with brain imaging (mean day post-injury=14.0 +/\u2212 5.3) within 21 days of injury (see\nSupplementary Table 1\n). The maximum time between clinical and imaging sessions was 6 days, although it was typically much shorter (mean days between sessions=1.3 +/\u2212 1.6 for mTBI patients). One mTBI patient and one HC were not able to complete neuropsychological testing due to scheduling difficulties during their first visit. Six of the mTBI subjects were being prescribed various medications for pain related to the accident at the time of their visit.\n\nClinical assessment and imaging protocol\nThe Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR) and the Test of Memory and Malingering (TOMM) provided estimates of overall pre-morbid intellectual functioning and effort, respectively. Composite indices were calculated for the following cognitive domains: attention (Trails A, Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test, Stroop and WAIS-III digit span), working memory (letter number sequence, arithmetic, and digits backward), processing speed (grooved pegboard and digit symbol coding), executive function (Wisconsin Card Sort, Trails B, and Fluency (FAS)), and memory (California Verbal Learning Test- II). The Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NBSI), a modified version of the Rivermead Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory and State Trait Anxiety Index were also given to measure self-reported post-concussive symptoms and emotional sequelae. Whenever possible, clinical measures were converted to T-scores using published age-specific norms and then averaged to provide an overall composite score for different emotional and cogntive domains (see\n30\nfor additional details).\nAll images were collected on a 3 Tesla Siemens Trio scanner. Foam padding and paper tape was used to restrict motion within the scanner. High resolution T\n1\n- and T\n2\n-weighted anatomic images were acquired for all participants (see\nSupplemental materials\n). Susceptibility weighted images (SWI) were collected on a subset of 24 mTBI patients to better characterize petechial hemorrhages. A five minute resting state run was completed by each participant using a single-shot, gradient-echo echoplanar pulse sequence [TR=2000\u2009ms; TE=29\u2009ms; flip angle=75\u00b0; FOV=240\u2009mm; matrix size=64\u00d764]. Thirty-three contiguous, axial 4.55-mm thick slices were selected to provide whole-brain coverage (voxel size: 3.75\u00d73.75\u00d74.55\u2009mm). A total of 152 images were collected, with the first three images eliminated to account for T\n1\nequilibrium effects.\nPresentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems) was used for stimulus presentation and synchronization of stimuli with the MRI scanners. Subjects were instructed to passively stare at a foveally presented fixation cross (visual angle=1.02\u00b0) for approximately five minutes and to keep head movement to a minimum.\n\nImage processing\nFunctional images were generated and processed using a mixture of freeware and commercial packages. Standard pre-processing of the raw time series EPI images included despiking (based on the median absolute deviation), temporal interpolation to correct for slice-time acquisition differences, motion-correction in both two- and three-dimensional space, spatial blurring using a 6\u2009mm Gaussian full-width half-maximum kernel, and then normalization to a 3\u2009mm\n3\nstandard stereotaxic coordinate space (Montreal Neurological Institute) using a non-linear algorithm. Mean frame-wise displacement (FD) was calculated across the 3 displacement parameters and 3 rotational motion parameters derived from the rigid body correction, with rotation converted to millimetres using a 50\u2009mm radius sphere.\n34\nA group-level spatial ICA was used to decompose resting state data into independent components to obtain both static and dynamic measures of RSFC using similar parameters from a recent publication.\n28\nA relatively high model-order was selected for both subject-specific principal components analysis (120 components) as well as group-wise data decomposition (100 components) to provide a more \u201cfine-grained\u201d parcellation of networks and to more clearly eliminate artifacts (e.g., head motion, physiological noise, susceptibility artifacts, etc) from the data.\n5\n,\n6\nThe Infomax ICA algorithm\n35\nwas repeated 20 times in Icasso using random initial conditions to improve the stability of the final decomposition,\n36\nwith the group spatial maps estimated as the modes of the component clusters. All group spatial maps were thresholded based on 0.25 of the maximum voxel-wise value to facilitate the automatic selection of components and presentation of data in figures.\nDual (spatial-temporal) regression was used to obtain the individual subject-specific spatial maps and component time-courses from the group-ICA. Additional subject-specific time-course processing was also conducted to remove potential noise sources from the data given the recent concerns in the literature regarding spurious correlations in static RSFC.\n28\n,\n37\nThese steps included 1) detrending linear, quadratic, and cubic trends, 2) multiple regression of the 6 realignment parameters and their temporal derivatives, 3) removal of detected outliers (based on the median absolute deviation), and 4) band-pass filtering with cutoffs of 0.01 and 0.10\u2009Hz. Pair-wise correlation coefficients were then computed for all combinations of components, followed by a transformation to z-scores using Fisher's method.\nPower spectra were estimated for each participant/component using a multi-taper approach,\n38\nwith the time-bandwidth product set to 3 and the number of tapers set to 5. From each spectrum we calculated the ratio of low (operationally defined as occurring between 0\u20130.10\u2009Hz band) to high (occurring between the 0.15\u20130.25\u2009Hz band) frequency power. This ratio should be above approximately 1.5 for ICN based on the temporal properties of the hemodynamic response. A mean power ratio was calculated across all 96 subjects for each component to facilitate automated component selection (see below).\nGroup components were first auto-classified as ICN or artifact (physiological, movement related, or imaging artifacts) using 3 different criteria. Specifically, components were classified as an artifact if the component 1) exhibited peak activations mostly in white matter or ventricles (>50%), 2) exhibited a mean power ratio below 1.5), or 3) a maximum spatial correlation of greater than 0.40 with a component previously classified as artifact in a large cohort of HC.\n28\nComponents were classified as ICN based on a maximum spatial correlation of greater than 0.40 with a component previously classified as an ICN. Individual ICN were then reviewed by two expert raters (A.M. and J.L.), manually reclassified if necessary, and then assigned into broad categories of visual, auditory, sensori-motor, sub-cortical, cerebellar, DMN or cognitive control (CCN) networks.\nBased on these criteria, 41 components were classified as artifact, 52 components as ICN and 7 components as neither ICN nor artifact. During expert review, two of the \u201cneither\u201d components were reclassified as ICN based on the location of peak activation and the mean power ratio. In addition, one component that was classified as an ICN was manually reclassified as an artifact, leaving a total of 53 ICN. Ten of the ICN were deemed to represent different nodes of the DMN, with six components representing sub-cortical structures (\nFigure 1A\n). Thus, there were 105 unique pairs for which static RSFC was compared based on our\na priori\npredictions.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nPanel\n(A)\ndepicts the 53 intrinsic connectivity networks (ICN) derived across both mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) patients and healthy controls (HC) following group independent component analysis. Individual ICN are clustered into seven over-arching networks: sub-cortical (SC; 6 ICN); default-mode (DM; 10 ICN); sensorimotor (SM; 8 ICN); visual (VS; 10 ICN); auditory (AD; 3 ICN); cerebellum (CB; 2 ICN); and cognitive control (CC; 14 ICN). Sagittal (X), coronal (Y) and axial (Z) slice locations are presented according to the Montreal Neurological Institute system. The color-coding for each ICN within each of the seven major networks is presented within Panel\n(B)\n, as well as t-statistics representing the pair-wise comparisons of static resting state functional connectivity comparisons across the two groups. Individual ICN labels include: L, left; R, right; pDMN, posterior default mode network; MeFG, medial frontal gyrus; SFG, superior frontal gyrus; PCC, posterior cingulate cortex; ACC, anterior cingulate cortex; AG, angular gyrus; MFG, middle frontal gyrus; IPL, inferior parietal lobule; PHG, parahippocampal gyrus; IFG, inferior frontal gyrus; aInsula, anterior insula; CC, cingulate cortex; pre-SMA, pre-supplementary motor area; SPL, superior parietal lobule; PreCG, precentral gyrus; PoCG, postcentral gyrus; SMA, supplementary motor area; PCL, paracentral lobule; STG, superior temporal gyrus; MTG, middle temporal gyrus; pInsula, posterior insula; FFG, fusiform gyrus; LG, lingual gyrus; MOG, middle occipital gyrus; SOG, superior occipital gyrus; IOG, inferior occipital gyrus. A priori hypothesis examined the DM and SC networks. Panels\n(C)\nand\n(D)\npresent the pair-wise Pearson correlation values (r) for HC and mTBI patients, respectively.\nA sliding window approach was adopted for dynamic RSFC analyses, wherein correlations were computed from windowed portions of the component time-courses.\n28\nSpecifically, a tapered window was created by convolving a rectangle (width=24 TRs) with a Gaussian (\u03c3=3 TRs) function, and slid in steps of 1 TR across all of the TRs. There were a total of 126 different windows in the current analyses (based on 149 initial images and a window width of 24). For each pair of components, the standard deviation across the sliding window correlation time series was then computed as a summary of temporal variability (dynamic RSFC). In the current context, larger standard deviations indicate more variable, or less stable, functional connections between two ICN.\nPrimary analyses were restricted to 16 ICN that were selected to represent the DMN and sub-cortical networks and compared component spatial maps, component spectra, static RSFC, and dynamic RSFC between groups. Voxel-wise ANCOVAs using WTAR and mean frame-wise displacement as covariates were utilized to compare spatial maps between mTBI and HC. Group-wise comparisons of subject-specific spatial maps were individually corrected for false positives at\np\n<0.05 based on 10,000 Monte-Carlo simulations. Group comparisons of the power ratio (low/high frequency) across the 16 ICN were performed using a similar ANCOVA model, corrected for multiple comparisons using the Bonferonni method. Group comparisons of pair-wise static and dynamic RSFC between DMN and sub-cortical ICN (105 pairs each) were conducted with an ANCOVA model and corrected for multiple comparisons using False Discovery Rate (FDR).\nFinally, we compared whether mTBI patients exhibited more extreme static or dynamic RSFC relative to HC in a spatially invariant fashion.\n39\nFirst, the mean and standard deviation were calculated for each pair-wise metric from the HC group. The individual pairwise correlations/standard deviations for both HC and mTBI groups were then transformed to signed z-scores using the statistical moments derived from the HC. The z-transformed data for both groups were then corrected for known distributional biases (hereafter referred to as distribution-corrected z-scores; DisCo-Z) resulting from the individual transformations. ICN exhibiting extreme values based either on two standard deviations above (DisCo-Z >2; positive summary measure) or below (DisCo-Z <\u22122; negative summary measure) the HC mean were coded with a 1 and summed separately across positive and negative extremes. These single value summary statistics were then transformed by adding one to the count and taking the square root to improve normality. The transformed data were then directly compared across the two groups using WTAR and mean frame-wise displacement as covariates."

    "Methods": "Study design\nThe source of patient-level data was a recent Phase III clinical trial, Magnesium Sulfate for Neuroprotection after TBI.\n19\nAfter simulating multiple treatment effects across multiple outcome measures, we generated a large number of samples via bootstrapping from the available clinical trial data. Bootstrapping simply draws a random sample from the clinical trial data, with replacement.\n21\nWe made no assumptions about the sampled population other than the trial used being representative of patient outcomes following moderate to severe TBI. For each sample, we used a suite of statistical techniques to test the null hypothesis that the simulated treatment had no effect on the outcome measures. The primary objective of this study was to determine the power and corresponding type I error rate associated with each primary outcome measure and statistical technique. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center, Toronto, Ontario, and the Institutional Review Board at the University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.\n\nData source\nThis simulation study used clinical data derived from a randomized controlled trial on TBI patients.\n19\nThe trial enrolled 499 patients aged 14 years or older (mean age - 34 years) with moderate or severe TBI who were admitted to a Level I regional trauma center in the United States between August 1998 and October 2004. The trial patients were randomly assigned one of two doses of magnesium or a placebo within 8\u2009h of injury and continued the treatment for 5\u2009d. The primary outcome was a composite of mortality, seizures, functional measures, and neuropsychological tests assessed six months after the injury. Although we had at least some outcome data available on 461 of the subjects (92%), we utilized only the data for the 331 subjects (66%) for whom data were known for all four outcome measures used in our study, which included those who had died or who were unable to take some of the tests due to neurological impairment. There were no significant differences in the primary or secondary outcomes between the treatment and control groups; therefore, data from both groups were included in the population used to draw the bootstrapped samples.\nThe reference values corresponding to normal levels of cognitive and functional performance were derived from patients who experienced trauma to parts of the body other than the head in the Patient Characteristics Study.\n22\nThese 132 participants were seen in the emergency department following trauma not involving the brain, with 71% having severe enough injuries to be admitted to the hospital. Ninety-two percent of subjects (\nn\n=121) returned at one year post-injury for neuropsychological assessment. Data from this study was used to establish normal levels of cognitive and functional performance for the purpose of defining the reduction in deficit and therefore simulating the desired treatment effects in the mock clinical trials.\n\nOutcome measures\nThe two outcomes used for comparison were GOSE and a battery of four functional and cognitive measures. GOSE scores range from 1 to 8, with lower scores indicating a poorer functional outcome. The eight categories are: Dead, Vegetative State, Lower Severe Disability, Upper Severe Disability, Lower Moderate Disability, Upper Moderate Disability, Lower Good Recovery, and Upper Good Recovery.\n11\nThe components of the four-measure battery are: GOSE,\n11\nDigit Symbol,\n23\n,\n24\nSelective Reminding Test Sum of Recall,\n25\nand Trail Making Test B (time to complete).\n26\nThe three neuropsychological tests examine episodic memory, information processing speed, and executive functions.\n23\u201327\nFor neuropsychological test scores, deaths were not considered to be missing data but rather were assigned a pseudoscore worse than the worst observed score. Those who were too neurologically impaired to take the test were assigned a pseudoscore better than those who died but worse than the worst score in the dataset. These neuropsychological tests were chosen, because they represent cognitive domains likely to be affected by TBI, they were among the outcome measures used in the Magnesium trial,\n19\nand we had data on performance of control subjects who had other injuries but not ones involving the brain.\n22\n\nStatistical analysis\nAn overview of our statistical analysis is shown as a flowchart in\nFigure 1\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nFlow diagram of the simulation design.\nGenerating the data with the desired treatment effect\nTo ensure that we could achieve the target outcome distribution equivalent to the desired treatment effect with a high precision, we first generated a \u201csuper\u201d dataset of 16,550 subjects by replicating the original dataset (\nn\n=331) 50 times. Then, we simulated the desired treatment effect (i.e., shifted the outcome distribution to achieve the target treatment effects) in each version of the super datasets. We simulated three different treatment effect magnitudes, resulting in datasets containing 10.0, 7.5, and 5.0 percentage point increases of favorable outcome based on the dichotomized GOSE (i.e., GOSE 5\u20138). Simulated treatment effects were applied to the data by systematically improving the observed scores until the overall means and frequencies reached specific target values. Both the calculation of the target values and the assignment of the new scores are described below.\nFirst, we calculated the target percentage in the favorable category for the GOSE (i.e., GOSE 5\u20138) by adding the posited treatment effect to the observed percentage in the favorable category and calculated the resulting odds ratio. We then constructed target frequencies for each individual GOSE category such that every possible dichotomization of the GOSE scale would yield an odds ratio equivalent to this value. Target values for the other outcome measures were achieved by re-expressing the treatment effect as a \u201creduction of deficit\u201d as measured against published reference data on patients without TBI.\n22\nFor example, if 45% of the original RCT dataset and 95% of trauma controls had a favorable outcome, then the deficit would be seen to be 50 percentage points. Consequently, if the treatment effect was defined as a 10 percentage point increase on favorable outcome, this would correspond to a 20% reduction of this deficit (i.e., 10/50). This scalar could then be projected onto the other measures in a similar fashion. Thus, if the Selective Reminding Sum of Recall mean for the original RCT dataset was 30 words, and the trauma-control mean was 50 words, then the deficit would be 20 words, and the corresponding improvement due to the treatment effect would be 20% of this deficit (i.e., four words).\nOnce the target values were established, the posited treatment effect was infused into the original RCT dataset by improving the individual scores in a systematic and uniform manner until those values were realized. For the GOSE, this was achieved by randomly selecting subjects to improve by one category (or two categories if necessary). When such promotions on the GOSE involved subjects who were dead or too neurologically impaired to be tested on some or all of the other measures and thus required a battery that was more appropriate to their new GOSE level, they were assigned one from a randomly-chosen subject in that same level. For all of the other outcome measures, scores were improved using the same \u201creduction of deficit\u201d methodology described above, except using ceiling values defined by observed maximums in the dataset rather than trauma control means (to ensure that no scores would actually worsen due to the treatment effect). Finally, all adjusted scores were rounded to emulate actual observed scores. This procedure resulted in three simulated datasets, each with a different treatment effect (10.0, 7.5, and 5.0 percentage points) in addition to the original data (which corresponded to a 0% treatment effect).\nForming the \u201cmock clinical trials.\u201d\nThe above simulations formed four sets of treatment data with 0, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 percentage points treatment effect, each drawn from a super dataset. We drew samples of\nn\n=400 from each of these datasets with replacement (i.e., bootstrapping) to create mock clinical trials with the desired treatment effect. For example, for a 10% treatment effect mock clinical trial, a sample of 400 subjects was drawn from the 10% treatment effect dataset and a sample of 400 subjects was drawn from the 0% treatment effect (control) dataset. This was done 10,000 times (each\nN\n=800), and then the process was repeated for the 7.5, 5.0, and 0% treatment effect simulations.\nDetermining power\nWe tested the null hypothesis of no treatment effect on both types of outcome measures, using multiple statistical techniques on each of the 10,000 simulated mock clinical trials, and for each of the desired treatment effects (5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 percentage points). Then, we computed the percentage of mock trials where the null hypothesis was rejected (i.e., how many were statistically significant defined as the two-sided\np\nvalue<0.05). In this way, the estimated power for each outcome and analytical technique was calculated. By applying the same analytic approach to the dataset with the 0% treatment effect, we estimated the type I error rate.\nAnalysis of GOSE\nFirst, GOSE was dichotomized into favorable (a score of 5 to 8 on the GOSE) and unfavorable (a score of 1 to 4 on the GOSE) outcomes, and a chi-square test (without continuity correction) was used to compare proportions. This is labeled \u201cFixed dichotomy of GOSE\u201d in the tables and figures. This analytic technique, based on a dichotomization that is the same for all study participants, is commonly used to analyze GOSE.\nSecond, proportional odds regression\n28\nwas used as an additional technique to analyze GOSE data under the assumption that the odds ratio for the treatment variable is the same for all possible ways of collapsing the ordinal outcome scale (i.e., GOSE) into a better and a worse category. The likelihood ratio test evaluates whether this odds ratio differs from 1. This is labeled \u201cProportional odds regression (GOSE).\u201d The assumption of a consistent odds ratio for all dichotomization points was satisfied in the simulated data, because of the way we generated each treatment effect.\nThird, we analyzed the GOSE data using a sliding dichotomy technique as described previously.\n29\n,\n30\nThis method aims to improve sensitivity by stratifying according to baseline prognosis, with each stratum having a GOSE cutpoint that yields a more even split of favorable and unfavorable outcomes. For example, for patients with a poor prognosis, non-vegetative survival (i.e. GOSE scores of 3\u20138) would be considered favorable, whereas for patients with a good prognosis, only GOSE scores of 7 or 8 might be considered favorable.\nIn this procedure, dichotomization of GOSE was based on baseline prognostic risk. For each patient, the baseline prognostic risk score (BPRS) for the usually defined unfavorable outcome at six months (GOSE \u22644) was calculated based on three factors: age, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) motor score, and pupillary reactivity, using the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials (IMPACT) core prognostic model.\n31\nThe original sample was ordered into tertiles based on the BPRS: best prognosis, intermediate prognosis, and worst prognosis. Within each tertile, the point of dichotomization for GOSE was chosen as the value closest to a 40:60 split between better and worse outcomes in the original dataset (\nTable 1\n). This split was chosen so that there would be nearly the optimal 50:50 split when the treatment effect was added. Thus, each patient's outcome was dichotomous (favorable or unfavorable) but the GOSE category they needed to obtain to be considered to have favorable outcome depended on their prognostic group. The treatment groups were compared using a chi-square test (without continuity correction). This is labeled \u201cSliding dichotomy of GOSE (3 prognostic groups).\u201d\nTable\n1.\nIllustration of Sliding Dichotomy Method (3 Prognostic Groups)\nStrata of probabilities of unfavorable outcome\n*\nGOSE\nBest prognosis\nIntermediate prognosis\nWorst prognosis\nDeath\nUnfavorable\nUnfavorable\nUnfavorable\nVegetative\nLower severe disability\nFavorable\nUpper severe disability\nLower moderate disability\nUpper moderate disability\nFavorable\nLower good recovery\nFavorable\nUpper good recovery\nOpen in a separate window\n*\nProbabilities of unfavorable outcome (a score of 1 to 4 on the GOSE) were calculated using the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials (IMPACT) core prognostic model.\nGOSE, Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale.\nFourth, we used the same sliding dichotomy technique except with 10 prognostic groups instead of three, allowing finer distinctions between what would be considered favorable for an individual (\nTable 2\n). This is labeled \u201cSliding dichotomy of GOSE (10 prognostic groups).\u201d\nTable\n2.\nIllustration of Sliding Dichotomy Method (10 Prognostic Groups)\nStrata of probabilities of unfavorable outcome\n*\nGOSE\n1 (Lowest)\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10 (Highest)\nDeath\nUnfavorable\nUnfavorable\nUnfavorable\nUnfavorable\nVegetative\nFavorable\nLower severe disability\nFavorable\nUpper severe disability\nLower moderate disability\nUpper moderate disability\nFavorable\nLower good recovery\nFavorable\nUpper good recovery\nOpen in a separate window\n*\nProbabilities of unfavorable outcome (a score of 1 to 4 on the GOSE) were calculated using the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials (IMPACT) core prognostic model. Stratum 1 is the decile of patients with the lowest probability of unfavorable outcome and stratum 10 is the decile with the highest probability of unfavorable outcome.\nGOSE, Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale.\nFifth, the previous four analyses were repeated after adjusting each one for the baseline probability of unfavorable outcome (GOSE 1\u20134), as calculated using the IMPACT core prognostic model, using regression-based methods (noted on\nTable 2\nas \u201cRegression-Adjusted\u201d). This provided us with adjusted fixed dichotomy using logistic regression, adjusted proportional odds regression, and adjusted sliding dichotomy using logistic regression (for three and 10 prognostic groups).\nAnalysis of four-measure battery\nFirst, we dichotomized each of the component measures into favorable or unfavorable responses (based on the closest round number below the median score for subjects in the original dataset). Then, the null hypothesis was tested with logistic regression computed with the use of generalized estimating equations (GEE) to analyze all measures in the composite outcome simultaneously.\n20\nThis technique assumes that the odds ratio is the same for each outcome and tests for whether that average odds ratio differs from 1. When analyzing the data using GEE, we tested two correlation structures: exchangeable (assumes equal correlation for all pairs of measures) and unstructured correlation (no assumption about correlation). These are labeled \u201cLogistic regression with GEE (Exchangeable correlation)\u201d and \u201c(Unstructured correlation).\u201d Similar analytic methods were used in the tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) for acute ischemic stroke trial\n8\n,\n32\nand the Citicoline Brain Injury Treatment trial.\n18\nSecond, for the average percentile method, each subject's percentile in the full study sample was determined separately for each of the four measures in the battery, and the overall outcome for each subject was the average of the four percentiles. The range was 0 to 100, with a higher percentile indicating a better outcome. The\nt\n-test and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare average percentile distributions between treatment and control groups. This method was used in the Magnesium trial\n19\nand the recent BEST-TRIP intracranial pressure monitoring trial in TBI.\n17\nFinally, with regard to GOSE, we looked to see whether analyzing the data with adjustment for baseline prognostic risk using regression methods increased power. This was done by including the baseline prognostic risk (i.e., the probability of unfavorable outcome on GOSE as calculated using the IMPACT model) in the logistic regression with GEE for the four-measure battery, and in the linear regression for the average percentile method. Note that here, as well, the word \u201cAdjusted\u201d is added to the beginning of the title of the relevant technique.\nAll of the statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (version 9.3, SAS Institute, Cary, NC), and statistical significance was defined by a two-tailed significance level of 0.05."

    "Methods": "Participants\nRecruitment and screening\nUndergraduate students from Queensland University of Technology and members of the general community were recruited via snowball sampling (e-mail and flyer advertisements that encouraged participants to forward the study information to others). People aged 17 years and older were invited to participate if they had: experienced an mTBI between 1 and 6 months ago or had no history of mTBI. A total of 41 people who had recently sustained an mTBI and 223 people with no history of mTBI had valid data (N=264).\nTwenty-six participants were removed because they failed the exclusion criteria (\nn\n=8/41 mTBI,\nn\n=18/223 controls). These criteria excluded participants who (a) had sought treatment in the last 12 months for a mental/intellectual impairment (e.g., severe brain injury, seizures, or other neurological problems) or a psychological/psychiatric disorder (e.g., depression:\nn\n=12; three persons with mTBI); (b) had a current self-reported sleep disorder (i.e., narcolepsy, sleep apnea, or \u201cother\u201d:\nn\n=10; three persons with mTBI); or (c) failed two or more instructional manipulation checks for indiscriminate responding (\nn\n=1 control). An additional three participants were excluded on multiple criteria: one control participant was excluded based on criteria 2 and 3, and two participants with mTBI were excluded for failing criteria 1 and 2, or all three criteria, respectively.\nmTBI sample\nAfter screening, the mTBI sample consisted of 33 participants (19 female), aged 17\u201341 years (Mean [M]=22.25, standard deviation [SD]=5.72). The primary cause of the mTBI was sport-related (\nn\n=22), followed by: a fall (\nn\n=8), a motor vehicle accident (\nn\n=1), an assault (\nn\n=1) or \u201cother\u201d (not specified;\nn\n=1). Although 22 persons sustained a sport-related mTBI and the majority of the sample were students, this study did not specifically recruit \u201ccollege athletes.\u201d Fourteen participants reported experiencing a previous \u201cconcussion\u201d (number of concussions range=2\u20135, M=3.3, SD=1.16,\nn\n=10; missing\nn\n=4). Eight persons had current pain from the injury, where the average severity of pain was 2.85 on a 1\u201310 scale (range=1\u20138; M=3.92; SD=2.23;\nn\n=12).\nParticipants self-reported experiencing an mTBI based on the following statement adapted from the World Health Organization's operational definition of mTBI\n15\n:\nThese statements will ask you about any concussion you may have had. By 'concussion' we mean an acute brain injury resulting from mechanical energy to the head from external physical forces. Concussion can result from things like playing sports, motor vehicle accidents, assaults and falls. Symptoms include at least one of the following: Confusion or disorientation (e.g., not knowing where you are or what day it is); Loss of consciousness for 30\u2009min or less; Being unable to remember events that occurred after the blow to the head for less than 24\u2009h. Please indicate if and when you have experienced a concussion according to the above definition (we are interested in your most recent concussion).\nMatched controls\nThirty-three participants were selected from the pool of 205 respondents with no history of mTBI. Case-control studies and individual matching are a means of decreasing bias from known confounds,\n16\u201318\nand this method has been used previously in TBI research on sleep.\n19\n,\n20\nControl participants were selected using the MatchIt optimal matching package from the statistical software program, R (Version 2.15.2).\n21\nThis process finds the best possible fit of controls to cases by minimizing an overall distance measure, based on the chosen covariates. Three covariates were used: sex, age (within 5 years), and ethnicity (Caucasian, non-Caucasian). This process resulted in the identification of one control for each case that was matched on age (except one case with missing age), sex, and ethnicity.\nClose-matched controls (CMCs)\nUsing the same optimal matching process, a second independent sample (\nn\n=33) was drawn from the remaining pool of 172 respondents with a negative history of mTBI. This pool was less optimally matched to mTBI cases than the control sample. The CMC group was drawn to allow a further test of the hypotheses via partial internal replication. This approach has been used previously,\n22\nand it is consistent with recent recommendations that strongly encourage the use of replication.\n23\n,\n24\nWhere possible, CMCs were matched within 5 years of age. Six participants had a greater than 5-year age difference between case and controls. Of these six participants, three were not a match on ethnicity, and one was not a match on sex. One case with missing age was matched only on sex and ethnicity.\nThe demographic characteristics of all three groups are shown in\nTable 2\n. Between-groups comparisons (mTBI vs. controls, mTBI vs. CMCs) generally revealed no significant differences on key background variables, including self-reported stimulant/sedative use and feelings of depression or anxiety. The one exception was a group difference on the number of nights of sleep disturbed by pain (mTBI>controls; mTBI>CMCs).\nTable\n2.\nDescriptive Statistics for Participant Characteristics and Between-Group Comparisons\n1. mTBI\n2.

A 5-point rating scale appropriate to the item is used; for example, \u201cmy sleep was restless\u201d (not at all - very much), \u201cI had trouble staying asleep\u201d (never \u2013 always), and \u201cmy sleep quality was\u201d (very poor - very good). Items 2, 3, 7, and 8 are reversed and all items summed for a total score ranging from 8 to 40 (US population mean=20), where higher scores indicate worse sleep.\n29\nInsomnia Severity Index (ISI)\n30\nThe ISI is widely used in sleep research and increasingly as a treatment response measure.\n31\nIn this study, it was used as an indicator of subjective sleep quality. Participants rate their insomnia problems in the past 2 weeks on a 5-point scale. The seven items include the following examples: \u201cdifficulty falling asleep\u201d (0=none - 4=very severe) and \u201chow satisfied/dissatisfied are you with your current sleep pattern?\u201d (very satisfied - very dissatisfied). A total score is derived by summing responses, ranging from 0\u201328 (0\u20137=absence of insomnia; 8\u201314=subthreshold insomnia symptoms; 15\u201321=clinical moderate severity insomnia; 22\u201328=clinical severe insomnia).\nWASO, SOL, and sleep efficiency\nIndices of these constructs were derived from the Sleep Timing Questionnaire (STQ).\nSleep quantity and timing\nSTQ\nSTQ\n32\nsleep quality, quantity, and timing and via questions about retrospective habitual bed and rising times. It provides information similar to that obtained using a prospective sleep diary. Participants report earliest, latest and usual \u201cgood night\u201d and \u201cgood morning\u201d times before work/school days and days off. In addition, it asks participants to estimate usual bedtime and waketime stability, as well as usual SOL and WASO. STQ item 17 (\u201con most nights, how long does it take you to fall asleep on average?\u201d) and STQ item 18 (\u201con most nights, how much sleep do you lose, on average, from waking up during the night, e.g., to go to the bathroom?\u201d) were analyzed separately as indicators of the sleep quality variables, SOL and WASO, respectively.\nSTQ responses were used to create five subscales describing usual sleep (weighted 5 workdays to 2 days off). Sleep quantity was measured as the duration of time between usual sleep- and wake-times, less reported WASO and SOL. Sleep efficiency (a measure of quality) describes the percentage of reported time spent in bed (from bed- to waketime) estimated as asleep (duration/time in bed). Sleep timing was assessed by calculating usual bedtimes, waketimes, and sleep midpoint times from the STQ. Sleep/waketime and sleep midpoint obtained via sleep diary have been shown to be appropriate estimates of dim light melatonin onset and, in turn, circadian phase.\n33\n,\n34\nSleep-related daytime impairment\nExcessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS])\nThe ESS\n35\nis a widely used questionnaire designed to evaluate the level of habitual sleepiness (or sleep propensity) during the day. The scale comprises eight items that describe typical day-to-day situations (e.g., sitting and reading or watching television). Likely sleepiness in each situation, or imagined sleepiness in each situation, is reported. Each item can be rated from 0\u20133 points (0=would never doze, 3=high chance of dozing), with the final score ranging from 0 to 24. The proposed range for normal sleep propensity is 0\u201310.\n36\nThe ESS has good reported internal consistency and reliability.\n37\nSleep-related functional impairment (PROMIS) Sleep-Related Impairment - Short Form 8a; Version 1.0 (PROMIS8a)\n25\nThe PROMIS8a is the second of the two short-form static sleep measurement scales developed from the PROMIS item banks. PROMIS8a measures daytime impairment related to sleep.\n25\n,\n26\nPROMIS8a assesses perceived sleepiness and sleep-related impact on daytime functioning over the last 7 days. Responses are made on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). An example item is: \u201cI had a hard time getting things done because I was sleepy\u201d and \u201cI felt alert when I woke up.\u201d PROMIS8a is scored by reversing item 2 and summing items for a total score, which ranges from 8\u201340. The mean score for the US population is 16.\n38\n\nProcedure\nEthical clearance was provided by the university's Human Research Ethics Committee. Consenting participants completed a battery of measures, including the sleep measures. The core battery used block randomization: sleep measures were presented in a fixed order but were randomized with other dimensions of functioning. The questionnaires were administered online using Key Survey (WorldAPP, Version 8.2; 2013). Three items to test for indiscriminate responding were included.\n39\nTo remain in the sample, participants were required to respond correctly to at least two of these items, and a further post-experimental check was used to verify that they understood and complied with the study instructions. Volunteers received bonus course credit if they were recruited from the undergraduate participant pool, or a chance to receive a randomly drawn prize valued at AU$100."

    "Methods": "Animals\nA total of 93 male 3- to 4-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN), weighing approximately 300\u2009g, were included in this study. Animals were housed in the animal facility, with a 12-h light/dark cycle, and water and food provided\nad libitum\n. All procedures were approved by our institutional animal care and use committee.\n\nSurgical procedures\nAnimals were subjected to a moderate lateral fluid percussion injury (LFPI) following our published protocol.\n20\n,\n21\nBriefly, adult rats were anesthetized in a plexiglass chamber with 5% isofluorane, intubated and ventilated with 2% isofluorane in a gas mixture (30% O\n2\nand 70% N\n2\n), and fixed on a stereotaxic frame. After a mid-line incision and skull exposure, a 4.9-mm craniotomy was trephinized on the left parietal bone halfway between the lambda and bregma sutures. A Leur-Loc syringe hub made from a 20-gauge needle was affixed to the craniotomy site with cyanoacrylate and further cemented with dental acrylic to the skull, at which point the anesthesia was switched off. Once the animal regained consciousness, as measured by toe and tail reflexes, the Leur-Loc fitting filled with saline was connected to a precalibrated fluid percussion device and a 2.2\u00b10.04 atm fluid pulse was administered. Sham animals went through the same surgical procedure without receiving the fluid pulse. After injury, the Leur-Loc fitting was removed; the animal was returned to the surgical table and righting time was assessed. Fifteen minutes after injury, the animal was reanesthetized and an Alzet brain infusion cannula (Brain Infusion Kit II; DURECT, Cupertino, CA) was stereotactically implanted into the posterior lateral ventricle ipsilateral to the injury site (coordinates: anteroposterior \u20131.0\u2009mm, mediolateral 1.4\u2009mm, and 3.5\u2009mm beneath the pial surface). The infusion cannula was connected to an Alzet miniosmotic pump (model 1007D; DURECT), which was placed subcutaneously on the back of the neck. An Alzet miniosmotic pump containing either 2% Ara-C or vehicle (artificial cerebrospinal fluid) was primed at 37\u00b0C water bath for 2\u2009h before use. The solution was infused for 7 consecutive days at a flow rate of 0.5\u2009\u03bcL/h. A total of 25 injured and 21 sham rats received 2% AraC infusion, whereas 21 injured and 21 sham animals received a vehicle infusion. Another group of 5 rats received 2% Ara-C infusion 7 days prior to LFPI.\nBeginning at 48\u2009h after injury, all animals received daily single intraperitoneal injections of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 50\u2009mg/kg) for 5 consecutive days. The infusion cannula and Alzet miniosmotic pump were removed at 7 days postinjury.\n\nTissue preparation\nAnimals were sacrificed at 7, 28, or 62 days postinjury, depending on the experimental group. Animals were deeply anesthetized with an overdose of isofluorane inhalation and transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Brains were dissected and postfixed in 4% PFA for 48\u2009h at 4\u00b0C and then cut coronally at 60\u2009\u03bcm with a vibratome throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the brain. Sections were collected in 24-well plates filled with PBS plus 0.01% sodium azide and stored at 4\u00b0C until use.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nIn order to assess the number of BrdU-labeled cells for animals sacrificed at 7 days postinjury (\nN\n=5 for each group), every fourth sections were processed for BrdU immunostaining. BrdU staining was performed following our previously published protocol.\n20\nBriefly, sections were washed with PBS, DNA was denatured with 50% formamide for 60\u2009min at 65\u00b0C followed by a rinse in 2\u00d7saline-sodium citrate buffer, and then incubated with 2\u2009N of HCl for 30\u2009min at 37\u00b0C. After denaturing, sections were washed with PBS and endogenous peroxidase was blocked using 3% H\n2\nO\n2\n. Following an overnight serum blocking with 5% normal horse serum in PBS, sections were incubated with rat immunoglobulin G (IgG) preabsorbed mouse anti-BrdU antibody (1:200; Dako, Carpinteria, CA) in PBST (PBS with 0.4% Triton) plus 5% normal horse serum at 4\u00b0C for 48\u2009h with agitation on the shaker. After rinsing with PBST, sections were incubated with horseradish peroxidase\u2013conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) overnight at 4\u00b0C and visualized with 5\u20325-diaminobenzidine. Sections were mounted on glass slides, lightly counterstained with 0.1% cresyl violet, and cover-slipped.\nTo assess the effect of Ara-C infusion on the generation of new neurons, another set of every fourth sections from sham animals sacrificed at 7 days postinjury were processed for doublecortin (DCX) immunostaining. In the DG, DCX labels actively divided transiently amplifying progenitor cells (type 2b cells), neuroblasts (type 3 cells), and immature neurons.\n25\nThe immunostaining procedure for DCX was similar to the BrdU immunostaining procedure described above, albeit omitting the denaturing steps. A goat anti-DCX (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and biotin-conjugated horse anti-goat IgG (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) were used, followed by an ABC kit and DAB substrate.\nBecause BrdU was injected at 2\u20137 days postinjury, the number of BrdU\n+\ncells present at a later time postinjury did not reflect cell proliferation at the time point when animals were sacrificed. To assess whether Ara-C has a long-term effect on cell proliferation in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and hippocampus, every fourth brain sections from animals that went through the Morris water maze (MWM) tests and were sacrificed at 62 days postinjury were immunostained for Ki67, a proliferation marker. The immunostaining procedure for Ki67 was similar to the BrdU immunostaining protocol described above, with the omission of the denaturing steps. A rabbit anti-Ki67 (1:500; Abcam, Cambridge MA) and biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were used, followed by an ABC kit and DAB substrate.\n\nStereological quantification\nA modified optical fractionator method was used to estimate the total number of BrdU-, DCX-, or Ki67-positive cells. This design-based stereological method, which is used to estimate cell numbers, has been widely used by our lab and previously described.\n22\nBriefly, the region of interest (ROI) was outlined using a 4\u00d7objective. A 60\u00d7oil immersion objective was used for cell counting. To quantify the number of BrdU\n+\n, DCX\n+\n, or Ki67\n+\ncells in the DG of the hippocampus, sections were examined with an Olympus Image System CAST program (Olympus, Fredericia, Demark). Ten sections spaced 240\u2009\u03bcm apart spanning the DG (\u20132.56 to \u20135\u2009mm of bregma) were examined by a \u201cblinded\u201d observer. In the DG, immunolabeled cells located in the subgranular zone (SGZ), a two-cell band between the granule cell layer (GCL) and the hilus,\n26\nand in the GCL were counted together as the granular zone (GZ). Because the immunostained cells were scattered in the DG, we counted the total number of BrdU\n+\n, Ki67\n+\n, or DCX\n+\ncells in the entire GZ and the hilus regions. A 60\u00d7oil immersion lens was used to focus through the thickness of each section, and, to avoid sampling error, cells from the upper- and lowermost focal planes were excluded from the count (optical dissector principle).\n27\nTo derive a cell number calculation, the sampling fraction (\nasf\n)=\n1\n, the disector height (\nh\n)=15, and the average section thickness (\nt\n) after immunostaining was 22 \u03bcm. With these parameters, the number of total cell counts (N) was estimated as N=\u03a3\nQ\n\u2212\n\u00b7t/h\u00b71/asf\u00b71/ssf\n, where\nssf\nwas the section-sampling fraction (=0.25 in this study) and \u03a3\nQ\n\u2212\nwas the number of cells counted.\n\nMorris water maze\nThe MWM was utilized to assess spatial cognition after TBI.\n1\n,\n28\nAll animals surviving beyond 7 days postinjury were tested. For the purpose of investigating the innate cognitive recovery after TBI, separate groups of animals were tested at 21\u201325 (\nN\n=8 for both sham and injury-vehicle groups;\nN\n=10 for both sham and injury-AraC groups) or 56\u201360 days postinjury (\nN\n=8 for both sham and injury-vehicle groups; N=10 for TBI-AraC group;\nN\n=6 for sham-AraC group) by a \u201cblinded\u201d observer. MWM testing was performed following our previously published protocol.\n20\nIn the MWM performance, goal latency and path length are equally sensitive measures.\n29\nWe used goal latency as the primary dependent variable. The probe trial was done at 24\u2009h after the last day of the goal latency test. Path length (to reach the goal in the MWM) and swim speed were also analyzed. Preceding MWM testing, a visual platform test was performed to confirm that the visual system of the animal was not impaired. Briefly, animals were placed in the large circular tank (180-cm diameter by 45-cm height) containing opaque water. Water temperature was maintained at 24\u00b0C with a heater. Animals were allowed to swim freely to find the hidden goal platform (1\u2009cm below the water surface) in order to escape from the water. Each animal was tested four times each day with a 5-min intertrial interval. For each trial, the animal was randomly placed at one of four starting positions (north, east, south, west). MWM performance was recorded using a computerized video tracking system (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). The latency to find the platform, total distance swum to reach the goal platform, and swim speed were calculated for each trial. Upon finding the platform, the rat was left there for 30\u2009sec before being removed from the maze and placed in a warm cage to dry. Animals that did not find the platform after 120\u2009sec were placed on the platform for 30\u2009sec and then removed from the maze. During the probe trial, at 24\u2009h after the last day of latency training, the platform was removed from the tank. The animal was placed in the quadrant where the platform was placed before facing the wall and given 60\u2009sec to swim in the pool. Using the video tracking system, the time spent in the goal platform quadrant and the average proximity to the goal location were recorded.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe data generated were analyzed using SPSS software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). For cell quantification, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a post-hoc Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) test or the Student's\nt\n-test with an applied Bonferroni's correction for multiple groups utilized, with\np\nvalues less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. For MWM data analysis, the data were analyzed using a split-plot ANOVA [\nTreatment\u00d7Day\n] comparing effect of group on goal latency. A Fisher's LSD test was performed to allow for pair-wise group contrasts. Swim speed was also analyzed using a one-way ANOVA. Data are presented as mean\u00b1standard error of the mean (SEM) in all figures."

    "Methods": "Animals\nSixty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) were housed in standard steel-wire mesh cages and maintained in a controlled environment with ambient temperature set at 21\u00b11\u00b0C and lights set on a 12/12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at 7:00\nam\n). Standard rat chow and water were available\nad libitum\n. Rats were allowed to acclimate to the colony for 1 week before commencing experimental procedures, which were carried out during the light portion of the cycle and were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at the University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, PA). Every attempt was made to limit the number of animals used and minimize discomfort.\n\nSurgery\nRats weighing 300\u2013325\u2009g on the day of surgery underwent surgical anesthesia, which was induced and maintained with inspired concentrations of 4% and 2% isoflurane, respectively, in a 2:1 ratio of N\n2\nO/O\n2\n. After endotracheal intubation, rats were secured in a stereotaxic frame, ventilated mechanically, and temperature was maintained at 37\u00b10.5\u00b0C with a heating blanket. Employing aseptic procedures, a mid-line scalp incision was made, the skin and fascia were reflected to expose the skull, and a craniectomy (6-mm in diameter) was made in the right hemisphere (encompassing bregma and lambda, and between the sagittal suture and the coronal ridge) with a handheld trephine. The bone flap was removed and the craniectomy was enlarged further with rongeurs. Subsequently, the impacting rod was extended and the impact tip (6\u2009mm, flat) was centered and lowered until it touched the dura mater, then the rod was retracted and the impact tip was advanced 2.8\u2009mm further to produce a brain injury of moderate severity (2.8-mm tissue deformation at 4\u2009m/sec). Immediately after the CCI, anesthesia was discontinued, the incision was sutured, and then rats were extubated and assessed for acute neurological outcome. Sham rats underwent similar surgical procedures, but were not subjected to the impact.\n\nAcute neurological evaluation\nAfter termination of anesthesia, hindlimb reflexive ability was assessed by gently squeezing the rats' paw every 5\u2009sec and recording the time to elicit a withdrawal response. Return of the righting reflex was also determined as the time required for a rat to turn from the supine to prone position. These natural reflexive responses are sensitive indicators of injury severity and anesthetic effects.\n17\u201320\n\nDrug administration\nAfter surgery, rats were randomly distributed among four TBI (\nn\n=10 per group) and four sham (\nn\n=5 per group) groups and provided HAL (0.5\u2009mg/kg), RISP (0.45\u2009mg/kg), BRO (5.0\u2009mg/kg), or vehicle (VEH; 1.0\u2009mL/kg). HAL (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), RISP (Research Diagnostics, Flanders, NJ), and BRO (Tocris Cookson, Inc., Ballwin, MO) were prepared daily by dissolving in 1:1 dimethyl sulfoxide/saline, which also served as the VEH. The doses of HAL and RISP were chosen because they were reported to be comparable to those used clinically to control psychosis\n21\nand have been used in several TBI studies.\n14\u201316\nThe dose of BRO was chosen based on previous studies revealing significant benefits.\n22\n,\n23\nTreatments began 24\u2009h after CCI or sham surgery and were provided intraperitoneally (i.p.) once-daily for 19 days. HAL and RISP were provided\nafter\nthe daily behavioral assessments to circumvent sedative effects that may confound the results. BRO was provided 15\u2009min before daily behavioral assessments because this paradigm has been shown to confer cognitive and neural protection after TBI.\n22\n,\n23\n\nMotor performance: beam-balance and beam-walk\nMotor function was evaluated using the well-validated beam-balance (BB) and beam-walk (BW) tasks.\n22\u201325\nThe BB task consists of placing the rat on an elevated (90-cm height from floor) narrow wooden beam (1.5\u2009cm wide) and recording the duration it remains on it for a maximum of 60\u2009sec. The BW task, a modified version of that originally devised by Feeney and colleagues\n9\nand used extensively in our laboratory\n22\u201325\nas well as those of others,\n26\n,\n27\nconsists of recording the time to traverse an elevated (90\u2009cm) narrow wooden beam (2.5 wide, 100\u2009cm long) and enter a darkened goal box at the opposite end to escape bright light and high-decibel white noise. All rats were trained to perform the tasks without errors (i.e., maintain their balance for 60\u2009sec and traverse the beam in under 5\u2009sec) preceding TBI or sham injury. A baseline performance assessment was taken on the day of surgery. Testing consisted of providing three trials (60\u2009sec of allotted time with a 30-sec intertrial interval) per day on each task and took place on postoperative days 1\u20135 while treatments were ongoing and again at postoperative days 48 and 108 (i.e., 1 and 3 months after the withdrawal of treatments). The average daily scores for each subject were used in the statistical analyses.\n\nCognitive function (acquisition of spatial learning and memory)\nA MWM task\n28\nthat is sensitive to cognitive function after TBI\n22\u201325\n,\n29\n,\n30\nwas used to compare acquisition of spatial learning among the treatment groups. The maze consisted of a plastic pool (180\u2009cm diameter; 60\u2009cm height) filled with water (26\u00b11\u00b0C) to a depth of 28\u2009cm and was situated in a room with salient visual cues that remained constant throughout the study. The platform was a clear Plexiglas stand (10\u2009cm diameter, 26\u2009cm high) and was positioned 26\u2009cm from the maze wall in the southwest quadrant of the maze and held constant throughout the study. Acquisition of spatial learning began on postoperative day 14 and consisted initially of providing a block of four daily trials (120\u2009sec maximum, 4-min intertrial interval) for 5 consecutive days (days 14\u201318 postsurgery) to locate the platform when it was submerged 2\u2009cm below the water surface (i.e., invisible to the rat). For each daily block of trials, rats were placed in the pool facing the wall at each of the four possible start locations (north, south, east, and west) in a randomized manner. Each trial lasted until the rat climbed onto the platform or until 120\u2009sec had elapsed, whichever occurred first. All rats were required to remain on the platform for 30\u2009sec before being placed in a heated incubator between trials (4-min intertrial interval). To assess the long-term cognitive effects of a 19-day treatment regimen, a similar daily block of trials was provided at 48 and 108 days postsurgery. Memory retention was assessed on day 19 (i.e., 1 day after the final acquisition training session while treatments were ongoing) and again on days 49 and 109 after cessation of treatments. During these testing phases, the platform was removed from the pool and rats were placed in the maze from the location point most distal to the quadrant where the platform was previously situated (i.e., \u201ctarget quadrant\u201d) and allowed to freely explore the pool for 30\u2009sec. The percent time spent in the target quadrant was used in the statistical analysis. The behavior data were obtained using a spontaneous motor activity recording and tracking system (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA), which, in addition to determining time to the platform, also calculates path length and swim speed.\n\nHistology: Cortical lesion volume\nAfter the last behavioral assessment (i.e., postoperative day 109), rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50\u2009mg/kg i.p.) and then perfused transcardially with heparinized 0.1\u2009M phosphate-buffered saline (200\u2009mL; pH 7.4), followed by 10% buffered formalin (300\u2009mL). Brains were extracted, postfixed in 10% buffered formalin for 1 week, dehydrated with alcohols, and embedded in paraffin. Coronal sections (7\u2009\u03bcm thick) were cut at 1-mm intervals through the lesion on a rotary microtome and mounted on gelatin-coated glass microscope slides. After drying at room temperature, sections were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated, and stained with cresyl violet. Cortical lesion volumes (mm\n3\n) were assessed by an observer blinded to experimental conditions using a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The area of the lesion (mm\n2\n) was first calculated by outlining the inferred area of missing cortical tissue for each section (typically 5\u20137; Nikon NIS-Elements AR 3.22.14 software; Nikon Corp, Tokyo, Japan) and then by summing the lesions obtained, as previously reported.\n18\u201320\n,\n24\n\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical analyses were performed on data collected by observers blinded to treatment conditions using StatView 5.0.1 software (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA). Motor and cognitive data were analyzed by repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Acute neurological data, probe trials, swim speed, and histological findings were analyzed by one-factor ANOVAs. When the ANOVA showed a significant effect, Bonferroni's/Dunn's post-hoc test was utilized to determine specific group differences. Results are expressed as the mean\u00b1standard error of the mean (SEM) and were considered significant when\np\nvalues were \u22640.05 for overall ANOVAs and 0.005 for post-hoc analyses, as dictated by Bonferroni's/Dunn's statistic after correcting for multiple comparisons."

    "Methods": "The effects of hypothermia therapy for patients with severe TBI based on the TCDB CT classification were examined using the results of a hypothermia study conducted from December 2002 to September 2008 in Japan.10The study was designed as a multicenter randomized controlled trial with prospective analyses and blinded assessment of neurological outcomes. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of each participating hospital, and the trial was registered at the University Hospital Medical Information Network site (UMIN-CTR, No. C000000231) in Japan, and at the National Institutes of Health site (Clinical Trials. Gov, Identifier NCT00134472) in the United States. A randomization list was automatically generated by the UMIN computer system to allocate patients in a 2:1 ratio to receive therapeutic hypothermia (32.0\u00b0C \u2013 34.0\u00b0C) or fever control (35.5\u00b0C\u201337.0\u00b0C). The temperature of the control group was set to 35.5\u00b0\u201337.0\u00b0C for an ethical reason because mild therapeutic hypothermia was reported to be effective in adult cardiac arrest/resuscitated patients at the time the trial was designed.13,14\n\nInclusion criteria were age 15\u201369 years for both sexes, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 4\u20138, and initiation of cooling within 2\u2009h after onset of TBI. After written informed consent was obtained from the patient's legally authorized representative, the patient was allocated to therapeutic hypothermia or fever control based on the randomization list. An internet-based enrollment system managed by UMIN enabled instant randomization on admission at each participating site. Private information on the patient was secured. If informed consent could not be obtained within 2\u2009h of admission, the consent policy was waived.\n\nIn this trial, 150 patients with severe TBI received therapeutic hypothermia or fever control after written informed consent was obtained from legally authorized representatives. After enrollment, informed consent could not be obtained for two patients, seven patients had unstable vital signs before temperature management, and neurological outcomes could not be assessed at 6 months in six patients. Therefore, per-protocol analyses were performed in 135 patients (88 treated with therapeutic hypothermia and 47 with fever control).\n\nCore body temperature was measured by a thermistor coupled to an internal jugular venous catheter. If the catheter could not be inserted, body temperature was measured at another site selected in the following order: pulmonary artery, bladder, rectum, and tympanic membrane. An arterial catheter and an intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring probe were inserted to maintain hemodynamic status and ICP at the following levels: mean arterial pressure (MAP) >80\u2009mm Hg, ICP <20\u2009mm Hg, and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) >60\u2009mm Hg.15The partial pressures of arterial oxygen (PaO2) and carbon dioxide (PaCO2) were maintained at >100\u2009mm Hg and 30\u201340\u2009mm Hg, respectively. If ICP was >20\u2009mm Hg, any treatment recommended by the Japanese guidelines was applied, including hyperventilation (>30\u2009mm Hg), decompressive craniectomy, mannitol/glycerol, and/or a bolus infusion of barbiturates.15\n\nCooling was initiated within 2\u2009h after onset of TBI. Cooling blankets, rapid cold fluid infusion (up to 1000\u2009mL saline, human plasma products, or dextrose-free plasma expanders), and/or cold gastric lavage were used during the induction phase in both groups. The goal in each group was to achieve the target temperature within 6\u2009h after onset of TBI and maintain this temperature for at least 72\u2009h, mainly using surface cooling blankets. The patient was rewarmed at a rate of <1\u00b0C/day. After rewarming, core body temperature was kept at <38.0\u00b0C until day 7 after onset of TBI. The sedation protocol used either midazolam (0.2\u2009mg/kg/h) and nonnarcotic analgesics, or neuroleptanalgesia (droperidol 25\u2009\u03bcg/kg/h and fentanyl 1\u03bcg/kg/h). Vecuronium (0.05\u2009mg/kg/h) or pancuronium (0.05\u2009mg/kg/h) was also used during the body temperature-control phase, as needed.\n\nAll patients were treated based on the guidelines for management of severe TBI of the Japan Society of Neurotraumatology.15All data, except CT data, were transmitted to the UMIN center via an internet-based system. CT on admission was classified based on the TCDB classification.12Hemodynamic data were recorded on days 0, 1, and 3, and 1 day after rewarming (defined as the day on which the core body temperature reached 36\u00b0C). The primary outcome was the Glasgow Outcome Scale at 6 months after injury. Good recovery and moderate disability were designated as favorable outcomes.\n\nHemodynamic parameters, ICP, CPP, favorable outcome rate, and mortality were compared between the two groups according to CT classification. The primary outcome in young patients (\u226450 years) was also examined. Continuous variables were analyzed by the Studentttest and Mann-WhitneyUtest, as appropriate. Categorical variables were analyzed by the chi-square test. Apvalue of\u22640.05 was deemed significant in all analyses."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nPatients admitted to the Tampere University Hospital emergency room between January 2010 to May 2012 for mTBI (\nn\n=27) or ankle injury (controls,\nn\n=17) were recruited. The groups were matched in age, sex, and level of education. (mTBI: 12 females, 15 males, mean age 41 years, mean education 14.5 years; controls: 11 females, 6 males, mean age 40 years, mean education 15.8 years). The inclusion criteria for mTBI used in this study were those of the World Health Organization Center Force on mTBI.\n28\nThese diagnostic criteria for MTBI include: 1) biomechanical force applied to the head resulting in loss or alteration of consciousness, confusion, and/or post-traumatic amnesia (PTA); 2) loss of consciousness if present for <30\u2009min, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score 13\u201315 after 30\u2009min following injury; and 3) if PTA, duration <24\u2009h. Exclusion criteria included previous psychiatric or neurological disorder or substance abuse. All of the patients provided a written informed consent according to the declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Tampere University Hospital.\nThe average time from the injury to the research visit including the electroencephalogram (EEG) recording, computer-based emotional NoGo task, and the questionnaires, was 20.4 months (range 9\u201337 months) post-injury.\n\nQuestionnaries\nAll of the participants filled in questionnaires including demographic information, Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function Adult version (BRIEF-A), Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire, and Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI). The BRIEF-A assesses subjective view of everyday behaviors associated with executive functioning. The Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPCSQ)\n29\nlists the symptoms most commonly associated with brain injuries; for example, headache, nausea, dizziness and depression. BDI\n30\nis a 21 question inventory developed for assessment of possible depressive symptoms and their severity.\n\nModified executive reaction time (RT) test\nA computer-based Go-NoGo visual discrimination paradigm used in this study was modified from an executive RT test that has been previously shown to detect subtle executive impairment after mild brain injury,\n24\nas well as alterations in emotion\u2013attention interaction caused by deep brain stimulation in epilepsy patients.\n17\nThe executive RT test requires multiple executive functions to be engaged simultaneously, such as inhibition, shifting, emotional control, and working memory. In the modified executive RT test used in this study, emotional stimuli served as task-irrelevant distractors as well as task-relevant Go or NoGo signals (\nFig. 1\n). This allows for investigating the capture of attentional resources by emotional stimuli when they are competing with the task demands (distractors) as well as when they are central to the task demands (signals).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSchematic presentation of the modified executive reaction time (RT) test. Example of two trials. Subjects were instructed to respond to the orientation of a triangle with a button press if a Go signal was presented after the triangle, and to withhold from responding if a NoGo signal was presented. There were four different block types with identical sets of trials presented in random order, but with different stimuli (spider, flower, green, red) serving as Go and NoGo signals. In the emotion relevant condition, either a spider was a Go-signal and a flower was a NoGo signal or vice versa. In the emotionally irrelevant condition, one of the colors (red or green) was a Go signal and the other a NoGo signal, with emotional stimuli serving as task-irrelevant distractors. Therefore, with identical stimuli presented in different block types with the only difference being stimulus relevance to the task, mere physical properties of the stimuli do not explain different effects in emotionally relevant and irrelevant conditions. Similarly, with emotional (spider) and emotionally neutral stimuli (flower) constructed from the same line components, emotional effects observed in this study cannot be explained by any lower level visual attributes. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nWe used black line drawings forming an image of a spider (emotional distractor/signal) as threat-related emotional stimuli, and emotionally neutral control stimuli that were constructed from identical line components rearranged in a different configuration forming an image of a flower (neutral distractor/signal). Line drawings were used in order to control for other visual features such as color, brightness, contrast, spatial frequency, and complexity. These stimuli have been previously shown to evoke emotion-related behavioral and electrophysiological responses both in healthy subjects\n34\nand in patient populations.\n31\nThe subjects were seated in front of a computer screen at a distance of 1\u2009m. A computer program (Presentation, Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc.) presented the paradigm and collected the response data. The paradigm consisted of upright- and downward-facing triangles presented for 150\u2009msec in a random order. There were two different kinds of blocks: one where emotional stimuli were relevant and one where they were irrelevant. In half of the blocks where emotion stimuli were relevant, the spider signified a Go signal and the flower a NoGo signal. In half of the blocks this rule was reversed. When emotional stimuli were task-irrelevant distractors, the color (red or green) on the background of the spider or flower served as the Go or NoGo signal. Subjects had to flexibly shift between these four different rules for responding, keep the response rule in working memory, and inhibit responding according to the previous rule. After a Go signal, the subjects had to press a button with their index finger if the triangle had been facing downwards and with their middle finger if the triangle had been facing upwards. Subjects had to hold the orientation of the triangle in their working memory, as the triangle had already disappeared from the screen when a Go signal appeared. The subjects were instructed to answer as fast and accurately as possible. One block consisted of 64 trials, and the subjects completed a total of 16 blocks: four of each different block type. The block type and, therefore, the rule for answering, changed between every block. Response hands were counterbalanced.\n\nEEG recording and processing\nEEG was recorded with 64 channel actiCAP Ag/AgCl electrodes (Gilching, Germany). EEG was digitized with a 512\u2009Hz sampling rate. The impedance of the electrodes was below 5\u2009k\u03a9. The ERP analysis was conducted with Brain Vision Analyzer 2 (Brain Products, Gilching, Germany). The EEG data were referenced offline to linked mastoids (TP9 and TP10) and band-pass filtered (0.5\u201330\u2009Hz; 24\u2009dB/octave). Eye movements were corrected based on a semiautomatic independent component analysis. Epochs with amplitudes >\u00b1100\u2009\u03bcV were rejected. Single trials from 200\u2009msec pre- to 1800\u2009msec post-stimulus (triangle) presentation were averaged for each condition.\n\nBehavioral analysis\nMean values of RT and number of errors were measured for the different conditions and for each subject. There were three different error types: incorrect button presses, commission errors, and missed responses. An incorrect response indicated an incorrect button press to the orientation of the triangle during a Go trial. Incorrect error is thought to reflect lapse in working memory or attention performance. A commission error indicated a failure in withholding from responding on a NoGo trial. A commission error is thought to reflect a failure in response inhibition. A miss indicated failure to respond during a Go trial within a given time. Misses reflected inattention and/or inability to initiate a response within the allowed time.\n\nERP analysis\nERPs were averaged according to valence of the emotional stimuli (threat [NEG] or neutral [NEU]), relevance of the emotional stimuli for the task (relevant [R] or not relevant [NR]) and the response signal (Go or NoGo). With visual inspection of the grand average waveforms, we identified N2 and P3 peaks (see\nFig. 2\n). The emotion relevant condition led to longer reaction times and delayed N2 and P3 ERP peaks in comparison with the emotion irrelevant condition. This was probably because the line drawing discrimination required in the emotion relevant condition was a harder task than the color discrimination required in the emotion irrelevant condition. Therefore, slightly different time windows for ERP peak detection were used for the emotion relevant and irrelevant conditions. The time windows were expressed from the onset of the trial; that is, from the onset of the triangle presentation. The onset of the Go-NoGo signal/Emotional stimuli was at 300\u2009msec from the trial onset. The time windows used for peak detection were 550\u2013700\u2009msec (R), 500\u2013650\u2009msec (NR) for N2 and 700\u2013800\u2009msec (R), 650\u2013750 (NR) for P3. We used N2-P3 peak-to-peak amplitude as a general index of attentional and executive processing resource allocation. Peak-to-peak amplitude measurement allows for subtracting the effect of slow positive or negative ERP deflections caused by other cognitive processes being concurrent with N2 and P3 peaks, thus allowing for a better estimate of overall resource allocation than a single peak measurement. We further used central N2 and parietal P3 peak amplitudes as indexes of cognitive control and attentional resources, correspondingly. The central region was chosen for investigating the anterior frontocentral N2, because the N2 peak amplitude maxima was centrally located.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nGreater attention capture by task-relevant emotional stimuli in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Threat-related Go signals evoked greater N2-P3 amplitude than neutral signals in the mTBI group than in the control group. Parietal P3 showed a trend, and central N2 showed a significant threat-related enhancement in the mTBI group. Grand average event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to emotionally relevant Go trials are illustrated from nine electrodes that were used to form frontal (F3, Fz, F4), central (C3, Cz, C4), and parietal (P3, Pz, P4) regions of interest for statistical analysis. The bottom plots from left to right illustrate 1) average N2-P3 peak-to-peak amplitudes across all regions of interest (frontal, central, parietal); 2) central N2 peak; and 3) parietal P3 peak amplitudes for mTBI and control groups in response to emotional (NEG) and emotionally neutral (NEU) control stimuli. Error bars indicate standard error. **\np\n<0.001.\nWe further explored the time course of the ERPs by dividing the interval between 550 and 850\u2009msec into 50\u2009msec time windows. The mean amplitude in each time window was extracted, and these data were used for statistical analysis. Identification of peaks and computation of mean amplitudes were performed in MATLAB 12 (Math Works Inc., Natick, MA).\n\nStatistical analysis\nSPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for statistical analysis. Normal distribution of the variables was tested statistically with the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. Repeated measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) was performed on RTs, and different error types with emotion (threat, neutral) and task relevance of the symbolic stimuli (relevant, irrelevant) as within-subject factors and group as the between-subject factor (control, mTBI).\nThe average scores from questionnaires for the ankle and mTBI groups were compared with the Mann\u2013Whitney\nU\ntest. For RPCSQ scores, the total symptom score and separate scores for different kinds of symptoms were compared with three different categories: somatic, emotional, and cognitive symptoms.\nN2-P3 peak-to-peak amplitude was used as a general measure of resource allocation. For statistical assessment of the ERPs, RM-ANOVA was performed to test for group differences in N2-P3 amplitude separately for the Go and NoGo conditions with emotion (threat, neutral), task relevance of the emotional stimuli (relevant, irrelevant), and EEG brain region (frontal, central, parietal) as within-subject factors, and group (control, mTBI) as the between-subject factor. To reduce the number of statistical comparisons and to improve signal-to-noise ratio, we clustered electrodes over regions of interest: frontal (F3, Fz, F4), central (C3, C4, Cz), and parietal (P3, Pz, P4) areas. Because parietal P3 is especially implicated in attentional allocation,\n25\nand frontal N2 is implicated in control processes,\n32\nwe conducted a separate RM-ANOVA analysis for P3 peak amplitude in the parietal region and N2 peak amplitude in the frontal region with emotion (threat, neutral) and task relevance of the symbolic stimuli (relevant, irrelevant) as within-subject factors, and group (control, mTBI) as the between-subject factor."

    "Methods": "Study population\nRecruitment of subjects was part of the TRACK-TBI (\nT\nransforming\nR\nesearch\na\nnd\nC\nlinical\nK\nnowledge in\nT\nraumatic\nB\nrain\nI\nnjury) Pilot Study, a National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke\u2013funded, multi-center, prospective collaboration among three U.S. level 1 trauma centers enrolling acute TBI patients (University of Pittsburgh Medical Center [UPMC]; University Medical Center Brackenridge [UMCB]; and University of California, San Francisco [UCSF]) and one rehabilitation center (Mount Sinai Rehabilitation Center) enrolling late-presenting TBI patients to develop, test, and refine TBI common data elements (TBI-CDEs) for research across four major domains: demographics, neuroimaging, biomarkers, and outcome measures.\n7\nThe TBI population under investigation spanned the entire injury spectrum, from severe to mild. Both patients with negative imaging and those discharged from the emergency department (ED) are also included in the total population. Institutional review boards of participating centers approved all study protocols. All participants or their legal authorized representatives gave written informed consent. At follow-up, participants previously consented by legal authorized representative, if neurologically improved to be cognizant, were consented for continuation in the study.\nTo be eligible for this analysis, patients must have presented to an ED within 24\u2009h of their injury and had a positive clinical screen for acute TBI necessitating a noncontrast head CT according to American College of Emergency Physicians/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ACEP/CDC) evidence-based joint practice guidelines.\n8\nThese guidelines represent an amalgam of the Canadian CT Head Rule and the New Orleans Criteria (Haydel, Indications for computed tomography in patients with minor head injury; Stiell, The Canadian CT Head Rule for patients with minor head injury). GCS score was assessed by a neurosurgeon at admission and was reconfirmed by study personnel at the time of biomarker collection. TBI severity was broadly defined by GCS, with mild between 13 and 15, moderate between 9 and 12, and severe between 3 and 8. Patients were excluded if they were younger than 16 or greater than 95 years of age, suffered penetrating head injury, or had a premorbid neurologic condition.\n\nSample collection and measurement of glial fibrillary acidic protein and its breakdown products\nData from the three level 1 trauma centers were used for this analysis. Serum samples were collected within 24\u2009h of injury and were dated and time stamped to compare with time of injury. The TBI-CDE Biospecimens and Biomarkers Working Group Guidelines for sample preparation were followed.\n9\nSamples were centrifuged and serum aliquots stored at \u221280\u00b0C for future batch processing. UPMC and UMCB batch-shipped samples, overnight on dry ice, to UCSF. All deidentified samples were then stored with a unique study number specific to site and subject. A central database was maintained by the coordinating center (UCSF) with each site entering site-specific data for final statistical reporting. Blinded sample analysis occurred in a single laboratory (Banyan Biomarkers, Alachua, FL) using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to GFAP-BDP. The GFAP ELISA utilized a proprietary mouse monoclonal antibody for solid-phase immobilization, and a proprietary polyclonal rabbit antibody for detection.\n10\n,\n11\nTesting procedure and detection of GFAP was carried out as previously described.\n6\nBoth whole GFAP molecules as well as GFAP-BDPs are detected by the assay, potentially resulting in a more complete measure of overall GFAP released into circulation. All samples were analyzed in duplicate concomitantly with calibrators prepared in compatible matrix, as described previously.\n6\nFrom high concentration to low, the previously reported intraassay coefficient of variance for the ELISA is 4.3\u20137.8% and the interassay coefficient of variance is 7.8\u201314.3%. The estimated limit of detection for GFAP is \u223c0.01\u2009ng/mL.\n11\n\nEvaluation of endpoints\nAll patients underwent CT imaging of the brain at the time of initial presentation to the ED. Patients were offered a follow-up, out-patient MRI upon enrollment in the TRACK-TBI study. The MRI was on a voluntary, opt-in basis to be performed 1\u20132 weeks postinjury. Radiographic images were deidentified, uploaded to a central imaging database, and reviewed by a blinded central reader. Imaging features were extracted and entered into the TRACK-TBI database. Each patient's head CT and magnetic resonance image (MRI) were characterized using the recommendations of the TBI-CDE Neuroimaging Working Group regarding specific radiologic features, data definitions needed to characterize injuries, and best practices needed to optimize and harmonize imaging data acquisition for TBI research during data collection.\n12\n,\n13\nSpecifically, the presence of cisternal effacement, mid-line shift, epidural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intraventricular hemorrhage were recorded to determine the Rotterdam score for all scans (assessment of TBI severity based on noncontrast head CT). The presence of any intracranial abnormalities on MRI was considered a positive scan. Imaging studies were performed at the discretion of each study site using their standard equipment and protocols.\nThe primary endpoint for analysis was intracranial injury, as identified on CT scan at time of presentation. Secondary endpoints included severity of intracranial injury, as measured by the Rotterdam score, and presence of intracranial injury, as identified by delayed MRI.\n\nStatistical analysis\nContinuous demographic characteristics were assessed for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov's test; normally distributed data were analyzed by\nt\n-test, whereas the remainders were compared using the Wilcoxon's rank-sum test. Categorical data were analyzed by Pearson's chi-squared or Fisher's exact test. Differences between groups in multi-level ordinal measurements (i.e., Rotterdam score, GCS, and Glasgow Outcome Scale) were tested using Kruskal-Wallis' test. Univariable regression analysis was performed to assess the association between GFAP-BDP level and radiographic presence of intracranial injury. Multi-variate regression models were later built to evaluate the predictive capabilities GFAP-BDP after adjustment for known factors associated with severity of intracranial injury (age, pupillary reactivity, GCS, and Injury Severity Score [ISS]). The ability of GFAP-BDP to predict severity of intracranial injury was assessed using ordered logistic regression modeling.\nThe ability of GFAP-BDP to predict the presence of intracranial injury was analyzed apropos of accuracy, discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility. Discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Using current statistical consensus, AUCs of 0.8\u20130.9 are considered very good, 0.7\u20130.8 as adequate, and below 0.7 as poor. Calibration was tested with the Hosmer-Lemeshow's goodness-of-fit test. Cut-off values for GFAP-BDP were assessed both for the highest accuracy and for the highest specificity, specifically in the mild to moderate injury groups. Values were determined utilizing ROC curves and AUC and Brier scores were calculated. Clinical utility was evaluated by decision curve analysis.\n14\nStatistical significance was set at\np\n<0.05. All data were analyzed using STATA statistical software (12; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX)."

    "Methods": "A literature search of PubMed\u00ae, MEDLINE\u00ae, and the Cochrane Database from 1966 to October 2013 was conducted using the MESH search terms athletes, concussion, sports, sports-related, traumatic brain injury, head injury, and biomarkers. Other terms also searched included biochemical markers, neuronal/glial/axonal injury, traumatic intracranial lesions, and expansions of these terms to match synonyms, subterms, or derivatives. These terms were searched in all fields of publication (e.g., title, abstract, and keyword). The search was limited to the English-language articles, clinical \u201chuman\u201d studies, and studies that included athletes participating in organized sports. Studies were included if they recruited athletes participating in organized sports who experienced concussion or head injury during a sports-related activity and had brain injury biofluid biomarkers measured. Articles that did not include athletes or did not measure brain-related biofluid biomarkers as a primary focus were excluded. In addition, the bibliographies and reference lists of all articles and all review articles were evaluated for other potentially relevant articles. Acceptable study designs included experimental studies, observational studies, and case-control studies. Review articles, opinion papers, and editorials were excluded. The abstracts of the publications were screened for relevance, and in case of uncertainty regarding the inclusion, the entire text of the article was read. Studies were defined as prospective or retrospective according to whether the method of data collection and the endpoints were defined before patient enrollment began. The full texts of the articles were then pooled and reviewed by two different authors to identify articles that met inclusion criteria. Once the relevant articles were selected, they were reviewed using a standard review form. The review forms allowed the reviewers to objectively assess the content of each article in a consistent fashion. A composite evidentiary table was then constructed. The evidentiary table included the internal identification number, design type, study methods, focus of the article, sample size, TBI severity, biofluid source, collection schedule, clinical variables assessed, outcome measures, results, and conclusions."

    "Methods": "LFP brain injury\nAll surgical procedures and experiments were performed in accordance with protocols and guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Maryland. All animals were single-housed in the animal facility with\nad libitum\naccess to food and water. Adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (310\u2013330\u2009g) were anesthetized using isoflurane (induction: 4%, maintenance: 2\u20132.5%; supply gas: 70% compressed air+30% oxygen). A sharp dissection was made followed by craniotomy (4\u2009mm) located midway between lambda and bregma sutures over the left parietal cortex. A luer-loc adaptor was cemented over the craniotomy site and attached to our custom-built microprocessor-driven LFP device, which when triggered produced a pressure pulse causing a deformation of the underlying brain. The rats underwent moderate LFP brain injury (1.9\u20132.2 atmospheres) or sham operation following approved experimental guidelines, as described previously.\n23\n,\n24\nImplantation of radiotelemetry transmitter\nImmediately after the injury, a radiotelemetry transmitter (F40-EET, Data Science International, St. Paul, MN) was subcutaneously implanted on the left side of the abdominal region of the rats. A 1-inch parasagittal incision was made starting at the caudal aspect of the rib cage and proceeding toward the tail. Using blunt scissors, directed downward away from the incision, a subcutaneous pocket was made for the transmitter. The leads from the transmitter were fed through the trochar to the skull. After the implantation of the transmitter, the insulated electroencephalogram (EEG) leads (Data Science International) were secured around the screws (1.5\u2009mm anterior and 1.0\u2009mm left of the bregma; 0.7\u2009mm anterior and 1.0\u2009mm right of lambda), and the leads were secured with dental cement avoiding the craniotomy.\nImplantation of electromyogram (EMG) electrodes\nBiopotential EMG leads were placed in contact with the dorsal muscles of the neck to monitor motor activity. The lead wires were placed in direct contact with the muscle 1\u20132\u2009mm apart along the same bundle of cervical trapezius muscles in the dorsal region of the neck. A 21-gauge needle was inserted through approximately 3\u2009mm of the muscle tissue. A bare lead wire was passed into the lumen of the needle, the needle was withdrawn, and the lead wire was left embedded in the muscle. A suture tie was placed securely around the insulation of both leads. The incision was closed with surgical staples.\n\nEEG and EMG analysis\nAcquisition of EEG and EMG waveforms for recording of sleep patterns\nSleep-wake behavior assessment was performed on post-injury days (PIDs) 6, 19, and 29, so as not to interfere with behavioral assessments (\nFig. 1\n). The complete light and dark phase was recorded starting at 8\npm\nand ending at 8\nam\non the following days 7, 20, and 30. The implanted telemetry device transmitted to a plate receiver (RPCI, Data Sciences International) located under the home cage of each individually housed animal. All recordings were performed in a designated room shielded from noise or other background disturbances. EEG and EMG waveform data were acquired using the Dataquest ART 4.0 software (DSI, St. Paul MN) to set a continuous sampling mode of 500\u2009Hz. The analog signal was converted to a digital signal and stored for analysis.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nBehavioral assessment.

Mean\u00b1SEM;\nn\n=8\u201311/group.\nSleep scoring and data analysis\nAll animals were scored manually using NeuroScore software (Data Sciences International) into 10-sec epochs. Power bands were defined as delta (0.5\u20134\u2009Hz), theta (4\u20138\u2009Hz), alpha (8\u201312\u2009Hz), sigma (12\u201316\u2009Hz), and beta (16\u201324\u2009Hz).\nLight and dark phases were separated into 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12\u2009h bins to further investigate changes in sleep-wake activity. Zeitberger time (ZT) was used throughout this study where ZT=0 corresponds to 8\nam\n(lights on) and ZT=12 corresponds to 8\npm\n(lights off). Total time, average bout length, and number of bouts were calculated for each bin. Customized software developed under MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA) was used to perform all sleep-wake state permutations, blind the investigator from animal group, and calculate power band analysis.\nWakefulness was defined as low amplitude (<150\u2009\u03bcV), high frequency EEG combined with high amplitude EMG RMS (>10\u2009\u03bcV). NREM was defined as having a high amplitude (>120\u2009\u03bcV), low frequency EEG in the form of the theta-delta ratio between 0.5 and 1, combined with low EMG tone (<10\u2009\u03bcV). REM was defined as low amplitude (<150\u2009\u03bcV), high frequency EEG in the form of the theta-delta ratio (>1) combined with muscle atonia (low EMG RMS; <10\u2009\u03bcV) with occasional muscle twitches.\n\nBehavioral assessment\nNovel object recognition for retention memory function\nThe novel object recognition (NOR) test (sham:\nn\n=8; LFP:\nn\n=11) was used to assess retention or intact memory function on PID 21. An open field (40\u2009cm\u00d720\u2009cm\u00d760\u2009cm) with two adjacently located imaginary circular zones was used, as previously designed.\n24\n,\n25\nThe zones were equally spaced from the sides in the center of the square and designated as \u201cold object\u201d and \u201cnovel object\u201d zones using the AnyMaze video tracking system (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL). The old object used was square-shaped, whereas the novel object was L-shaped, assembled by building blocks from LEGO\n\u00ae\ntoys, and were clearly distinct in shape and appearance.\nOn PID 20, all animals were placed in the open field without objects for 5\u2009min each for habituation. Two 5-min trials were performed on PID 21: the first (training) trial with two old objects in both zones and the second (testing) phase with one old object and one novel object present in the respective zones of the open field, with an intertrial interval of 60\u2009min. The time spent in novel and old object zones was assessed manually as well as by using AnyMaze software. Retention memory was determined by \u201cDiscrimination Index\u201d (D.I.) for the second trial that was calculated as follows\n24\n,\n25\n:\n% D.I.=Time spent in novel object zone\u00d7100.\n(Time spent in old object zone+Time spent in novel object zone)\nPassive avoidance test for fear-based cognitive function\nThe passive avoidance test (sham:\nn\n=8; LFP:\nn\n=11) was used to evaluate nonspatial fear-based amygdala-dependent contextual and emotional memory on PIDs 23\u201324, as previously described\n24\nusing one-trial step-through PACS-30 passive avoidance apparatus (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) adjusted to an electric foot shock setting of 0.5\u2009mA for 3\u2009sec with a 24-h lag between training and testing. The cognitive impairment was assessed in terms of latency to the dark compartment in the testing phase.\nForced swim test for depressive-like symptoms\nThe forced swim test (sham:\nn\n=8; LFP:\nn\n=11) was used to evaluate depressive-like behavior.\n24\n,\n26\nOn PID 26, rats were individually forced to swim inside a vertical rectangular container, containing 30\u2009cm of water maintained at 24\u201325\u00b0C for a period of 6\u2009min. The total duration of immobility versus struggle was recorded manually using a timer.\n\nImmunocytochemistry\nTissue processing\nImmediately after the EEG and EMG recording on PID 29 and approximately 5\u2009h into the active phase, the rats were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with saline, followed by 4% buffered paraformaldehyde solution (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) containing 2.5% acrolein (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The brains were removed, post-fixed in paraformaldehyde for 24\u2009h and protected in 30% sucrose.\nBrains were serially cut in the coronal plane on a cryostat and stored in a cryoprotectant solution (ethylene glycol/glucose in phosphate buffer) at \u221220\u00b0C until processed.5 Free-floating sections were rinsed in potassium phosphate buffered saline to remove cryoprotectant, and the sections were then incubated for 30\u2009min in 0.5% sodium borohydride to neutralize the acrolein fixative. The sections were stained for ORX-A using rabbit anti-ORX-A primary immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody (1:20,000; Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Belmont, CA) for 48\u2009h followed by incubation with biotinylated antirabbit IgG antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and processed further as described previously.\nQuantification of ORX-A was performed by unbiased stereology using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope and Stereo Investigator software (MBF Biosciences, Williston, VT). A total of five anatomically matched sections of the hypothalamus were used for analysis. Sections analyzed were from a one-in-four series (adjacent sections were separated by 120\u2009\u03bcm) roughly between the bregma coordinates \u22122.8\u2009mm and \u22123.3\u2009mm, based on the Paxinos and Watson (1998) rat brain atlas. The lateral hypothalamus was defined by a 1200\u2009\u03bcm\u00d7600\u2009\u03bcm box with horizontal alignment at the most ventral portion of the fornix and vertical alignment at 600\u2009\u03bcm from either direction of the fornix for both hemispheres of the brain. The optical dissector had a size of 50\u2009\u03bcm\u00d750\u2009\u03bcm in the x- and y-axis, respectively, with a dissector height of 10\u2009\u03bcm and guard zone height of 4\u2009\u03bcm from the top of the section. Grid spacing of 400\u2009\u03bcm in the x-axis and 400\u2009\u03bcm in the y-axis was used.\nThe volume of the region of interest was measured using the Cavalieri estimator method with grid spacing of 150\u2009\u03bcm for the cortex. The estimated number of ORX-A\u2013positive neurons in each field was divided by the volume of the region of interest to obtain the cellular density expressed in counts/mm\n3\n.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe quantification of data was expressed as mean\u00b1standard error of the mean. Analysis of sleep-wake states was performed using repeated-measures one-way analysis of variance followed by multiple pairwise comparisons using the Student-Newman-Keuls\npost-hoc\ntest. The data for forced swim, passive avoidance test, and ORX-A expression were statistically analyzed by two-tailed unpaired Student\nt\ntest. The data for cognitive impairments in novel object recognition were analyzed by two-tailed Mann-Whitney\nU\nt\ntest. The functional and stereological data were analyzed using SigmaPlot 12 (Systat Software, San Jose, CA) or GraphPad Prism Version 4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). MATLAB (Mathworks) code created by Clauset and colleagues\n27\nwas used to determine the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of the cumulative distribution probability. A\np\n<0.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Data\nThe International Neurotrauma Research Organization in Vienna has been working to improve the outcome of patients with TBI in Austria and the broader European region for over 12 years. One of its most recent studies focused on improvements of outcome of patients with TBI through improved prehospital care. Within this prospective observational study, data on patients with TBI were collected in Austria during the period of 2009\u20132012 (INRO-PH data set). All patients with GCS score <=12 within 48\u2009h after the accident and/or Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) head >2 were included in the study. Data on demographic characteristics, injury type and severity, prehospital treatment, trauma room treatment, surgical procedures, computed tomography (CT) scans, intensive care unit (ICU)-based treatment (first 5 days) and outcome (at ICU discharge, hospital discharge and 6 months after injury) were recorded. The Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale was used to categorize the outcome at hospital discharge and at 6 months after injury.\nData were prospectively collected in 16 centers, and a total of 778 patients were enrolled. Of these, a subset of 445 patients was selected where data both on prehospital and admission assessments of the GCS motor score and pupillary reactivity was available. These patients were used for the analyses in this study.\n\nAssessment of neurological status\nPrehospital treatment within the studies was provided by emergency physicians or paramedics. The treatment protocol included rapid examination with documentation of vital signs (GCS score, pupillary status, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation). Rapid-sequence intubation, facilitated by hypnotics and relaxants, ventilation, treatment of hemorrhage, and fluid resuscitation, were done as appropriate. After admission, each patient was examined by a trauma team (anesthesiologists, trauma surgeons, and/or neurosurgeons, radiologists, and nurses), clinical status (GCS score, pupillary status, heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation) was documented again, and a CT scan was done. Both the GCS and pupillary reaction at admission were assessed by the anesthesiologist, who was primarily responsible for the monitoring of vital signs. Patients then underwent surgery as appropriate and/or were admitted to the ICU. Given that GCS score and pupillary reactivity were assessed in all patients twice (in the field, and at admission to the hospital), it was feasible to make comparisons of neurological status assessed at both time points.\n\nStatistical analyses\nThe GCS motor score and pupillary reactivity in field and at admission were compared using cross-tabulations. The differences in the distributions were tested with McNemar's test.\nTo evaluate the prognostic value, logistic regression models were fit using GCS motor score and pupillary reactivity assessed in field and at admission as single predictors and in different combinations, with 6-month mortality as the response variable.\nThe IMPACT core and IMPACT extended models\n4\nfor prediction of 6-month mortality were refit on data to further evaluate the predictive performance of both measures. GCS motor score and pupillary reactivity assessed in field and at admission were used in various combinations (along other predictors in the IMPACT core and extended models\n4\nthat remained unchanged) and performances were compared (see\nSupplementary Table 1\n). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated to evaluate the discriminative ability, and Nagelkerke's\nR\n2\nwas used as a measure of predictive ability. Bootstrapping with 500 repetitions was used to correct for optimism of both these measures when refitted using the IMPACT core and extended models. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals were calculated for optimism-corrected performance measures using the standard deviation of bootstrapped measures as an indication of uncertainty."

    "Methods": "Animal preparations\nAll animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio. The induction of TBI was done as previously described.\n25\nBriefly, male Sprague Dawley rats (250\u2013350\u2009g;\nn\n=6) were anesthetized initially with 5% isoflurane mixed with room air and maintained at 1.2% isoflurane throughout all surgical and imaging procedures. The animal was secured in a stereotaxic frame and an incision was made at the level of the cerebellum as posterior from the impact site as possible to prevent artifacts during MRI acquisition, and the periosteum was removed over the impact site. A \u00d85mm craniotomy was created over the left S1FL (+0.25mm anterior and 3.5\u2009mm lateral to bregma), exposing the dura matter. The intact dura matter was impacted using a pneumatic-controlled cortical impactor (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, LLC, Fairfax Station, VA) fitted with a \u00d83mm tip (5.0\u2009m/s, 250\u2009\u03bcs dwell time, 1\u2009mm depth) to mimic a mild focal TBI. Following the impact, the cranial opening was sealed with bone wax, the scalp sutured closed, and antibiotic ointment applied. Saline was injected under the skin to facilitate the removal of air pockets between the scalp and the skull to minimize artifacts during MRI acquisition. Buprenex (0.05\u2009mg/kg) was given subcutaneously every 12\u2009h for 3\u2009d for pain.\nMRI was acquired on the day of the TBI procedure (1\u20133\u2009h post-TBI), and again on Days 1, 2, 7, and 14 after TBI onset. Behavioral assessments were made 1\u20133\u2009d prior to TBI and again 1, 2, 7, and 14\u2009d post-TBI prior to the MRI experiments in the same animals. Behavioral tests were not performed on the day of TBI induction due to incomplete recovery from anesthetic. Immunohistology was done after MRI on Day 14 post-TBI. The 14\u2009d endpoint was selected based on a subset of studies in which no apparent difference was observed in lesion volumes between 14 and 28\u2009d post-TBI.\n\nMRI\nMRI was performed on a rodent Bruker 7-Tesla Pharmascan Scanner with 16-cm clear bore diameter under 1.5% isoflurane. The animal was secured in a custom-built MRI-compatible rat head stereotaxic holder with ear and tooth bars.\nDiffusion tensor-weighted MRI (3.5\u2009mins)\nDTIs were obtained with a single low b-value (10\u2009sec/mm\n2\n) in 30 directions with a 1200\u2009sec/mm\n2\nb\nmax\n-value. Echo planar imaging (EPI) scans with partial Fourier (5/8) also were acquired using the following settings: seven 1.0-mm coronal images, field of view (FOV)=2.56\u00d72.56\u2009cm, matrix 96\u00d796 and reconstructed to 128\u00d7128, single shot, repetition time (TR)=3\u2009sec, echo time (TE)=32\u2009msec, \u0394=14\u2009ms, \u03b4=5\u2009msec, and 2 transients for signal averaging.\n26\u201328\nT\n2\nmap (9.5\u2009mins)\nT\n2\n-weighted images were acquired using a fast spin-echo sequence with TR=3\u2009sec (90\no\nflip angle), effective TE=18, 54, 90 and 126\u2009msec, 4 echo train lengths, where the center of the echo train was taken as the effective TE for T\n2\ncalculation. The other parameters were: seven 1.0-mm coronal images, FOV=2.56\u00d72.56\u2009cm, matrix 96\u00d796 and reconstructed to 128\u00d7128, and 8 transients for signal averaging. The contralateral hemisphere T\n2\nwas used as the internal control (note that although there are changes in the molecular or cellular levels in the contralateral hemisphere, these changes did not alter T\n2\nvalues).\n\nImage analysis\nADC, FA, and T\n2\nmaps were calculated as previously described.\n26\n,\n29\n,\n30\nImage maps of individual subjects were co-registered across time points via the application of a transformation matrix generated by QuickVol and MRIAnalysisPak software.\n31\n,\n40\nRegions of interest (ROIs) were defined by pixels that had T\n2\nvalues higher than the mean plus 2 standard deviations of the value in the homologous contralesional region. The ROIs used to determine T\n2\nlesion volumes were also used to tabulate the T\n2\n, ADC, and FA values across all time points using Stimulate software (University of Minnesota).\n\nFunctional assessment\nSensorimotor function was assessed using the asymmetry forelimb placement (cylinder) test and foot-fault test.\n25\nPrevious behavioral studies have demonstrated that these functional tests have the appropriate sensitivity for this injury models.\n22\u201324\nTesting was conducted 1\u20133\u2009d prior to TBI and again 1, 2, 7, and 14\u2009d post-TBI.\nThe forelimb asymmetry placement test was performed with videotaping to assess the use of forelimbs during exploration of the cylinder. The rat was placed in a transparent cylinder (20\u2009cm diameter, 30\u2009cm height) for 5\u2009min or until 30 placements were made. A mirror was positioned under the cylinder to enable the video recorder to see directly into the cylinder. Behavior was scored by counting the number of left or right individual forelimb placements, and the number of simultaneous right and left (both) forelimb placements onto the wall of the cylinder during rearing. The forelimb asymmetry index was calculated as (the number of forelimb placements for each individual limb)+0.5 (number of both placements) divided by the total number of placements.\nThe forelimb foot fault test was performed with videotaping to assess forelimb misplacement during locomotion. The rat was placed on an elevated grid floor (size, 18\u00d711 inches with grid openings of 1.56\u00d71.00 inches) for 5\u2009min or until 50 steps were taken with one (non-affected) forelimb. The rat was allowed to move freely on the grid and the total number of steps and the number of times each limb fell below the grid opening were counted. The percentage of foot faults for each limb was calculated as the number of right or left forelimb foot faults divided by the total number of steps taken.\n\nNissl staining\nNissl staining was used to measure morphological changes within and around the impact following TBI as described in Watts and colleagues.\n25\nBriefly, anesthetized rats were perfused on Day 14 post-TBI with ice-cold heparinized phosphate buffered saline, followed by ice-cold 4% buffered paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were removed and post-fixed with 4% PFA and subsequently cryopreserved (30% sucrose) for 48 hours at 4\u00b0C. Coronal section measuring 25-\u03bcm were affixed to gelatin coated slides and dried overnight at 37\u00b0C. Slides were hydrated through a series of graded alcohols to distilled water, followed by 0.1% cresyl violet acetate for 7\u2009min. Brain sections were then dehydrated, cleared in Histoclear, and coverslipped with Permount mounting medium.\nImages were acquired on an Olympus BX60F microscope equipped with an Olympus DP70 camera. A 5\u00d7objective was utilized to acquire images for mosaic full brain images assimilated using Microsoft ICE software. Intact neurons were defined as nonbasophilic neurons with pale nuclei and discrete nucleoli and that had an intact neuronal body. Dark stained neurons were defined as neurons with abnormal morphology, such as hyperbasophilic neurons and those with shrunken morphology.\nFor quantitative analysis, four brain slices from each animal were obtained to carefully represent the T\n2\nMRI that showed the lesion. Histological slices were carefully co-located with the MRI slices based on anatomical features present in both. Ten regions from each slice located under the impact zone were imaged at 60\u00d7(175\u2009\u03bcm\u00d7175\u2009\u03bcm) by sampling beginning directly under the impact zone 3.5\u2009mm from the median plane and 1.5\u2009mm from the edge of the cortex, and on either side of and below this area in two rows spaced 250\u2009\u03bcm apart (see\nFig. 8A\nfor representative imaging locations). For each slice, 10 corresponding regions on the contralateral side also were imaged for comparison. The numbers of dark stained cells were counted and averaged per field. Results were expressed as the number of Nissl dark-stained cells per field.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 8.\nHistological staining 14\u2009d post- traumatic brain injury (TBI).\n(A)\nMosaic Nissl image of a TBI animal.

Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\n\nFluro-Jade B staining\nFluro-Jade B was used to stain degenerating neurons.\n32\n,\n33\nFrozen sections measuring 30\u2009\u03bcm were incubated in a solution of 1%NaOH in 80% ethanol for 5\u2009min followed by hydration in graded ethanols (75%, 50%, and 25%) to distilled water. The sections were then incubated for 10\u2009min in 0.06% potassium permanganate, rinsed with distilled water, and incubated in 0.004% Fluro-Jade B (Hist-Chem Inc, Jefferson, AR) for 20\u2009min. Sections were rinsed with distilled water three times for two min each. The slides were dried on a slide warmer for 10\u2009min, cleared with Histoclear and coverslipped with DPX (Fluka). Images were acquired on a Nikon C1si microscope using a 60\u00d7water immersion objective. Image analysis was done as described for Nissl staining, counting Fluro-Jade\u2013positive cells per field.\n\nStatistical analysis\nPaired t-tests were used to compare T\n2\n, ADC, and FA abnormality between the ipsilesional and contralesional sides. Values are presented as mean\u00b1standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical significance was set at\np\n<0.05. Multiple regression analysis was performed to determine the correlation between T\n2\n, ADC, and FA abnormality and asymmetry scores or foot fault scores. The differences in the number of dark-stained Nissl neurons and Fluro-Jade B\u2013positive cells between ipsilesional and contralesional animals were assessed using unpaired two-tailed\nt\n-tests."

    "Methods": "Study population\nWe studied a cohort of patients with moderate to severe TBI ages 16 years or older who were enrolled in the Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems (TBIMS) National Database.\n20\nPatients were eligible for inclusion if their Glasgow Coma Scale score was less than 13 in the emergency department, if they experienced post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) for more than 24\u2009h, if they lost consciousness for more than 30\u2009min, and/or if there were trauma-related intracranial neuroimaging abnormalities.\n20\n,\n21\nTBIMS history, inclusion criteria, procedures and enrollment rates have been published elsewhere.\n21\nThis database is representative of adults receiving inpatient rehabilitation for TBI in the U.S.,\n22\n,\n23\nwhere patients are required to be able to participate in 3\u2009h of therapy 5 d a week to be eligible for admission. Participant data from January 1, 2002, to June 28, 2012 were studied to identify factors that predicted institutionalization rates under the current Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services IR facility prospective payment system.\n24\nTwenty IR centers across the U.S. enrolled participants in the TBIMS database during this time period. The Institutional Review Board of each TBIMS facility approved registry participation and informed consent was provided by either the participant with TBI or their legal proxy.\nThe primary criterion for selecting the sample was whether the patient was living in a \u201cprivate residence\u201d immediately prior to the injury. The TBIMS private residence classification includes persons living in a house, apartment, mobile home, foster home, condominium, dormitory, military barracks, boarding school, boarding home, rooming house, bunk-house, boys ranch, fraternity/sorority house, commune, or migrant farm workers camp.\n20\n\nMeasures\nThe primary outcome \u201cinstitutionalization\u201d was defined as a discharge residence of \u201cnursing home,\u201d \u201cadult home,\u201d and \u201csubacute care,\u201d and encompassed residential nursing homes, long-term acute care facilities, adult foster care, independent living centers, transitional living facilities, assisted living facilities, supported living facilities, group homes, subacute hospitals, and skilled nursing facilities. Participant data were excluded from analyses when discharge residence data either did not fit criteria for private residence or institutionalization (e.g., hotel/motel, homeless, and transfer to another rehabilitation hospital setting) or was missing. Participant data also were excluded if there were missing values for several of our pre-specified predictors.\nTo address the factors relevant to our hypothesis, participants' level of independence in feeding, bladder management, bowel management, bed-chair-wheelchair transfers, locomotion (walking/wheelchair use), and comprehension were rated within 72\u2009h of admission on a 7-point scale using the FIM System\n\u00ae\n.\n25\u201327\nOther pre-specified predictors included demographic factors, proxy measures for TBI severity, and acute-care length of stay (LOS). Age at injury, gender, race, and lived-alone status prior to injury were collected based on interview of the most reliable source (e.g., patient and/or family member) as soon as possible after admission. Command following at admission was dichotomously coded based on the participant's ability to follow simple motor commands accurately two consecutive times within a 24-h period. The presence of PTA was determined using one of several equivalent standardized assessments\n28\u201331\nfor which threshold scores or criteria for emergence were met on two consecutive occasions within a period of one to three calendar days. Acute-care LOS was computed using injury and admission dates. Factors identified for check analyses included: highest level of educational attainment, employment status prior to injury, living with parents immediately prior to injury, pre-injury limitations in physical function, geographic region, year of inpatient rehabilitation admission, cause of injury, and 11 cognitive or motor functional independence items. A limited number of interactions also were identified for check analyses\u2014namely, race and age and comprehension score and time post-injury.\n\nData collection and analyses\nResearch data staff trained and certified on the TBIMS IR admission and discharge protocol abstracted data from acute care and IR medical records, administered tests, and collected sociodemographic and pre-injury information from the most reliable source. Standardized administration procedures, comprehensive quality control standards, and automated data checks for completion and accuracy were used to minimize bias, random error, and attrition.\n20\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics were computed for patient sociodemographic characteristics, injury etiology, and functional impairment at time of admission. Differences between univariate analyses of persons discharged to private residence versus institutional care were calculated using Fisher's exact test for dichotomous and multinomial variables, and\nt\n-tests for ordinal and interval variables. We tested standard statistical assumptions, including collinearity. Age at injury was re-coded by dividing by 10 to improve the interpretability of the coefficients. FIM System items were centered by subtracting 4.5 (the numeric value between a 4-minimal assistance and 5-supervision rating) from each score in order to increase the interpretability of the constant term.\nLogistic regression modeling was used to assess the contribution of the hypothesized predictors, with adjustment for demographic factors, proxy measures for TBI severity, and acute-care length-of-stay. Odds ratios, confidence intervals and the statistical significance of these pre-specified factors were computed. To control for type I error associated with clustered data, we used a modified t-statistic based on 19 degrees of freedom\n32\nsince our 20 (center) clusters were too few for reliable use of cluster-adjusted robust standard errors. This led to a cluster-adjusted alpha of\np\n<0.04. Model performance was evaluated using the c-statistic to estimate discrimination and to help protect against overfitting, predictiveness curves.\n33\nEven with data sets of a moderate size, it is easy to overfit models by including variables that, though statistically significant, are a) not affecting the outcome of interest and b) are mostly fitting noise in the data. Non-significant pre-specified factors were removed from the model if they did not influence the significance and strength of the identified predictors and did not greatly diminish model performance.\nOnce the non-significant factors were removed, check analyses first examined whether the inclusion of additional factors either mediated or moderated the effects of pre-specified predictors or improved model performance. Preference was given to keeping pre-specified factors in the model unless an added factor both clearly outperformed a pre-specified factor and had a strong conceptual rationale for inclusion. Check analyses then evaluated whether a more parsimonious final model could be achieved by removing the least predictive factors without diminishing either the influence of other predictors or model performance.\nInternal validation was conducted on the final model via the bootstrap method\n34\nusing 1000 replications.\n35\nExternal validation will be discussed in a future article. All analyses were performed using Stata, version 12.1."

    "Methods": "Controlled cortical impact (CCI)\nBrain trauma in rats and mice was produced using an electromagnetic contusion device (Myneurolab, St. Louis, MO). Adult male (280\u2013300\u2009g) Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) or C57Bl/6J mice (\u223c30\u2009g; Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME) were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane in a carrier gas of oxygen (0.8\u2009L/min) and maintained in 2.5% isoflurane as anesthesia in the same carrier gas. Core body temperature was monitored continuously and maintained at 37\u00b11\u00b0 C. Animals were placed onto a stereotactic apparatus (David Kopf, Tujinga, CA) in a prone position and secured by ear and incisor bars. Following a midline cranial incision and reflection of the soft tissues, a unilateral craniotomy (ipsilateral to site of impact; 4\u2009mm and 7\u2009mm diameter for mice and rats, respectively) was performed adjacent to the central suture, midway between bregma and lambda. The dura mater was kept intact over the cortex.\nBrain trauma was produced by impacting the right (ipsilateral) cortex with an aluminum impactor tip (housed in a pneumatic cylinder; 3.5\u2009mm and 5\u2009mm diameter for mice and rats, respectively) at an impact velocity of 4.5\u2009msec with a 1.5\u2009mm (mice) or 2.5\u2009mm (rats) depth and 150\u2009msec dwell time. The craniotomy was covered with a plastic plate that was cemented (Grip Cement, Dentsply, York, PA) to the skull. Sham-injured control animals were subjected to the same surgical procedures but did not receive the impact injury.\nAnimals were monitored and recovery from anesthesia was confirmed when they regained their ability to right themselves and ambulate. Appropriate pre- and post-injury management was preformed to minimize pain and discomfort and to insure compliance with guidelines set forth by the State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol #'s 08-477-10 and 13-10382) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines detailed in the Guide for the Care and Use of Animals.\nBrain tissue and blood samples were harvested from mice and rats at selected times after the CCI. At each time point, mice and rats were anesthetized with isoflurane before sample collection. Blood was collected in non-heparinized tubes from tail veins or by cardiac exsanguination. Following centrifugation, serum was obtained, stored at \u221280\no\nC, and diluted (1:20) prior to use. Brains were removed immediately following cervical dislocation and stored at \u221280\no\nC. In addition to these samples, frozen brains and blood from 8-month-old JNPL3 (P301L) and T-tau knockout (TauKO) mice were generously supplied by Dr. Karen Duff (Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY).\n\nHuman samples\nSamples were derived from six patients with blunt trauma to the head and with a GCS score <8 enrolled in a sTBI study where CSF was collected from adult subjects presenting to the emergency department of Ben Taub General Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas. The study protocol was approved by the Baylor College of Medicine (IRB # H-13606). CSF was collected until a ventriculostomy catheter was no longer clinically indicated. CSF samples (10\u2009mL), with a collection time not exceeding 1\u2009h, were diverted to 15\u2009mL conical polypropylene centrifuge tubes (BD Falcon) and centrifuged at 4,000\u00d7g at room temperature for 5\u2009min to remove loose cells and debris. One mL aliquots of the cleared supernatants were pipetted into cryogenic tubes, snap-frozen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\nControl CSF samples were purchased from Bioreclamation, Inc. Archived TBI CSF samples also were assessed. Archived serum samples from sTBI subjects and non-TBI controls were collected at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (IRB #'s PRO08020342, IRB0308021).\nEnrolled subjects in this cohort also sustained blunt trauma to the head and had an admission GCS score <8. Initial blood samples were collected during the acute stage (<3\u2009d post-injury) and also at approximately one month, three months, and six months post-TBI. Non-TBI control sera were collected only once per subject using similar procedures. After collection, blood samples were allowed to coagulate for 30-60\u2009min at room temperature before centrifugation at 2,500\u00d7g for 10\u2009min. Supernatants (serum) were collected, aliquoted, snap-frozen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Prior to analysis, serum and CSF were diluted 1:20 and 1:100, respectively.\nHuman CSF and serum samples were transferred to SUNY Downstate for use in this study with NIH clinical exemption 4 (IRB # 00003624) from Federal regulations.\n\nPreparation of tissue extracts\nSoluble tissue extracts were generated by homogenization of rodent brain tissue in 1x lysis buffer (20\u2009mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 5\u2009mM EGTA, 5\u2009mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1\u2009mM Na vanadate, 1\u2009mM dithiothreitol, and 100\u00d7Halt protease inhibitor (Fisher Scientific) on ice. Extracts were transferred to 1.5\u2009mL microcentrifuge tubes, microfuged at 10,000\u00d7g for 15\u2009min at 4\u00b0 C and the supernatants (soluble proteins) were collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C until analysis. Protein concentrations were determined using a micro BCA protein assay kit (Fisher Scientific, Morristown, NJ).\n\nEIMAF and a-EIMAF\nThe anti-tau monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) used were previously described\n55\nand epitopes are indicated in italics below. For EIMAF coupled to rolling circle amplification (a-EIMAF), high-binding 96-well microtiter plates (Costar) were coated with capture Mab at 6\u2009\u03bcg/mL final concentration (Mab DA31\n[aa150-190]\nfor T-tau and Mabs CP13\n[pSer-202]\nrodents samples or RZ3\n[pThr-231]\nhuman samples for P-tau). Following an overnight incubation at 40\no\nC, unoccupied binding sites were blocked for 1\u2009h with casein. A 100\u2009\u03bcl aliquot of diluted brain or blood (serum at 1:20 dilution is used to avoid matrix effects) sample was added, incubated and followed by the addition of a biotinylated detection Mab DA9 (\naa102-140\n) (100\u2009\u03bcL at 4\u2009\u03bcg/mL final Mab concentration).\nFive 10-min washes with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween-20 (PBST) were followed with the addition of 100\u2009\u03bcL of streptavidin (5\u2009\u03bcg/mL) per well and incubation for 1\u2009h at 37\no\nC. A biotinylated prostate-specific DNA primer (5\u2032-TTTTTTTGTCCGTGCTAGAAGGAAA-CAGTTAC-3\u2032) (100\u2009\u03bcl at 4\u2009\u03bcg/mL) was added for 1\u2009h at 37\no\nC. Following the addition of a T4-DNA ligase-pretreated prostate DNA template (1\u2009mg/ mL), RCA was initiated by adding 100\u2009\u03bcl of reaction mixture consisting of: \u03c629 DNA polymerase reaction buffer, bovine serum albumin, nucleotide triphosphates supplemented with dUTP-Texas Red, and \u03c629 DNA polymerase.\n56\nIncubation for several hours is followed by PBST washes, addition of 1N NaOH, neutralization with 1\u2009M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, heat treatment (100\no\nC for 15\u2009min) and fluorescence analysis using surround optical fluorescence detection.\nFor direct, non-amplified detection and relative quantitation of tau, EIMAF was performed as detailed previously and briefly described here.\n50\nFor direct EIMAF, tissue homogenates or biofluids were added to the capture Ab followed by the biotinylated detection Mab DA9. Following a 1\u2009h incubation, streptavidin conjugated to Rhodamine Red X (1:1000; Invitrogen, Norwalk, CT) was added and incubated for 1\u2009h. The wells were washed with TBS containing Tween-20, treated with NaOH and neutralized. A 90\u2009\u03bcL sample was drawn up into a 100\u2009\u03bcL Microcap (Drummond Scientific, Broomall, PA) micro-capillary tube which was then inserted into a specifically designed tube sample holder for laser excitation and emission quantitation. Each EIMAF and a-EIMAF sample was tested in triplicate and, depending on available sample volumes, duplicated in independent experiments. Although we have found that a-EIMAF is not required for all serum samples, it is required for many of them. Therefore, our standard protocol is to assay all non-CNS samples directly by a-EIMAF.\n\nImmunoblotting and ELISA\nFor capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), 96-well microtiter plates were coated with 100\u2009\u03bcL of purified capture antibody (Mab DA31 for T-tau, Mab CP13 for rodent P-tau, Mab RZ3 for human P-tau) at a concentration of 5\u2009\u03bcg/mL in PBS. After overnight incubation at 4\u00b0 C the wells were washed twice with PBST and blocked by adding 200\u2009\u03bcL 1% non-fat dry milk in PBS, pH 7.4. A 100-\u03bcL aliquot of PBS-diluted antigen was incubated at 37\no\nC for 1\u2009h followed by four washes with PBST. Biotinylated DA9 (100\u2009\u03bcL at 1\u2009\u03bcg/mL) was added and incubated for 1\u2009h at room temperature (RT). Wells were washed four times with PBST followed by the addition of 100\u2009\u03bcL of streptavidin conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and incubation at RT for 60\u2009min. This was followed by the addition of 100\u2009\u03bcL para-Nitrophenylphosphate substrate, incubation at 37\no\nC for 60\u2009min and optical density readings at 405\u2009nm.\nFor immunoblotting analysis, soluble protein fractions (25\u2009\u03bcg per lane) from the brain tissue extracts were separated using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% resolving gels). Equivalent sample volumes were loaded on each lane. Proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes and the blots were blocked using 5% non-fat dry milk in PBST for 30\u2009min at RT. Blots were incubated with primary Ab (1:1000 dilution of Mab DA9 conditioned media for T-tau and Mab CP13 for P-tau) for 2\u2009h at 37\no\nC, washed three times in PBST (15\u2009min each) followed by goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG; Fab specific) conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (1:2000; Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, St. Louis, MO) in 1% non-fat dry milk - PBST for 2\u2009h. Following three PBST washes (15\u2009min each), the blots were developed in substrate buffer (100\u2009mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 100\u2009mM NaCl, and 5\u2009mM MgCl\n2\n) containing nitro blue tetrazolium (0.33\u2009mg/mL)/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (0.165\u2009mg/mL). All data shown are representative of three separate experiments. Quantification of tau proteins was performed by densitometric analysis using NIH Image J software. All data shown are representative of multiple independent experiments."

    "Methods": "MSC culture and characterization\nPrimary cultures of MSC were set up from P22 male Sprague-Dawley rats. The animals were euthanized with CO\n2\n. From each animal, tibias and femurs were dissected, placed in cool phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and epiphyses removed. The diaphyses of bones were flushed with PBS using a syringe and the marrow was homogenized. The extract was filtered through a 70-\u03bcm nylon mesh and recovered by centrifugation for 10\u2009min at 1500\u2009rpm (220\u2009g). The pellet was re-suspended in growth medium \u03b1-MEM with L-glutamine (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Lonza, Verviers, Belgium), 2mM L-glutamine (Life Technologies) and 100 units/mL penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies, 100\u00d7), and plated in 100-mm culture dishes (Iwaki, Asahi Technoglass, Chiba, Japan) at a density of 5 \u00b7 10\n6\ncells/cm\n2\n. After 24\u2009h, the supernatant containing non-adherent cells was removed and fresh medium was added. When the culture was near confluence, every 4\u20135\u2009d, the cells were detached using PBS with 0.05% trypsin (Life Technologies) and 0.04% EDTA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and re-plated at 5,000 cells/cm\n2\n8\n. Cells were passaged three to four times, expanded to 80\u201390% of confluence.\nFor phenotype characterization, after four passages in culture, MSC were labeled for 30\u2009min using antibodies against CD90, CD29, CD11b and CD45, conjugated with FITC (BD Bioscience, Erembodegem, Belgium; 1:200 v/v). After incubation, the cells were centrifuged for 5\u2009min at 1300\u2009rpm and re-suspended in PBS. Analysis of surface markers was performed using flow citometry (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson, Madrid, Spain) and FACSDiva software (BD Bioscience). The capacity of the MSC for differentiation to adipogenic and osteogenic cells was assessed as described previously.\n8\n,\n37\nFor analysis of adipogenesis, cells were fixed for 20\u2009min with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (PB); the adipogenic cells were labeled using 60% Oil red O stock solution (0.5% Oil red O in isopropanol, Sigma) for 15\u2009min and washed with distilled water. For osteogenic labeling, cells were fixed using 70% ethanol pre-cooled for 1\u2009h at 4\u00b0C, washed and incubated during 30\u2009min with 0.1\u2009mg/mL Alizarin red solution (Sigma) in distilled water.\nFor identification of the cells after grafting, MSC were transfected with a lentiviral vector encoding for the green fluorescence protein (GFP) under EF1\u03b1 promoter. Cells in passage 2 were plated at 2000 cells/cm\n2\nand incubated with lentiviruses during 48\u2009h. Then, the medium was changed and the cells cultured as described above before transplantation. The infected cells were checked using an antibody against GFP (1:200, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom). The efficacy of infection was measured by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson) and FACSDiva software (BD Bioscience). We found that around 90% of the cells in the infected culture were positive for GFP.\n\nSpinal cord injury and cell transplantation\nAdult female Sprague-Dawley rats (9 weeks old; 250\u2013300g) were used. The animals were housed with free access to food and water at a room temperature of 22\u00b12\u00b0C under a 12:12 light-dark cycle. The experimental procedures were approved by the ethical committee of the Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona in accordance with the European Directive 86/609/EEC.\nUnder anesthesia with ketamine (90mg/kg) and xylacine (10 mg/kg) and aseptic conditions, a longitudinal dorsal incision was made to expose T6-T10 spinous processes. A laminectomy of T8-T9 vertebra was made and a cord contusion of 200 Kdyns was induced using an Infinite Horizon Impactor device (Precision System and Instrumentation, Kentucky, USA). The animals were transplanted acutely, 30\u2009min after the contusion, and divided in eight groups. Four groups of rats received an injection in the spinal cord (see below) of a low dose of cell suspension or vehicle (VHC), with or without FK506 co-administration. Other four groups of rats were injected with a high dose of cell suspension or vehicle, with or without FK506 co-administration. In addition, for studying cell survival, four additional groups were transplanted with GFP+ MSC (gMSC).\nTable 1\nshows all the experimental groups included in the study.\nTable\n1.\nExperimental Groups Included in the Study\nVehicle injection (intraspinal)\nMSC transplantation (intraspinal)\nLow dose\nHigh dose\nLow dose\nHigh dose\nExperimental groups for treatment evaluation\nSaline i.p\nLow VHC (\nn\n=9)\nHigh VHC (\nn\n=8)\nLow MSC (\nn\n=10)\nHigh MSC (\nn\n=8)\nFK506 i.p\nLow VHC-FK506 (\nn\n=9)\nHigh VHC-FK506 (\nn\n=10)\nLow MSC-FK506 (\nn\n=8)\nHigh MSC-FK506 (\nn\n=8)\nExperimental groups for cell survival study\nSaline i.p\n-\n-\nLow gMSC (\nn\n=15)\nHigh gMSC (\nn\n=15)\nFK506 i.p\n-\n-\nLow gMSC-FK506 (\nn\n=15)\nHigh gMSC-FK506 (\nn\n=15)\nOpen in a separate window\nMSC, mesenchymal stem cells; i.p., intraperitoneal; VHC, vehicle; gMSC, green fluorescence protein+MSC.\nSpinal cord injections were made using a glass needle (100\u2009\u03bcm internal diameter, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) coupled to a 10\u2009\u03bcL Hamilton syringe (Hamilton #701, Hamilton Co, Reno, NV). Intraspinal injections were performed at the epicenter of the contusion and at 2\u2009mm rostrally and caudally. In the low-dose groups, 3\u2009\u03bcL of cell suspension (50,000 cells/\u03bcL) or vehicle (L15) were injected at each indicated point for a total of 450,000 cells per rat. In the high-dose groups, 4\u2009\u03bcL of cell suspension (75,000 cells/\u03bcL) or vehicle (L15) were injected in both caudal and rostral injection points and 6\u2009\u03bcL in the epicenter, for a total of 1,050,000 cells per rat. The cell concentration was increased in the high-dose groups in order to inject a volume only slightly larger than in the low-dose groups (total volume of 14\u2009\u03bcL vs. 9\u2009\u03bcL), and do not compromise the survival of cells through the injection process (viability >95% of the cells after re-suspension and injection through the needle). A perfusion speed of 2\u2009\u03bcL/min was controlled by an automatic injector (KDS 310 Plus, Kd Scientific, Holliston, MA), and the tip was maintained inside the tissue 3\u2009min after each injection to avoid liquid reflux.\nThe wound was sutured by planes and the animals allowed recovering in a warm environment. An intraperitoneal (i.p.) bolus of saline or FK506 (2\u2009mg/kg) solution was administered immediately after the transplantation and additional injections of saline or FK506 (1\u2009mg/kg) were given once a day until the end of the follow-up. To prevent infection, amoxicillin (500\u2009mg/L, Normon, Madrid, Spain) was given in the drinking water for one week. Postoperative analgesia was provided with buprenorphine (0.05\u2009mg/kg). Bladders were expressed twice a day until reflex voiding was re-established.\n\nFunctional assessment\nOpen-field locomotion: motor behavior was tested before surgery and at 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42\u2009d post-operation. Animals were placed individually in a circular enclosure and allowed to move freely for 5\u2009min. Two observers evaluated locomotion during open-field walking and scored the hindlimb performance according to the BBB-scale, ranging from 0 (no movement) to 21 (normal movement).\n38\nTreadmill locomotion: maximal walking speed, gait pattern, and locomotor coordination were assessed at end time point using the DigiGait Imaging system (Mouse Specifics Inc., Boston, MA) as previously described.\n39\nBriefly, images captured by a video camera mounted below a transparent treadmill belt were digitized at 140 frames per second, and a minimum of eight sequential step cycles analyzed. For the maximal speed, the treadmill speed was progressively increased from 0\u2009cm/sec until the animal was not able to maintain running. For gait and coordination the rats were recorded at 20\u2009cm/sec, if the animals were able to run at this speed. The start and ending times of the stance phase of each stride were extracted and a foot gait diagram was depicted.\n39\n,\n40\nQuantitative values for the gait parameters (stride duration, stance duration and swing duration) were calculated. To assess the coordination of locomotion the regularity index (RI), the correct alternation between different pairs of limbs and the phase dispersion (PD) were calculated as previously described.\n39\n\nElectrophysiological tests\nFor the electrophysiological tests, the animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital (30\u2009mg/kg i.p.), placed prone onto a metal plate and skin temperature maintained above 32\u00b0C. An electromyograph (Sapphyre 4ME, Vickers Healthcare Co., Woking, United Kingdom) was used.\nMotor evoked potentials (MEPs) were elicited by transcranial electrical stimulation delivered by two needle electrodes placed subcutaneously over the skull, with the anode over the sensorimotor cortex and the cathode at the nose. Single electrical pulses of supramaximal intensity (25\u2009mA, 100\u2009\u03bcs) were applied, and the MEPs were recorded with needle electrodes from tibialis anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius medialis (GM) muscles.\n41\n,\n42\nPeripheral motor nerve conduction tests were performed by stimulating the sciatic nerve with single electrical pulses (100\u2009\u03bcs at supramaximal intensity) delivered by needles at the sciatic notch, and recording the compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) of TA and GM muscles by means of needle electrodes. The recording active electrode was inserted on the belly of the muscle and the reference at the fourth toe. The latency and the onset-to-peak amplitude of the maximal MEP and M waves were measured.\n42\n\nHistology\nThe end time-point of the animals for evaluation of treatment was 42\u2009d after injury. The rats were deeply anesthetized (pentobarbital 60\u2009mg/kg i.p.) and intracardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The spinal cord segment from 1cm rostral to 1cm caudal of the injury epicenter (2\u2009cm total length) was harvested and post-fixed in the same fixative solution for 24\u2009h and cryopreserved in PB-30% sucrose.\nFor evaluation of the injury transversal spinal cord sections 30\u2009\u03bcm thick were cut with a cryotome (Leica CM190, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and distributed in 15 series of 24 sections (separated by 450\u2009\u03bcm) each. One series of sections was re-hydrated in water, immersed in hematoxylin Harris solution (Fluka, Sigma) for 5\u2009min, washed in water two times followed by 1% HCl in ethanol solution during 30\u2009sec. The sections were washed with water again and stained with Eosin Y (Merck Millipore, Dramstadt, Germany) during 6\u2009min.\nThe sections were dehydrated and mounted with DPX (Sigma). Analysis of spared tissue and injury size was made using 19 transversal cord sections (separated by 450\u2009\u03bcm between pairs) of each animal. Images of transversal sections were taken at 40x (Olympus BX51) through a digital camera (Olympus DP50). The area of spared tissue, of the cavity and the total spinal cord section were delineated and measured using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda MA). Volumes of the graft, spared tissue, cavity and total spinal cord injured segment were calculated using the Cavalieri's correction of morphometric volume.\n43\nFor neurofilament immunohistochemistry sections were blocked with PBS 0.3% with Triton 5% in fetal bovine serum, and incubated for 24\u2009h at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies rabbit anti-NF-L (neurofilament light chain, 1/500, Millipore) and chicken anti-NF-H (neurofilament heavy chain, 1/1000, Millipore). After washes, sections were incubated for 2\u2009h at room temperature with donkey anti-rabbit-AlexaFluor 488 and goat anti-chicken-AlexaFluor 594 (1/200, Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). Slides were dehydrated and mounted with Citoseal 60 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Madrid, Spain). Images of the spinal cord injured epicenter section were taken at 100\u00d7 with the same setting. Microphotographs were transformed to a gray scale and analyzed using ImageJ software. The NF-H labeled area for each section was measured after defining a threshold for background correction. The percentage of NF-H positive area with respect to the injured area was measured for each animal.\n\nCell survival assessment\nGroups of animals injected with GFP-MSC were sacrificed at 2, 7, 14, 21, and 42\u2009d after injection (\nn\n=3 for each time point). Perfusion and processing of the spinal cord was as above. Longitudinal sections of 30-\u03bcm thickness of the spinal cord segment were cut and distributed in 12 series of eight sections (separated by 360\u2009\u03bcm) each. Sections were blocked with PBS 0.3% with Triton 5% in fetal bovine serum and incubated for 24\u2009h at 4\u00b0C with primary antibody rabbit anti-GFP (1/200, Life Technologies). After washes, sections were incubated for 2\u2009h at room temperature with biotinylated conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (1/200, Vector, Burlingame, CA), and then with AlexaFluor 488 conjugated streptavidine (1/200, Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). Slides were dehydrated and mounted with Citoseal 60 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Madrid, Spain).\nAnalysis of the GFP+ area was performed on eight spinal cord sections (separated by 360\u2009\u03bcm between pairs) of each animal. Consecutive images of the spinal cord injured segment were taken at 100\u00d7with the same setting and the total section was mounted using Photoshop software (Adobe Systems Inc.). Microphotographs were transformed to a gray scale and analyzed using ImageJ software. The GFP labeled area for each section was measured after defining a threshold for background correction. The total volume of GFP signal for each spinal cord was calculated.\n\nData analysis\nQuantitative data from white matter spared tissue, mean cavity, stance/swing ratio, RI, and electrophysiology tests were analyzed by\nt\n-Student or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) when more than two groups were compared. Data of graft volume were analyzed using two-way ANOVA. Statistical analyses of BBB score and percentage of spared tissue was performed by two-way ANOVA of repeated measures. Bonferroni's post hoc test for compared pairs of groups was used where needed. Data from maximal treadmill speed was evaluated as survival curve by log-rank test. For the parameters in which no statistical differences between vehicle groups were found, these animals were grouped for the comparative analysis with MSC-treated animals (see\nsupplementary Fig. S1\nand\nFig. S2\n; online only). A\np\nvalue lower than 0.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "The study was conducted in accord with the Animal Welfare act. All experiments were performed under veterinarian supervision and were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee.\n\nGroup allocation\nBefore surgery, 12 female Yorkshire swine (weight, 42\u201350\u2009kg; Tufts Veterinary School, Grafton, MA) were randomized to resuscitation with either FFP (\nn\n=6) or 0.9% NS (\nn\n=6).\n\nPreparation and monitoring phase\nAnimal preparation was performed according to our previously published protocols.\n13\n,\n14\nBriefly, on the day of the experiment, animals were sedated with 5\u2009mg/kg of Telazol intramuscularly (Pfizer, New York, NY) and anesthetized by mask inhalation using 4% isoflurane in 100% oxygen. Upon attaining sufficient depth of anesthesia, intubation was performed using a direct laryngoscopy technique with a 7.0-mm endotracheal tube. Upon confirmation of tracheal intubation, levels of inhaled isoflurane were adjusted down to 1\u20133% inspired fraction in room air. Cannulations of the right external jugular vein, right and left femoral arteries, and right femoral vein were then performed by a cut-down technique. The external jugular vein was used for the placement of a pulmonary artery catheter. The right femoral artery was used for continuous monitoring of the mean arterial pressure (MAP), which was recorded every 5\u2009min. The left femoral artery was used for blood draw, and the femoral vein was used for fluid administration.\n\nInjury phase\nAfter cannulations, a mid-line laparotomy was used to gain access to the abdominal cavity. The distal 2 inches of the right medial liver lobe were sharply transected and allowed to bleed freely. Volume of blood loss was measured by continued suctioning into a canister. Further, laparotomy pads were weighed. Upon reaching 250\u2009mL of free hemorrhage, bleeding was controlled by packing and cauterization of small vessels. Larger vessels were sutured. Final hemostasis was secured by an interlocking running suture across the cut surface of the liver. During hemorrhage, one of the free floating ribs (overlying the liver) was manually fractured, while soft-tissue injury was created by crushing the rectus muscle along the incision line with a Kelly clamp. The abdomen was then rapidly closed with #1 nylon sutures.\nAnimals were then carefully flipped to a prone position in preparation for the creation of TBI, as previously described.\n13\nBriefly, a 20-mm burr hole was made on the right side of the skull over the frontal lobe in order to expose the dura. A catheter for intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring and monitoring of cerebral oxygenation (Integra LifeSciences, Plainsboro, NJ) was inserted through a 2-mm burr hole on the left side of the skull, 10\u2009mm lateral and 10\u2009mm anterior to the bregma. ICP was continuously measured and recorded every 5\u2009min. TBI was created through the 20-mm burr hole using a computer-controlled cortical impact device,\n13\n,\n15\nand the hole was subsequently sealed using bone and bone wax in order to prevent leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\nConcurrent with the TBI, controlled hemorrhage was started using the femoral arterial line, as previously described.\n13\nBefore the experiment, 40% blood volume had been calculated and the previously hemorrhaged 250\u2009mL was deducted from this for the purpose of the calculation of controlled blood-volume draw. Total blood loss equaled 40% of the estimated blood volume.\n\nResuscitation and observation phase\nUpon completion of the controlled hemorrhage, animals were left hypotensive for 2\u2009h. During this phase, we targeted an MAP of 30\u201335\u2009mm Hg, adjusted by titrating the inhaled fraction of isoflurane.\nUpon completion of the shock phase, animals were resuscitated according to their randomized groupings, either FFP (\nn\n=6) or NS (\nn\n=6; Hospira Inc., Lake Forest, IL). Volume of FFP matched the volume of shed blood, whereas volume of NS was 3 times the volume of blood loss to simulate the resuscitation volume used in clinical settings. FFP had been obtained from healthy porcine donors and was thawed in the morning of the experiment, as previously described.\n16\nUpon completion of resuscitation, animals were observed for 6\u2009h under continued anesthesia before killing. During the observation phase, blood gases were obtained hourly and electrolytes were corrected as needed. Immediately following the termination of the study, brain and other organs were harvested for the purpose of subsequent tissue analysis.\n\nPreparation of brain samples\nPreparation of these samples has been described in detail.\n17\nBriefly, brains were sliced into 5-mm coronal sections beginning 10\u2009mm anterior and ending 30\u2009mm posterior to the lesion. These slices were incubated in 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to demonstrate the presence of viable tissue. Lesion size and swelling were subsequently calculated as previously described.\n17\nBriefly, volume of lesion size was measured from the stained coronal sections using ImageJ image analysis software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). For each coronal section, the surface area was measured and converted from pixels to mm\n2\n, and all sections were combined to obtain a total volume of lesion size. Brain swelling was quantified by comparing the injured and uninjured hemispheres: [(ipsilateral hemisphere's volume/contralateral hemisphere's volume) \u2013 1]\u00d7100.\nThirty milligrams of ipsilateral cortical brain tissue samples from the border zone of the TBI were subjected to whole-cell lysis for the purpose of tissue analysis, as previously described.\n17\nBriefly, brain tissue samples were sonicated by an ultrasonic cell disruptor and extracted using a whole-cell lysis extraction kit (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). The homogenate was centrifuged at 8000\ng\nfor 20\u2009min at 4\u00b0C, and the supernatant was used for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis.\n\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\nAll assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ELISA technique was used to assay brain whole-cell lysis samples for endothelial-derived vasodilator nitric oxide synthase (eNOS; Novatein Bio, Cambridge, MA) and vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 (ET-1; Novatein Bio).\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented as medians with interquartile range. Differences between groups at distinct time points were compared at equal time points using Mann-Whitney's U test whereas linear mixed modeling was used to compare differences in correlated data over time (hemodynamics, brain oxygenation, and ICPs). A\np\nvalue of 0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll animal procedures were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC; New Orleans, LA) and were in accord with the National Institute of Health (NIH) guidelines. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Raleigh, NC) weighing 250\u2013275\u2009g at the time of arrival were housed in the Division of Animal Care at LSUHSC and were exposed to a 12-h light/dark cycle and fed a standard rat diet (Purina Rat Chow; Ralston Purina, St. Louis, MO)\nad libitum\nfor 1 week before surgical procedures.\n\nSurgical procedures\nAnimals were anesthetized (intramuscular injection of ketamine 90\u2009mg/kg and xylazine 9\u2009mg/kg) and positioned in a stereotaxic apparatus (model 900; Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA), and craniotomy (5.0\u2009mm) was performed (2.0\u2009mm posterior to bregma, 3.0\u2009mm lateral from mid-line, over the left sensory motor cortex). Extreme care was taken to ensure that the dura matter was not penetrated. A female Luer Loc connector was positioned directly over the craniotomy and secured in place with cyanoacrylate glue. Once the glue was dry, dental cement (Lang Dental Manufacturing, Wheeling, IL) was applied around the female Luer Loc connector and surrounding exposed skull approximately 2\u2009mm in thickness. The female Luer Loc was filled with sterile normal saline and capped. A subset of animals was also surgically implanted with a carotid catheter for BBB measurements. Briefly, using aseptic surgical procedures, catheters (PE50; BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD) were inserted into the left carotid artery, then advanced approximately 3\u2009cm in length. Catheters were flushed with sterile saline, then sealed, and subcutaneously routed to the nape of the neck, where they were exteriorized through a small incision and secured with tape. After surgery, animals were placed in individual cages, allowed to recover from anesthesia, and given food and water\nad libitum\nfor 3 days before randomization to either sham or TBI groups.\n\nTraumatic brain injury model\nAfter recovery from surgery, animals were either subjected to TBI by lateral fluid percussion (LFP) or given no injury [shams]). The LFP model is the most extensively used and well-characterized model of nonpenetrating and nonischemic TBI and provides consistent, reproducible injury.\n36\u201339\nAnimals were anesthetized with isoflurane (4% induction, 3% maintenance) and positioned into a stereotaxic frame; the cranial female Luer Loc was connected to an LFP system by pressure tubing. LFP (pressure wave of \u223c2 atm and 25-ms duration) was delivered to the dura. Animals were immediately monitored for signs of apnea after TBI, removed from the stereotaxic frame, and placed on their right side for observation of respiratory rate. Righting reflex was recorded as the time it took for the animal to regain complete consciousness and standing on all four limbs. Time-matched sham controls were anesthetized and connected to the LFP system, but not subjected to LFP. All animals were placed back into their individual home cage and continuously monitored for 2\u2009h postinjury with free access to food and water.\n\nEndocannabinoid modulation\nSelective inhibitors of MAGL and FAAH, the enzymes responsible for 2-AG and AEA hydrolysis (JZL184 [16\u2009mg/kg] and URB597 [0.3\u2009mg/kg]) were dissolved in alcohol, emulphor, and saline (1:1:18) as vehicle. Either JZL184 (TBI/JZL) or URB597 (TBI/URB) was injected intraperitoneally at 30\u2009min post-TBI. Time-matched controls received equal volumes (10\u2009\u03bcL/kg body weight) of vehicle (TBI/VEH). Animals were studied during the acute postinjury period (2\u201324\u2009h).\n\nNeurological and neurobehavioral assessments\nAs previously described, neurological (neurological severity scores; NSS) and neurobehavioral (neurobehavioral scores; NBS) function was assessed at baseline (1\u2009h before TBI) and at 2 and 24\u2009h post-TBI, as previously described.\n40\nAll animals were exposed to all tasks, trained, and evaluated before TBI using the testing parameters that were adapted from previously published methods of assessing cognition and behavior.\n39\n,\n41\nTo reduce any impact on behavior assessments potentially caused by the process of relocation, they were transported to the test room 1\u2009h in advance of the start of testing. NSS scores ranged from 0 to 25 and NBS scores ranged from 0 to12 and were based on the animal's ability to carry out each task. A score of 0 represented normal or pass, whereas higher scores correlated to the animal's severity of injury and NSS or NBS impairment. NSS evaluates motor function, sensory, reflexes, beam walking, and beam balancing. Pinna, corneal, startle, and righting reflexes were assessed, where one is no reflex and 0 indicates the reflex is intact. Beam walking assessed motor coordination, animals were placed on beams of decreasing width (10, 8, 5, and 2.5\u2009cm) and allowed 60\u2009min to traverse each beam. In addition, beam balance was assessed where animals were placed on a 1.5-cm-wide beam and given 60\u2009sec to balance. Failure to walk all beams and/or balance for 60\u2009sec resulted in increased NSS total. NBS tests sensorimotor, proprioception, exploratory behavior, and novel object exploration. Proprioception was assessed by pushing each animal laterally (lateral pulsion) on each side of its body. Each side was assessed and failure to resist lateral pulsion on one or both sides increased the NBS total. Exploratory behavior was assessed immediately after the animal's cage top was removed. Uninjured animals actively explore the top of the cage and surroundings.\n\nBlood\u2013brain barrier permeability\nIntegrity of the BBB was examined by dye tracer extravasation, as previously described.\n42\n,\n43\nAnimals received a 1-mL injection of a Ringer's lactate solution containing 2% Evans Blue (EB; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) into the carotid catheter. After 10\u201315\u2009min, animals were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and then transcardially perfused for 15\u2009min with normal saline to remove dye from the vasculature. The brain was removed and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and brain regions (ipsi- and contralateral) were isolated, weighed, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C before homogenization and extraction. Tissue was homogenized in formamide, and EB was extracted from brain tissue by incubating in formamide (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37\u00b0C overnight. Samples were then centrifuged at 4000\ng\nat 4\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. The concentration of EB was measured in the supernatant with a spectrophotometer at 620\u2009nm. A linear standard curve of EB in formamide was used to calculate brain-tissue EB concentration (\u03bcg/mL EB) and was then normalized to tissue weight in grams. Data are expressed as \u03bcg/mL EB/g of brain tissue.\n\nTissue collection\nAfter decapitation, the brain was removed from the skull, rapidly sprayed by Richard-Allan Scientific Cytocool II (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), and dipped into liquid nitrogen for approximately 6\u201310\u2009sec. Using a prefrozen standard adult rodent brain slicer matrix (Zivic Instruments, Pittsburgh, PA), the brain was positioned and cut using three razor blades pressed into slice channels at 4, 8, and 13\u2009mm from the tip of the frontal cortex to excise out a 4-mm width of prefrontal cortex and a 5-mm width of the injured area. A fourth razor blade was pressed at mid-line to separate the ipsilateral (injured) from the contralateral (uninjured) region, and a 5-mm width of uninjured cortex was collected. Brain tissues were collected at 24\u2009h post-TBI and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for further analyses.\n\nReal-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis\nMessenger RNA (mRNA) expression of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), TNF-\u03b1, COX2, and gp91\nphox\n(nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate [NADPH] oxidase; NOX2) was measured 24\u2009h post-TBI at the site of injury. Total RNA was extracted from brain tissue using an RNeasy Plus Universal Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was reverse transcribed using the TaqMan Reverse Transcription Reagent kit (Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA). Primer sequences (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) for IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and CCL2 used in this study are listed in\nTable 1\n. COX2 and NOX2 primers were purchased from SA Biosciences (Valencia, CA), and these sequences remain proprietary. Primer concentrations used were 500\u2009nM. The RT\n2\nSYBR Green FAST Mastermix (Qiagen) was used for real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All reactions were performed on a CFX96 system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR data were analyzed using the \u0394\u0394C\nT\nmethod. Target genes were compared with RPS13 and normalized to control values.

Protein concentrations from brain tissue lysates were determined using a bicinchoninic acid assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein (60 ug) from each sample were separated on 4\u201320% gradient SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Membranes were then blocked, incubated with anti-COX2 (1:200; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), anti-NOX2 (1:1000; Abcam), and anti-\u03b2-actin (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) primary antibodies (Abs) overnight at 4\u00b0C, and then incubated with secondary Abs conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:2500; Cell Signaling technology) for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Bands were visualized using Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Science, Boston, MA), and densitometry was used to quantify protein expression using Carestream molecular imaging software (Carestream Health, Inc., Rochester, NY). \u03b2-actin was used as a loading control on all membranes.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nPerfusion-fixed brains were sliced at 35-\u03bcm thickness, and sections were mounted on glass slides before staining. Sections were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton-X 100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin and 2% normal donkey serum for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Sections were incubated with two primary Abs: rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP; 1:200; Abcam) and mouse anit-ED1 (1:200; Abcam) for 24\u2009h at 4\u00b0C. Sections were then washed 3\u00d75\u2009min with PBS and incubated in a mixture of secondary Abs: Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-rabbit (1:200; by Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse (1:200; by Life Technologies) for 2\u2009h at room temperature. Slides were washed 3\u00d75\u2009min with PBS, dried, and cover-slipped using antifade mounting media with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (ProLong Gold; Life Technologies). Sections were observed under a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), and images were captured using NIS Elements (Version 3.22.11; Nikon). Images were then quantified using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD) at 40\u00d7 magnification. Values are expressed as percent area of positive staining. At least two pictures were taken of three sections, for a total of six to nine pictures per animal, and 3 animals were analyzed per group.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data are expressed as mean\u00b1standard error of the mean (SEM) with the number of animals per group indicated in the figure legends. Statistical analysis of differences in outcome measures was determined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and two-way ANOVA with repeated measures using GraphPad Prism 5.0 statistical software (Graphpad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA).

    "Methods": "Spinal lesions\nAll procedures used for this study were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee in accord with U.S. Department of Agriculture regulations. Bladder and urinary tract data were collected over many years from spinally injured animals used for our separately published electrophysiological/neural tracing studies of reproductive function. The data reported here are based on a comprehensive analysis of historical postoperative care data from those studies, obtained during the first 2 postoperative weeks. Some preliminary data using a less-rigorous analysis were reported earlier.\n35\nAdult Wistar rats, approximately 90 days of age, were anesthetized for surgery using a mixture of ketamine (80\u2009mg/kg intraperitoneally [i.p.]) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg i.p.). Surgeries were done under aseptic conditions. Before surgery, a long-acting antibiotic was administered subcutaneously (s.c.). In male rats, laminectomies of the caudal half of one vertebra were performed to expose one segment of the T6\u2013T9 spinal cord. One of the following types of lesions was made through a longitudinal dural incision using a pair of microdissecting scissors: complete spinal transection; bilateral dorsal columns; lateral hemisection; dorsal hemisection; or a lesion completely destroying the bilateral lateral funiculus in addition to bilateral dorsal columns (lesion micrographs and diagrams shown in\nFigs. 1\nand\n\u200b\nand2,\n2\n, respectively). After each lesion was performed, a small piece of thrombin-soaked absorbable gelatin sponge (Gelfoam; Pfizer, Inc., New York) was placed into the vertebral defect. The dura and overlying musculature were sutured with 10-0 and 4-0 monofilament, respectively, and the skin was closed with wound clips. In addition to the spinal-injured animals, 10 spinal injury shams were used as controls for effects of general anesthesia and laminectomy. Shams received all the same surgical procedures, but without the dural incision and spinal lesion. Postoperatively, an analgesic (Buprenex; Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Richmond, VA) was administered to alleviate postoperative discomfort. The antibiotic, gentamicin sulfate (5\u2009mg/kg), was administered s.c. for the first 5 postoperative days\n45\nto prevent UTIs.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExamples of histological sections from each of the animal groups with partial lesions of the T8 spinal cord. Lesion groups shown are the dorsal column (\nA\n), lateral hemisection (\nB\n), dorsal hemisection, which spared the ventral half of the lateral funiculus (\nC\n), and the dorsal column plus lateral funiculus, which spared the ventral funiculus (\nD\n). Photomicrographs were taken from paraffin sections near the lesion epicenter. Sections were stained with Luxol fast blue and cresyl violet (Kl\u00fcver-Barrera stain). The calibration bar applies to all sections. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nEffects of complete and partial spinal cord injury on recovery of bladder voiding and duration of hematuria in male rats. Postinjury onset (in days) of both \u201cperineal reflex\u201d voiding and \u201cautomatic\u201d voiding behavior in male rats was related to degree of bilateral damage to the lateral funiculus. Compared to total transection lesions, recovery of both voiding measures was significantly faster (*\np\n<0.01) in all groups. Recovery was fastest in animals with dorsal column lesions or lateral hemisections, when compared to the slower (\n#\np\n<0.05) recovery in animals with increased bilateral damage to the lateral funiculus (dorsal hemisection; dorsal columns/lateral funiculus). Duration of hematuria was significantly shorter than complete transection (*\np\n<0.01) only in animals with dorsal column lesions or lateral hemisections. There were no significant differences between the latter two lesion groups. The y-axis represents the number of days necessary for resolution of hematuria and perineal reflex-based and automatic bladder voiding onset in rats after receiving the following categories of spinal lesions: complete transaction; dorsal columns; lateral hemisection; dorsal hemisection; and dorsal columns plus lateral funiculus. Standard error bars are shown.\nA separate analysis of historical data was used to determine bladder reflex recovery and hematuria resolution times in male and female rats with a \u201csevere\u201d contusion injury to the T8 spinal cord by rapid compression with a concave probe having the same radius and size of the overlying T7 lamina and attached to a displacement-controlled device driven with a trapezoid waveform generator (2.0-mm displacement for 5\u2009sec\n46\n). This severe contusion injury spared a minimal number of axons through the epicenter,\n46\nbut did not completely sever the cord as occurs with spinal transection. All postoperative data on bladder reflex voiding and hematuria in female rats were obtained using the same procedures performed in males.\n\nPostoperative treatment and data collection\nAnimals recovered in a temperature-controlled environment while housed singly in plastic cages with wood shavings. Animals were examined three times daily at approximate 8-h intervals, 7 days a week. At these postoperative times, recorded as a one-third fraction of the postoperative day (e.g., 1.3 days, corresponding to a postoperative time of approximately 32\u2009h), animals were observed for evidence of infection or other complications and given an injection of sterile lactated Ringers solution (3 cubic centimeters [cc] injected s.c. every 8\u2009h) until measured water consumption returned to normal levels (approximately 40 cc/day). Bladder voiding function was evaluated during these sessions (at 8-h intervals) by first determining whether the bladder was distended (determined by gentle manual palpation) and, if so, whether bladder status was 1) \u201careflexic\u201d, that is, distended bladder required a gentle bladder squeeze for urine expression, a \u201ccrede maneuver,\u201d\n20\nor 2) \u201creflexive,\u201d that is, distended bladder required gentle tactile stroking stimulation of the perineum to initiate reflex voiding contractions. If the bladder was not distended, we noted that \u201cautomatic\u201d bladder voiding had occurred (i.e., spontaneously triggered by contact with cage bedding or otherwise without caretaker assistance). Caretakers were meticulously trained in the bladder palpation and expression technique and were blinded to severity of the spinal lesion. In addition to determining status of bladder voiding reflexes, the presence or absence of gross hematuria (i.e., visible blood in the urine) was recorded at each 8-h postoperative interval. However, it should be noted that slight levels of blood products in the urine not visible to the naked eye can only be determined with a dipstick or smear analysis, procedures that were not performed here. In all animals across all lesion groups, bladder voiding function had developed \u201cautomatic\u201d status and hematuria had resolved within a 2-week period after spinal lesion surgery.\n\nSpinal cord lesion reconstructions\nAt 1\u20132 months postinjury, each animal was anesthetized for a terminal experiment for which the obtained electrophysiological or neuroanatomical data have been reported in previously published data from the our labs, including those cited here.\n35\u201337\n,\n46\n,\n47\nFollowing those terminal experiments, animals were euthanized with an overdose of urethane and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. Specific spinal cord segment blocks from the T6\u2013T9 spinal cord were removed after careful confirmation of spinal segment number with cadaveric dissection of spinal nerves and vertebral segments. These blocks were embedded in paraffin and transversely sectioned at 8\u2009\u03bcm with a rotary microtome. Sections were stained with the standard Luxol fast blue (LFB) and cresyl violet procedure (Kl\u00fcver-Barrera stain\n48\n), which consisted of deparaffinization in xylene, dehydration in ethanol, overnight immersion in warm 0.1% LFB, two cycles of lithium carbonate with ethanol/distilled water rinse/wash, and 6-min immersion in warm cresyl violet. Precise reconstruction drawings were made of the injured cord to confirm the exact and total extent of the damage along the length of the entire lesion (in addition to the epicenter) by an observer blinded to both the surgical procedure and behavioral results,\n47\n,\n49\nthereby reducing the possibility of underestimating the size of the lesion while also verifying that specific spared WM regions were continuous through the mid-thoracic spinal cord. Lesions were then grouped into specific categories, eliminating those from analysis that did not fit the lesion extent criteria. The lesion categories were: complete transection, in which the cord was severed completely; dorsal columns lesion, which destroyed the dorsal columns bilaterally; lateral hemisection, which eliminated the entire left or right side of the cord (see\nFig. 1\n); dorsal hemisection, which ablated the dorsal columns and the more dorsal portions of the lateral funiculus bilaterally; and a lesion including both the dorsal columns and lateral funiculi bilaterally. Severity of the contusion injuries used in the second experiment resembled that of complete transections, although there was sometimes a thin rim of spared axons in some portions of the peripheral WM. All of these contusion injuries were classified as severe (using outcome measures we have described previously).\n20\n,\n46\n\nStatistical analysis\nDistribution normality tests were conducted for each set of grouped data, and because normal distributions were not verified in all cases, the more appropriate (and more conservative) nonparametric Mann-Whitney's rank-sum test was used to determine significant differences between group pairs. Levels of significance were between\np\n<0.001 and\np\n<0.05. Data are presented as mean\u00b1standard error of the mean."

    "Methods": "Experimental animals\nAdult male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (colony 236, Harlan, Indianapolis, IN; initial body weight \u223c300\u2009g) underwent unilateral SH. The Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all experimental procedures. All surgical procedures and experimental measurements were performed under appropriate anesthesia induced by intramuscular ketamine (90\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg) and maintained by intermittent repeat dosing as needed.\n\nSH\nThe surgical procedure for SH has been previously published.\n8\n,\n9\n,\n11\n,\n12\n,\n14\n,\n21\nBriefly, the cervical spinal cord was exposed with a bilateral dorsal laminectomy at C2, and the right anterolateral cord was transected at C2 (i.e., involving the lateral and ventral funiculi, and preserving the dorsal funiculus). All animals were observed daily after surgery, and intramuscular buprenorphine and oral acetaminophen were administered for the first 3 days.\n\nChronic diaphragm electromyographic (EMG) recordings\nA pair of electrode wires (0.28\u2009mm diameter - model AS631, Cooner Wire Inc., Chatsworth, CA) were stripped \u223c3\u2009mm at the tip, and implanted into both the right and left diaphragm midcostal regions at 3 days prior to the SH surgery, as previously described.\n14\n,\n21\n,\n42\u201346\nThe uninsulated portion was embedded within the diaphragm. The wires were tunneled subcutaneously to the dorsum of the animal and externalized. Diaphragm EMG activity was recorded in anesthetized rats during SH surgery and at 3 days post-SH (SH 3D) to verify absence of ipsilateral diaphragm activity and completeness of SH. Diaphragm EMG activity was also recorded during eupnea in anesthetized rats at 7 days post-SH (SH 7D) and 14 days post-SH (SH 14D). The EMG signal was differentially amplified (2000\u00d7), band-pass filtered (20\u20131000\u2009Hz), and analog-to-digitally converted at 2\u2009kHz using a LabView data acquisition board and software (National Instruments, Austin, TX). Signals were digitally stored until blinded analyses could be performed on the entire dataset.\n\nMSCs\nBDNF-green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing MSCs (BDNF-MSCs; obtained from G.E. Rooney at the Regenerative Medicine Institute, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland),\n36\n,\n40\n,\n41\nwere derived from the bone marrow of adult transgenic rats expressing GFP and transduced with murine leukemia virus-encoding BDNF. WT-MSCs were derived from the bone marrow of adult WT rats. Both WT-MSCs and BDNF-MSCs were grown to \u223c70% confluence in rat MSCs media (\u03b1MEM-F12, 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS], 1% penicillin-streptomycin) and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO\n2\nand 90% humidity. Media was changed every 3\u20134 days. MSCs were characterized by consistent cell surface expression of CD105 and lack of cell surface expression of CD45, indicating an undifferentiated MSCs phenotype. The amount of BDNF produced and released\nin vitro\nby BDNF-MSCs (\nn\n=5; passage 7\u201315, \u223c1.2\u00d710\n5\ncells/mL) and WT-MSCs (\nn\n=4; passage 11\u201312, \u223c1.4\u00d710\n5\ncells/mL) was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Human BDNF Quantikine kit, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) following the manufacturer's protocol. Duplicate assays showed that BDNF-MSCs released significantly greater levels of BDNF compared to WT-MSCs (37.9\u00b17.9 compared to 0.2\u00b10.01\u2009ng/mL, respectively;\np\n=0.004).\nAt the time of the SH surgery, animals were randomly assigned to the following groups: BDNF-MSCs treated (\nn\n=7), WT-MSCs treated (\nn\n=4) and untreated (\nn\n=6). For\nin vivo\ntransplantation, MSCs were resuspended at a concentration of \u223c5\u00d710\n4\ncells/\u03bcL in sterile media containing F-12. Around the site of SH injury (C2 level), 2\u2009\u03bcL of cell suspension were injected unilaterally \u223c1\u2009mm rostral and \u223c1\u2009mm caudal to the C2 level using a Hamilton syringe (total injected volume, 4\u2009\u03bcL), 2\u2009mm lateral to midline and at a depth of 3.5\u2009mm (corresponding to the anterolateral funiculus). The concentration of cells injected\nin vivo\n(200,000 cells total) would be expected to generate \u223c24.4\u2009ng BDNF per day in BDNF-MSCs treated SH animals compared with \u223c0.2\u2009ng BDNF per day in WT-MSCs treated SH animals. In preliminary studies, survival of transplanted BDNF-MSCs at the site of injection was confirmed at 1 day post-transplantation.\n\nEMG analyses\nAs in previous studies,\n14\n,\n21\n,\n46\ntwo outcome measures defining functional recovery were determined from EMG analyses: 1) the proportion of animals displaying recovery of rhythmic ipsilateral diaphragm EMG activity; and 2) the amplitude of the ipsilateral diaphragm root mean squared (RMS) EMG signal (i.e., extent of functional recovery). The criteria for classification of functional recovery included a diaphragm EMG signal that: 1) was both rhythmic (i.e., in phase with contralateral signal) and periodic (i.e., occurring across multiple eupneic bursts); 2) was composed of more than one motor unit; and 3) displayed RMS EMG amplitude >10% of the pre-SH amplitude. For each recording period (i.e., D0, D3, D7, and D14) and hemidiaphragm, RMS EMG amplitude was calculated using a moving window of 50\u2009ms.\n21\n,\n44\n,\n47\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nIn BDNF-MSCs treated SH animals, cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) (List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA) was used to retrogradely label phrenic motoneurons by intrapleural injection at 3 days before the terminal experiment, as previously reported.\n12\n,\n48\n,\n49\nAt SH 14D, rats were anesthetized, euthanized by exsanguination after administration of heparin, and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cervical spinal cord was excised and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, and then transferred to 24% sucrose in PBS for 24\u201372\u2009h. Longitudinal 50\u2009\u03bcm thick sections were cut with a Reichert\u2013Jung Frigocut cryostat (Reichert Microscope Services, Depew, NY). Spinal cord sections were blocked with 10% donkey serum in 0.3% Triton tris-buffered saline (TBS), followed by overnight incubation with CTB antibody (goat polyclonal, #703; List Biological Laboratories) and GFP antibody (rabbit polyclonal, ab6556; Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Secondary antibodies DyLight 649-conjugated anti-goat and Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) were used. Tissue sections were mounted on slides, dehydrated in graded alcohol concentrations, and cover-slipped with DPX mountant (Fluka, Sigma\u2013Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).\n\nPrimary antibody validation\nImmunoreactivity with the GFP antibody was previously validated in the rat spinal cord by using intrapleural delivery of AAV7 expressing GFP (2\u00d710\n11\ngenome copies/animal), which specifically transduces phrenic motoneurons present in the cervical ventral horn region.\n46\nGFP immunoreactivity was absent in spinal cord from control (untreated) rats. In addition, we confirmed that the GFP antibody recognized a single band (\u223c27\u2009kDa) in Western blot analyses of rat spinal cord that was treated with AAV7-GFP.\nImmunoreactivity with the CTB antibody was validated by lack of staining in the spinal cords of rats not injected with intrapleural CTB. Retrogradely labeled phrenic motoneurons in rats injected with CTB had a staining pattern identical to previous studies.\n12\n,\n46\n,\n48\n,\n49\n\nConfocal microscopy\nSpinal cord sections were imaged using a Nikon C1 laser scanning confocal system (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) mounted on an upright Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope with argon (488\u2009nm) and solid state (561 and 640\u2009nm) lasers. Phrenic motoneurons and GFP immunoreactivity were imaged with a 20\u00d7oil immersion lens (NA 0.75), as well as GFP autofluoresence, to define the borders of white and gray matter in the spinal cord. The entire width of the cervical spinal cord was imaged from the C2 to C4 segments, with individual images having a 10% overlap to allow for stitching. Nikon Elements (version 4.13, Nikon Instruments) was used to stitch individual images to create the merged three channel image. Images were exported into Adobe Photoshop (version 7.0), and, as needed, were changed to gray scale and inverted, and levels were adjusted linearly. For each primary/secondary antibody pair, additional studies, not including the primary antibody (blank), were conducted. Sections from both experimental groups and blank controls were processed in parallel for all immunohistochemical reactions and animals.\n\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical evaluations were performed using JMP statistical software (version 9.0.1, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The proportion of animals displaying functional recovery was compared across groups using Pearson's \u03c7\n2\ntest. Diaphragm RMS EMG amplitude was normalized to the eupneic value before SH for the same animal, and differences between treatment groups were examined using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Statistical significance was established at the 0.05 level. All experimental data are presented as mean\u00b1SE, unless otherwise specified."

    "Methods": "Piglets\nAll protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania. Four-week-old female piglets (\nn\n=20) were housed in groups and were maintained in a 12:12\u2009h light:dark cycle before and concurrent with testing. They were allowed food and water\nad libitum\nuntil 2\u2009h before the experiment, at which point they were only allowed access to water.\n\nAnesthesia and euthanasia\nAt the beginning of the experiment, animals were induced with an intramuscular injection of ketamine (20\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (2\u2009mg/kg), followed by 4% isoflurane inhaled via snout mask until deep anesthesia was achieved. They were intubated and mechanically ventilated. Animals received femoral arterial and venous catheters using standard cutdown technique. After catheter placement, they received a physiologic saline bolus of 20\u2009mL/kg, which could be repeated up to two times during the baseline period (before injury) as needed to maintain normotension. Bolus doses of fentanyl and midazolam (50\u2009\u03bcg/kg and 1\u2009mg/kg intravenously [IV], respectively) were given, followed by cessation of isoflurane and transition to total IV anesthetic with a combination of infusions, including fentanyl (100\u2009\u03bcg/kg/h), midazolam (1\u2009mg/kg/h), and dexmedetomidine (0.2\u2009\u03bcg/kg/h). For ongoing hydration, animals received a physiologic saline infusion (4\u2009mL/kg/h). After completion of the experiment, animals were euthanized with phenobarbital 150\u2009mg/kg IV bolus.\n\nMaintenance and monitoring\nAfter intubation, mechanical ventilation parameters were a tidal volume of 10\u2009mL/kg, a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5, a respiratory rate of 35, and an FiO\n2\nof 28\u201330%. Animals were connected to standard cardiorespiratory monitors (Surgivet V9204, Smiths Medical, Dublin, OH), and a rectal probe was placed for continuous temperature monitoring (Gaymar Industries, Inc, Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI). Vital signs, including heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), respiratory rate (RR), end tidal CO\n2\n(ETCO\n2\n), pulse oximetry (SpO\n2\n), and temperature were monitored continuously and recorded at least every 15\u2009min throughout the experiment. Response to a reflexive toe pinch was also assessed and recorded every 15\u2009min to monitor anesthetic depth. An arterial blood gas (ABG) was collected every 30\u2009min. PEEP and FiO\n2\nwere not adjusted during the experiment. Minute ventilation was occasionally adjusted to maintain a PaCO\n2\nof \u223c40\u201345\u2009mm Hg. Temperature was maintained from 37\u201338\u00b0C using a warming pad.\n\nExperimental groups and injury\nPiglets were designated as injured (\nn\n=10) or shams (\nn\n=10). Sham animals were anesthetized and instrumented with the previously described protocol for the length of the experiment. For injury, piglet heads were rotated rapidly 60 degrees in the sagittal plane without impact using a pneumatic device previously described,\n33\u201335\nwhich results in higher levels of intracranial pressure and unconscious time than other planes of head rotation.\n38\nVelocity, measured using an angular rate sensor (ATA, Albuquerque, NM) attached to the side arm of the pneumatic device, averaged 149.3\u00b13.1\u2009rad/sec. Subsequently, all animals were positioned prone for the remainder of the experiment.\n\nDoppler ultrasonography\nUltrasonographic assessments were taken at time points held consistent between animals: immediately before injury (baseline), immediately after injury (denoted as time 0 in graphs but was typically 1\u20133\u2009min post-injury), and at post-injury minutes 15, 30, 45, and 60. All measurements were taken by the same person to provide consistent technique, and the left side was always imaged before the right to minimize small time-related differences. Using a Sequoia Acuson C256 (Siemans Medical Solutions USA, Inc, Malvern, PA) with a 15L8 linear transducer, ultrasound gel, and a consistent technique for localization, the bilateral common carotid arteries were identified in the longitudinal plane using grayscale scanning. This resulted in the end of the probe approximately 1 inch from the humeral head. Positioning was further confirmed with color Doppler to ensure imaging of arterial rather than venous flow, and imaging parameters were then manually optimized (color gain, pulse repetition frequency (PRF)).\nFollowing consistent identification of the left or right common carotid artery, five grayscale images were recorded digitally for repeated diameter measurements. Spectral Doppler was then used to digitally record three different 5-sec intervals of waveforms for repeated velocity measurements. Imaging of the left and right sides took approximately 3\u2009min total to complete for each time point.\n\nImage processing\nAll ultrasonography images were processed using Showcase Clinical Case Presentation Tools (version 5.3.0.0, Trillium Technologies, Inc, Ann Arbor, MI), a medical image analysis software program frequently used for ultrasonography analyses. From each of the five grayscale diameter images recorded, a typical diameter was obtained along the length of the vessel. The five diameter measurements from that time point from that vessel were then averaged into a single diameter measurement for a given side and time point.\nFrom the three waveform images, a total of five waveforms for each side for each time point were analyzed. This was completed using the first full waveform of each image and the third full waveform from the first and second recorded image. Waveforms were manually traced in Showcase, which then computed output waveform data. These data included the velocity time integral (VTI, the area underneath the entire waveform curve) and the peak systolic velocity (Vmax). The time over which each waveform occurred (dT) was also measured, and the average velocity for the waveform was calculated by dividing the VTI by the dT. This was completed for each of the five velocity waveforms for that time point and vessel and averaged to obtain a single average velocity measurement for a given side and time point.\nCommon carotid artery flow was calculated using the equation Flow=(0.25)\u03c0D\n2\nV, using the average diameter and average velocity for a given side and time point.\n\nData analysis\nPrimary outcomes were measured carotid artery diameter and velocity, and calculated flow. Unless otherwise specified in the\nresults\nsection, all post-injury measurements were normalized to baseline values. Three-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) were completed for group, time, and side.\nPost-hoc\nTukey-Kramer analyses were used to confirm statistical differences. All statistical analyses were completed using JMP (version 10.0.0, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC)."

    "Methods": "Survivors and assessment\nSurvivors who had an MVC and visited an ED within 48\u2009h of the accident were recruited from EDs of local Level I centers. The study included English-speaking adults (18\u201360 years old) of all races/ethnicities, but excluded pregnant women or survivors who were under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs when the accident happened. Survivors were also excluded if they had Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores less than 13 or any abnormality on conventional CT examination in the ED. An Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score was calculated to evaluate the severity of physical injury in each survivor (Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine, 1998 update), and survivors with an AIS score greater than 3 were excluded. All survivors gave written Institutional Review Board approved informed consent. All survivors were alert and oriented on testing. Most selected survivors had severe acute pain as measured with the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS; \u22656) in the ED.\nSurvivors completed self-report measures in the ED that included questionnaires about the incidence and duration of LOC and PTA, as well as other information about the MVC. To provide information on traumatic stress symptoms at each MRI session, survivors completed a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Checklist-Stressor Version (PCL) questionnaire, in which the MVC was specified as the index traumatic event.\n32\n,\n33\nSurvivors' physical health was evaluated during the follow-up session using questionnaires, during which they were asked to estimate the number of days when some of their usual activities could not be performed. Police traffic reports were obtained from the Ohio Department of Public Safety\nhttps://ext.dps.state.oh.us/CrashRetrieval/OHCrashRetrieval.aspx\nto confirm information on the MVC collected in EDs.\n\nmTBI diagnosis\nmTBI was diagnosed by reviewing ED medical records and self-report questionnaires. According to the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine (ACRM) criteria, persons who experienced head impact or acceleration-deceleration during MVC are considered to have sustained mTBI if they had LOC for <30\u2009min, PTA for <24\u2009h, or severe neurological symptoms such as disorientation, dizziness, or headache.\n1\nSurvivors with a GCS score less than 13 or positive radiological examinations for any brain lesions were excluded. Survivors who did not experience any concussive symptoms served as a non-mTBI control group. All survivors were invited to undergo an initial MRI session within 2 weeks and a follow-up MRI session at 3 months after MVC.\n\nMRI data acquisition\nSurvivors were scanned using a 3.0 Tesla General Electric Signa HDX MRI scanner at the University of Toledo. Survivors were positioned in the MRI scanner with their heads comfortably restrained to reduce movement. Heart rate and respiration were monitored throughout the experiment. A high-resolution T1-weighted aMRI image was obtained with a 3-D Volume Inversion Recovery Fast Spoiled Gradient Recall Echo (IR-FSPGR) protocol (repetition time [TR]=7.9\u2009msec, echo time [TE]=3\u2009msec, TI=650\u2009msec, field of view [FOV]=25.6\u00d725.6\u2009cm, matrix=256\u00d7256, slice thickness=1\u2009mm with no gap, voxel dimensions=1\u00d71\u00d71mm, 164 contiguous axial slices to cover the whole brain).\n34\nT2*-weighted images were acquired with Echo Planar Imaging pulse sequence: multiphase gradient echo pulse sequence, (TR=2000\u2009msec, TE=30\u2009msec, flip angle (FA)=90\u00b0, FOV=3.75\u00d73.75\u2009mm, matrix=64\u00d764, slice thickness=3.5\u2009mm with no gap, 34 axial interleveled slices to cover the whole brain. Both images were reviewed by an experienced radiologist to screen for any clinical abnormalities.\n\nCortical thickness measurement\nAutomated cortical thickness measurements were made on a Linux workstation from the aMRI images with FreeSurfer programs (version 4.5.1) (\nhttp://www.surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki\n)\n35\u201337\nthat have been shown to be valid and reliable.\n34\n,\n38\u201340\nStructural analyses involved preprocessing high resolution T1-weighted MRI data (including motion correction, transformation to Talairach space, intensity normalization, skull stripping, segmentation, tessellation, smoothing of the cortical gray/white border, and inflating sulci to create a spherical model of each hemisphere).\nThickness measures were based on spatial intensity gradients of white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid and were derived from determination of the average of the shortest distances from the gray/white border to pial surface and from the pial surface to gray/white border for each vertex (1\u00d71\u2009mm\n2\narea on the surface). Cortical thickness measure iteration of this process provided a continuous grid of vertex thickness measures covering each hemisphere (approximately 150,000 vertices/hemisphere). All individual MRI slices were visually inspected and inaccuracies in borders were manually corrected if necessary.\nA vertex-based group analysis was performed using Freesurfer. Individual spherical models of hemispheres were normalized to the spherical atlas of Freesurfer based on alignment of the cortical folding patterns.\n41\nThe normalized cortical thickness maps of individuals were spatially smoothed along the surface using a two-dimensional Gaussian filter with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) kernel of 8\u2009mm. Group comparisons of cortical thickness were performed at every vertex using a general linear model (GLM) of two independently sampled\nt\ntests, controlling for age and sex.\nA cluster-wise correction for multiple comparisons within each hemisphere was performed by means of Z Monte Carlo simulations as implemented in Freesurfer.\n42\u201344\nThe data were tested against an empirical null distribution of maximum cluster size across 5000 iterations synthesized with an initial cluster forming at vertex-wise threshold of\np\n<0.01. Differences were considered significant after a multiple comparison correction with a cluster-wise\np\nvalue<0.05 and a surface area >50\u2009mm\n2\n.\n43\n,\n45\nThe minimal size is set relatively low to detect the small, subtle brain changes that are characteristic of mTBI. The cluster-wise\np\nvalue is a False Positive Rate (FPR), meaning that a cluster of the given size would occur by chance only 5% of the time (\np\n<0.05). The cluster-wise correction using Z Monte Carlo simulations is considered suitable for surface-based analysis and is recommended by the FreeSurfer group. These significant clusters were defined as regions of interest (ROIs) and were studied longitudinally by extracting and comparing regional mean cortical thickness from each survivor's initial and follow-up scans."

    "Methods": "Sample and procedure\nUsing publicly available contact information, coaches and/or athletic trainers at 110 NCAA Division I FCS schools were contacted before the start of the 2013 football season and invited to have their team members participate in a survey-based research study about concussions in U.S. collegiate football. A convenience sample of 734 athletes from 10 teams whose coach and/or athletic trainer expressed interest participated in the study. Teams represented seven separate states, including those in the Northeast (four teams), the Midwest (five teams), and the South (one team). A total of 230 athletes identified themselves as freshmen, 164 sophomores, 189 juniors, 134 seniors, and 17 \u201cother\u201d (primarily fifth-year students). Overall, 730 athletes indicated their primary playing position and were included in the present analyses. Detailed sample characteristics can be found in\nTable 1\n. All surveys were completed in person using paper and pen in a group setting. The same member of the research team (C.M.B.) described the study, distributed the surveys, answered any questions as they arose during survey completion, and collected surveys. All surveys were administered during the 2013 fall football season.

These included the following three questions, with regard to two separate time points (last football season [2012] and their entire football career): \u201cHow many times have you been diagnosed with a concussion by a medical professional (doctor, athletic trainer, nurse)?\u201d; \u201cHow many times have you sustained an impact that you suspect was a concussion but that was never diagnosed?\u201d; and \u201cHow many times did you get a ding or get your bell rung?\u201d\nReturning to play while experiencing symptoms\nAthletes were asked to write in their numeric responses to the question, \u201cHow many times have you returned to a game or practice while experiencing symptoms after a hit?\u201d with respect to the 2 weeks preceding the survey, the 2012 football season, and their entire football career. Additionally, using items adapted from Kaut and colleagues' Head Injury Questionnaire (HIQ),\n59\nathletes were also asked how frequently the following things happened to them in the 2012 football season: experienced symptoms after a hit but continued to play in a game or practice; experienced symptoms after a hit but did not tell coaches or athletic trainers; and experienced symptoms the day after a hit but did not report them. Responses options were: never; once per season; once per month; once per week; once per day; or more than once per day.\nFrequency of concussion-related symptoms\nUsing items adapted from Kaut and colleagues' HIQ,\n59\nathletes were asked how frequently each of the following things happened to them during the 2012 football season: dizziness after a hit; had their bell rung; lost consciousness after a hit; saw stars after a hit; vomited or felt nauseous after a hit; forgot what to do on the field after a hit; headache at least once during the week after a hit; and problems studying, concentrating, or doing classwork after a hit. Responses options were: never; once per season; once per month; once per week; once per day; or more than once per day.\nConcussion reporting intention\nAthletes were asked to indicate how strongly they agreed with the following statement: \u201cI intend to report my concussion symptoms,\u201d using a 7-point Likert scale with response options ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).\nContact practice\nAthletes were asked to write in their numeric responses to questions regarding the frequency of participation in various types of football practices. The item stem was, \u201cIn a typical game week, how many times per week do you have\u2026\u201d with the following specific options appended: full-contact practice (includes tackling to the ground and hitting drills); full pads, limited contact practice; half pads/shells/uppers practice; and helmets only/walk through practice.\nDemographic characteristics\nAthletes were asked to select their year in school, age in years, age at which they began playing contact football, duration of their football career to date, and their primary football playing position.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll analyses were conducted using SPSS statistical software (v.20; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). An alpha level of 0.05 was used for all analyses. Based on precedent in previous literature,\n29\u201333\nresponses to primary playing position were combined into the following nine position groups: offensive linemen (includes: offensive center, guard, and tackle); defensive linemen (includes: defensive end and defensive tackle); running backs (includes: fullback and running back); linebackers (includes: middle linebacker and outside linebacker); defensive backs (includes: cornerback and safety); special teams (includes: punter and kicker); tight ends; wide receivers; and quarterbacks. When coding the numbers of diagnosed concussions, undiagnosed concussions, and \u201cdings,\u201d only numeric entries were included with the exception of the following: \u201cnone\u201d was entered as 0; \u201ccouple\u201d was entered as 2; and \u201cfew\u201d was entered as 3. When ranges were written, the average was used (e.g., 5\u201310 was coded as 7.5). When responses such as \u201c10+,\u201d \u201c10's,\u201d or \u201c\u226510\u201d were written, the lowest value endorsed was coded (for all examples provided, 10 would have been coded). Ten percent of the data were randomly selected and entered by a second coder to assess data entry error, which was found to be <0.01%. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine differences between position groups in the following outcome variables: symptom frequency; intention to report concussion symptoms; returning to play with symptoms; and practice style frequency. Differences in respondent demographic characteristics by playing position were similarly assessed. Following a significant\nF\ntest, Tukey's post-hoc tests were used to examine differences between position-group categories. Kruskal-Wallis' nonparametric ANOVAs were used to examine differences in concussion-diagnosis outcomes and write in return to play outcomes between position groups, given that these outcomes were not normally distributed based on measures of skewness and kurtosis. All outcome variables were then examined using generalized linear model (GLM) regressions to examine whether differences by primary playing position may be attributable to team membership or differences in duration of football career. Offensive linemen were selected as the referent position group for all GLM regressions."

    "Methods": "Animals\nIn this study, male C57/BL6 mice (23\u201329\u2009g) purchased from Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany were used. All mice had free access to water and food. Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the institutional guidelines of the animal care institutions of the University of Munich and approved by the Bavarian government (protocol number 55.2-1-54-2531-117-05).\n\nAnesthesia\nAnimals were anesthetized as described previously.\n29\nBriefly, anesthesia was induced with 4% isoflurane in a gas-tight chamber and maintained by intraperitoneal (IP) injection of midazolam (5\u2009mg/kg KG, Dormicum,\n\u00ae\nRoche, Basel, Switzerland), fentanyl (0.05\u2009mg/kg, Janssen-Cilag, Neuss, Germany), and medetomidine (0.5\u2009mg/kg, Pfizer, Karlsruhe, Germany). Body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C by a feedback-controlled heating pad (FHC, Bowdoin, ME). Anesthesia was terminated by IP injection of atipamezole (2.5\u2009mg/kg; Pfizer, Karlsruhe, Germany), naloxone (1.2\u2009mg/kg; Inresa, Freiburg, Germany), and flumazenil (0.5\u2009mg/kg; Hoffmann-La-Roche, Grenzach-Wyhlen, Germany). For short-term anesthesia (<30\u2009min) animals received 30% O\n2\nby a face mask. For long-term anesthesia, animals were intubated with an orotracheal tube and mechanically ventilated with 30% O\n2\n(Minivent, Hugo Sachs, Germany) as described previously.\n29\n\nPhysiological monitoring\nFor the investigation of systemic changes in vital parameters after application of SR-49059 and SR-121463A, we measured end-tidal pCO\n2\n, noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in two separate experimental series. After induction of anesthesia, mice were intubated, mechanically ventilated, and fixed in a stereotactic frame with a nose clamp. Microcapnometry (CI240, Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) was used to maintain arterial pCO\n2\nbetween 35 and 40\u2009mm Hg.\n29\nArterial blood gases were assessed with a blood gas analyzer (Chiron 860, Bayer, Germany) at the end of each experiment.\nSystolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured by a NIBP monitoring system (RTBP 2000, Kent Scientific, Torrington, CT) with a custom-made adjustable tail-cuff device.\n29\nrCBF was assessed in the parietal cortex contralateral to the injury by laser-Doppler fluxmetry (Periflux 4001 Master, Perimed, Sweden).\n30\nFor this purpose, a laser-Doppler probe was attached to the temporal bone (\nFig. 1\n). Data were collected and recorded with a PC data acquisition system (A/D converter PCI 9112, Adlink Technology, Taiwan; Software: Dasylab 5.0, IED GmbH, Hamburg, Germany).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSchematic drawing of a mouse skull with the location of trephination, contusion, and the positions of the laser-Doppler probe, measurement of intracranial pressure (ICP), and the intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of the vasopressin receptor antagonists.\n\nCCI\nAfter induction of anesthesia, animals were fixed in a stereotactic frame with a nose clamp, the scalp was incised midline, and a craniotomy of 4\u00d74\u2009mm was performed posterolateral to the bregma over the right hemisphere leaving the dura mater intact (\nFig. 1\n). CCI (Mouse-Katjuscha 2000, L. Kopacz, University of Mainz, Germany) was performed immediately after opening the skull as described previously.\n21\n,\n31\n,\n32\nBriefly, the impact was applied perpendicular to the dura with the following parameters: piston diameter: 3\u2009mm; penetration depth: 1\u2009mm; velocity: 8\u2009m/sec; and impact duration: 150\u2009msec. The initially removed bone flap was glued back (Histoacryl,\n\u00ae\nBraun-Melsungen, Melsungen, Germany), and the scalp was sutured. After antagonizing anesthesia mice were put into an incubator heated to 35\u00b0C until recovery of spontaneous motor activity.\n\nMeasurement of ICP\nICP was measured 24\u2009h after trauma using a microprobe with a pressure transducer microchip at the tip (\u00d8 0.9\u2009mm, MIPM, Mammendorf, Germany). The microprobe was inserted 1\u2009mm rostral and 1\u2009mm lateral to the bregma of the traumatized hemisphere at a depth of 3\u2009mm (\nFig. 1\n).\n31\n\nDetermination of brain water content\nMice were sacrificed 24\u2009h after CCI by cervical dislocation under deep isoflurane anesthesia. Brains were sampled in toto, cerebellum, brain stem, and olfactory bulb removed, and hemispheres divided using a brain matrix (Kent Scientific). The brains were weighted immediately to obtain their wet weight (w.w.) and afterward dried at 110\u00b0C for 24\u2009h, followed by the measurement of the dry weight (d.w.). Brain water content was then calculated by the following formula: ([w.w.-d.w.]/w.w.)\u00d7100.\n21\n\nQuantification of contusion volume\nAnimals were euthanized 24\u2009h after CCI in deep isoflurane anesthesia. Brains were removed, immediately frozen in dry ice, and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. Coronal sections with a thickness of 10\n\u03bc\nm were sliced every 500\n\u03bc\nm with a cryostat (CryoStar HM 560, Microm, Germany), dry fixed, stained with Nissl staining, and photographed with a digital camera system connected to a microscope. The contused brain tissue was then measured on the digital photographs using standard image analysis software (Olympus DP-soft, Germany) by an investigator blinded to the treatment of the animals. Contusion volume (V) was calculated as described previously based on the contused area (A) on 15 consecutive coronal brain sections 500\u2009\u03bcm (d) apart using the following formula: V=d\u00d7(A\n1\n\u00d70.5+A\n2\n+A\n3\n\u2026+A\n15\n\u00d70.5).\n\nDrug administration\nThe inhibition of V\n1a\nand V\n2\nreceptors was performed by using the selective antagonists SR-49059 (V\n1a\nreceptor antagonist) and SR-121463A (V\n2\nreceptor antagonist) (Sanofi Aventis, Toulouse, France).\n27\n,\n28\nFor IP administration, 1 or 10\u2009\u03bcg SR-49059/g body weight (BW) were dissolved in 18.5\u2009\u03bcL water/g BW with 10% dimethylformamide (DMF) (Serradeil-Le Gal et al, 1993). SR-121463A was applied IP at 0.1 and 1\u2009\u03bcg/g BW and dissolved in 18.5\u2009\u03bcL saline/g BW.\n28\nCompounds and vehicles were applied 10\u2009min after TBI.\nFor ICV administration, 1.08\u2009\u03bcg, 540\u2009ng, and 270\u2009ng SR-49059 were dissolved in 2\u2009\u03bcL water with 10% DMF resulting in dosages of 40, 20, and 10\u2009ng/g BW, respectively. SR-121463A was applied at 108\u2009ng dissolved in 2\u2009\u03bcL saline. The dissolved compounds (or vehicle) were given ICV 3\u2009min after TBI contralateral to the trauma site (0.9\u2009mm left, 0.1\u2009mm posterior, and 3.1\u2009mm deep relative to the bregma) over a period of 2\u2009min\u2014i.e., at a rate of 1\u2009\u03bcL/min (\nFig. 1\n). Because ICV injections necessitate scalp closure after injection, we used this protocol to keep the anesthesia time equal in all groups.\n\nExperimental design\nThe current study consists of five different experimental series. To determine potential physiological changes induced by the receptor antagonists or their respective vehicles, we performed two experimental series (A+B) to measure pCO\n2\n, NIBP, and rCBF after administration of the compound and performing CCI. PCO\n2\n, NIBP, and rCBF were measured every 5\u2009min during the whole experiment. As soon as these parameters reached a stable baseline value, receptor antagonists or vehicles were administered in a blinded manner. At 20 minutes later, trephination, and after another 10 minutes, CCI was performed as described above. Subsequent to CCI, the parameters were measured for a further 30\u2009min until the animals were sacrificed.\n(A) For physiological parameters after IP administration, four groups were formed: 10% DMF (control,\nn\n=10), 10\u2009\u03bcg SR-49059/g (BW) (\nn\n=10), saline (control,\nn\n=5), and 1\u2009\u03bcg SR-121463A/g (BW) (\nn\n=8).\n(B) For physiological parameters after ICV administration, another four groups were investigated: 10% DMF (control,\nn\n=8), 1.08\u2009\u03bcg SR-49059 (\nn\n=7), saline (control,\nn\n=5), and 108\u2009ng SR-121463A (\nn\n=7).\nThree treatment series were performed (C\u2013E). After IP injection solely contusion volume were measured. In animals receiving ICV application, we analyzed in addition to contusion volume brain edema formation and ICP levels.\n(C) Contusion volume 24\u2009h after CCI and IP administration of the receptor antagonists were investigated in seven different groups: 15\u2009min survival (\nn\n=8), 24\u2009h saline (control,\nn\n=6), 10% DMF (control,\nn\n=8), 1\u03bcg SR-49059/g (BW) (\nn\n=7), 10\u2009\u03bcg SR-49059/g (BW) (\nn\n=8), 0.1\u2009\u03bcg SR-121463A/g (BW) (\nn\n=8) and 1\u2009\u03bcg SR-121463A/g (BW) (\nn\n=7).\n(D) Contusion volume 24\u2009h after CCI and ICV administration of the receptor antagonists were investigated in five different groups: 15\u2009min survival (\nn\n=7), 24\u2009h saline (control,\nn\n=7), 10% DMF (control,\nn\n=7), 1.08\u2009\u03bcg SR-49059 (\nn\n=7), and 108\u2009ng SR-121463A (\nn\n=7).\n(E) For measurement of changes in post-traumatic brain edema and ICP 24\u2009h after CCI and ICV administration of the receptor antagonists, we performed a series of six groups: sham (\nn\n=8), 24\u2009h saline (control,\nn\n=7), 1.08\u2009\u03bcg SR-49059 (\nn\n=7), 540\u2009ng SR-49059 (\nn\n=7), 270\u2009ng SR-49059 (\nn\n=7), and 108\u2009ng SR-121463A (\nn\n=7).\nIn all described experiments, animals were randomly assigned to the different treatment groups and the investigator, who performed animal surgery, was blinded in terms of the treatment.\n\nStatistical analysis\nMeasurements over time (BP, rCBF) were tested versus baseline with Friedman repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) on Ranks followed by Student-Newman-Keuls All Pairwise Multiple Comparison Procedure as a\npost hoc\ntest. Differences between groups were tested by the Kruskal-Wallis test for nonparametric one-way ANOVA followed by Student-Newman-Keuls All Pairwise Multiple Comparison Procedure as a\npost hoc\ntest.

    "Methods": "Patients, randomization, and blinding\nThe study covered the period from December 2002 to September 2008. It was designed as a multicenter RCT with prospective analyses and blinded assessment of neurological outcomes. The protocol and consent procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of each participating hospital. The study was registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN-CTR, No. C000000231) in Japan and the National Institutes of Health (Clinical Trials.gov Identifier NCT00134472) in the United States of America. The randomization list was automatically generated by the UMIN computer system to allocate patients in a 2:1 ratio to receive TH (32\u201334\u00b0C) or fever control (35.5\u201337\u00b0C). The temperature of the control group was set to 35.5\u201337\u00b0C for ethical reasons, because MTH was reported to be effective in adult cardiac arrest/resuscitated patients at that time.\n1\n,\n2\nWe also attempted to try quick initiation of temperature managements in which cooling was allowed to be 35.5\u00b0C before the randomization in both groups, to prolong duration of hypothermia (>72\u2009h), to reduce rewarming speed (<1.0\u00b0C/day) and to randomize for two parameters (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] scores 4\u20135 and 6\u20138; ages 15\u201345 years and 46\u201369 years) in each participating hospital.\nInclusion criteria were age 15\u201369 years for both sexes, GCS score of 4\u20138, and ability to initiate cooling within 2\u2009h after the onset of TBI. Patients with any of the following were excluded: good motor response (GCS motor response=6), systolic blood pressure <90\u2009mm Hg after fluid and vasopressor resuscitation, platelet count <50,000 /mm\n3\n, severe pre-existing medical conditions (e.g., liver, kidney, or heart failure, or severe arrhythmia), acute myocardial infarction, pregnancy, severe alcohol intoxication that prevented assessment of consciousness, penetrating brain injury, epidural hematoma without brain parenchymal injury, or core body temperature <30\u00b0C. Eligible patients were enrolled and their core temperature was lowered to the desired temperature as quickly as possible. Head computed tomography (CT) scans were performed and evaluated on admission and after rewarming in all patients.\nAfter obtaining written informed consent from the patient's legally authorized representative, the patient was randomized to either TH or fever control based on the randomization list. An Internet-based enrolment system managed by the UMIN enabled instant randomization for the patient upon admission at each participating site. Patient private information was secured. If informed consent could not be obtained within 2\u2009h of admission, the consent policy was waived.\n\nTreatments\nCore body temperature was measured by a thermistor coupled to an internal jugular venous catheter. If the catheter could not be inserted, body temperature was measured in another site that was selected in the following order: pulmonary artery, bladder, rectum, and tympanic membrane. In addition to critical neurological care,\n23\nan arterial catheter, a pulmonary arterial catheter, and an intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring probe were inserted to maintain hemodynamic status and ICP at the following levels: mean arterial pressure (MAP)>80\u2009mmHg, cardiac index (CI)>2.5\u2009L/min/m\n2\n, systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) 800\u20131200 dynes/sec/cm\n5\n, ICP<20\u2009mm Hg, and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP)>60\u2009mm Hg. The partial pressures of arterial oxygen (PaO\n2\n) and carbon dioxide (PaCO\n2\n) were maintained at>100\u2009mm Hg and 30\u201340\u2009mm Hg, respectively. If ICP was>20\u2009mm Hg, any treatment recommended by the Japanese guidelines could be applied, including mannitol/glycerol and/or a bolus infusion of barbiturates,\n23\nbut not continuous infusion of barbiturates, because of the enormous suppressive effects on cardiac function. Hyperventilation was allowed, but excessive hypocapnia<30\u2009mm Hg was prohibited. ICP could also be reduced by decompressive craniectomy. Anticonvulsants were allowed as deemed necessary.\nCooling blankets, rapid cold fluid infusion (up to 1000\u2009mL saline, human plasma products, or dextrose-free plasma expanders), and/or cold gastric lavage could be used during the induction phase in both groups. The aim was to achieve the target temperature within 6\u2009h after the onset of TBI. The desired temperature was to be maintained for \u226572\u2009h, mainly using surface cooling blankets, in each group. The patient was rewarmed at a rate of <1\u00b0C/day and core body temperature was maintained at <38\u00b0C for 7 days after the onset of TBI.\nOur sedation protocol specified either midazolam (0.2\u20130.4\u2009mg/kg/h) and non-narcotic analgesics for patients treated between December 2002 and April 2005, or neuroleptic analgesia (NLA) (25\u2009\u03bcg/kg/h droperidol and 1\u2009\u03bcg/kg/h fentanyl) for patients treated between May 2005 and May 2008. Vecronium (0.05\u2009mg/kg/h) or pancuronium (0.05\u2009mg/kg/h) could be used in each sedation protocol during the induction and maintenance phases as deemed necessary. In terms of hemodynamic outcomes, NLA may be superior to midazolam, because NLA can dilate peripheral blood vessels, increase cardiac output, and facilitate quicker cooling.\n24\nSedatives and analgesics were usually tapered off, once the patients had been rewarmed to 36\u00b0C. The muscle relaxant was stopped when shivering had disappeared, which usually occurred during the maintenance phase. Muscle relaxants were restarted as deemed necessary.\n\nData collection and study outcomes\nAll data, except head CT data, were transmitted to the UMIN center via an Internet-based system. Injury severity score (ISS) and head CT classification were also assessed. In this study, ISS was also calculated as an abbreviated injury score (AIS).\n25\nHead CT was classified as follows: diffuse injury grade I, all diffuse injuries without CT findings; diffuse injury grade II, high or mixed density lesions with a volume of <25\u2009mL; diffuse injury grade III, high or mixed density lesions with a volume of <25\u2009mL and compressed or absent basal cisterns; diffuse injury grade IV, high or mixed density lesions with a volume of <25\u2009mL and a midline shift of >5\u2009mm; and evacuated/nonevacuated mass, high or mixed density lesions with a volume of >25\u2009mL with or without surgical evacuation.\n26\nHemodynamic and laboratory data were recorded on Days 0, 1, and 3, as well as 1 day after rewarming (defined as the day on which the core body temperature reached 36\u00b0C). Representative values were recorded for each day.\nThe primary outcome, Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at 6 months, was assessed by a neurosurgeon, a neurologist, or an emergency physician who was unaware of the patient's treatment method.\n27\nAfter discharge from the original hospital, the patients were evaluated by telephone. Severe disability (SD), persistent vegetative state (PVS), or death (D) were defined as poor neurological outcomes, whereas moderate disability (MD) or good recovery (GR) were defined as good neurological outcomes. The RCT stopped at the interim because of a shortage of TBI patients and the trial's futility.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe planned sample size of 300 patients allocated in a 2:1 ratio to receive TH or fever control would detect a 20% difference (90% power) in the percentage of patients with a good neurological outcome because the percentage of good neurological outcomes in severe TBI patients without MTH was 31% by an inquiry taken from the participating hospital in Japan before our RCT and there was a 20% difference between TH and control groups in the cardiac arrest /resuscitated patients.\n1\n,\n2\nFrom these facts, the sample sizes were planned to be 200 and 100 for TH and fever control groups, respectively.\nPoor neurological outcomes and mortality were compared between the two groups. Patients were stratified into predefined subgroups according to initial GCS (4\u20135 or 6\u20138) and age (\u226445 or >45 years old) based on the results of the first NABISH study.\n13\nContinuous variables were statistically analyzed using Student's\nt\ntest and the Mann\u2013Whitney\nU\ntest, as appropriate. Categorical variables were statistically analyzed using \u03c7\n2\ntests and Fisher's exact probability test, where appropriate. The threshold of significance was set at\np\n<0.05."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nSubjects included rodents (mice and rats) and monkeys.\n\nRaw data\nData donors offered raw data from published studies from the Ohio State University, University of Louisville, University of Kentucky, University of California Irvine, University of California San Francisco, and the California Spinal Cord Injury Consortium. Data donors provided our team with full access to raw data archives in various formats, including paper records, data flat files, analyzed images, and videos, with periodic interviews with the data donors for clarification regarding data integrity, content, and organization. Data were curated using a combination of hand data entry and data formatting before integration and analysis, organized initially into Microsoft Excel flat files and then uploaded into a MySQL database. Before integration into SQL, a star schema was created for accurate data integration based on hierarchical organization of the data. We received data from a total of 7 laboratories whose data was largely heterogeneous as a result of variability in hypotheses and outcomes tested between laboratories. Because of this heterogeneity, there is a considerable amount of potential data that can be considered \u201cmissing.\u201d Complete data records in the database are from 102 separate studies, both published (\nN\n=48 studies; 69% of subjects) and unpublished (\nN\n=38 studies; 27% of subjects), and rigorous, systematic error checks are performed on the database to ensure quality control of the original data. There are 1124 variables in the database, both predictor and outcome measures that were collected between 1993 and 2013 in both cervical and thoracic injury models.\n\nDatabase development\nThe error-checked database contains a completely annotated data dictionary for every variable that exists. A MySQL interface was developed for efficient parsing of data files after they have been formatted to the data dictionary. Python scripts are actively developed to do efficient extract/transform/load (ETL) jobs when loading data from flat files into MySQL. The scripts support exporting data files in various formats (.xls, .csv, .txt, and so on) to the MySQL database, as well as exporting those formats from MySQL for analysis in other programs. As the database grows, it will be maintained and updated, with secure backup and access.\n\nData set assembly\nThe first step in creating the database involved locating archived paper records (\u201cfile drawer\u201d)\n17\nof SCI data. For ease of data entry and formatting, these archives are digitized using an automatic feed, high-speed scanner (Sharp AR-M355N) to convert paper records to PDFs that can be stored on hard drives that serve as the raw data repository. These files can then be further processed using optical character recognition software (Omnipage) to be formatted to the database. For handwritten records, manual data entry is performed through a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant data entry portal (UCSF-REDCap) and error checked for accuracy. Additional archived records in digital formats (e.g., data disks and external hard drives) are copied into the raw data repository and formatted to be merged with the master database.\n\nData annotation\nEach set of data has variables corresponding to both predictor (e.g., animal model and injury paradigm) and outcome measures (e.g., behavioral tests and histological confirmation of injury) that are not only unique to each animal, but also to each experiment. Therefore, an important aspect of the database curation is to annotate all the variables into a detailed data dictionary and ensure that it loads correctly into the database schema. This will facilitate parsing of variables and their corresponding data into their proper location in the MySQL database.\n\nData quality assurance\nAccording to the goals of our project, we have designed a series of check points in our data management process to ensure quality assurance of data entry, formatting, storage, and distribution. When new data are located, conversations and interviews with the data donors are conducted to determine the scope of each variable, as well as the completeness of the data set. Original data are never modified, but duplicated and converted into new (or existing) database variables that are coded according to the data dictionary. Data are stored in multiple secure locations, including encrypted hard drives and secure database systems, with periodic backup to off-site locations. Any distribution of the data is done so across a secure server, or locally between encrypted hard drives, to prevent unauthorized access of sensitive information.\n\nData quality control\nOnce data have been digitized and transferred from the original source to our raw data repository, the data are formatted and cross-checked with the source data to ensure no errors were introduced and that the full data set was entered. This is followed by quality control measures to ensure accuracy of the final data set. Systematic error checks are performed, where original records of the data are cross-referenced with what has been entered into the database. All errors are cataloged and analyzed to highlight problem areas with any point in the process of data management and to fine tune our methods and minimize errors with future data sets. Although the overall error in data entry and formatting was low (<1.5% of all data points), occasional data curation and entry errors were observed. Of this small percentage of errors, the most common was the classification of data as missing, when, in fact, it simply had not been formatted and entered into the master database (41%) for one reason or another (e.g., overlooked or skipped). The second-most common errors were repetitive entries of data points (39% of total errors), followed by data entry typos of either the wrong information (14% of total errors) or the entry of information that did not actually exist for that data point (5%). The remaining errors combined (<1%) included issues with data curation and miscommunication about the definition of certain types of data.\n\nData visualization\nGraphical representations of the database demographics were done in a combination of Microsoft Excel (2010), GraphPad Prism (v 5.04), the online word frequency tool, Wordle (\nhttp://www.wordle.net/\n), and Adobe Illustrator (CS5) and were assembled together using Adobe Photoshop (CS5).\n\nPrevalence of variables in the database\nQuantitative word clouds were generated to show the distribution of either independent or dependent variables collected for all subjects from published studies. Word size reflects the prevalence of each variable in the database. By identifying common variables used across heterogeneous studies, we have the opportunity to identify consistent SCI metrics that may facilitate translation. Toward that end, we aligned prevalent pre-clinical variables with clinical SCI common data elements (CDEs) that have been published by the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NIH/NINDS).\n20\nOne of the figures highlights prevalent preclinical metrics in the database that, on face value, correspond to clinical CDEs. The NINDS SCI CDE working group has classified variables as core, supplemental, or emerging/exploratory. Core variables reflect critical information (e.g., gender, age, treatment site, and cause of injury), which all clinical trials should collect to maximize comparison across studies. Supplemental variables are those variables that provide important additional information that could be useful for describing patients (e.g., cardiovascular and bladder/bowel function). Emerging variables reflect novel metrics that are not fully standardized, but may provide important information about patient populations (e.g., GRASSP\n18\n,\n19\n). Analysis of the pre-clinical data suggests that most of the prevalent variables in the database correspond to supplemental and emerging clinical CDEs, with a small number of pre-clinical variables corresponding to core clinical CDEs. Additionally, there is a lack of clinical outcome measures that line up with measures collected in pre-clinical studies, for which potential translation from pre-clinical models would benefit. That is not to say that clinical outcome measures that could be potential endpoint metrics for clinical trials do not exist, but they have not been incorporated into the approved CDEs for SCI.\n18\u201324\n\nMulti-variate analysis to test database functionality\nTo test the utility of the database for extracting translational features of SCI across heterogeneous studies, we performed unsupervised, data-driven multi-variate pattern detection on data from two previously published studies in the database for both rats\n15\nand monkeys.\n9\n,\n25\nTo the extent that SCI reflects a syndrome, the large-scale and heterogeneous nature of the database should allow detection of coherent subfeatures that are reflected as patterns within sets of related variables. Once identified, such variable sets may be applied as outcome sets for experimental therapeutics at the syndrome level that are conserved between species.\nA subselection of the database containing rat and monkey cervical SCI was created to run principal component analysis (PCA),\n26\na type of exploratory factor analysis that allows for dimension reduction in large data sets to create new multi-variables (principal components; PCs) determined by the variance in the data set. In the context of SCI, PCs represent syndromic measures of outcome as detected by multiple outcome variables simultaneously (e.g., sensorimotor and autonomic function, histopathology, and so on). To evaluate translational potential of PCs, individual outcome measures were standardized using\nz\n-scores and combined into new translational variables (e.g., Object Manipulation). Data were binned across time for syndromic analysis. PCA was performed in SPSS (v.19) to extract a correlation matrix of the standardized variables, PC loadings for the outcomes onto each PC, and individual PC scores for post-hoc analysis of both species and injury predictors.\nBar graphs of the PC scores for each subject were plotted and analyzed to test the influence of predictor variables on these syndromic clusters and analyzed for significance with Student's\nt\n-tests (\np\n<0.01) or analysis of variance with Tukey's post-hoc correction (\np,\nsignificant, at alpha <0.05)."

    "Methods": "Animal preparation\nAll procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania. Female, 4-week-old piglets (8\u201310\u2009kg), were pre-medicated with intramuscular injection of ketamine (20\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (2\u2009mg/kg) followed by 4% isoflurane and 100% FiO\n2\nvia snout mask, until abolishment of a reflexive withdrawal to a pinch stimulus. Endotracheal intubation was followed by a decrease in FiO\n2\nto 21\u201330%, and maintenance anesthesia was provided using 2% isoflurane. Femoral artery and venous catheters were placed for continuous MAP monitoring, arterial blood gas sampling, and intravenous (IV) fluid administration. Vital signs, including heart rate, respiratory rate, MAP zeroed to the right atrium, arterial oxygen saturation (SaO\n2\n), end tidal CO\n2\n, and rectal temperature, were recorded every 10\u2009min for the duration of the experiment. A 20\u2009mL/kg normal saline (NS) bolus was administered for replacement of pre-anesthetic dehydration secondary to required fasting, followed by an NS infusion at 4\u2009mL/kg/h. Mechanical ventilation was titrated with goals of normoxia (PaO\n2\n>90\u2009mmHg) and normocarbia (PaCO\n2\n38\u201345\u2009mm Hg). A core body temperature goal of 37\u201338.5\u00b0C to ensure accurate thermal diffusion CBF measurements was accomplished with conductive warming/cooling blanket system (Gaymar, Orchard Park, NY). Piglets were then given a bolus of 1\u2009mg/kg midazolam and 50\u2009\u03bcg/kg fentanyl and started on midazolam and fentanyl infusions (1\u2009mg/kg/h and 100\u2009\u03bcg/kg/h, respectively), and isoflurane was discontinued. Pre- and post-injury arterial blood gas samples were obtained hourly (Nova Biomedical, Waltham, MA) until euthanasia 6\u2009h after injury.\n\nNonimpact rotational brain injury\nAnimals (\nn\n=16) experienced rapid sagittal head rotations without impact (angle rotation 90 degrees over 10\u201312\u2009msec) as described previously.\n13\u201315\nAngular velocity was measured using an angular rate sensor (ATA, Albuquerque, NM) attached to the linkage sidearm. After injury, the animal was removed from the bite plate and placed in the prone position.\n\nNeuromonitoring\nAfter injury, four burr holes were prepared for placement of fiberoptic intracranial pressure monitor, CBF thermal diffusion probe, brain tissue oxygen monitor, and microdialysis probe. The fiberoptic intracranial pressure probe (Integra, Plainsboro, NJ), was inserted 0.5\u2009cm posterior to the coronal suture and 0.5\u2009cm to the left of the sagittal suture and secured with a single lumen bolt. The Licox catheter system (Integra, Plainsboro, NJ) was placed to measure brain tissue oxygenation (PbtO\n2\n) 1\u2009cm anterior to the intracranial pressure probe. The brain tissue oxygen probe was inserted to a depth of 1.5\u2009cm, secured with bone wax, and allowed to equilibrate for 30\u2009min before values were recorded. A hyperoxia test was performed to confirm proper catheter placement. Data for intracranial pressure and PbtO\n2\nwere recorded every 15\u2009min until euthanasia.\nA microdialysis probe (PAS 12, 4\u2009mm length, CMA, North Chelmsford, MA) was placed on the opposite side of the skull from the PbtO\n2\ncatheter into subcortical white matter. Immediately after insertion, the probe was infused with sterile 0.9% NaCl at a rate of 1\u2009\u03bcL/min. Dialysate samples were collected every 30\u2009min until euthanasia, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C and analyzed for lactate and pyruvate using a CMA600 analyzer (CMA, North Chelmsford, MA).\nCBF of the right frontal lobe subcortical white matter was measured continuously with a thermal diffusion intraparenchymal probe (Hemedex, Cambridge, MA) inserted 1\u2009cm anterior to the microdialysis probe.\n16\n,\n17\n\nCerebral perfusion modulation\nOne hour after injury, animals were randomized to receive either PE (\nn\n=8) or NE (\nn\n=8) infusions titrated to a CPP >70\u2009mm Hg for 5\u2009h until euthanasia.\n\nHistology\nAt 6 hours post-injury, animals were euthanized via an overdose of pentobarbital. Brains were perfusion fixed, and two 6\u2009\u03bcm sections were cut from every 3\u2009mm block. Sections were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E), or with the immunohistochemical marker for axonal injury beta-amyloid precursor protein (\u03b2-APP) (Chemicron 22C11 used at dilution of 1:5000) and counterstained with Meyer's hematoxylin. Areas of cell injury on H&E staining were identified by changes in staining intensity, and characterized by cell shrinkage and cytoplasmic eosinophilia, so-called \u201cred cell change.\u201d\n18\nRegions of \u03b2\u2212APP immunoreactivity and cell injury were noted by a blinded neuropathologist. and the locations of white matter damage and cell injury were traced in each slice using our previously described procedure to determine total area.\n10\nTotal and injured areas were multiplied by section thickness to determine total and injured brain volumes.\n\nStatistical analysis\nPhysiological, arterial blood gas, and neuromonitoring parameter (intracranial pressure [ICP], PbtO\n2\n, microdialysis, CBF) data were analyzed across groups and time using repeated measures ANOVA tests, and Tukey\u2013Kramer tests were used for post-hoc analysis with significance defined as\np\n<0.05. Neuropathology comparisons between groups were analyzed using Student's\nt\ntest."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nForty-six individuals participated in the study, which was composed of three groups: 1)16 individuals with CPTHA after TBI (13 males and 3 females, age 36.5\u00b111 [mean\u00b1SD] years), 2) 12 individuals with TBI without headache of any kind (10 males and 2 females, age 34.1\u00b19 years) and 3) 18 pain-free healthy individuals (14 males and 4 females, age 31.6\u00b19 years).\nPatients diagnosed with CPTHA and who met with inclusion criteria, were chosen from a computerized list of patients who had attended the Headache Unit of the Department of Neurology at Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer. Recruitment of subjects was initiated by mail explaining the aims of the study, followed by a phone call explaining the study in more detail and further verifying the inclusion criteria. The eligible patients who agreed to participate in the study were invited to a single testing session. Individuals with TBI who did not have CPTHA were recruited from the Department of Head Injury at Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer and from the Department of Psychiatry at the Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel-Aviv. Both departments have units for continuous care for individuals at the chronic stage of TBI. It is of note that the state's health system recognizes the need for these patients to continue (sometimes lifelong) treatment following TBI, and patients are seen (for maintenance, support and occasional crisis intervention) on a regular basis. These individuals were first approached by their therapists who explained the aims of the study. The inclusion criteria and eligibility of those who agreed to participate were verified, and eligible individuals were invited to a single testing session. Healthy controls were recruited from among the workers of the Medical Center and Tel-Aviv University.\nInclusion criteria for all individuals with TBI (group 1 and 2) were: 1) a diagnosis of mild brain injury as determined by a clinical evaluation and CT and/or MRI scans, 2) a minimum duration of 12 months since the injury, 3) no evidence of neurological and systemic diseases (e.g. diabetes, Parkinson's disease), 4) no pre-existing headache, 5) no medication-overuse headache, 6) no evidence of cervicogenic or whiplash-related headache, 7) no prior psychiatric illnesses, 8) no current depression, 9) no somatization disorder, 10) no current involvement in litigation, and 11) no communication and/or comprehension problems as assessed by clinical examination and by the routine neuropsychological tests that were administered at the time of admission to each unit. An additional inclusion criterion for group 1 was the presence of CPTHA for >6 months. CPTHA attributed to mild brain injury was diagnosed according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD)-2\n3\nsection 5.2.2: A) Headache with no typical characteristics known, B) head trauma with the following: 1) Either no loss of consciousness or loss of consciousness for <30 minutes, 2) Glasgow coma scale score \u226513, 3) symptoms and/or signs of concussion, C) Headache develops within 7 days after head traumas, D) Headache persists for >3 months after head trauma. Clinical and imaging examinations excluded secondary disorders such as hematoma, cerebral vein thrombosis, cerebral hemorrhage, or epilepsy.\nIt is noteworthy that most of the subjects had headaches for >12 months; therefore, they could be considered chronic. All patients were living in households in the community, and were seen at the rehabilitation clinic on a regular (once a week/a fortnight/a month) basis.\nInformed consent was obtained from all subjects according to the Declaration of Helsinki after they received full explanation of the goals and protocols of the study. Experiments were approved by the Sheba Medical Center, the Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, and the Tel-Aviv University institutional review boards.\n\nEquipment\nThermal stimulator\nHeat stimuli were delivered using a Peltier-based computerized thermal stimulator (TSA II, Medoc Ltd., Israel), with a 3\u00d73\u2009cm contact probe. According to the principles of the Peltier element, a passage of current through the Peltier element produces temperature changes at rates determined by an active feedback system. As soon as the target temperature is attained, probe temperature actively reverts to a preset adaptation temperature by passage of an inverse current. The adaptation (baseline) temperature was set to 35\u00b0C. The probe was attached to the testing site by means of a Velcro band.\nPressure algometer\nPressure stimuli were delivered using a hand-held pressure algometer (Somedic Sales AB, Algometer type II, Sweden). The algometer has a built-in pressure transducer, electronics recording and display unit, power supply, and subject-activated push button connected via a cable to the instrument. The principle of operation of the algometer is the exertion of a constantly increasing rate of pressure, the latter being monitored by a cursor presented on the display. The tip of the algometer that is pressed against the skin is 1\u2009cm\n2\n. The algometer was calibrated before each measuring day.\n\nProcedure\nSubjects were invited to a single testing session lasting \u223c3\u2009h. The experiments took place in a quiet room with an ambient temperature of 22\u00b12\u00b0C. The subjects sat in a comfortable armchair with the forearm supported on a holder. Prior to sensory testing, the subjects were interviewed with regard to demographics, the TBI, and the CPTHA, and were trained for the sensory testing before the actual testing started. The thresholds for heat-pain and pressure-pain were measured first, because their values were used in the subsequent measurements. Heat-pain threshold (HPT) in the forearm was used for the purpose of measuring pain adaptation in the forearm. HPT in the shin was measured for the purpose of determining the conditioning stimulus in the conditioned pain modulation (CPM) test. HPT was also measured in the forehead in order to study whether the results obtained in our previous study\n12\non a different group of individuals with CPTHA are repeatable or coincidental. Pressure pain threshold (PPT) was measured in the forearm for the purpose of determining the test stimulus in the CPM test. PPT was also measured in the forehead in order to study whether the results obtained in our previous study\n12\non a different group of individuals with CPTHA are repeatable or coincidental.\nAfter determining the pain thresholds, the measurement of pain adaptation and CPM followed. These tests were chosen as indices of two pain modulation systems. In these tests, pain inhibition is tested while noxious stimuli are applied either inside or outside the segmental receptive fields of nociceptive neurons, respectively. The former test is related to the activation of the periqueductal gray (PAG) and nucleus raphe magnus (NRM) of the rostro ventro medulla,\n29\n,\n30\nwhereas the latter reflects the diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC) exerted by the subnucleus reticularis dorsalis (SRD).\n31\n,\n32\nAt the end of the testing session, subjects completed the questionnaires.\n\nSensory testing\nPain thresholds\nHPT was measured with the thermal stimulator using the method of limits. Subjects received four successive ramps of temperature, starting from an adaptation temperature of 32\u00b0C, at a rate of 2\u00b0C/sec with an interstimulus interval of 30\u2009sec. Subjects were asked to press a switch at the first pain sensation perceived. HPT was the averaged reading of four successive stimuli of increasing temperature.\n33\nPPT was measured with the pressure algometer using the modified method of limits. The tip of the pressure algometer probe was placed perpendicular over the skin. Gradual pressure was applied from a baseline intensity of 0\u2009kPa at a rate of 30\u2009kPa/sec, with an interstimulus interval of 15\u2009sec. Each application was administered at a different location on the skin within a predetermined area of 3\u00d73\u2009cm in order to shorten the overall measurement time (for the purpose of the CPM) and in order to avoid changes in the sensitivity of the skin. Subjects were instructed to press the switch the first pain sensation perceived, thus \u201cfreezing\u201d the display with the corresponding pressure reading and recording it. PPT was the averaged reading of three successive stimuli of increasing pressure.\n34\nPain adaptation\nPain adaptation was measured by applying tonic noxious heat stimuli at an intensity of 1\u00b0C above individuals' HPT measured as descried previously. For each subject, the stimuli were administered to the volar aspect of the forearm, for 60\u2009sec, during which time the subjects were instructed to report the intensity of their pain every 15\u2009sec using a visual analog scale (VAS). The VAS is a plastic ruler with an inner slider that has set points where 0 indicates \u201cno pain\u201d and 10 indicates \u201cthe most intense pain imaginable.\u201d Thus, readings were obtained at time 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60\u2009sec. The amount of adaptation was calculated by subtracting the last rating from the first. The course of adaptation was analyzed to detect time trends.\nCPM\nCPM was measured by applying a noxious stimulus to the nondominant volar aspect of the forearm (the \u201ctest stimulus\u201d) and evaluating its perceived intensity alone, and in the presence of another noxious stimulus applied to the lateral aspect of contralateral shin (\u201cconditioning stimulus\u201d). This distance between the test and conditioning stimulus was reported to produce the most intense CPM.\n35\nThe test stimulus was PPT measured with the pressure algometer as described previously. The conditioning stimulus was noxious heat, applied with the thermal stimulator, at an intensity of 2\u00b0C above individual HPT measured as described previously for a duration of 60\u2009sec. PPT was first measured, than, after a break of 5\u2009min, the conditioning stimulus commenced, and after 15\u2009sec of operation, the PPT was measured again. Both the test and conditioning stimuli terminated at 60\u2009sec. The magnitude of CPM was calculated by subtracting the PPT measured in the presence of the conditioning stimulus from the PPT measured alone.\n35\n\nQuestionnaires and additional data collection\nTBI\nAll patients with TBI were interviewed regarding their injury, including the date and their age at the time of injury, causes and circumstances, additional injuries that incurred with the main injury, and comorbidities. Information obtained at these interviews was cross-checked with subjects' medical records.\nChronic pain\nPatients with CPTHA were queried about its onset, duration, quality, location in the head, frequency, and dynamic characteristics, as well as use of medication, and alleviating and aggravating factors. In addition, these subjects rated the intensity of CPTHA on a VAS. All patients with CPTHA completed the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ).\n36\nThe MPQ provides a quantitative evaluation of the patient's pain experience with a separate measure of its sensory, affective, and cognitive dimensions. Three quantitative parameters were derived: 1) the pain rating index (PRI), based on summing the values of the words chosen by the subject from the list; 2) the number of words chosen (NWC) from that list; and 3) pain intensity (pain at its least and when it becomes worse) on a five word/number scale.\nPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\nPTSD is an anxiety disorder that develops following exposure to a potentially life-threatening event. Because PTSD and TBI are known to coexist, and because studies show an association between PTSD and chronic pain among individuals after TBI\n10\n,\n37\nespecially among individuals with mild TBI,\n38\nwe measured the severity of PTSD symptomatology among the participants. The PTSD Inventory was used.\n39\nThis is a 17 item self-report scale based on the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders,\n4th ed. (DSM-IV) criteria for PTSD, which evaluates post-traumatic stress symptomatology. PTSD severity is calculated as the number of symptoms present. The inventory was used in previous studies and has good convergent validity when compared with structured clinical interviews. Internal consistency calculated was high (\u03b1=0.91).\n\nStatistical analysis\nData were analyzed with the IBM SPSS statistics software (version 21). Average values of continuous variables are described by means (SD). Categorical variables are described by frequencies. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc comparisons were used to evaluate differences between the groups in the continuous variables. Chi square analyses examined group differences in categorical variables. Pearson correlation examined associations between variables. The problem of multiple comparisons was addressed with the false discovery rate (FDR) procedure.\n40\np\nvalues <0.05 were considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Mice\nAdult male BALB/c mice (three months old) were obtained from a breeding colony kept in barrier-reared conditions in a specific-pathogen-free facility at The Ohio State University. Mice were individually housed in polypropylene cages for the duration of the study and maintained at 25\u00b0C under a 12\u2009h light/12\u2009h dark cycle with ad libitum access to water and rodent chow. All procedures were in accordance with the National Institute of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by The Ohio State University Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nMidline fluid percussion injury\nMice received a midline diffuse TBI using an FPI apparatus (Custom Design & Fabrication, Richmond, VA) as previously described.\n49\nThis diffuse injury occurs in the absence of a contusion, does not induce tissue cavitation or gross neuronal loss, and causes diffuse axonal injury in the neocortex, hippocampus, and dorsolateral thalamus.\n21\n,\n45\u201347\nIn brief, a midline craniectomy was performed with a 3\u2009mm outer diameter trephine and a rigid Luer-loc needle hub was secured over the craniectomy and capped. After 4\u20136\u2009h, injury was induced by imposing a 10\u2009ms pulse of saline (1.2 atmospheres; 670\u2013720\u2009mV) onto the dura through the injury hub.\n21\n,\n50\n,\n51\nAll sham controls received the same procedure without the fluid pulse. Immediately after injury, the injury hub was removed, dural integrity was confirmed, and mice were evaluated for injury severity using the self-righting test.\n50\nAny mice with a confirmed dura breach were euthanized immediately after injury and excluded from the study. Self-righting inclusion criteria was based on our previous work with BALB/c mice\n21\n: Only mice with a moderate TBI were used: sham\u226460 sec; 60\u2009sec<mild<200 sec; 200\u2009sec<moderate<540 sec; severe>540\u2009sec.\n\nMethylene blue injection\nFifteen to 30\u2009min after sham or TBI, mice were administered an i.v. tail vein injection of sterile water (control) or a low dose of MB (2\u2009mg/kg body weight, \u223c80\u2009\u03bcM). Dosage above 7\u2009mg/kg MB is considered high dose and cytotoxic.\n35\n,\n52\nMice were awake and restrained during i.v. injection (<2\u2009min) and immediately returned to their home cage after injection. Methylene blue (1% solution, 10\u2009mg/mL) was diluted and injected at a volume of 100\u2009\u03bcL.\n37\nMB (Anmol Chemicals [Commercial Grade], Mumbai, India) was acquired from by the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.\n\nEdema\nEdema was classified as increased water content in the brain and was determined as previously described.\n53\nIn brief, 24\u2009h after sham or TBI, mice were euthanized and the rostral and caudal cortex was dissected. Tissue was weighed and oven dried overnight at 73\u00b0C before reweighing. Water content was determined by calculating the ratio of weight loss to original wet weight (% water loss=[(wet weight \u2013 dry weight)/wet weight]*100).\n\nIsolation of brain microglia/macrophages\nBrain CD11b+ cells (microglia/macrophages) were isolated and enriched as previously described.\n21\n,\n54\n,\n55\nIn brief, whole brain homogenates were centrifuged and layered in a discontinuous Percoll gradient (70/50/35/0% isotonic Percoll; GE-healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). Enriched CD11b+ cells were collected from the interphase between the 70 and 50% Percoll layers. We have previously characterized these cells as 80\u201390% CD11b+.\n55\nThese cells were characterized as microglia (CD11b+/CD45lo) or macrophages (CD11b+/CD45hi) based on flow cytometric gating using CD11b/CD45 labeling. In sham mice, the Percoll gradient isolation yielded \u223c84% microglia and \u223c1.5% macrophages and these percentages shifted to \u223c82% microglia and \u223c3% macrophages after TBI (data not shown).\n\nIsolation of blood leukocytes\nWhole blood was collected by cardiac puncture with EDTA lined syringes 24\u2009h after sham or TBI. A 30\u2009\u03bcL aliquot of blood was used, red blood cells were lysed, samples were washed, and remaining leukocytes were stained for protein expression by flow cytometry.\n\nBV-2 cell culture\nBV-2 microglial cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) growth medium (Lonza, Walkersvill, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (GE-healthcare Hyclone, Little Chalfont, UK) (3.7\u2009g/L sodium bicarbonate, 200\u2009mM glutamine, 100\u2009U/mL penicillin G, 100\u2009\u03bcg/mL streptomycin, 0.25\u2009\u03bcg/mL fungizone) as previously described.\n56\nCultures were maintained and incubated at 37\u00b0C with 95% humidity and 5% CO\n2\n. Growth medium was replenished every third day until confluence. Prior to experimentation, cells were plated at 1\u00d710\n5\ncells per well in 24 well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Immediately before treatment, cells were washed three times with serum-free DMEM medium and supplemented with warm serum-free DMEM medium containing experimental treatments. Cells were treated with saline or LPS (100\u2009ng/mL) for 1\u2009h. After 1\u2009h, water or 4.5\u2009\u03bcM 1% MB was added to the culture media. Twenty-four hours after saline/LPS, cells were homogenized and ribonucleic acid (RNA) was isolated.\n\nFlow cytometry\nEnriched CD11b+ cells from the brain and leukocytes from the blood were assayed for surface protein expression as previously described.\n21\n,\n55\nIn brief, Fc receptors were blocked with anti-CD16/CD32 antibody (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). Cells were incubated with rat anti-mouse GR-1-FITC and CD11b-APC, or CD45-PE, Ly6C-PerCP-Cy5.5, and CD11b-APC antibodies (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). Surface protein expression was determined using a Becton-Dickinson FACSCaliber four color cytometer (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Ten thousand events characterized as blood leukocytes or microglia/macrophages were recorded. For each antibody, gating was determined based on appropriate negative isotype stained controls from the representative cell population. Flow data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, San Carlos, CA).\n\nRNA isolation and RT-PCR\nRNA was isolated from the dissected hippocampus and BV-2 microglia using the Tri-Reagent protocol according to manufacturer instructions (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Messenger RNA (mRNA) was isolated from enriched brain CD11b+ cells using the PrepEase kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) according to manufacturer instructions. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using the Applied Biosystems Taqman\n\u00ae\nAssays-on-Demand\u2122 Gene Expression protocol (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) as previously described.\n56\n,\n57\nIn brief, experimental complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) was amplified by RT-PCR where a target cDNA (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, Arginase, CCL2) and a reference cDNA (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GAPDH) were amplified simultaneously using an oligonucleotide probe with a 5\u2032 fluorescent reporter dye (6-FAM). Gene accession numbers are listed for each primer in\nTable 1\n. Fluorescence was determined on an ABI PRISM 7300-sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Calsbad, CA). Data were analyzed using the comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method and results are expressed as fold difference from GAPDH.\nTable\n1.\nGene Accession Numbers for TaqMan RT-PCR Probes\nRefSeq number\nCD14\nNM_009841.3\nIL-1\u03b2\nNM_008361.3\nTNF-\u03b1\nNM_001278601.1\nNM_013693.3\niNOS\nNM_010927.3\nArg1\nNM_007482.3\nIL-10\nNM_010548.2\nOpen in a separate window\nIL, interleukin; TNF-\u03b1, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; Arg1, arginase 1.\n\nBehavioral assays\nRotarod\nMotor coordination was assessed using the rotarod apparatus (Rotamex, Columbus, OH) as previously described.\n21\nIn brief, mice were acclimated to the apparatus 4\u2009d before testing, and were trained on the apparatus each day for 3\u2009d before testing. Testing consisted of three trials in which mice were placed on a stationary rod that began to rotate at 10\u2009rpm with 0.2\u2009rpm/sec acceleration. Trials 1 and 2 were done back-to-back to prevent associations between falling and returning to the home cage, and mice were given 10\u2009min between Trials 2 and 3. The average time spent on the rod before falling for the two longest trials is reported. Mice were tested 1\u2009h and 1\u2009d, 4\u2009d, and 7\u2009d post injury.\nTail suspension test\nDepressive-like behavior was measured using the tail suspension test (TST) as previously described.\n21\n,\n58\nIn brief, 7\u2009d after sham or TBI, mice were suspended by their tail and video recorded for 10\u2009min. The amount of time spent immobile was assessed by a trained observer blind to experimental conditions. Increased time spent immobile designates an increase in depressive-like behavior. We have previously determined that TBI mice have recovered to baseline motor performance (rotarod) by 7\u2009d post-injury and do not show increased exhaustion.\n21\n\nStatistical analysis\nData were subjected to the Shapiro-Wilk test using Statistical Analysis Systems (SAS, Cary, NC) statistical software. To determine significant main effects and interactions between main factors, data were analyzed using one-way (i.e., injury and treatment), two-way (i.e. injury\u00d7treatment), or three-way (i.e., injury\u00d7treatment\u00d7time) analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the general linear model procedures of SAS. When appropriate, differences between treatment means were evaluated by an F-protected\nt\n-test using the least significant difference procedure of SAS. Edema was evaluated using a one-tailed\nt\n-test after ANOVA. Body mass and rotarod data were further subjected to repeated measures ANOVA. All data are expressed as treatment means\u00b1standard error of the mean (SEM)."

    "Methods": "Advanced blast simulator (ABS)\nA custom\u2010built ABS (\u223c30.5cm in diameter and 5.79\u2009m in length) located at Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) Suffield was used for producing simulated blast waves.\n45\nThe ABS consisted of a \u201cdriver\u201d section filled with high-pressure gas, and a low-pressure test section, separated by a frangible cellulose acetate diaphragm. Closely controlled pressurization of the driver causes rupture of the diaphragm, releasing high-pressure gas into the test section, and generating a shockwave down the length of the test section. The inclusion of a custom-designed divergent driver and an end wave eliminator in this ABS system enables the highly reproducible generation of single pulse shockwaves.\n45\nCompressed helium and varying thicknesses of cellulose acetate sheets were employed to obtain the desired target pressure. A complete description of the development and operation of the ABS is described in a manuscript nearing completion, to be submitted to the open literature by Sawyer and colleagues.\n\nAnimal exposure to simulated blast\nIn conducting this research, the authors adhered to the\nGuide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals\nand\nThe Ethics of Animal Experimentation\n, published by the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Adult male S-D rats were acquired from Charles River Laboratories (St. Constant, Quebec, Canada) and acclimated for at least 1 week prior to exposure. The animals were kept on a 12\u2009h light/dark cycle and fed ad libitum. On the day of use, the animals (\u223c350\u2013400\u2009g) were anaesthetized with 3% isoflurane in oxygen for 3\u2009min in a closed induction chamber. Anesthesia was maintained using a face mask, and the animal was placed into a restraint consisting of a clear plastic cylindrical sleeve, with the neck encircled in a closely fitting plastic collar with the head protruding from the end. The hindquarters were supported using an end cap fitted with a piston. To the left of the head, a mesh netting was secured between two pins placed vertically in line with the side of, and above and below the head. The head was placed against this vertical netting, and then held in place using additional netting around the head. This was locked into place using Velcro on the side of the head opposite the direction of shockwave propagation. After a minimum of 8\u2009min of anesthetic exposure, the cylindrical restraint containing the animal was set into the wall of the ABS, such that only the head protruded into the test section. Test groups consisted of sham control, and head-only, side-on exposures of single pulse shockwave overpressures of 15, 20, 25, and 30 psi or 103.4, 137.9, 172.4, or 206.8\u2009kPa.\nAfter exposure, the animals were immediately removed from the shock tube and animal restraint, and were closely observed for at least 30\u2009min post-exposure, or until no signs of stress were evident. The animals were returned to the dedicated animal holding facility where they had been observed on a daily basis prior to testing. At 24\u2009h, the animals were anaesthetized and euthanized by decapitation prior to blood sample collection.\n\nSample collection\nFollowing anesthesia, whole trunk blood samples were collected from both control (\nn\n=19) and blast (\nn\n=33) group rats following decapitation into potassium ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (K\n2\nEDTA) coated blood collection tubes. Samples were centrifuged for 10\u2009min at 2000\ng\n, and the separated plasma supernatant was collected. To avoid excessive freeze\u2013thaw cycles, blood plasma aliquots were made and stored at \u221220\u00b0C for short-term use, and the rest were stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\n\nPlasma PrPC ELISA\nFor sensitive quantification of full-length soluble PrPC, we employed an ELISA technique using a commercially available assay kit (Spi Bio A05201, Paris, France). The kit is typically used for qualitative screening in animal products; therefore, we modified the manufacturer's protocol to allow sensitive and accurate quantification. Pure full-length recombinant PrPC (Prionatis, \u03b1-Rec Mouse PrP-RPA0101S, Zurich, Switzerland) was used for producing serial dilutions (0.625\u201320\u2009ng/mL) in order to establish the calibration curve for quantifying samples. All samples and PrPC protein standards were diluted in the manufacturer's provided dilution buffer solution (1\u2009M phosphate, 1% bovine serum albumin [BSA], 4\u2009M NaCl, 10\u2009mM EDTA, and 0.1% sodium azide). Remaining solutions and reagents provided by the manufacturer were reconstituted and prepared according to the suggested protocol.\nBriefly, overall protein concentration of individual samples was first determined in triplicate using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay (Sigma-Aldrich, bovine albumin, A-9647, Oakville, ON). Samples and standards were loaded in equal volume in triplicate in the kit's 96 microwell plate strips. Diluted samples were loaded such that each well contained overall protein amounts of \u223c 75\u2013100\u2009\u03bcg. The plate is then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with shaking to allow adequate antigen binding to well-embedded monoclonal antibodies, specific to the 144\u2013153 amino acid sequence. After rigorous washing (4M phosphate, pH 7.4), the wells were incubated with an acetylcholinesterase- (AChE) Fab\u2019 conjugated antibody solution for 2\u2009h at room temperature (RT) with shaking, thus completing a double-antibody sandwich. After another cycle of rigorous washing, Ellman's reagent was added in equal volume to each well, and incubated in the dark for 30\u2009min at RT with shaking. Any immobilized AChE-conjugated antibody bound to PrPC therefore reacted with Ellman's reagent to produce a colorimetric reaction in solution proportional to the concentration of PrPC, which was read using a microplate reader at 405\u2009nm (Molecular Devices, LLC., SpectraMax M5, Sunnyvale CA). Raw absorbance values were interpolated along the standard calibration curve and converted into PrPC concentration values.\n\nPrPC Western blotting\nWestern blotting was conducted as previously described.\n46\nBriefly, diluted plasma samples were separated with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane, and probed with an anti-PrPC primary antibody (Santa Cruz, goat IgG anti-PrP C-20 pAb, 1:500, sc-7693). For sequential reprobing of the same blots, the membranes were stripped and subjected to immunoblotting with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) primary antibody (AbCam, mouse IgG2b mAb, 1:2000, ab9484). Blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham) and exposed to x-ray film. Band intensities were quantified using National Institutes of Health (NIH) ImageJ software and normalized to the quantity of GAPDH in each sample lane. Blots were developed in triplicate, and a representative image is provided (see\nFig. 1\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nQuantile-quantile Q-Q plot of blast soluble cellular prion protein (PrPC) distribution. Most of the blast group PrPC concentration results depart from the normal distribution reference line (y=x). Therefore, data are not normally distributed and are considered nonparametric.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis for all data was performed using the IBM SPSS 21 Statistical Package. Nonparametric data were appropriately analyzed using the Kruskall\u2013Wallis test for comparison of mean rank values of control and the different blast intensity groups. Post-hoc Mann\u2013Whitney\nU\ntest with a Bonferroni correction for 95% confidence interval (CI) was used for determining statistical significance between mean rank values of control and individual blast group PrPC concentration. The Jonckheere trend test was used to determine a significant relationship between blast intensity and PrPC concentration. Kendall's tau-b test determined the nature and degree of association for said relationship. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed for determining accuracy of classifier performance. The measure of general predictiveness of classifiers was determined by area under the ROC curve (AUC). Two-graph ROC (TG-ROC) analysis was used for determining the cutoff value, as described by Greiner and coworkers, between control and blast exposure groups, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) were subsequently calculated.\n47\nFor all tests, statistical significance was determined when\np\n\u22640.05."

Furthermore, community outreach included Brain Injury Association web sites, TBI support groups, TBI clubhouses, a dedicated study web site (\nwww.LIFTcare.org\n) and Facebook page, TBI conferences, and networking with community and national TBI agencies that included study information and a link to the study web site on their web page, newsletters, and listservs.\nInclusion criteria were: being \u226518 years old; having been hospitalized within the past 10 years for a complicated mild to severe TBI as indicated by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3\u201312, or documented intracranial abnormalities on imaging, or having had post-traumatic amnesia of at least 7 days (participants with GCS scores<13 and no radiological evidence of TBI were excluded if their blood alcohol levels exceeded 199\u2009mg/dL because alcohol intoxication can decrease GCS scores);\n44\nspeaking English; meeting criteria for MDD on SCID and having scores \u226510 on PHQ-9; and residing in any of the 50 United States.\nExclusion criteria were: having no stable home or regular access to a telephone; history of diagnosis of schizophrenia; evidence of bipolar disorder, psychosis, or suicidal intent, or current (within the past month) alcohol or drug dependence on Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI);\n45\ncurrently receiving or planning to start evidence-based psychotherapy for depression within the 16-week study period (other forms of counseling such as rehabilitation counseling were permitted); antidepressant initiation within 6 weeks or dosage adjustment within 4 weeks prior to randomization, or planning to start an antidepressant within the 16 week intervention period; or severe cognitive impairment as defined by significant impairment on two or more of the following tests administered via telephone \u2013 Digit Span (cutoff below the lower 5th percentile),\n46\nor the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT),\n47\nor Oral Trail Making Test (TMT) A and B\n48\n(cutoff below the lower 1st percentile).\n\nRandomization\nWe randomized the first nine participants to CBT-T. CBT-IP, or UC; thereafter, we instituted a \u201cchoice- or equipoise-stratified\u201d approach\n49\nin order to enhance the accessioning and ecological validity of the study. Participants were given a choice of three randomization options: 1) CBT-T versus CBT-IP versus UC; 2) CBT-IP versus UC; or 3) CBT-T versus UC. Randomization was stratified on TBI severity (complicated mild/moderate, severe) and randomization option choice. A biostatistician (J.B.) computer generated blocked randomization lists with block size equal to the number of possible treatment options available in that stratum. He also assigned participants to treatments after they were enrolled by the research coordinator (K.M.).\n\nMeasures\nDemographic and injury-related characteristics were obtained from participant interviews and medical record reviews. During screening, potential depression was assessed using the PHQ-9,\n42\nwhich has been used extensively in TBI populations and has been found to be valid and reliable.\n41\n,\n50\nDysthymic disorder, current substance abuse or dependence, as well as exclusion diagnoses of bipolar disorder or psychosis, were assessed using the MINI.\n45\nPatients were asked about history of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis or treatment, and whether they were currently involved with or planning litigation related to their injury. Patients provided a list of current medications, and the Cornell Services Index\n51\nwas used to document concurrent counseling consisting of four or more sessions by a psychiatrist or psychologist\n36\nand antidepressant use at a therapeutic dose\n52\nat baseline and outcome assessments. For confounder and moderator analyses, baseline medical comorbidity was assessed using a checklist of chronic medical conditions and self-rating of environmental reward and response-contingent positive reinforcement; automatic negative thoughts and dysfunctional attitudes were assessed using the Environmental Reward Observation Scale (EROS),\n53\nAutomatic Thoughts Questionnaire (ATQ),\n54\nand the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale (DAS),\n55\nrespectively.\nDepression outcomes\nThe primary depression outcome measures were the clinician-rated 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17)\n56\nand the patient-reported Symptom Checklist-20 (SCL-20).\n57\nThe SCL-20 is a more unidimensional depression scale that is less dependent on somatic symptoms than the HAMD-17,\n58\nand, therefore, more sensitive to change in the TBI population. These instruments were chosen because they are widely used depression intervention outcome measures and have previously been used in TBI populations to assess depression outcomes.\n59\n,\n60\nWe used a structured version of the HAMD-17\n61\nfor improved reliability. Secondary depression outcomes included MDD criteria based on the SCID, self-rated improvement in depression symptoms as measured by the Patient Global Impression (PGI),\n62\nand Satisfaction with Depression Care as measured on a 1 (very satisfied) to 7 (very dissatisfied) Likert scale.\n63\nTherapeutic alliance was assessed with the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Form.\n64\nInterrater reliability for the HAMD-17, SCID and MINI were \u226590%.\nOther secondary outcomes\nSecondary outcomes included quality of life (SF-36),\n65\nfunctional impairment (Sheehan Disability Scale),\n66\n17 post-concussive symptoms (Head Injury Symptom Checklist)\n67\nrated from 0 to 5 on frequency and bothersomeness, environmental reward, automatic negative thoughts, and dysfunctional attitudes.\n\nCBT-TBI Intervention\nTelephone and in-person CBT-TBI was adapted from Simon and Ludman's eight session structured telephone care management and CBT protocol.\n68\n,\n69\nAlthough originally developed for English-speaking primary care patients, the program has been adapted for different populations and translated into multiple languages.\n70\u201374\nBased on our prior TBI telephone counseling studies,\n59\n,\n75\nthe intervention protocol was tailored in several ways to individuals living with TBI. Brief care management at the beginning of each session addressed issues specific to promoting TBI rehabilitation and recovery,\n76\nincluding return to work or school, substance abuse, social and interpersonal isolation, and transportation difficulties. Patients' support persons (spouse, significant other, parent, adult child, or other caregiver) were invited to attend sessions to assist with planning, implementing, and monitoring CBT-TBI activities. Motivational interviewing (MI) was used to engage participants in the treatment protocol.\n77\nThe CBT-TBI sessions occurred weekly over 12 rather than 8 weeks so that the material could be presented in smaller portions, more slowly and with greater repetition.\nTable 1\nillustrates session content and\nTable 2\nlists accommodations for cognitive impairments. Therapy sessions were generally kept to 30\u201360\u2009min to minimize problems with mental fatigue, and began with a review of issues from the previous session.\nTable\n1.\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy for Traumatic Brain Injury (CBT-TBI) Treatment Session Content\nSession\nSession content\na\nInitial contact\nIntroductions, explain program, review materials, answer questions, schedule calls.\n1\nDepression education.

Participants were asked to read the relevant workbook chapter prior to each session. During each session, the therapist followed a specific agenda. After each session, the therapist mailed a personalized follow-up letter describing mutually agreed-upon plans for between-session exercises. Following the final session, in addition to a summary follow up letter, participants received a list of local TBI and mental health resources.\nThe same two therapists (S.V. and J.D.) delivered both the telephone and in-person CBT. Therapists followed and completed detailed session-by-session checklists to assure fidelity to the structure and content of the intervention. All sessions were audiotaped, and a random 10% were reviewed using a fidelity checklist. Average therapist ratings for both CBT modalities were excellent and exceeded 95%. No differences in quality ratings were observed for any therapist for either modality. All recorded sessions received detailed review and corrective feedback during weekly supervision by one of the study supervisors.\n\nUsual care\nParticipants assigned to usual care were notified by phone of their depression status and encouraged to continue using the rehabilitation and primary care services available to them. Patients were provided a list of local mental health and TBI resources and were free to self-refer to mental health services outside the study.\n\nStatistical analysis\nFisher exact and Mann\u2013Whitney\nU\ntests were used to compare demographic, clinical, and process variables among groups. Mixed-effects linear regression models were used to compare treatment efficacy of combined CBT, CBT-T, and CBT-IP compared with UC. Primary analysis included observations at baseline, and 8, 16, and 24 weeks, with 16 weeks being the prespecified time of primary interest. Eight and 24 week outcomes were included to examine early effects of treatment, and persistence of effect beyond the treatment period, respectively. Random effects were included for participants' intercepts. Fixed effects were time (categorical, with pretreatment as the reference category), assigned treatment (CBT vs. UC), interaction of time with treatment, stratification factors (acceptable treatments, severe vs. complicated mild or moderate TBI), and potential confounders and variables to improve sensitivity; that is, variables related to outcome without consideration of treatment. The primary indicator of treatment effect was the interaction of time by treatment. We calculated the mean treatment effect for the depression outcomes as the time-by-treatment interaction evaluated at 16 weeks; that is, the estimated difference between treatment groups at 16 weeks in excess of the difference at baseline. Exact logistic regression was used to compare depression response rates (\u226550% decrease from baseline), PGI (percent very much or much improved) and satisfaction with treatment (percent very or moderately satisfied) at 16 weeks. Secondary outcomes were assessed using mixed-effects linear regression models, controlling for the same variables as in the primary analysis. SPSS 17.0 and SAS 9.3 statistical software were used for the analyses.\nVariables examined as potential confounders included: age, sex, medical comorbidity, depression variables (MDD duration, number of prior MDD episodes, pre-injury history), PTSD history, litigation, word recall (HVLT-delayed recall score), psychomotor speed and cognitive flexibility (TMT B), and baseline EROS and DAS scores. We examined potential effect modification by the following domains: demographics, depression variables, medical comorbidity, injury characteristics (TBI severity, time since injury), and other psychiatric history (history of substance dependence, history of PTSD), cognitive function, baseline EROS and DAS, involvement of a support person in CBT, and concurrent mental health treatment (counseling or antidepressants during the 16 week study period)."

    "Methods": "Spinal cord injury and drug treatment\nSpinal cord contusions were performed using standardized protocols as described previously.\n20\u201322\nAll procedures conformed to National Institutes of Health and The Ohio State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee care guidelines. Briefly, adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (223g\u2013280g; Harlan, Houston, TX) were anesthetized with intraperitoneal (i.p.) ketamine (80\u2009mg/kg, i.p) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg, i.p.), and a dorsal laminectomy was performed at the vertebral level C5 (\nn\n=3\u20135/group), T8 (\nn\n=3\u20134/group) or, T12 (spinal segment L1) (\nn\n=3\u20134/group). Rats then received a moderate midline spinal contusion injury using the Infinite Horizons device (Precision Systems and Instrumentation) with a preset force of 200 kD. The muscles overlying the spinal cord were sutured and the skin was closed with surgical clips. Animals were given 5\u2009mL of saline and placed into warm recovery cages immediately after the injury. Postsurgical care included 5 days of antibiotic treatment (Gentamicin, 5\u2009mg/kg) and saline to maintain hydration, and twice-a-day manual bladder expression until spontaneous voiding returned.\n\nHepatic macrophage analysis\nAt the appropriate time post-injury (\nn\n=3\u20136 per time point post-injury), animals were given a lethal dose of ketamine (120\u2009mg/kg, i.p) and xylazine (15\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) and transcardially perfused with 0.1M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) until the liver was cleared of blood. Next, animals were perfused with 400\u2009mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The livers were removed and post-fixed in 4% PFA for 2\u2009h followed by phosphate buffer overnight. The next day, the tissue was transferred to 30% sucrose for 3 days before freezing and blocking for tissue sectioning. Tissue sections were cut at 10\u2009\u03bcm using a cryostat and slide mounted (Superfrost Plus Slides, Fisher Scientific); slides were stored at \u221220\u00b0C until used. For tissue analysis, hepatic macrophages were visualized using immunohistochemistry for CD68 (Serotec, MCA341R, 1:2,000). Microscopic images of liver sections were digitized (MCID Image Analysis software, Imaging Research Inc), and three random fields were quantified per animal. The area of anti-CD68 labeling was divided by the total sample area to calculate the proportional area of liver CD68 immunoreactivity.\n\nHepatic lipid analysis\nOil red O staining was performed to visualize hepatic lipid accumulation. Liver sections were placed in 4% PFA for 20\u2009min to further fix the tissue. Next, the tissue was placed in 70% ethanol for 10\u2009min before being placed in a saturated solution of Oil red O dissolved in 70% ethanol at 60\u00b0C for 30\u2009min. The tissue was differentiated in ethanol, washed in distilled water, and then coverslipped with Immu-mount (Thermo Scientific). Quantification of hepatic lipid content was performed using MCID Image Analysis software. Liver sections were digitized, and the proportional area of the liver positive for stained lipids was calculated as above. Each region of interest was centered on a central vein and the area of Oil Red O staining was normalized to the hepatocyte area to control for differences in the area of vasculature. To determine lipid droplet n size, Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD) was used to measure the size of lipid droplets within each section. The maximum droplet size at each time post-injury was compared with na\u00efve using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).\n\nHepatic lipidomic analysis\nA crude lipid extract from liver tissue samples was obtained using a modified Bligh and Dyer procedure as described previously.\n23\n,\n24\nCeramide C12:0 (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) was included in extraction solvent as an internal standard. Extracts were dried in a nitrogen evaporator (Organomation Associates Inc, Berlin, MA) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Dried extracts were resuspended in pure methanol just before analysis. Analyses of ceramides were performed on a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (API3000, AB Sciex Inc. Thornhill, Ontario, Canada) using instrument settings similar to those described in previous studies.\n23\n,\n24\nSamples were injected using a CTC PAL autosampler (LEAP technologies Inc., Carrboro, NC) into an HPLC (PerkinElmer, Wellesley, MA) equipped with a reverse phase C18 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The column was first pre-equilibrated for 0.5\u2009min with the first mobile phase consisting of 85% methanol, 15% H\n2\n0, and 5\u2009mM ammonium formate, then eluted with the second mobile phase consisting of 99% methanol, 1% formic acid, and 5\u2009mM ammonium formate at the flow rate of 400.0\u2009\u03bcL/min. The eluted sample was injected into the ion source where the detection of each ceramide species was conducted by multiple reaction monitoring. Spectral analysis was conducted using MultiQuant software (AB Sciex Inc, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada), and each peak area was individually validated and normalized to the internal standard. Final data for each ceramide species were expressed as the ratio of analyte/internal standard.\n\nHepatic gene analysis\nAt the appropriate time post-injury (\nn\n=3\u20135 per time post-injury), animals were given a lethal dose of ketamine (120\u2009mg/kg, i.p) and xylazine (15\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) and transcardially perfused with 0.1M PBS until the tissue was cleared of blood. The liver was rapidly dissected and immediately homogenized with Trizol Reagent (15596018, Life Technologies). The homogenate was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until processed for RNA isolation and cDNA generation as described previously.\n21\nHepatic mRNA expression of CD68, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, chemokine ligand (CXCL)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, chemokine ligand (CCL)-2, and 18S was examined using a 7900HT Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) and the primers listed in\nTable 1\n. Ribosomal 18S expression was used to normalized values for each animal, and mRNA levels were calculated using the \u0394\u0394CT method.\n25\nTable\n1.\nPrimers for Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Based Quantification of Hepatic Gene Expression\nName\nForward sequence\nReverse sequence\nCCL2\nAGCCAACTCTCACTGAAGCC\nAACTGTGAACAACAGGCCCA\nCXCL1\nCAGACAGTGGCAGGGATTCA\nTGACTTCGGTTTGGGTGCAG\nIL-1\u03b1\nTCACTCGCATGGCATGTGCTGA\nTCGGGCTGGTTCCACTAGGCT\nIL-1\u03b2\nGAAGATGGAAAAGCGGTTTG\nAACTATGTCCCGACCATTGC\nTNF\u03b1\nTCGTAGCAAACCACCAAGCG\nATGGCAGAGAGGAGGCTGACTTTC\nCD68\nGGATTCAAACAGGACCGACATCAG\nCTACAGAGTGGACTGGAGCAAATGC\n18S\nTTCGGAACTGAGGCCATGAT\nTTTCGCTCTGGTCCGTCTTG\nSPT-lc1\nGCCTTCCTCCTCCAAGCATC\nTGGGCAGGAGCCTACAAAAG\nOpen in a separate window\nCCL, chemokine ligand; IL, interleukin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; SPT, serine palmitoyltransferase.\n\nSerum analysis of ALT\nAt the time of perfusion, cardiac blood was collected and allowed to clot at room temperature for 30\u2009min.

    "Methods": "Design and subjects\nThis prospective, observational, multicenter study was performed in six intensive care units of Spain. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethic Review Board of the six participating hospitals: Hospital Universitario de Canarias (La Laguna, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain), Hospital Universitario Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Candelaria (Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain), Hospital General de La Palma (La Palma, Spain), Hospital Cl\u00ednico Universitario de Valencia (Valencia, Spain), Hospital Insular (Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain), Hospital Universitario Dr. Negr\u00edn (Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain). Written informed consent from the patients or from their legal guardians was obtained.\nWe included 100 patients with severe TBI. Severity of brain trauma injury was classified according to Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS),\n15\nand severe TBI was defined as GCS lower than 9 points.\nExclusion criteria were: age less than 18 years, pregnancy, inflammatory or malignant disease, and Injury Severity Score (ISS) in noncranial aspects higher than 9 points.\n16\n\nVariables recorded\nThe following variables were recorded for each patient: sex, age, ISS, GCS, lactic acid, platelets, international normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score,\n17\nand brain lesion according to the Marshall CT classification.\n18\n\nEnd-point\nThe end-point of the study was 30-day mortality.\n\nBlood sample collection\nBlood samples were collected in tubes with separator gel to obtain serum from 100 patients with severe TBI on day 1 of TBI, and from 75 healthy controls to measure concentrations of MDA. After coagulation during 10\u2009min at room temperature, serum was obtained by centrifugation at 1000\u2009g for 15\u2009min. The samples were aliquoted and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until determination.\n\nSerum MDA analysis\nThe assay of MDA levels was centralized in the Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine (University of the La Laguna. Santa Cruz de Tenerife. Spain). Serum MDA levels were measured using thiobarbituric acid (TBA)-reactive substance (TBARS) method as described by Kikugawa and associates.\n19\nwith some modifications. A volume sample of 0.2\u2009mL was added to 0.2\u2009mL of H\n3\nPO\n4\n(0.2\u2009M), and the color reaction was initiated by the addition of 25\u2009\u03bcL of 0.11\u2009M TBA solution. Samples were placed in a 90\u00b0C heating block for 50\u2009min. After the samples were cooled, the TBARS (pink complex color) were extracted with 0.4\u2009mL of\nn\n-butanol. Butanolic phase was separated by centrifugation at 6000\u00d7g for 10\u2009min.\nAliquots of the\nn\n-butanol phase were placed in a 96 well-plate and read at 535\u2009nm in a microlate spectrophotometer reader (Benchmark Plus, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The calibration curve was prepared with authentic MDA standards ranging from 0\u201320\u2009nmol/mL. The detection limit of this assay was 0.079\u2009nmol/mL; the intra- and interassay coefficient of variability were 1.82% and 4.01%, respectively. The serum concentration of MDA was expressed in nmol/mL. To avoid the possible dispersion of serum MDA level results, all the samples were processed at the same time, at the end of the recruitment process. MDA determination was performed by a laboratory technician blinded to all clinical data.\n\nStatistical methods\nContinuous variables are reported as medians and interquartile ranges. Categorical variables are reported as frequencies and percentages. Comparisons of continuous variables between groups were performed using Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, and we reported the value of\nU.\nComparisons between groups for categorical variables were performed with the chi-square test, and we reported the value of \u03c7\n2\n(df).\nMultiple binomial logistic regression analysis was applied to predict 30-day mortality. Because the number of events (death) was 27, we constructed three multiple binomial logistic regression models with only three predictor variables in each to avoid an overfitting effect that may lead to selecting a final model of slightly higher order than required.\n20\nWe considered to include in regression analysis those significant variables in the bivariate analysis and were included in each model, avoiding the collinearity effect.\n21\nIn the first model, serum MDA levels, GCS, and age were included. In the second model, serum MDA levels, APACHE-II score, and CT classification were included. In the third model, serum MDA levels, APACHE-II score, and sex were included. Before including the variable CT classification in the regression analysis, it was recoded according to the risk of death observed in the bivariate analysis, as low (CT types 2 and 5) and high risk (CT types 3, 4, and 6), because we found a mortality rate of 3/24 (12.5%) in patients with CT classification type 2, 5/18 (27.8%) with type 3, 6/16 (37.5%) with type 4, 5/31 (16.1%) with type 5, and 8/11 (72.7%) with type 6. Thus, patients with CT classification types 2 and 5, with a combined mortality rate of 8/55 (14.5%), were considered to be at low risk; and patients with CT classification types 3, 4, and 6, with a combined mortality rate of 19/45 (42.2%), were considered to be at high risk. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated as measures of the clinical impact of the predictor variables.\nReceiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to estimate the area under the curve (AUC), and we used the likelihood ratio between sensitivity/1-specificity as criteria to select the cutoff of the serum MDA level to predict 30-day mortality. Thirty-day Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and comparisons by log-rank test were performed using serum MDA levels lower/higher than 1.96\u2009nmol/mL as the independent variable and survival at 30 days as the dependent variable. The association between continuous variables was assessed using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient.\nA\nP\nvalue of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and NCSS 2000 (Kaysville, Utah) and LogXact 4.1, (Cytel Co., Cambridge, MA)."

    "Methods": "Experiment 1: Buspirone dose response\nSubjects and surgery\nFifty-two male Sprague-Dawley pediatric rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) were initially housed with their dams in a Plexiglas cage and maintained in a temperature (21\u00b11\u00b0C) and light (on 0700 to 1900) controlled environment. The rats were all postnatal day-17 (PND-17) on the day of surgery, which consisted of a CCI injury that was produced as described previously,\n19\n,\n22\n,\n28\n,\n41\n,\n42\nwith the exception of some necessary modifications for the smaller rats. Specifically, surgical anesthesia was induced and maintained with inspired concentrations of 4% and 2% isoflurane (carried in 2:1\u2009N\n2\nO/O\n2\n), respectively, via a nose cone. The rats were secured to a stereotaxic frame, and core temperature was monitored with a rectal thermometer and maintained at 37\u00b10.5\u00b0C with a heating blanket.\nUsing aseptic procedures, a midline scalp incision was made, the skin and fascia were reflected to expose the skull, and a craniectomy was produced in the right hemisphere (between bregma/lambda and the sagittal suture/coronal ridge) with a high-speed dental drill. The impact tip (6\u2009mm, flat) was lowered and centered through the craniectomy such that it produced a brain injury of moderate severity (2.2\u2009mm tissue deformation at 4\u2009m/sec). Immediately after the CCI, anesthesia was discontinued, and the incision was promptly sutured. Rats were assessed for acute neurological outcome and placed in a heated chamber (maintained at 37\u00b10.5\u00b0 C) until able to ambulate freely and then were returned to their dam in the colony. Sham rats underwent comparable surgical procedures, sans the CCI.\nPost-surgery\nAfter surgery, the rats were randomly assigned to four TBI groups, which are denoted as TBI+buspirone (0.08\u2009mg/kg;\nn\n=9), TBI+buspirone (0.1\u2009mg/kg;\nn\n=9), TBI+buspirone (0.3\u2009mg/kg;\nn\n=9), TBI+vehicle (1.0\u2009mL/kg;\nn\n=9), and four sham control groups (\nn\n=16) that received the same doses of buspirone and vehicle as their TBI counterparts. The pediatric pups were weaned on PND-28 and pair-housed in standard (STD) steel-wire mesh cages where they had\nad libitum\naccess to rat chow and water. All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Pittsburgh. Every attempt was made to minimize discomfort, suffering, and the number of animals used.\nAcute neurological evaluation\nHindlimb reflexive ability was assessed immediately after the discontinuation of anesthesia by gently squeezing the rat's paw every 5\u2009sec and recording the latency to elicit a withdrawal response. Return of the righting reflex was determined by recording the time needed for the rat to return to the prone position after three consecutive supine placements.\nDrug administration\nBuspirone (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO) was prepared daily by dissolving in sterile saline, which also served as the vehicle. Buspirone (0.08\u2009mg/kg, 0.1\u2009mg/kg, or 0.3\u2009mg/kg) and vehicle (1.0\u2009mL/kg) were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) beginning 24\u2009h after surgery and once daily for 16 days. On the days of behavioral testing, the injections were administered 1\u2009h before testing to avoid behavioral symptoms associated with the serotonin syndrome (e.g., flat body posture) that could affect performance. The doses and route of administration were selected based on previous data from our laboratory showing a narrow therapeutic range.\n25\nCognitive function: spatial learning\nAcquisition of spatial learning was assessed using a Morris water maze (MWM)\n43\ntask that has been shown to be a sensitive indicator of cognitive function after TBI.\n23\n,\n44\u201347\nThe maze consisted of a plastic pool (180\u2009cm diameter; 60\u2009cm high) filled with tap water (26\u00b11\u00b0C) to a depth of 28\u2009cm and situated in a room with prominent visual cues. The platform was a clear Plexiglas stand (10\u2009cm diameter, 26\u2009cm high) that was positioned 26\u2009cm from the maze wall in the southwest quadrant and held constant for each rat.\nSpatial learning consisted on providing four blocks of daily trials (four min intertrial interval) for 5 consecutive days (post-operative days 11\u201315) in which the rat was given a maximum of 120\u2009sec to find the submerged platform (2\u2009cm below the water surface (i.e., invisible to the rat). On post-operative day 16, the platform was raised 2\u2009cm above the water surface (i.e., visible to the rat) as a control to determine the contributions of nonspatial factors (e.g., sensorimotor performance, motivation, and visual acuity) on cognitive performance. Each trial lasted until the rat climbed onto the platform or the maximum allotted time had elapsed, whichever occurred first. If the rats did not find the platform within the given time, they were manually guided to it. All rats remained on the platform for 30 cumulative sec and then were returned to a heated incubator between trials. The times of the four daily trials for each rat were averaged and used in the statistical analyses.\nCognitive function: memory retention\nOne day after the final acquisition training session in the MWM (i.e., day 16), all rats were given a single probe trial to measure memory retention. During this trial, the platform was removed from the pool, and the rats were placed in the maze from the location point most distal to the southwest quadrant (i.e., the \u201ctarget quadrant\u201d where the platform was previously located) and allowed to freely explore the pool for 30\u2009sec and the percent time spent in the target quadrant was recorded. A spontaneous motor activity recording and tracking (SMART) system (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA) was used to record the data, which included time to locate the platform and percent time in the target quadrant.\nHistology: quantification of cortical lesion volume\nOn post-operative day 17, the rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50\u2009mg/kg, i.p.), and then perfused transcardially with 200\u2009mL 0.1M phosphate-buffed saline (pH 7.4) and 300\u2009mL 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were extracted, post-fixed in the perfusate for 1 week, dehydrated with alcohols, and embedded in paraffin wax. Seven-micrometer-thick coronal sections were cut at 1-mm intervals throughout the lesion using a rotary microtome and mounted on gelatin-coated glass microscope slides. After drying at room temperature, the coronal sections were deparaffinized in xylenes, rehydrated, and stained with cresyl violet. Cortical lesion volumes (mm\n3\n) were determined by first calculating the area of the lesion (mm\n2\n) by outlining the inferred area of missing cortical tissue for each section taken at 1-mm intervals (MCID software; Imagining Research, Ontario, Canada), and then multiplying the distance between each section (1\u2009mm) by the sum of the lesion area obtained from each section.\nStatistical analysis\nData analyses were performed using StatView 5.0.1 software (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA) by observers blinded to treatment conditions. The cognitive data were analyzed by repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), while the acute neurological evaluations, probe trial, swim speed, and histological data were analyzed by one-factor ANOVAs. When the ANOVA revealed a significant effect, the Fisher PLSD\npost-hoc\ntest was used to determine specific group differences. The results are expressed as the mean\u00b1standard error of the mean (SEM) and are considered significant when\np\nvalues are\u22640.05."

    "Methods": "Patient population\nEleven ED sites participated in patient recruitment for the study from a consecutive sample of patients presenting following a closed head injury and meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria described subsequently. Clinical sites included: Barnes Jewish Medical Center, Detroit Receiving Hospital, University of Virginia Medical Center, University of Maryland Medical Center (R. Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center), Sinai-Grace Hospital, Brooke Army Medical Center, University of Rochester Strong Memorial Hospital, Duke University Hospital, Hartford Hospital, Sinai Grace Hospital, and Inova Fairfax Hospital. From this sample, 46 patients who were confirmed to have intracranial bleeding (\u22651\u2009cc), based on blinded, adjudicated measurements of ED CT scans, were selected for study. Those with such hematomas represented 40% of the the CT+ population (\nn\n=116) identified in the 394 cases referred for CT. A total of 278 CT\u2212 mTBI patients were selected from the same sample of ED brain-injured patients, and used as controls. mTBI was defined as a closed head injury, with or without loss of consciousness or amnesia, and with a GCS >8, (with all but one patient with GCS between 14 and 15).\nAll sites received approval from their respective Human Subjects Research Committees, and written informed consent was obtained prior to testing of all subjects. Assessment of the capacity of the subject to give informed consent was performed using the Conley criteria.\n17\n\nInclusion/exclusion criteria\nMale and female patients between the ages of 18 and 80 years who presented to the ED after a closed head injury and who had a CT scan of the head ordered as part of their clinical evaluation were eligible for inclusion. Patients were excluded if clinical conditions would not allow placement of the electrodes, or if they were obtunded as a result of intoxication to the point where they could not provide informed consent. In addition, patients with known psychiatric disorders, including chronic drug or alcohol dependence disorders, chronic seizure history, or mental retardation, or who were currently taking medication affecting the central nervous system (CNS) on a daily basis for a chronic psychiatric condition, were not eligible for the study. If the head injury occurred following a seizure, the patient was not a candidate for this study.\n\nCT scans\nAll head CT scans were noncontrast, and were reviewed by a three member panel of independent experienced neuroradiologists (blinded to clinical and electroencephalographic [EEG] data), and positive CT findings were determined by majority rule. The CT+ reports in these patients included all intracranial hematomas, contusions, subarachnoid hemorrhages, cortical edema, and combinations of these etiologies. All but one CT scan were performed within 23\u2009h of the EEG data acquisition, with a mean of 5.03\u2009h, (85% were <12\u2009h, and were in the time frame of the standard of care practiced at the ED site of acquisition).\nThe neuroradiological adjudicators also scored all CT scans using the Marshall Scale (MS) scoring system.\n18\nThe MS, used largely by neurosurgeons, rates the severity of CT abnormality using six categories (I\u2013VI), based largely on volume of blood and midline shift.\n19\nAlthough the MS is relatively insensitive to gradations of neurological severity in cases in which neurosurgical intervention is not indicated, and is not used routinely in ED assessment, it is applied here as a measure of the mild nature of the CT abnormalities in the population of study.\n\nBlood volume measurements\nBecause of concerns about the subjective nature of CT scan readings when evaluated conventionally by visual inspection and the poor inter-rater and within-rater reliability reported in the literature, in this study we used a method for quantification of the severity of the hematoma.\nThe volume of blood and distance from recording electrodes were measured by blinded independent experts using a published method for volume measurement,\n11\nin the same manner as has been done in the previously published work, and which was described in detail by Hanley and colleagues, cited earlier.\n12\nMeasurements of intracranial hematomas were calculated by two independent neuroradiologically trained technician readers (A.M.), blinded to the EEG results and adjudicated by a third reader (D.H.) when required by discrepancy. Each hematoma was classified in terms of the lobe(s) compromised (frontal, parietal, temporal, or occipital), hemisphere affected (left or right), and hematoma type (epidural [EDH]; subdural [SDH]; or intracerebral [ICH]). Quantitative measurements of the volume of blood within the hematoma were performed with operator-defined region of interest segmentation as described by OsiriX\n11\n(see\nFig. 1\n). In instances of multiple hematomas, a single volume was attributed to each unique bleeding location. When a single bleed spanned multiple lobes, the volume was indicated in the lobe in which the epicenter was localized. It is important to note that subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAH) were not assigned a volume. The distance of the bleeding event from the location of the EEG electrodes (midpoint between FP1 and FP2) was also evaluated, to assess whether using only frontal electrodes influenced accuracy of detection. Two linear measurements (mm) were performed for each unique bleeding event, one to the shortest distance from the electrodes to the bleed, (using FP1 or FP2, depending upon the lobe of the bleed); and the second corresponded to the distance from the same sensor to the epicenter of the bleed. Only patients with hematomas with blood volumes \u22651\u2009cc were considered candidates for this study.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nRepresentation of the perimeter of a subdural (left panel, red) and an intracranial hematoma (right panel, pink). The volume was calculated by multiplying the area of each region of interest by the slice thickness.\n\nElectrophysiological data acquisition and analysis\nFive to ten minutes of eyes closed resting EEG was recorded on a handheld device. EEG recordings were made from five frontal electrode sites of the International 10/20 system referenced to linked ears, using a disposable headset that optimized ease and standardization of placement. Recording sites included: FP1, FP2, AFz (located just anterior to Fz on the forehead, below the hairline), F7, and F8. All electrode impedances were below 10\u2009k\u03a9. Amplifiers had a bandpass from 0.3 to 250\u2009Hz (3\u2009dB points). The EEG data were subjected to automatic artifact rejection algorithms for identification and removal of any biologic and nonbiologic contamination, such as that from eye movement or muscle movement. Details of these algorithms are given elsewhere.\n3\nWhen an artifact was identified in any channel, data from all channels at that time point were removed. Artifact-free data (60\u2013120\u2009sec) were concatenated after removal of artifact, with the minimum for any artifact-free segment being 2.5\u2009sec. Sufficient artifact-free data were obtained from all study subjects. EEG recording was made as early as was practically possible without interfering with the clinical workup of the patient, with the vast majority (>85%) tested within 12\u2009h of injury.\nThe artifact-free EEG data were submitted to offline feature extraction, and the features were input to an independently developed linear discriminant classifier function described previously and in detail elsewhere (see Prichep et al.\n4\n), which had high sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing patients with structural brain damage (CT+). This binary discriminant classification function was derived using an evolutionary algorithm.\n20\nAn evolutionary algorithm performs a stochastic search (which involves randomness from one iteration to the next) and evaluates a series of candidate solutions, in which each new candidate is informed by high-performing predecessors, similar to genetic evolution.\n21\u201329\nThe final classifier function consists of a weighted combination of selected linear and nonlinear features that reflect brain electrical activity, which mathematically describes traumatic structural brain injury as distinguished from normal or concussed brain activity. The patients in this study were completely independent of the database used to develop the classification algorithm. Each patient's brain electrical activity data were submitted to the algorithm off line, without any information about the patient's clinical status. In addition to the binary classification output (TBI-Index), there was a continuous discriminant score, which was used in analyses that explored the correlation between such scores and blood volume and distance measurements described previously."

    "Methods": "The Hospital Corporation of America\u2013HealthONE Institutional Review Board for Craig Hospital authorized this study as part of the TBIMS National Data and Statistical Center. Since 1987, the US Department of Education\u2019s National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR) has funded the TBIMS. One of the major components of the TBIMS program is a standardized NDB for innovative analyses of TBI treatment and outcomes.17The TBIMS NDB contains information on cases treated within the 23 TBIMS centers, funded between 1988 and 2013, which are located throughout the US. For the purposes of the NDB, TBI is defined as damage to brain tissue caused by an external mechanical force, as evidenced by medically documented loss of consciousness or post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) caused by brain trauma or by objective neurological findings that can be reasonably attributed to TBI on physical examination or mental status examination. In addition, subjects included in the database must 1) meet at least one of the following criteria for moderate to severe TBI: PTA > 24 h, trauma-related intracranial neuroimaging abnormalities, loss of consciousness > 30 min, or a Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) in the emergency department of < 13 (unless caused by intubation, sedation, or intoxication); 2) be at least 16 years of age at the time of injury; 3) present to the Model System\u2019s acute care hospital within 72 h of injury; 4) receive both acute hospital care and comprehensive rehabilitation in a designated brain injury inpatient unit within the Model System; and 5) provide informed consent to participate or have a proxy provide consent.18\n\nFor purposes of this study, the TBIMS NDB as of March 30, 2013 was limited to 7373 individuals treated within 20 TBIMS Centers, with inpatient rehabilitation admission dates beginning between October 1, 2001 and December 31, 2010, and with follow-up or death dates through December 31, 2011. This sample was further reduced to 6913 cases because of missing data on key variables necessary to calculate the SMRs (e.g., race/ethnicity, gender, age, death status, date of death). Information in the database was collected during acute care and rehabilitation hospitalization, and at 1 year, 2 years, 5 years and every 5 years thereafter at the approximate anniversary of injury. The rate of successful follow-up across all follow-up time points is 80%.18\n\nTBIMS staff attempted to contact individuals for an interview; if they were told that the person had died, or a search in the Social Security Death Index indicated that the person had died, the death date was entered in the NDB. TBIMS staff then attempted to obtain the death certificate, which was sent to the TBIMS National Data and Statistical Center (NDSC) for the purpose of coding causes of death using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes and entering those codes into the NDB. ICD-9-CM is used to code cause of death for the NDB to maintain coding consistency across years since the NDB began prior to the implementation of ICD-10. One primary cause of death, one secondary cause of death, and one external cause injury and poisoning (E-code) cause of death are recorded in the NDB based on guidelines specified for coding for the NDB, which could include both Cause of Death Part I and Part II of the death certificate.19If an E-code is indicated as a cause of death, it becomes the primary cause of death. For the purposes of this study, only the primary cause of death was used.\n\nIfbetween follow-up interviewscenter staff learned that a participant had died (e.g., perhaps through a clinical contact or the participant\u2019s medical record), the date of death was recorded in the NDB at that time. If contact with the participant or a knowledgeable proxy at a routine follow-up was not made, center staff attempted to verify the vital status of participants using the Social Security Administration\u2019s Death Index (SSDI). If a person was not listed in the SSDI as deceased and could not be found, he or she was reported as lost at that time. Even if a person were reported as lost at one scheduled interview, the staff would attempt to contact the individual at the next scheduled follow-up. Cases reported as lost were censored at the previous follow-up point at which the person\u2019s vital status could be verified (i.e., the person or a proxy was interviewed, the person or a proxy refused to be interviewed, the person withdrew from the study, or the person was incarcerated).\n\nThe TBIMS NDB can be weighted to represent individuals who received inpatient rehabilitation for a primary diagnosis of TBI in the US. The TBIMS NDB data were weighted using an iterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedure (also called \u201craking\u201d) that simultaneously aligns the proportions of numerous sample characteristics, such as age and gender, with those of the larger population. In this case, sample distributions were the distributions of the categorical characteristics of the TBIMS NDB, and the populations\u2019 values were the distributions of the categorical characteristics of the US TBI rehabilitation population included in the article by Cuthbert and coworkers.16Variables included as part of the raking procedure, including the categorical distributions used, have been previously reported.20One requirement of raking is that proportions within both the sample and population must be \u2265 5%; therefore, instances in which either the US TBI rehabilitation population characteristics or those of the TBIMS NDB were found to be below this threshold were combined with additional categories. Missing values for these characteristics were rare ( < 33%) in the TBIMS NDB; however, those subjects with missing data across any of these variables had the missing value imputed using the estimation maximization algorithm prior to implementation of the raking procedure. At the completion of raking, weights were assessed by weight trimming, a process in which extreme weights (e.g. weights beyond the 95th or 99th percentiles) are removed, to reduce the mean squared error in subsequent analyses. However, in this particular case, weight trimming was not found to reduce the mean squared error for any of the evaluated outcomes; therefore, no weight trimming was performed. All raking was completed using SAS Version 9.3. Raking was completed prior to all analyses performed, as described in the Statistical analysis.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe data analysis for this study was performed using SAS software, Version 9.3 for Windows (SAS software, Version 9.3 of the SAS System for Windows, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Descriptive statistics (means for continuous variables and counts and proportions for categorical variables) were used to characterize the study sample. Vital status was determined as indicated. Only deaths occurring after discharge from the initial inpatient rehabilitation and before January 1, 2012, were included in the study.\nThe expected number of deaths in the absence of TBI was calculated by applying age-sex-race-specific mortality rates published by the federal government\n21\nfor the calendar year 2005 (the median person-years of follow-up in the study) to each year of follow-up for each person in the study, and summing the results. The SMR for this TBI population was calculated as the ratio of actual number of deaths to the expected number of deaths. Statistical significance of the SMR was determined by calculating the 95% confidence interval, which was considered significant if that confidence interval did not contain one.\n22\nSMRs were also calculated for age, race, gender, TBI severity (based on GCS score at emergency department admission) and time post-injury, and specific causes of death. For the cause of death-specific SMRs, the expected number of deaths in the absence of TBI was calculated using the methodology described previously, with the age-sex-race-specific mortality rates taken into account for each cause of death category.\n21\nIn 1999, the federal government transitioned from using ICD-9 to ICD-10 for coding the cause of death. The cause of death mortality rates based on ICD-10 code categories were used to calculate expected deaths for the SMRs, and these were then matched to observed causes of death by ICD-9 code categories, because the NDSC had used the ICD-9 to code the death certificates (ICD-9/ICD-10 code category crosswalk, which was matched by organ system categories from the CDC WONDER system).\nComparative life expectancy with and without TBI by age, sex, and race was estimated by applying the overall SMR for those with TBI to the latest age-sex-race-specific mortality rates published by the federal government for the most recent year available at the time of this study (calendar year 2010), using the methodology described by DeVivo.\n22\nIt is of note that this methodology assumes a constant SMR with advancing age, and often results in a slight underestimation of long-term survival probabilities and life expectancy.\nFinally, to assess the impact of each potential mortality risk factor, Cox proportional hazards regression analysis based on the weights generated by the IPF was conducted, taking into account the number of days in the study. A backward selection procedure was used so that each risk factor had the opportunity to be considered in the model reduction process. Only risk factors that exhibited a significant relationship (\np\n< 0.05) with the outcome of interest were retained. Demographic factors assessed in the analyses were age at injury, sex, race/ethnic group, level of education, marital status, and employment status at injury. Pre-injury drug use and alcohol use were also used as factors. Injury-related risk factors included calendar year of injury (i.e., to determine if risk of death was greater having had an injury a decade earlier than more recently, for example because of improvements in medical care), and cause of injury. Other potential risk factors included the number of days from injury to inpatient rehabilitation discharge, third-party sponsor for rehabilitation care, place of discharge after rehabilitation, and the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) Scores (Motor and Cognitive)\n23\nand the Disability Rating Scale (DRS)\n24\nscores at rehabilitation discharge. For the purposes of this study, DRS had a score range of 0, indicating no disability, to 29, indicating extreme vegetative state."

    "Methods": "Participants\nParticipants were derived from a larger sample of 3205 service members evaluated at one of six Military Medical Centers: San Antonio Military Medical Center, San Antonio, TX (SAMMC;\nn\n=1053); Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, MD (WRNMMC;\nn\n=861); Naval Medical Center San Diego, San Diego, CA (NMCSD;\nn\n=437); Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, Camp Pendleton, CA (MCBCP;\nn\n=476); Marine Corps Base Twenty Nine Palms, Twenty Nine Palms, CA (MCB29P;\nn\n=108); and Wilford Hall Air Force Medical Center, San Antonio, TX (WHAFMC;\nn\n=222), and 48 cases were missing a location variable.\nInclusion criteria for selecting the current sample consisted of closed head injury only (excluded\nn\n=71), valid and complete Post-traumatic Checklist-Civilian version (PCL-C) and Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI) inventories (excluded\nn\n=350), injury sustained in OEF/OIF (excluded\nn\n=493), time tested post-injury between 1 and 24 months (excluded\nn\n=984), sustained mild TBI only (excluded\nn\n=596), and were male (excluded\nn\n=28). Females were excluded only because of the relatively small number who met inclusion criteria. There were 104 persons who were excluded because of missing data regarding number of previous blast exposures. Finally, six additional service members were excluded because they reported exposure to more than 10 blasts. The Wilford Hall Air Force Medical Center Internal Review Board approved this study.\nFinal sample selection included 573 male active duty military service members (mean age=26.8 years, standard deviation=7.0, range=18\u201355), who sustained combat related MTBI, grouped into five categories: 0 blast exposures (\nn\n=68), 1 blast exposure (\nn\n=123), 2 blast exposures (\nn\n=178), 3 blast exposures (\nn\n=106), and 4\u201310 blast exposures (\nn\n=98). The number of blasts that characterize each group reflects the number of previous blast exposures subjectively reported by the service member plus the current mechanism of injury. Whereas diagnosis and verification of MTBI was required for inclusion in the study, it is unknown whether previous blast exposures resulted in undocumented MTBI. Previous blast exposure was simply operationalized as any blast that knocked the service member off his feet or resulted in injury. Number of previous blast exposures therefore does not necessarily reflect the number of previous concussions or MTBIs in this study.\nThe mechanism of injury/cause of current MTBI in all groups occurred in the context of a blast event except the 0 blast group. The primary blast pressure wave, however, may not have explicitly caused the MTBI in this sample. Primary, secondary, or tertiary blast injuries may have been the \u201cblast-related\u201d cause of MTBI in members of any of our groups (excluding the 0-blast group).\nThe distribution of participants by military service branch was as follows; Army (\nn\n=3 59, 62.7%), Marines (\nn\n=170, 29.6%), Navy (\nn\n=43, 7.5%) and Air Force (\nn\n=1, 0.2%).\nMTBI was classified according to Department of Defense (DoD) criteria with the exception of \u201ccomplicated\u201d mild cases. DoD guidelines suggest that any TBI resulting in abnormal brain imaging be classified as at least moderate in severity. For purposes of this research, however, we chose to include cases in which loss of consciousness (LOC) and post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) fell in the mild range (<30\u2009min and <24\u2009h, respectively), including those few with identified neuroimaging abnormalities (\nn\n=15).\nFor the 0 blast group (i.e., those with nonblast-related MTBI and no exposure to blast) the primary mechanism of injury was distributed as follows (more than one mechanism could be endorsed by the service members): fall (\nn\n=28, 41.2%), motor vehicle accident (\nn\n=23, 33.8%), bullet (\nn\n=2, 2.9%), and \u201cother\u201d (\nn\n=18, 26%). For the remaining groups, the source of blast-related MTBI was (again, more than one mechanism could be endorsed by the service members): improvised explosive device (\nn\n=412, 81.6%), land mine (\nn\n=7, 1.4%), rocket-propelled grenade (\nn\n=43, 8.5%), grenade (\nn\n=6, 1.2%), bomb (\nn\n=10, 2.0%), mortar (\nn\n=14, 2.8%), \u201cother\u201d (\nn\n=29, 5.7%).\n\nMeasures\nDetails of the service members' TBI and demographic data were obtained via the Clinical Tracking Form (CTF) and medical chart review. Post-concussion symptoms were measured with the NSI and PTSD symptoms with the PCL-C.\n\nCTF\nThe CTF is a structured questionnaire detailing the service member's TBI and was administered via a semi-structured clinical interview at one of the aforementioned Military Medical Centers by a physician assistant, nurse, neuropsychologist, or social worker trained in the assessment of TBI. The CTF queries demographic information such as the service member's age, sex, rank, and branch of military service. It also covers injury-related information, such as date, time, location, and mechanism of injury, directionality of impacts (if any), specific sensory deficits, presence and duration of LOC, and amnesia.\n\nPost-concussive symptoms\nThe NSI is a 22-item self-report inventory of common post-concussion sequelae.\n13\nSubjects are instructed to rate the presence/severity of each symptom within the past 2 weeks on a five-item Likert scale ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe). Analyses in this study were conducted on both NSI total scores as well as the four subscale scores identified in the original Cicerone factor analysis (cognitive, affective, sensory, and somatic) to facilitate comparison of present results with existing literature.\n\nPost-traumatic stress symptoms\nThe PCL-C is a self-rated interval-level rating scale used to screen for PTSD.\n14\nThe PCL-C consists of 17 items, each designed to capture one of three distinct clusters of symptoms representing PTSD diagnostic criteria in the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR)\n. These three clusters are labeled reexperiencing (items 1\u20135), avoidance or numbing (items 6\u201312) and hyperarousal (items 13\u201317). This self-reported measure requires the subject to rate how much he/she has been bothered by that symptom in the past month, using a 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely) Likert-scale value. Scores are derived by summing the weighted frequencies for all items and can range from 17 to 85. For the current study, PCL-C total scores were used to capture the degree of PTSD symptom severity.\n\nStatistical analyses\nDifferences in the demographic makeup of the five blast-exposure groups were explored using analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables and chi-square or Fisher exact (for TBI severity and LOC duration comparisons only) tests for categorical variables. Between-group differences on demographic and injury-related variables were tested with univariate ANOVAs and effect sizes calculated for significant differences. PTSD and post-concussive symptom endorsement were compared between groups using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with the demographic variables found to discriminate between groups included as covariates. An additional ANCOVA was conducted on post-concussion symptom endorsement, controlling for both demographic variables and PTSD symptom report. Finally, hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to ascertain the amount of variance in symptom reporting accounted for by number of blast exposures. For the purposes of symptom analyses in this investigation, \u201cdemographic\u201d is defined to include age, number of deployments, time since injury (TSI), and duration of LOC. All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 19."

    "Methods": "Materials\nThe PKA inhibitor, Rp-cAMPS, and the CaMKII inhibitor, KN-67 (4-[(2S)-2-[(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl) methylamino]-3-oxo-3-(4-phenyl-1-piperazinyl)propyl] phenyl isoquinolinesulfonic acid ester), were purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO). PKA regulatory (PKA RI-\u03b1/\u00df) and catalytic (PKA C-\u03b1) antibodies (Abs) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA).\n\nControlled cortical impact injury\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats (260\u2013300\u2009g) were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). All protocols involving the use of animals were in compliance with the National Institutes of Health's (NIH's)\nGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\nand were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee. An electric controlled cortical impact device (Virginia Commonwealth University Custom Design & Fabrication, Richmond, VA) was used to administer a unilateral brain injury, as previously described.\n24\u201326\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane and a 2:1 mixture of N\n2\nO/O\n2\n, then mounted in a stereotaxic frame. The head was held in a horizontal plane, and a 7-mm craniectomy was performed on the right cranial vault. The center of the craniectomy was placed at 3.0\u2009mm posterior of the bregma and 3.5\u2009mm lateral to the mid-line. Animals received a single impact of 3.3\u2009mm deformation with an impact velocity of 4.0\u2009m/sec at an angle of 10 degrees from the vertical plane using a 6-mm-diameter impactor tip. Impact was delivered onto the parietal association cortex. Body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C by the use of a heating pad.\n\nWorking memory\nAll behavioral tests were performed by an experimenter blind to the treatment groups. The delay match-to-place working memory task was carried out as previously described using five pairs of location-match trials.\n27\u201329\nFor tissue preparation, after locating the platform in the fifth location trial, the animal was allowed to remain on it for 10\u2009sec, then removed from the tank and immediately killed (within 20\u2009sec). mPFC tissue was removed and used for PKA activity measurements. For testing the influence of intra-mPFC drug infusions, rats were bilaterally implanted with sterile stainless-steel guide cannulae aimed at the dorsal border of the mPFC using a stereotaxic device (bregma 3.2\u2009mm, lateral\u00b10.75\u2009mm, and depth 2.5\u2009mm). Implantations were carried out immediately after TBI. Infusions (0.25\u2009\u03bcL/min for 4\u2009min) were carried out 30\u2009min before working memory assessment.\n\nProtein kinase A activity assay\nActivity of PKA was measured using a MESACUP protein Kinase Assay Kit (MBL International Co., Woburn, MA) as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, 25\u2009\u03bcg of mPFC proteins were used for the assay using the PS peptide (RFARKG\nS\nLRQKNV, with S being the site of phosphorylation) as a substrate. Because we have observed that freezing the tissue causes a marked loss in PKA activity, tissue homogenates were prepared from freshly dissected mPFC. The assay was carried in 25\u2009mM of Tris (pH 7.0), 3\u2009mM of MgCl\n2\n, 0.1\u2009mM of adenosine triphosphate, 0.5\u2009mM of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 1\u2009mM of ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, and 5\u2009mM of 2-mercaptoethanol. Phosphorylation of the serine residue was detected with a biotinylated monoclonal Ab and peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, and colorization of a peroxidase substrate. The assays were performed with and without 20\u2009\u03bcM of cAMP to compare fully stimulated PKA activity and the unstimulated activity. A purified PKA catalytic subunit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was used to generate standard curve for PKA activity assay.\n\nWestern blotting\nEqual amounts of mPFC protein extracts were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, then transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). After overnight blocking in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), membranes were incubated for 3\u2009h in primary Abs (0.1\u20130.5\u2009\u03bcg/mL) at room temperature. Membranes were washed, incubated with species-specific, alkaline-phosphatase\u2013conjugated secondary Abs and immunoreactivity detected using a chemiluminescence substrate. Bands were quantified using ImageJ software (freely available through NIH).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nTo assess the extent of Rp-cAMPS diffusion, rats were infused into the mPFC as described above with either saline or Rp-cAMPS, then killed 1 or 24\u2009h later. Brains were removed, cut into 2-mm slabs, and drop-fixed overnight in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde/15% picric acid in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cryoprotected brains were sectioned on a cryostat. Free-floating slices (40\u2009\u03bcm in thickness) that spanned the mPFC or dorsal hippocampus were incubated overnight in primary Ab (0.5\u20131.0\u2009\u03bcg/mL) in PBS plus 0.25% Triton X-100 containing 2% BSA and 2.5% normal goat serum. After extensive washing, immunoreactivity was detected using species-specific secondary Abs coupled to Alexa Fluors. Immunofluoresence results were corroborated in separate sections using horseradish-peroxidase\u2013conjugated secondary Abs and diaminobenzadine. Sections were visualized and photographed using a Zeiss Axiovert 2 (Carl Zeiss AG, Jena, Germany) microscope.\n\nQuantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction\nMessenger RNA (mRNA) was extracted from mPFC tissue with biotinylated poly-thymidine and streptavidin paramagnetic particles using a PolyATract System 1000 mRNA extraction kit (Promega, Madison, WI) as recommended by the manufacturer. The concentration of the mRNA was determined using a RiboGreen RNA quantification kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). A 20-ng sample of mRNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (Gad67) mRNA level, relative to the neuron-specific \u03b2-tubulin mRNA level, in each sample was quantified by amplification of the complementary DNA using TaqMan probes and the comparative threshold cycle (C\nT\n) method (Schmittgen and Livak, 2008)\n30\nin a StepOne real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequences of the primers and TaqMan probes were as follows: Gad67: forward primer 5\u2032-CAAACTCAGCGGCATAGAAA-3\u2032, reverse primer 5\u2032-GAAGAGGTAGCCTGCACACA-3\u2032, probe 5\u2032-TGCTGCTCCAGTGTTCTGCCA-3\u2032; neuron-specific \u03b2-tubulin: forward primer 5\u2032-CTCAACCACCTTGTGTCT-3\u2032, reverse primer 5\u2032-CATGAAGAAATGCAAGCG-3\u2032, probe 5\u2032-ATGAGCGGAGTCACCACC-3\u2032.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStudent's\nt\n-tests were used for the analysis of western blot data, and one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used to analyze changes in PKA activity over time. Two-way ANOVA was used for evaluating working memory performance and the effect of training on PKA activity. Results were considered significant at\np\n<0.05, with a Holm-Sidak method for multiple comparisons as the post-hoc test to isolate the groups with differences. Data are presented as the mean\u00b1standard error of the mean (SEM)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nForty male Wistar rats, each weighing between 250 and 300\u2009g, were obtained from the animal facility of the Health Science Center, Kuwait University (Safat, Kuwait). Animals were kept under conditions of constant temperature (23\u00b12\u00b0C) and humidity with a 12-h light/dark cycle. Moreover, rats were housed in pairs with free access to food and water\nad libitum\n. An ethical approval was obtained for all procedures from the animal ethics committee at the Health Sciences Center, Kuwait University, in accord with the guidelines of laboratory animal welfare and the National Institutes of Health\nGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\n(NIH publications no. 8023, revised 1978). All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and reduce the number of animals used in this study.\n\nSurgical procedure\nAnimals were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups (\nn\n=10): group 1: sham-operated rats; group 2: saline-treated crushed sciatic nerve rats (CRUSH); or group 3: 50-mg/kg EGCG-treated crushed sciatic nerve (CRUSH+EGCG) rats. In addition, a group of na\u00efve control rats were also maintained (group 4). Animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a mixture of Ketallar\n\u00ae\n(62.5\u2009mg/kg, Tekam\n\u00ae\n50 [ketamine HCl]; Hikma Pharmaceuticals, Amman, Jordan) and Rompun\n\u00ae\n(3.2\u2009mg/kg, 2% xylazine HCl; Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany). Surgical sites were shaved and cleaned with 70% alcohol. An incision was made in the right gluteal region, and the sciatic nerve was exposed by splitting the gluteal muscle with the aid of a surgical microscope. The sciatic nerve was crushed at a 10-mm distance from the sciatic notch for 60\u2009sec using a micro mosquito forceps (12.5\u2009cm [S] [500451] [09F S/N]; World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL). The nerve was then examined to ensure that the epineurial sheath was intact, but translucent (axotomy), and returned back under the muscle.\n11\n,\n12\nThe skin was sutured with fine silk sutures after repositioning the muscles. The recommended dose of EGCG, in many studies, was 50\u2009mg/kg i.p.\n4\n,\n13\u201317\nTherefore, we injected 50\u2009mg/kg (i.p.) of EGCG daily for 3 days, starting 1\u2009h after sciatic nerve crush injury in the treated group.\nWe chose the sciatic nerve crush technique to induce acute blunt sciatic nerve injury because it allows us to perform a standard direct trauma in each rat, and it also results in a lesion similar to those observed in patients with peripheral nerve injury. Factors such as duration and severity of the injury, as well as dose selection, can alter results. Moreover, uniform distribution of rats among different groups and random allocation provide some control of confounding factors. In order to minimize animal-animal variation in producing the injury in the accepted model for testing pharmacological substances on neuronal regeneration and recovery after an injury, we took the following approved parameters by many investigators using this well-established model.\n12\n,\n18\u201320\nThe same investigator conducted all surgeries while keeping all parameters identical. Nerve injury may depend on the length of time of crush insult. During our earlier trials, we tried different time frames, ranging from 30 to 120\u2009sec. The 60-sec compression injury in the sciatic nerve showed all the motor and sensory symptoms of a typical crushed nerve reported previously by many investigators.\n21\u201323\nThe crush-lesioned rats were randomly distributed among groups 2 and 3 to minimize group variations as much as possible.\n\nAssessment of functional recovery\nThe different animal groups were evaluated for walking-track analysis preoperatively and once a week after surgery. All the tests were repeated three times (with 30-min interval), and the average of the three readings was used for data analysis. Investigators were blinded to all treatments in all experiments. Several tests of reflexive sciatic nerve function (foot position, toe spread, extensor postural thrust [EPT], and hopping tests) were conducted as described in our previous studies.\n6\n,\n24\nBriefly, the time course of functional recovery was measured using EPT after crush injury and EGCG treatment. EPT was measured by calculating the functional deficit in this feature; thus, a higher value indicates a poor outcome. The hopping test was done to test several integrated functions. Each leg of the rat was suspended above a horizontal surface and was slowly moved laterally, with one foot touching the table surface. The rat was scored (1 or 0) based on whether it hopped on the foot or not.\n\nNeurobehavioral sensory tests were performed as follows\nTactile allodynia\nThe von Frey methodology was used to assess the sensitivity of the skin to tactile stimulation.\n24\n,\n25\nvon Frey filaments were calibrated to have a characteristic bending force when pressure is applied. Mechanical allodynia was tested in different animal groups by the application of von Frey filaments on different rat groups and then measuring the withdrawal reflex threshold (mean\u00b1standard error of the mean [SEM]).\nMechanical hyperalgesia\nNociceptive mechanical thresholds expressed in grams were measured with an analgesic meter (model 21025; UGO Basile, Monvalle Varese, Italy), which has been previously used to measure hyperalgesia.\n24\u201326\nBriefly, nociceptive mechanical threshold was assessed in the different animal groups by applying a steady pressure on the hindlimb and measuring the time needed for the rat to withdraw the limb. The mean of three consecutive values were measured, and the mean\u00b1SEM of the latency periods were calculated and plotted.\nHot-plate analgesia\nThermal nociception was measured by a modified hot-plate test. The rat was covered in a surgical towel and held in an upright position with one foot placed on a wooden board and the other on the hot plate (50\u00b0C; model 39D Hot Plate Analgesia Meter; Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). The withdrawal response latency was characterized as a brief paw flick recorded to the nearest 0.1 sec; a standard cut-off latency of 20\u2009sec was employed to prevent tissue damage.\n27\nResults are presented as mean and SEM. WRL is defined as the time elapsed from the onset of hot-plate contact to withdrawal of the hind paw and measured with a stopwatch. Normal rats withdraw their paws from the hot plate within 4\u2009sec or less. The affected limbs were tested three times, with an interval of 20\u2009min between consecutive tests to prevent for sensitization, and the three latencies were averaged to obtain a final result.\nTail flick\nThe spinally mediated nociceptive thresholds were determined using an analgesia meter apparatus (model 7360; UGO Basile). The animal was gently restrained by hand, and radiant heat (IR Intensity 20) was directed onto the proximal two-thirds part of its tail. The amount of time taken for the animal to move (flick) its tail away from the heat was recorded. The cut-off time was 20\u2009sec to prevent tissue damage.\n27\n\nTissue processing for immunostaining and Nissl staining\nBoth sham control and sciatic nerve-lesioned animals were deeply anesthetized with a mixture of Ketallar 62.5\u2009mg/kg and Rompun 3.2\u2009mg/kg injection (i.p.) and were perfused transcardially with 50\u2009mL of ice-cold saline, followed by 350\u2009mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffer (PB; 0.1\u2009M, pH 7.4). Spinal cords were removed carefully and post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C. Spinal cords were cryoprotected in 10%, 20%, and 30% sucrose solution in PB containing 0.06% sodium azide to prevent bacterial and fungal growth before sectioning. Cryostat sections of 30\u2009\u03bcm thick were cut transversely and collected serially in PB in a 24-well culture plate. These sections were used for Nissl staining (for cytoarchitecture of spinal cord), neuronal nuclear-specific protein (NeuN), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), Bax, and Bcl-2 immunostaining. Ventral gray and dorsal horn regions of spinal cord were studied. Number of neurons, immunoreactivity for astrocytes, GAP-43, Bax, and Bcl-2 in dorsal and ventral horn regions were quantified.\n\nNissl staining\nFor Nissl (cresyl violet) staining, every 15th cross section of the lumbar spinal cord (a total of 10 sections per spinal cord;\nn\n=6 in all groups) were processed. Sections were mounted on gelatinized slides and air-dried overnight. Sections were hydrated in graded alcohol and stained with 0.1% aqueous cresyl violet (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Stained sections were differentiated in 70% ethanol and dehydrated in graded alcohol, cleared in xylene, and cover-slipped with DPX.\n\nNeuronal nuclear-specific protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein, growth-associated protein 43, B-cell lymphoma 2, and B-cell lymphoma 2-associated X protein immunohistochemistry\nSections were processed for NueN, GFAP, GAP43, Bcl-2, and Bax immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, as described previously.\n28\u201330\nBriefly, every 15th transverse section of lumbar spinal cord (a total of 10 sections per spinal cord;\nn\n=6 in all groups) was selected for free floating immunostaining in a 24-well culture plate. In control spinal cord, regions of the spinal cord identical to that in the sciatic nerve-lesioned animal were selected for staining. Sections were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) and then treated with 3% H\n2\nO\n2\n(Fluka Chemika, Buchs, Switzerland) and 10% methanol, in PBS for 20\u2009min to quench the endogenous peroxidase activity. Sections were then washed three times (5\u2009min each) with PBS and incubated for 30\u2009min with appropriate blocking serum solution (5% normal horse serum [NHS]/normal goat serum [NGS] and 0.01% Triton X-100 in PBS) before applying the primary antibody (Ab). Sections were incubated overnight in primary Abs (mouse anti-NeuN, 1:1000; Millipore, Billerica, MA; rabbit anti-GFAP, 1:50; Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA; rabbit polyclonal anti-GAP-43, 1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA; rabbit polyclonal anti-Bax, 1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; and rabbit polyclonal anti-Bcl2, 1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Sections were washed in PBS and treated with biotinylated secondary Abs (horse antimouse IgG [1:200] or goat-anti-rabbit IgG [1:200]; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and 1% NHS or NGS for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Sections were then washed three times in PBS and treated with avidin biotin complex (Vector Laboratories) for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Sections were color developed with 3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) as a chromogen (DAB kit; Vector Laboratories). Finally, sections were washed in distilled water, dehydrated in graded ethanol, cleared in xylene, and mounted with DPX (Fluka Chemika). Sections were observed under a light microscope.\n\nNeuronal count\nNeuronal count in the dorsal horn and ventral horn regions of the spinal cord were done using the NIS-Elements D image analysis system. From each animal, every 15th section stained well with NeuN was selected for this analysis (a total of 10 sections per spinal cord;\nn\n=6 in all groups). The region of the spinal cord under analysis was focused at 40\u00d7 magnification, and an image was transferred to a computer monitor with a high-resolution digital Olympus camera (DP-72; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) attached to an Olympus microscope. The total number of neurons in the entire dorsal and ventral horn regions was counted. Slides were coded to avoid observer's bias. Mean number of neurons per section was calculated for statistical analysis.\n\nQuantitation of glial fibrillary acidic protein, growth-associated protein 43, B-cell lymphoma 2-associated X protein, and B-cell lymphoma 2 immunoreactivity\nThe areas occupied by GFAP and GAP-43 immunoreactive elements in the spinal cord were quantitatively determined by Scion Image for Windows, which is based on the National Institutes of Health ImageJ.\n28\nEvery 15th section from each animal was used for this quantification in all groups (a total of 10 sections per spinal cord;\nn\n=6 in all groups). The areas occupied by the GFAP-, GAP-43-, Bax-, and Bcl-2-positive immunoreactive structures per unit area of tissue were determined. Briefly, a digital microscopic image was taken from dorsal and ventral horn regions of the spinal cord (using a 40\u00d7 objective lens) in an Olympus microscope attached with a high-resolution digital Olympus camera (DP-72). Sections were well focused before taking the images. The same intensity of light in the microscope, magnification, and the same parameters in the digital camera were used to digitize all the images in grayscale from different animals. Images were saved as BMP files for subsequent measurements using Scion Image. Each image was taken with a scale bar on it for calibration purposes. The area occupied by the GFAP-positive structures in each image was measured by selecting the \u201cAnalyze Particles\u201d command of the Scion Image program. The summed area of all particles was stored for further calculations and statistical analyses.\n\nRNA extraction and reverse transcription\nTotal RNA was extracted from the lumbar region of the spinal cord tissue from the three animal groups (\nn\n=4) using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), according to the manufacturer's Instruction. RNA samples were subjected to DNase I digestion (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) to avoid DNA contamination. Reverse transcription (RT) was performed using the SuperScriptTM First Strand Synthesis System for RT polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR; Invitrogen). Complementary DNA was synthesized from 2\u2009\u03bcg of total RNA by extension with Oligo (dT)\n18\nin the presence of 200\u2009U of M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) for 1\u2009h at 55\u00b0C in a final volume of 20\u2009\u03bcL. RNA concentration was measured by reading the absorbance at 260\u2009nm, and the purity and integrity were verified by the 260/280-nm ratio >1.8 and by denaturing agarose gel.\n6\n,\n25\n\nReal-time polymerase chain reaction\nGene expression levels of Bax, Bcl-2, survivin, and p53 were measured by real-time PCR based on TaqMan technology using the ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), as described previously.\n6\n,\n25\nGene-specific assay sets (predesigned and validated primers and TaqMan probes) were purchased from Applied Biosystems. PCR amplification reactions were run in triplicates in a final volume of 20\u2009\u03bcL of TaqMan master mix. Real-time PCR conditions used were as follows: 2\u2009min at 50\u00b0C, 10\u2009min at 95\u00b0C for enzyme activation followed by 40 cycles of 15\u2009sec at 95\u00b0C for denaturation, and 1\u2009min at 60\u00b0C for annealing and extension. Relative gene expression was calculated by the comparative \u0394\u0394\nC\nT\nmethod.\n31\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data were analyzed by two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni's F- and Fisher's least significant difference post-hoc comparison test or Student's\nt\n-test, as appropriate, using the SPSS\n\u00ae\nstatistical program (v17; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). Results were considered significant when\np\n<0.05. All biochemical RT-PCR data were analyzed by one-way repeated-measures ANOVA followed by the Neuman-Keuls' test, using the SPSS statistical program (v17; SPSS, Inc.). Results were considered significant when\np\n<0.05. Data are represented as mean\u00b1SEM. Graphs were generated in Microsoft\n\u00ae\nExcel and Publisher (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA)."

(\nC\n)\nTsc2\n+/KO\nmCHI mice (\nn\n=10) needed three trials (F\n(2,18)\n=6.139,\np\n=0.009, two-way repeated measures ANOVA) to distinguish between the shock and safe cages.

A midline incision was made to expose the skull, and anesthesia was discontinued for the remainder of the surgical manipulations. Immediately after discontinuation, mice were placed on a foam pad that kept their head level with the body. A pneumatically driven controlled CTX impact (CCI) device with a metal impactor tip (5\u2009mm diameter) was used to deliver a single impact to the skull midway between lambda and bregma over the sagittal suture. The impactor was driven at 4\u2009m/sec to a depth of 1\u2009mm below the plane of the skull. Immediately after impact, the length of apnea was monitored. When spontaneous breathing returned to normal, the scalp was closed with sterile surgical staples. Sham animals received the same surgical treatment but did not receive an impact.\n\nWestern blots\nMice underwent the mCHI or sham surgery and their brains were dissected at 30\u2009min post-injury. The brains were submerged in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing phosphatase inhibitors (2\u2009mM NaF, 2\u2009mM Na\n2\nMoO\n4\n, and 1\u2009mM Na\n3\nVO\n4\n), and HIPP and CTX tissues were quickly dissected and snap frozen on dry ice. To prepare total protein extracts, tissues were thawed and disrupted in homogenization buffer (10\u2009mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1\u2009mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, 1\u2009mM ethylenediaminetetraaceticacid, 0.5 dithiothreitol, 0.1\u2009\u03bcM okadaic acid and 1\u2009mM Na\n3\nVO\n4\n, 1\u2009mM phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride, and 10\u2009\u03bcg/mL leupeptin). An equal volume of 2X Laemmli buffer was added, and the protein concentration was determined by NanoOrange Protein Quantification Assay (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard.\nSamples were resolved on Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gels, and the proteins transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked for 30\u2009min in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 5% BSA. Blots were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C in TBS/BSA, washed, and incubated for 1\u2009h at room temperature with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame CA). Immunoreactivity was detected using the CDP-Star chemiluminescence system (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and the blots exposed to Kodak XAR5 film (Rochester, NY). The detected immunoreactive band intensities were normalized against the signal obtained for \u03b2-actin using\nImageJ\n(National Institutes of Health). Western blot data were compiled from at least five independent animals.\n\nAssessment of acute neurological functions\nPost-injury apnea, the duration of suppression of tail pinch, and righting response were monitored to assess injury severity across groups. After anesthesia was discontinued, the animal was quickly positioned underneath the impactor and the mCHI was delivered. A timer was started on impact, and the time to recovery of spontaneous breathing was recorded by an independent observer. Immediately after breathing resumed, the scalp was closed with sterile surgical staples and a topical ointment (Tritop, which contains neomycin sulfate, isoflupredone acetate, and tetracaine hydrochloride) was applied while the observer monitored recovery of the tail pinch response by applying firm pressure to the distal tip of the tail at regular intervals. Concurrently, the righting response was monitored by placing the animal on its back and recording the time needed to right itself on three consecutive trials.\n\nBeam balance task\nTo assess vestibulomotor and motor functions of mCHI\nTsc2\n+/KO\nheterozygous and\nTsc2\n+/+\nwild-type mice, the beam balance task was used.\n21\n,\n22\nOn the day after injury, animals were placed at the farthest end of a metal beam (0.5\u2009cm wide), and the time animals remained on the beam was recorded. A foam pad was placed beneath the animals to prevent injury if they fell. Animals were given three trials of 1\u2009min each on the beam, and the trials were averaged to give a group mean for each day.\n\nFoot fault task\nVestibulomotor function of\nTsc2\n+/KO\nand WT injured mice was tested using the foot fault task.\n21\n,\n22\nFor this task, a mouse was placed on a wire grid with an opening size 1\u00d71\u2009cm and allowed to walk freely until the experimenter counted 50 steps. Foot faults were recorded when either of the front paws passed below the plane of observation through a gap in the grid. Each animal was given three trials per day, and the results averaged to give a group mean, until all groups performed as well as sham controls.\n\nAbbreviated water maze\nSpatial learning and memory were assessed using a 1-d abbreviated version of the hidden platform water maze task as described previously.\n23\n,\n24\nOn day 7 post-injury, mice were given 10 consecutive training trials with an intertrial interval of 4\u2009min. Animals were allowed to search for a hidden escape platform for a period of 60\u2009sec, and the time to find the hidden platform was recorded. Forty-eight hours later, animals were tested in a probe trial in which the escape platform was removed from the tank, and the mice were allowed to search for a period of 60\u2009sec. Movement within the water maze was monitored using a video camera linked to tracking software (Ethovision, Noldus Information Technology, Leesburg, VA).\n\nContext discrimination\nFear context discrimination was performed on days 14\u201316 post-injury by pre-exposing animals for 10\u2009min to two similar, but not identical, contexts without shock. These contexts shared certain features (e.g., background noise, horizontal grid floor) but differed in others (differently spaced grids, distal cues, floor color, shape, and scent). Animals were given two trials a day, one in each of the two chambers. Half of the animals from each group were trained in the morning in the shock chamber where they stayed for a total of 3\u2009min, with a 2\u2009sec, 0.75 mA shock given at 178\u2009sec. In the afternoon, they were placed in the safe chamber for a total of 3\u2009min, and no shock was given. The other half of each group received the same treatment with reversed order and thus experienced a foot shock in the shock chamber in the afternoon.\nOn the following 2 days, an animal's ability to discriminate between the two contexts was assessed by monitoring freezing behavior in 2\u2009sec intervals for 178\u2009sec in each chamber, with the same presentation order. The animals received a shock during the last 2\u2009sec in the shock chamber, and no shock in the safe chamber. Percent freezing in each chamber was calculated and analyzed to determine if animals were able to discriminate between the shock and no-shock (or safe) contexts.\n25\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nAt the conclusion of behavior testing, mice were killed with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital followed by transcardial perfusion with ice-cold phosphate-buffered-saline (PBS) followed by buffered 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed and stored in buffered 4% paraformaldehyde for an additional 24\u2009h. Brains were then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose and 40\u2009\u03bcm sections cut on a cryostat in the coronal plane. Sections were incubated in primary antibody solutions (0.1\u20130.5\u2009\u03bcg/mL antibody, 2.5% normal goat serum in PBS) overnight at room temperature. After extensive washing, sections were incubated for 1\u2009h in PBS containing species-specific secondary antibodies linked to AlexaFluor dyes (Alexa-488 or Alexa-568; Invitrogen). Sections were mounted onto glass slides and coverslipped with Fluoromount-G to inhibit fading. Slides were examined using an upright microscope with epifluorescence capabilities, and images were captured with a MagnaFire camera using settings that remained constant across groups.\n\nStatistics\nIn all experiments, data collected from the same animal with one or more factors were subjected to repeated measures (RM) analysis of variance (ANOVA). Data comparing only one factor between groups, such as probe trial data analysis and western blot data, were subjected to a two-tailed Student's\nt\n-test for unpaired (behavioral data) or paired variables (western blot data and contextual discrimination data). Data comparing more than two groups were subjected to one-way ANOVA. Data were considered significant at\np\n<0.05."

    "Methods": "The present study was conducted in three stages: 1) calibration of thein vitroexperimental setting; 2) calculation of the truein vitroconcentrations of Na+, K+, and Cl\u2212by using the conventional method of calculating the RR and by applying a linear regression model; and 3) study of the feasibility of the methodology in 2 patients in whom the probe was placed in different areas of the brain (injured/core, penumbra, or macroscopically normal brain).\n\nCalibration of the\nin vitro\nexperimental setting\nThe microdialysis probe\nIn the\nin vitro\nexperiments, 9 sterile CMA-71 probes with a 10-mm dialyzing membrane were used (manufacturer reference #8010320; M Dialysis AB, Solna, Sweden). These probes are approved for clinical use in Europe (CE marking approval according to the Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC). To avoid systematic errors in the manufacturing process, we used catheters from 4 different lots. According to the manufacturer's specifications, this probe has a nominal cutoff of \u201caround 100\u2009kDa.\u201d\n22\nThe 60-mm shaft is made of polyurethane and has an outer diameter of 0.9\u2009mm. The dialyzing membrane is 10\u2009mm long, has an outer diameter of 0.6\u2009mm, and is made from polyarylethersulphone. The inlet and outlet tubes are also made from polyurethane and have a 1-mm outer diameter. The catheter contains a gold tip, making it visible on a computed tomography (CT) scan and thus allowing for the determination of the exact position of the probe.\nThe infusion pump and the perfusate\nThe\nin vitro\nexperiments were conducted with a compact, flexible, dual-syringe pump designed for low pulse-free flow rates and suitable for MD (CMA-402\u2009pump; CMA Microdialysis AB, Kista, Sweden). The pump allows for each of the two syringes to be controlled independently and is precalibrated for 1-, 2.5-, and 5-mL syringes and for flow rates between 0.1 and 20\u2009\u03bcL/min. The experiments for this study were conducted with a 1-mL syringe connected to the catheter. For all of the experiments, the flow rate was set to infuse commercially available isotonic sterile perfusate that is specially developed for brain MD (perfusion fluid CNS, ref. no.: P000151; M Dialysis AB) at a constant rate of 0.3\u2009\u03bcL/min. This artificial solution has a composition similar to human brain interstitial fluid, an osmolality of 305\u2009mOsm/kg, and the following composition: NaCl 147\u2009mmol/L; KCl 2.7\u2009mmol/L; CaCl\n2\n1.2\u2009mmol/L; and MgCl\n2\n0.85\u2009mmol/L. The total Cl\n\u2212\ncontent for this solution is 153.8\u2009mmol/L. To facilitate the\nin vitro\ncalibration of the high cut-off membranes, 3% albumin (3\u2009g/dL) was added to the perfusate. The addition of 3% albumin to the perfusate provokes minor changes in the final concentration of ions. The new obtained concentrations were: NaCl 143.5\u2009mmol/L; KCl 2.6\u2009mmol/L; CaCl\n2\n1.02\u2009mmol/L; MgCl\n2\n0.72\u2009mmol/L; and 144.9\u2009mmol/L as a total content of Cl\n\u2212\n.\nExperimental design and calibration of the system to zero fluid loss\nThe objective of the laboratory setting was to design an\nin vitro\nsystem that simulates the conditions found\nin vivo\nwhen CMA-71 probes are implanted. The glass tubes\u2014without additives\u2014containing the test solution (BD Vacutainer\n\u00ae\n; Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were placed on a dry bath (Labnet International, Edison, NJ), and the relative vertical positions of the pump, the tip of the probe inside the tube, and the top of the microvial were controlled, as was the temperature. Controlling the difference in height between the different components of the pump and the probe is crucial for controlling the small changes in hydrostatic pressures inside and outside the probe that can significantly affect fluid recovery. The CMA-71 catheter tip was placed inside the solution through a channel made by a 14G safety IV catheter (Introcan Safety\n\u00ae\n14G, 2.2\u00d750\u2009mm; B. Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany) inserted into the center of the rubber closure to establish a channel to introduce the MD probe and prevent fluid evaporation and bacterial contamination (\nFig. 1\n). The other end of the catheter was connected to the CMA-402 pump that infused the perfusion fluid at 0.3\u2009\u03bcL/min.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nDiagram of the general setup for the\nin vitro\nexperiments. For the sake of clarity, sizes have been altered and are not proportional to the reality. 1) Dry or wet bath, where the tube containing the matrix is placed to control the temperature of the experiment constant. For this particular experiment, a dry bath without agitation was used. 2) CMA 402 dual-syringe pump designed for low pulse-free flow rates. 3) Syringe. 4) Inlet tubing of the CMA-71 probe. 5) 14G safety IV catheter. 6) Matrix solution (for exact composition, see the text). 7) Outlet tubing of the CMA-71 probe. 8) Microvial. H1. Height from the surface of the solution to the mid-point of the dialyzing membrane (10\u2009mm in length); H2. Height from the mid-point of the MD membrane to the top of the microvial. In the real setup and for this particular experiment, the syringe (3) and the microvial tip (8) were in line with the mid-point of the 10-mm MD membrane and therefore H2 was equal to 0\u2009mm.\nIn each experiment, the first step was to equilibrate the inflow and outflow volumes to make certain that no fluid was lost into the matrix (i.e., to obtain 100% volume recovery) and, consequently, to verify that both hydrostatic and osmotic pressures across the membrane were in equilibrium. To do so, the same isotonic perfusion fluid CNS was used both in the perfusate and in the matrix. In our experiments, the osmotic pressure was equal on both sides of the membrane; thus, according to the Starling equation, the probe's internal hydrostatic pressure and matrix hydrostatic pressure were considered to be in equilibrium when there was no net fluid movement across the dialyzing membrane, and fluid recovery was thus close to 100% (18\u2009\u03bcL/h). The hydrostatic pressure inside the probe at the level of the tip is the pressure that the pump generates in the circuit\u2014this was determined to be approximately 1\u2009mm Hg\u2014plus the hydrostatic difference between the pump and the tip of the MD probe (in most experiments, this was set at 0\u2009mmH\n2\n0). The hydrostatic pressure inside the probe at the level of the tip depends on the pressure that the pump generates in the circuit. This was determined in an\nin vitro\nexperiment in which the pump was connected to a CMA71 probe through a three-way stopcock, and the circuit pressure was continuously monitored for 24\u2009h with a minute-by-minute recording\u2014by a computer and LabChart Software\u2014through the lateral channel by using a conventional solid-state Camino probe. For 1444 readings, the mean circuit pressure was 0.98\u00b10.53\u2009mm Hg. Therefore, for\nin vitro\ncalculations, we assumed a 1-mm Hg hydrostatic pressure equivalent to 13.6\u2009mmH\n2\nO. The hydrostatic pressure that the matrix exerts on the external side of the MD membrane depends on the fluid density, the gravitational constant, and the vertical height of the matrix column. After various adjustments in the experimental design, it was observed that when the mid-point of the 10-mm membrane was placed 13.6\u2009mm under the matrix surface (H1), a steady state was easily achieved. Thus, the CMA-71 probe was introduced vertically into the tube containing the matrix, with the tip of the dyalizing 18.6\u2009mm below the surface of the solution (\nFig. 1\n). The top of the microvial was aligned with the mid-point of the membrane (H2=0\u2009mm). This setup allowed us to recover approximately 100% (18\u2009\u03bcL/h) of the volume, without the need to add any colloid to the perfusate when the matrix and the perfusion fluid were isotonic and did not contain any macromolecules. However, because we used different ionic concentrations in our experiments, it was easier to increase the osmotic pressure by adding albumin to the perfusate to facilitate steady fluid recovery. Different albumin concentrations (2.0\u20133.5%) were tested, and fluid recoveries close to the expected volumes were achieved when 3% albumin was added.\n\nIn vitro\ndetermination of relative recovery for the ions of interest\nA total of 9 different catheters were used in these experiments. In seven catheters, the experiments were conducted at room temperature (22\u201323\n\u00b0\nC) and in 2 probes at 37\n\u00b0\nC. For the sake of simplicity and because the obtained data were not significantly different at both temperatures, most experiments were conducted at room temperature. Different matrix solutions with different ionic concentrations were prepared under sterile conditions and sampled by each catheter. Study matrices were prepared with 1) Milli-Q water, 2) different amount of sodium chloride and potassium chloride salts (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), and 3) a constant concentration of 200\u2009mg/L of serum human albumin (Grifols, Barcelona, Spain). This external concentration of albumin was chosen because it is within the reference range for normal human CSF.\n23\n,\n24\nThe whole preparation process of the matrices was carried out inside a laminar flow hood to avoid bacterial contamination. The range of ionic concentrations for the different matrices are summarized in\nTable 1\n.\nTable\n1.\nIonic Concentration of MD Perfusates, Reference Range for CSF Ionic Concentrations and Range of\nIn Vitro\nTested Concentrations\nIonic concentration of MD perfusates\nCNS perfusion fluid\nCNS perfusion fluid+3% albumin\nRinger\na\nRinger lactated\nb\nNormal saline\nControl group (lower-upper)\nIn vitro\ntested concentrations\nNa\n+\n(mmol/L)\n147\n143.5\n145.3\n130\n154\n130\u2013164\n115\u2013195\nK\n+\n(mmol/L)\n2.7\n2.6\n5.4\n5.4\n\u2014\n2.8\u20133.6\n2.0\u20137.5\nCl\n\u2212\n(mmol/L)\n153.8\n144.9\n155.3\n111.8\n145\n115\u2013144\n120\u2013192\nCa\n2+\n(mmol/L)\n1.2\n1.02\n4.6\n2.7\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\nMg\n2+\n(mmol/L)\n0.85\n0.72\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\nOsmolarity (mOsm/L)\n305\n286\n308.6\n273\n308\n\u2014\n\u2014\nOpen in a separate window\nLower-upper indicates lower upper thresholds calculated by the robust method described in the National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) and Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines C28-A2 and C28-A3 (\nn\n=22).\na\nComposition from Fresenius Kabi (Bad Homburg, Germany).\nb\nComposition from B. Braun Melsungen AG (Melsungen, Germany).\nMD, microdialysis; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid.\nThe matrices were placed in 5-mL tubes (BD Vacutainer; Becton Dickinson), and the CMA-71 probes were inserted as shown in\nFigure 1\n. Minor adjustments to H2 were made before each experiment to correct for small differences in hydrostatic pressures and obtain a zero-fluid loss and a fluid recovery close to the expected theoretical volume (18\u2009\u03bcL/h). In each experiment, the dialysate of the first hour was always discarded. Once a steady state was achieved, each catheter was perfused for a median of 5 days (120\u2009h; min-max, 48\u2013180\u2009h). The microvials were changed every 12\u2009h, and both the container and the matrix were replaced every 24\u2009h to avoid volume loss by evaporation and the consequent variations in hydrostatic pressure and ionic concentration. Every time the microvials were replaced, a small volume of the matrix was sampled to verify that no significant changes had occurred in the solution as a result of evaporation or other uncontrolled factors. The microvials were stored at 4\u00b0C in the same conditions as the matrix solution until analysis.\nFor ion determination, dialysates and matrix samples were analyzed by the AU5400\u2122 analyzer (Diagnostic Systems Group, Melville, NY). This system uses selective ion electrodes with the following detection ranges: 10\u2013400\u2009mmol/L for Na\n+\n; 2\u2013200\u2009mmol/L for K\n+\n; and 15\u2013400\u2009mmol/L for Cl\n\u2212\n. The coefficient of variation for the analyzer in the study period was approximately 1% for all the three ions (0.7% for Na\n+\n, 1.1% for K\n+\n, and 0.9% for Cl\n\u2212\n).\nTo calculate the true concentration in the matrix, two mathematical models were used: 1) the calculation of RR to correct the concentration obtained in the dialysate. RR was calculated by the equation proposed by Bungay and colleagues\n18\u201320\nfor the situation when the perfusate contains the solute of interest: RR=(C\nmd\n\u2013 C\nin\n/C\nmatrix\n\u2013 C\nin\n)\u00d7100, where C\nmd\n, C\nin\n, and C\nmatrix\nare the analyte concentrations in the microdialysate, inflow perfusate, and the matrix, respectively, and 2) a simple linear regression and the ordinary least squares (OLS) method in which the independent or predictor variable was C\nmd\nand the outcome (dependent variable) was C\nmatrix.\nThe only previous assumption was that both variables were linearly correlated and therefore C\nmd\ncould be used as a reliable estimator of the true ionic concentration in the medium (C\nmatrix\n).\n\nFeasibility study\nA prospective study was conducted in 2 patients, one with an severe TBI and the second with a malignant stroke who received ICP and MD monitoring (PR-ATR-286/2013). In summary, brain MD catheters are usually inserted into noninjured brain tissue and/or in regions of interest according to a previously described methodology.\n25\nA CMA-71 brain microdialysis catheter with a 100-kDa cut-off membrane (M Dialysis AB) was used in the 2 patients included in this study, and the position of the probe was confirmed by a control CT scan. Cerebral catheters were perfused with same sterile isotonic CNS fluid at a fixed flow rate of 0.3\u2009\u03bcL/min using a CMA-106 pump (M Dialysis AB). The dialysates were collected hourly by the nurse in charge of the patient, using capped microvials\u2014specially designed to collect microvolumetric samples and minimize evaporation\u2014and lactate, pyruvate, glucose, glycerol, and glutamate levels were routinely monitored at the bedside using an Iscus Flex analyzer (M Dialysis AB). After the hourly measurements were completed, the microvials were placed in a rack designed to seal the microvials and prevent evaporation (M Dialysis AB). All racks were stored at \u221286\u00b0C until analysis. In an experimental study we conducted previously, it was established that under these storage conditions, evaporation does not occur and therefore the ionic concentration for Na\n+\n, K\n+\n, and Cl\n\u2212\ndoes not change significantly for at least 36 months of storage (unpublished results). Data from the first two microvials were always excluded.\nFor ion determination, dialysates were analyzed with the same AU5400 analyzer used in the\nin vitro\nstudy. The microvials corresponding to the first 24\u2009h were defrosted on ice. When the Iscus Flex analyzer analyzes metabolites, a volume of 8\u2009\u03bcL is used and therefore it is necessary to pool the content of 12 microvials in order to obtain the minimum volume of 85\u2009\u03bcL needed to perform the analysis in the AU5400 analyzer. Therefore, two samples for each patient are usually obtained for a 24-h period.\n\nReference range\nFor the best approximation to the reference range for extracelullar ionic concentration, we used the CSF concentrations measured with the same analyzer in a cohort of 22 normal volunteers having no neurological or psychiatric history. These also had normal neurological examination results and Mini\u2013Mental State Examination scores of >25. CSF was obtained during spinal anesthesia for urological, general, or vascular surgery after informed consent was obtained from all patients and approval was given by the ethical committee of our center (PRAG-75/2005).\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics were obtained for each variable. For continuous variables, the summary statistics used were the mean, median, range, and the standard deviation. Percentages and sample sizes were used to summarize categorical variables. The Shapiro-Wilk's test and inverse probability plot were used to test whether the data followed a normal distribution. To correlate two continuous variables, the most conservative Kendall's tau (when data did not follow a normal distribution) or Pearson's correlation test (for data following a normal distribution) was used. For each ion, scatter plots were built, with [Na\n+\n]\nmd\n, [K\n+\n]\nmd\n, and [Cl\n\u2212\n]\nmd\nin the dialysate as the predictor variables and the true matrix concentrations as the outcome variables. A simple linear regression and the OLS method were used. Adjusted R\n2\nvalues were calculated for all models to test whether linear or nonlinear models adequately explained the relationships between both variables. Statistical analyses were carried out with R software (version 3.0.2; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)\n26\nand the integrated development environment RStudio (v0.98.501; RStudio, Boston, MA).\n27\nThe car package was used for regression analysis.\n28\nTo calculate the reference interval and the upper and lower thresholds for the ions, we used the distribution-free \u201crobust method\u201d described in the National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) and Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines C28-A2 and C28-A3 for estimating percentiles and their 90% confidence intervals (CIs).\n29\u201331\nTo calculate reference intervals with this method, we used the routine implemented in MedCalc (version 12.2; MedCalc Software, Mariakerke, Belgium)."

    "Methods": "Patient population\nThe study population consisted of patients included in the\nT\nransforming\nR\nesearch\na\nnd\nC\nlinical\nK\nnowledge in TBI (TRACK-TBI) Pilot study.\n11\nIn this study TBI patients age >16 years were enrolled upon arrival in the emergency departments (EDs) at San Francisco General Hospital (University of California San Francisco; UCSF), University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and University Medical Center Brackenridge. All participants or their legally authorized representatives gave written informed consent. At follow-up outcome assessments, participants previously consented by legally authorized representative, if neurologically improved and capable, were consented for continuation in the study.\nInclusion criteria were presentation to study hospital within 24\u2009h of injury and history of trauma to the head sufficient to triage to noncontrast head computed tomography (CT) using the American College of Emergency Physicians/Centers for Disease Control evidence-based joint practice guidelines.\n12\nWe selected patients with mTBI and available 3- or 6-month outcome. All study protocols were approved by the institutional review boards at each participating level 1 trauma center.\n\nMeasures\nDetails on loss of consciousness, amnesia, and source of trauma were recorded upon admission and informed consent was obtained. GCS score was assessed by a neurosurgeon at admission.\n13\nTrained study personnel in the ED obtained demographic data, patient history, and clinical information from the patient. All patients underwent CT imaging at the time of initial presentation to the ED. Each patient's head CT was characterized using the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke TBI Common Data Elements (TBI-CDEs).\n14\u201316\nClinical brain CTs were transmitted to a radiology picture-archiving and communications system with software that allow controlled remote access for multiple users at study sites. To comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the UCSF Quantitative Image Processing Center built a multiplatform tool that completely anonymized CT studies during the transmission process. Each CT was then reviewed by a single board-certified neuroradiologist blinded to demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical data, except gender and age, and scored on 26 of the 93 CDEs developed by the TBI-CDE neuroimaging working group.\n17\n,\n18\n\nOutcome\nThe outcomes for this study were the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOS-E) at 3 and 6 months after injury.\n19\nThe GOS-E provides eight categories of outcome: dead; vegetative state; lower severe disability; upper severe disability; lower moderate disability; upper moderate disability; lower good recovery; and upper good recovery. Ratings are based on patient consciousness, independence, ability to work, social and leisure activities, social relationships, and other sequelae of TBI. Upper good recovery (GOS-E score of 8) indicates return to preinjury baseline with no residual effects of the TBI.\n\nPrediction models\nOur literature search identified three prediction models that were developed (partly) on mTBI patients.\n7\u20139\nWe could not validate the Stuhlemeijer and colleagues model because not all of the former's predictors were available in our data set.\n7\nWe thus undertook to validate the Nijmegen and CRASH models.\n9\nThe characteristics of the model are described in\nTable 1\n.\nTable\n1.\nCharacteristics of the Validated Models\nModel\nDevelopment population (\nn\n)\nPredictors\nOutcome\nNijmegen\nGCS 13\u201315 (\nn\n=1069)\n6-month GOS-E<7\nClinical model\n-Age\n-AIS head\n-ISS without head\n-Alcohol intoxication\nCT model\n-Number of hemorrhagic contusions\n-Facial fractures\nCombined model\n-Age\n-ISS without head\n-Number of hemorrhagic contusions\n-Alcohol intoxication\nCRASH\nGCS 3\u201314 (\nn\n=10,008)\n6-month GOS<4\nBasic model\n-Age\n-GCS\n-Pupillary reactivity\n-Extracranial injury\nCT model\nBasic model plus\n-Petechial hemorrhage\n-Obliteration of third ventricle and cisterns\n-Subarachnoid hemorrhage\n-Mid-line shift\n-Nonevacuated hematoma\nOpen in a separate window\nCT, computed tomography; CRASH, Corticosteroid Randomization After Significant Head Injury; GCS, Glasgow Coma Scale; AIS, Abbreviated Injury Score; ISS, Injury Severity Score; GOS-E, Glasgow Outcome Score Extended.\nThe Nijmegen model was built specifically for mTBI, with 6-month GOS-E<7 as the endpoint. Multivariable analysis of 1069 patients with GOS-E yielded age, Abbreviated Injury Score for head (AISh), Injury Severity Score (ISS) without head, and alcohol intoxication as significant predictors in the clinical model and number of hemorrhagic contusions and facial fractures as predictors of unfavorable outcome in the CT model and age, ISS without head, number of hemorrhagic contusions, and alcohol intoxication in the combined model.\n8\nThe Medical Research Council CRASH trial built and externally validated two prognostic models in mild, moderate, and severe TBI.\n9\nA basic model included age, GCS, pupillary reactivity, and presence of extracranial injury. In a CT model, additionally included were petechial hemorrhage, obliteration of third ventricle and cisterns, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), mid-line shift, and nonevacuated hematoma emerged as predictors for mortality at 14 days and unfavorable outcome on the GOS (<4) at 6 months postinjury.\n9\nIn this study, we only validated the models for 6-month unfavorable outcome. We note that the CRASH model excluded patients with GCS 15, a score that represents a majority of this subpopulation.\n\nStatistical analysis\nIf patients had a missing outcome at 6 months, but an observed outcome at 3 months, the 3-month value was extrapolated to 6 months. Similarly, 6-month outcomes were interpolated when 3-month outcome was missing. Patients with missing outcome at both time points were excluded. Missing values in predictors were statistically imputed using single imputation with the AregImpute function in R statistical software (version 2.14; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).\nPatients' baseline characteristics were described by median and interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. These descriptive statistics were reported on the nonimputed data.\nThe prediction models were applied to the patients in the validation set, that is, a predicted probability of unfavorable outcome was calculated for each patient using the CRASH and Nijmegen models. Accordingly, the external validity of the models was assessed by studying calibration and discrimination. Calibration refers to the agreement between observed and predicted outcomes. The extent of over- or underestimation, relative to the observed and predicted rate, was explored graphically using validation plots.\n20\nWe assessed calibration-in-the-large by fitting a logistic regression model with the logit of model predictions as an offset variable. The intercept indicates whether predictions are systematically too low or high and should ideally be zero. The calibration slope reflects the average effects of the predictors in the model and was estimated in a logistic regression model with the logit of the model predictions as the only predictor. For a perfect model, the slope is equal to 1. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used to quantify the ability of the model to discriminate between patients who died versus survived. Because the development of the CRASH model did not include patients with GCS 15, we validated it both on patients with GCS 13\u201314 and on our total study population.\nTo further explore relevant predictors of 3- and 6-month GOS-E, we selected 21 possible predictors from the literature and based on clinical knowledge. These were analyzed in univariate and multi-variable proportional odds regression models with 3- and 6-month GOS-E as ordinal outcomes. This means that the full range of the GOS-E is considered instead of dichotomizing at a fixed point (e.g., favorable vs. unfavorable outcome). Simulation studies have shown that ordinal analysis is more efficient than dichotomization, also when the proportional odds assumption is violated. Each predictor was tested in the univariate models, and those with a\np\nvalue of 0.30 in both the 3- and 6-month model were selected for inclusion in the multi-variable models. The liberal\np\nvalue was motivated by the fact that we performed an exploratory analysis in a relatively small sample size and did not want to exclude possible predictors.\nAll analyses were performed with R statistical software (version 2.14; R Foundation for Statistical Computing)."

Last mTBI refers to the number of months since previous concussion.\n\nStudy design\nWe targeted rugby because the nature of the sport exposes players to numerous subconcussive impacts.\n22\nInitially, quantification of subconcussive impacts was planned to be performed, yet a number of limitations made it not plausible. Rugby matches were recorded but due to limited resources and limited access to high speed cameras positioned in different angles, the standard one position video camera failed to accurately quantify the number of subconcussive impacts. Additionally, because rugby players do not wear protective equipment, including helmets,\n23\nincorporation of commercially-available tools like the Head Impact Telemetry (HIT) system could not be employed.\nCompounding the difficulty to quantify the number of subconcussive impacts in rugby are certain prominent elements of the game including the tackle and scrum.\n23\nThese events often results in a massive pileup of players and jeopardizes the accuracy of quantifying the number of subconcussive hits as players under the pile can experience anything from kicks, elbows, or any other type of blow to the head they may not be visible. To compensate for this shortcoming, an observational study of the matches was completed in order to see if the number of impacts were similar to those reported in the literature. Results from the observational study put the number of impacts at between 30 and 45 and were in agreement with those reported by in a study of 77 professional league rugby matches over the course of three seasons.\n24\nThe study was broken into two testing sessions, an initial baseline pre-game session and then a follow-up post-game session that included the acquisition of rs-fMRI. By eliminating the task, rs-fMRI excludes bias based upon performance.\n25\nPre-game scanning was performed 24\u2009h prior to a scheduled full contact game, while the post-game session was performed within 24\u2009h of the end of that game following a night's sleep. No sports-related subconcussive impacts were sustained between pre-game scanning and the actual game, as no contact practices were scheduled in the interim. Pre-game and post-game scanning was performed at the same time of the day to reduce any influence that may have been caused by circadian rhythms. No participants reported concussive symptoms at either session and additionally no players under study were diagnosed with a concussion on the field under supervision of certified athletic trainers as a part of the routine protocol of the Sport Concussion Program at the Pennsylvania State University.\n\nMRI Set-up and Acquisition\nFunctional and anatomical images were acquired on a 3.0 Tesla Siemens Trio whole-body scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using a 12-channel head coil. Subjects were asked to lay quietly with their eyes open and not fall asleep while in the scanner. Two-dimensional BOLD echo planar rs-fMRI sequence were acquired in the axial plane parallel to the anterior and posterior commissure axis covering the entire brain (3.0\u00d73.0\u00d73.0\u2009mm resolution, TR=2490\u2009ms, TE=24\u2009ms, iPAT=none, EPI factor=74, echo spacing=0.48\u2009ms, NSA=1, acquisition time=5:04). Three-dimensional isotropic T1 weighted magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo anatomical images were acquired in the sagittal plane parallel with the longitudinal fissure covering the entire brain (1\u2009mm\u00d71\u2009mm\u00d71\u2009mm resolution, TE=3.46\u2009ms, TR=2300\u2009ms, TI=900\u2009ms, flip angle=9\u00b0, 160 slices, iPAT=none, NSA=1).\n\nData analysis\nWe employed the commonly accepted and widely reported seed-based correlation analysis technique based upon our a priori hypothesis that subconcussive impacts will alter the areas of the brain that make up the DMN.\n18\n,\n19\n,\n20\n,\n32\n,\n34\nStatistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) version 8 (\nwww.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8\n), in conjunction with Functional Connectivity (CONN) toolbox (\nweb.mit.edu/swg/software.htm\n) software were used for data analysis. Images were first pre-processed, which included realignment, co-registration, segmentation, normalization, and smoothing. During pre-processing, images were motion-corrected, registered with structural images, and normalized to the standard brain template from the Montreal Neurological Institute. After pre-processing, images were then band-pass filtered to 0.01\u2009Hz-0.09\u2009Hz and motion regressed to reduce the influence of noise.\nWhite matter, cerebrospinal fluid, and physiological noise source reduction were taken as confounds, following the implemented CompCor strategy.\n26\nHead motion was taken into account and rotational and translational motion parameters and their first-order temporal derivatives were regressed out. Further, whole-brain BOLD signal was excluded as a regressor to eliminate erroneous anti-correlations.\n27\nThe CONN toolbox performs seed-based correlation analysis based on the temporal low-frequency fluctuations of BOLD signals. Specifically, region of interest (ROI) analysis was performed by grouping voxels into ROIs based upon Brodmann areas. All Brodmann areas were imported as possible connections for our selected seed ROIs. The BOLD signal time series was averaged from all voxels compromising each ROI. Bi-variate correlations were calculated between each pair of ROIs as reflections of connections. Fisher transformed Z-scores were introduced to validate multiple comparisons and SPM functions were called by the CONN toolbox for spatial statistical tests. ROI-based analyses were performed for all subjects' data with a general linear model (GLM) test to determine significant resting-state connections at the individual level (1st level). Based upon first level results correlation coefficients were converted into standard scores, and an unpaired\nt\n-test was used with a threshold set at\np\n<0.01 uncorrected to determine significant connections.\nFunctional connectivity is broadly defined as the temporal correlation of the BOLD signal between two distinct anatomical regions.\n28\nHere, increases in connectivity indicate positive correlations between ROIs that are associated with increases in BOLD signal time series synchronization and reflected by higher Z-scores. Whereas decreased connectivity indicates negative correlations and decreased synchronicity between ROIs and reduction in Z-scores. ROIs were selected based upon the commonly reported and studied ROIs of the DMN and included dorsal frontal cortex, anterior prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, ventral posterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, angular gyrus, retrosplenial cortex, and supramarginal gyrus.\n18\n,\n20\n,\n29"

    "Methods": "We conducted a retrospective study including patients with TBI treated in the ICU of a large urban Level 1 trauma center (T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6 Hospital, Helsinki University Hospital; catchment area population approximately two million inhabitants) during a four-year period (January 2009 to December 2012) who had BAC measured on admission. Definition of TBI was a S06.1-S06.9International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revisiondiagnosis, caused by an external force.15Patients with a history of head trauma but no intra-cranial pathological findings (by CT imaging) during the hospital stay and those with subacute head injuries (>24\u2009h) were not considered. Penetrating head injuries and patients younger than 14 years were excluded.\n\nPatient admission characteristics were assessed by an emergency department physician (neurosurgeon, anesthesiologist, or trauma surgeon) and extracted from subsequent electronic records. Admission BAC was measured by venous blood sampling, and categorized to: no BAC (0.0\u2030), low BAC (<2.3\u2030), and high BAC (\u22652.3\u2030).8,16\n\nPrimary outcome was six-month mortality, which was retrieved from the Finnish population center (available for all patients). A secondary outcome was six-month neurological outcome (by Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS]), which was dichotomized to favorable outcome (GOS: 4 [moderate disability], 5 [good outcome]) and unfavorable outcome (GOS 1 [dead], 2 [vegetative state], 3 [severe disability]). Two authors (RR, JS) independently and retrospectively assessed GOS based on outpatient medical charts. GOS assessment agreement was good between the two authors (kappa=0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86\u20130.95). Discrepancies were resolved by verbal discussion.\n\nTreatment guidelines in the trauma center follows the Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines.17The Helsinki University Hospital ethics committee and The Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare approved the study and waived the need for informed consent.\n\nStatistical analysis\nDifferences in univariate variables between the BAC groups were tested using the \u03c7\n2\ntest (two-tailed) test for categorical data, the Student's\nt\n-test for parametric data, and the Mann-Whitney U test for non-parametric data. Categorical data is presented as number (%), parametric data as mean (standard deviation), and non-parametric as median (interquartile range). To assess the correlation between admission BAC and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, the Spearman's rho was used.\nTo assess the independent effect of BAC on outcome, we created a multivariate binary logistic regression model (multivariate analysis). To adjust for case-mix and injury severity differences between the BAC groups, we used the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI (IMPACT) prognostic model together with the APACHE II scoring system by using the newly developed IMPACT-APACHE II prediction model.\n18\nThe IMPACT-APACHE II prediction model has shown superior performance in predicting six-month outcome in patients with TBI compared to the individual IMPACT and APACHE II models.\n18\nWe used the IMPACTlab-APACHE II model to achieve best possible case-mix adjustment. The IMPACT lab portion of the IMPACTlab-APACHE II prediction model includes several admission characteristics strongly associated with long-term outcome after TBI: age, motor score, pupillary light reaction, Marshall CT score, presence of traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, presence of epidural hematoma, hypotensive or hypoxic insults, glucose and hemoglobin concentrations.\n13\nThe APACHE II portion of the IMPACTlab-APACHE II model, on the other hand accounts for 12 physiological variables measured in the first 24\u2009h in the ICU (most abnormal physiological value), and a chronic health evaluation.\n14\nThus, the IMPACTlab-APACHE II prediction model serves as a marker of both baseline TBI risk and general severity of illness in the ICU. Furthermore, due to the possible risk of BAC-positive patients having a lower GCS score on arrival due to alcohol intoxication and not TBI severity, we also adjusted for the Rotterdam Computerized Tomography (CT) score.\n19\nThe final multivariate model included: IMPACTlab-APACHE II Rotterdam CT score, and BAC groups (with no BAC as the reference).\nFor the statistical analysis, the 2012 IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version, 21.0. (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) was used."

    "Methods": "Animals\nThe study was conducted according to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines in compliance with National Institutes of Health guidelines (MD-11-12783-4). Adult Sabra male mice weighing 40\u2009g were housed in a specific pathogen-free facility according to a 12:12-h light-dark cycle. Food and water were provided ad libitum.\n\nTrauma model\nTBI was induced according to the CHI model, using a weight drop device.\n22\n,\n23\nIn brief, after isoflurane anesthesia, a midline longitudinal incision was performed, exposing the skull. A Teflon-tipped cone (2\u2009mm diameter) was placed 1 to 2\u2009mm lateral to the midline in the midcoronal plane. The head was manually held in place and a 95\u2009g weight was dropped on the cone from a prefixed height (18\u2009cm), resulting in a focal injury to the left hemisphere. Following recovery from anesthesia, the mice were returned to their home cages with postoperative care and free access to food and water. Ouabain (1\u2009\u03bcg/Kg) or saline as control were injected (intraperitoneally) into the mice (\nn\n=12) according to two protocols. In the first, ouabain or saline were given 1, 24, 48, and 72\u2009h after injury. In the second, ouabain was administered 1 and 24\u2009h following injury and then three times a week until the end of the experiment (43\u2009d post-injury).\n\nBrdU injections\nDuring the last 10\u2009d of the experiment (Days 33 to 43), all the animals received intraperitoneal injections of the tracer 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 50\u2009mg/kg/day) to label dividing cells.\n\nNeurobehavioral evaluation\nThe functional status of the mice was evaluated according to a Neurological Severity Score (NSS) by a blind observer. The score is a 10-point scale that assesses the functional neurologic status based on the presence of some reflexes and the ability to perform motor and behavioral tasks, such as beam walking, beam balance, and spontaneous locomotion.\n24\nAnimals are awarded one point for failure to perform a task, thus the NSS increases with the severity of dysfunction. The NSS obtained 1\u2009h after CHI reflects the initial severity of injury.\n25\nNSS values were measured at 1 and 24\u2009h following injury. Additional measurements were made at 4, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 40\u2009d after injury.\n\nInjury size\nAt 43\u2009d after CHI, the animals were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. Their brains were removed and frozen-sectioned into 10\u2009\u03bcm slices. Brain slices at 200\u2009\u03bcm intervals between bregma +1.42 and bregma - 0.8 were stained with Giemsa stain-modified solution (1:1; Fluka, Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, St Louis, MO) and digitally photographed. The volume of injured tissue was measured using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Damaged tissue volume was calculated by dividing the volume of the injured hemisphere by that of the non-injured hemisphere.\n26\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nFor each brain, three evenly-spaced frozen sections between bregma +1.42 and bregma - 0.8 were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15\u2009min. Deoxyribonucleic acid was denatured by incubating the sections in 2\u2009N HCl for 30 mins at 37\u00b0C followed by neutralization with immersion in 0.1\u2009mol/L borate buffer. After washing with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), the sections were blocked in 5% normal goat serum containing 0.3% triton X-100, and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the appropriate primary antibodies in a humidified chamber. Rat anti-BrdU was used as a marker for cell proliferation (1:200; Accurate, New York, NY), mouse anti-GFAP was used to detect astrocytes (1:200; Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA), mouse anti-NeuN was used to identify mature neurons (1:100 Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA) and mouse anti-CD31 was used as a marker for endothelial cells (1:100; Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA). Following the incubation, the sections were rinsed and incubated for 2\u2009h with Alexa 488 and Alexa 555 conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200; Molecular Probes, Leiden, the Netherlands). After an additional three washings in PBS, specimens were mounted in medium containing 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma, Israel) to visualize the nuclei.\n\nImage analysis and cell counting\nFor image analysis of each brain section, five high magnification (\u00d7400) images were obtained of specific area of interest, including the entire area surrounding the injured cortex and the subventricular zone (SVZ), using a confocal or epifluorescent Olympus (Tokyo, Japan) microscope equipped with a camera. Cells were counted using a cell counter plug-in for the ImageJ software. To measure cell proliferation, the percentage of BrdU-positive cells among the total DAPI stained cells was calculated. To determine the identity of the proliferating cells, the number of double-positive stained cells for BrdU and either CD31, GFAP or NeuN was determined and divided by the total number of DAPI stained cells.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe data are presented as the mean\u00b1standard error of the mean as indicated in the figure legends. Neurobehavioral evaluation values were compared at the selected time points using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. Other tests were evaluated by Student's\nt\n-test. A\np\nvalue of\u22640.05 was considered significant for all comparisons."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll experiments were performed on 3\u20134 month old, male Sprague-Dawley rats (310\u2013445\u2009g, colony 211, Harlan, Indianapolis, IN). Animals were individually housed in a controlled environment (12-h light/dark cycle). The Animal Care and Use Committee at the School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Wisconsin, approved all experimental procedures in this study.\n\nExperimental preparation\nSurgical preparation\nFor telemetry implantation and C2HS procedures, a sterile operation was performed under anesthesia induced with isoflurane in 100% O\n2\n. The rats were injected with buprenorphine (0.03\u2009mg/kg), carprofen (Rimadyl, 5\u2009mg/kg) and enrofloxacin (Baytril, 4\u2009mg/kg) subcutaneously to minimize potential post-operative pain and infection. Body temperature was maintained at 36.5\u201337.5\u00b0C using a rectal probe and external heating pad. A cannula was inserted into the trachea, and the animals were artificially ventilated (tidal volume, 2.0\u20132.5 mL; Rodent Ventilator, model 683; Harvard Apparatus, South Natick, MA) with 1.5\u20132.5% isoflurane in 100% O\n2\nduring the procedure. Effective anesthesia was judged by abolition of pedal withdrawal and corneal blink reflexes. Oxygen saturation was monitored by pulse oximetry (model 8600; Nonin Medical Inc. Plymouth, MN) during the surgical procedures.\nAt the end of the procedure, buprenorphine, carprofen, and enrofloxacin at the same dose rats received before the surgery were administered at 12\u2009h intervals for 48\u2009h post-surgery. Rats were visually monitored and weighed daily. In addition, in spinal cord injured rats, animal care included trimming nails after surgery, and cleaning fur, eyes, and mouth with warm water daily for 7 days to avoid accumulation of porphyrin. Rats had free access to pellets and high caloric nutritional gels inside their cages. In both telemetry implantation and SCI procedures, stainless steel staples were removed 7 days post-surgery. We report no post-surgery complications after telemetry implantation or SCI procedures.\nTelemetry transmitter implantation\nAfter anesthesia induction and pre-operative care (see above), the rat was placed in a supine position and the ventral surface of the abdominal muscles were exposed. A sterilized telemetry transmitter body (model 4ET-S1/2; Data Sciences International [DSI], St. Paul, MN) was inserted into the peritoneal cavity. The transmitter allowed simultaneous and continuous monitoring of electrical bio-potentials, body temperature, and general locomotor activity. In experiments with normal rats, two bio-potential channels were used to record EMG from right Dia and T2 EIC muscle. In SCI experiments, the four bio-potential channels were used to record EMG activity from bilateral Dia and second external intercostal (T2 EIC) muscles.\nDuring bilateral Dia and T2 EIC implantations, both right and left hemi-Dias were exposed through a midline incision following the Alba line. In both hemi-Dias, two leads were implanted in the midcostal area using a 23-gauge syringe needle guide and tissue adhesive (Vetbond 1469SB; 3M Animal care product, St. Paul, MN) as reported previously.\n3\nNext, right and left T2 EIC muscles were exposed through a 2.5\u2009cm midsternum incision, starting in the upper edge of the sternum, followed by retraction of the pectoralis major and minor on the right and left side. The right and left T2 EIC muscles were implanted 1.0\u2009cm right and left from the sternum, respectively, and the second interspace was identified.\nBio-potential lead pairs targeting EIC muscles were tunneled subcutaneously from the body of the transmitter in the peritoneal cavity. As in the Dia, all leads in T2 EIC were implanted using a 23-gauge syringe needle guide with tissue adhesive to keep the leads in place. Finally, abdominal muscles and pectoralis major were joined by midline suture (Polysorb 3.0). Skin was closed with wound staples.\nC2HS\nOne week after telemetry implantation, C2HS were performed, consistent with previous studies.\n17\n,\n18\nAfter anesthesia induction and pre-operative care (see above), the spinal cord was exposed at C2 via a dorsal laminectomy. The dura mater was cut and a left C2 hemisection was performed using a microscalpel followed by aspiration. Overlying muscles were sutured and the skin closed with stainless steel wound clips. Sham rats received laminectomy, but not C2HS.\nTelemetry\nFor the AIH protocol (see below), rats were placed in custom-made Plexiglas chambers positioned on telemetry receivers (model RPC-2; DSI, St. Paul, MN). Signals from the implanted radiotelemetry transmitter were detected by the receivers and sent to a data exchange matrix (model ACQ-7700; DSI, St Paul, MN). Channels of EMG (Dia and T2 EIC muscles), body temperature, and general locomotor activity were monitored in the unanesthetized, freely moving rats using a data acquisition system (PONEMAH Physiology Platform; DSI, St. Paul, MN). EMG analysis was performed with Neuroscore software (DSI, St. Paul, MN) as described below.\nDrug preparation\nKW6002 (Istradefylline, Sigma-Aldrich) is a selective A2A receptor (A2AR) antagonist with a molecular weight of 384 and a Ki of 29.6 nM in rats. It has a half-life of 110\u2009min, 97% availability after intraperitoneal (IP) injection, and brain concentration of 500 uM after 4\u2009h,\n19\nmaking it a suitable drug for our prolonged,\nin vivo\nexperiments. KW6002 was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 9.3\u2009mg/mL, sonicated and stored at 4\u00b0C in a dark vial protected from light. The day of the experiment, the drug was administrated via IP injection at a dose of 0.5\u2009mg/kg.\nExperimental groups\nTo investigate the effects of AIH and A2AR inhibition, rats (\nn\n=28) were randomly allocated into the following groups: (1) AIH+KW6002,\nn\n=8; (2) AIH+vehicle,\nn\n=8; (3) normoxia (Nx)+KW6002,\nn\n=6; (4) NX+vehicle,\nn\n=6. Another cohort of rats with C2HS (\nn\n=16) was randomly assigned to the following groups 7 days post-surgery: (1) AIH+KW6002,\nn\n=4; (2) AIH+vehicle,\nn\n=4; (3) Nx+KW6002,\nn\n=3; (4) Nx+vehicle,\nn\n=3; (5) Sham,\nn\n=2. Finally, a third group of rats with chronic C2HS (8 weeks post-surgery;\nn\n=16) were assigned to the following groups: (1) AIH+KW6002,\nn\n=4; (2) AIH+vehicle,\nn\n=4; (3) Nx+KW6002,\nn\n=3; (4) Nx+vehicle,\nn\n=3; (5) Sham,\nn\n=2.\nSham rats were exposed to Nx and did not receive IP injections. Neither acute nor chronic C2HS rats received any treatments before beginning experiments. Allocation of groups was performed after telemetry implantation. For the C2HS and administration of treatment, the investigator was blind. For the final analysis, the investigator was not blind.\nAIH protocol\nNormoxic (21% O\n2\n) and hypoxic (10.5% O\n2\n) conditions were established in custom-made chambers (Plexiglas cylinder, 12\u00d74 inches ID; 1 rat per chamber) by mixing O\n2\nand N\n2\nvia a custom-made computer-controlled system to obtain the desired inspired oxygen concentrations. Within the chambers, CO\n2\nand O\n2\nlevels were continuously monitored (O\n2\nAnalyzer, model 17518; CO\n2\nAnalyzer, model 17515; VacuMed Inc, Ventura, CA). Gas flowed through the chamber at a rate of 4 L/min, keeping chamber CO\n2\nconcentration well below 0.5% at all times. Of the change in O\n2\nlevels within the chamber during AIH protocols, 95%was achieved in 25\u00b15\u2009sec.\nIn normal rats, experiments were performed 7 days after telemetry implantation. In C2HS rats, EMG amplitude was recorded during baseline conditions (normoxia) for 20\u2009min 1 day after C2HS to assure complete hemisection. Acute and chronic C2HS experiments were performed 7 days and 8 weeks post-C2HS, respectively. At 8:00 AM on the experimental day, rats were placed in the chamber above the signal receivers for 2\u2009h of acclimation, followed by 1\u2009h of baseline recording. Next, rats received an IP injection of either A2AR antagonist (KW6002) or vehicle (DMSO). Once all rats were in the chambers, experimental groups received AIH (10, 5-min episodes of 10.5% O\n2\ninterspersed with 5-min 21% O\n2\nintervals). Control and sham rats also received time control (TC) exposures (time matched continuous Nx). Finally, 1\u2009h post-treatment, recordings were made in all groups during normoxia. Chamber temperature was 22.5\u201324.5\u00b0C during protocols.\nTissue processing\nTo verify the extent of C2HS, spinal cords were removed immediately after completion of experiments, immersed in paraformaldehyde (4%, overnight at 4\u00b0C), and cryoprotected in increasing concentrations of sucrose (20\u201330%). Tissues were frozen in isopentane at \u221245\u00b0C and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Longitudinal sections of the spinal cord (C1 to C6, 30\u2009\u03bcm thick) were stained with cresyl violet and examined histologically using a light microscope to reconstruct the injury in a transverse plane.\n20\n,\n21\nNIH ImageJ software (National Institute of Health;\nhttp://rsb.info.nih.gov/jj\n) was used to measure and compare the extent of hemisections among groups.\n\nData analyses\nEMG signals were analyzed with Neuroscore software. Raw signals were filtered (100\u2013624\u2009Hz), rectified, integrated (100 msec) and averaged for each muscle. EMG values during active locomotor and grooming activity were excluded from analysis. Mean peak amplitude, respiratory frequency, and calculated minute activity (amplitude\u00d7frequency) were averaged in all rats before and after AIH. Data obtained during the pre-treatment period (1\u2009h) were regarded as baseline values. For experiments assessing motor activity in Dia and T2 EIC muscles after C2HS, values were normalized to pre-injury baseline values.\nStatistical comparisons were made for time (pre- and post-treatment) and treatment groups (see\nexperimental groups\n, above) using a two-way, repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Fisher LSD\npost hoc\ntests (Sigma-Stat version 2.03, Systat Software Inc, San Jose, CA). Differences indicated as statistically significant were\np\n<0.05. All values are expressed as means\u00b1standard error of the mean (SEM)."

    "Methods": "Participants\nU.S. Marines (\nn\n=646) from the Second Expeditionary Force (2MEF) participated in the single testing session reported here. Volunteer participants were all active duty service members in good standing (not on limited duty medical status or pending medical or disciplinary discharge). Testing took place in 2012 at Marine Base Camp Lejeune, where an entire neurobehavioral battery was administered, and at Marine Corp Air Grand Combat Center, Twenty-nine Palms, where the entire neurobehavioral battery was administered to some participants, but because of time constraints, only a portion of the neurobehavioral battery was administered to others (see list of measures). Marines were recruited for participation independent of their medical or deployment history.\n\nProcedure\nMedical officers arranged for 2 hours of time off from duties for service members who might be interested in participating in this study, informing them that researchers were developing an instrument that might eventually be used to improve medical problems in the field. Service members showed up at an appointed time in a classroom to hear a briefing about the research. After an explanation of the procedure that took place without the presence of commanding officers or senior enlisted personnel in their chain of command, volunteers were allowed to leave or sign the Department of Defense Institutional Review Board approved consent to participate. No remuneration was offered, and care was taken to insure that participation was voluntary, without recrimination for refusing to participate or leaving during testing. No identifiable information was collected, other than age, rank, and sex. There was greater than a 99% agreement to participate from those who came to hear the briefing.\nGroups of approximately 20\u201340 consented service members were administered neurocognitive and self-report and psychological measures on a handheld computing device, in classrooms at either Marine Base Camp Lejeune or Marine Desert Warfare Training Center, Twentynine Palms. The full (Standard) testing battery reported here took approximately 40\u2009min to complete, with the subset (Rapid or Brief) battery taking approximately 10\u2009min (see list of measures). After an explanation of the procedure, handheld devices were distributed. For the neurocognitive tests, participants were instructed to answer as rapidly and accurately as possible. All tests were self-explanatory, beginning with written instructions. After completion of the test battery, service members were administered additional testing for determining reliability. Only the first test administrations are discussed here, because reliability of this instrument has been reported elsewhere.\n41\n\nMaterials\nTesting materials was administered on a handheld computing device, programmed with the Defense Automated Neurobehavioral Assessment software (DANA). DANA combines a traditional Neuro Cognitive Assessment Tool (NCAT) with other behavioral assessments. All subjects were administered the DANA Standard battery consisting of eight different neurocognitive tests assessing speed and accuracy across a range of simple motor and visual discrimination to more complex memory and decision-making tasks, as well as five self-report psychological assessments. Subjects used a Trimble NOMAD handheld computing device and were instructed to use a stylus for consistency. The NOMAD uses the Android Operating System and has a 3.5-inch color pressure sensitive touch screen. This format is optimally suited for tests of speed and accuracy because it has less variability than can be achieved across various desktop computers.\nDANA was funded by and developed for the Department of Defense for use by medical support personnel in the field to detect impaired performance because of deployment-related factors including concussion, emotional distress, or exhaustion. Although DANA uses standard assessments tools that have been well researched and widely utilized, because of its unique delivery system, DANA was tested under extreme field conditions as well as classroom settings, and found to have adequate test-retest (>0.70) and split-half (>0.80) reliability\n41\nand cross-platform validity compared with the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metric (ANAM), the standard neurocognitive assessment used by the military.\n42\nNeurocognitive tests in the DANA Standard Battery used to assess speed and accuracy included Simple Reaction Time (SRT1), Procedural Reaction Time (PRT), Go-No-Go (GNG), Spatial Rotation Discrimination (SPD), Code Substitution Simultaneous (CDS), Code Substitution Recall (CDR), Sternberg Memory Test (STN), and a second Simple Reaction Time (SRT2).\nDepending on the test, between 20 and 40 trials per test are administered, and average speed, accuracy, and TP are calculated for each of these tests. The Standard Battery also included five self-report psychological tests: Post-Traumatic Symptom Disorder Check List, military version (PCL-M), Primary Care Health Questionnaire depression module, minus the suicide question (PHQ-8); Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory (PSQI), the Deployment Stress Inventory (DSI), a modification of the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory adapted for deployed service members that includes questions about anger and distress, and the Combat Exposure Survey (CES). For each behavioral assessment, total score was calculated. Accepted clinical threshold scores were calculated for dichotomous analyses. Demographic and concussion history was also included in the battery.\nNeurocognitive measures\nData Cleaning was conducted for neurocognitive tests. Responses that are considered too fast (faster than 150\u2009msec for SRT and 250 for other measures) and lapses (slower than 850\u2009msec for SRT or timed-out for the response time for other tests, approximately 2000\u2009msec) are considered incorrect responses and not calculated in mean, Standard deviation (SD), percent correct, or TP scores. Neurocognitive tests that have less than 66% correct responses are considered invalid. Valid summary test scores were calculated to determine mean correct (Mean), SD, percent correct (% correct), and TP (mean correct responses divided by total trials within 1\u2009min), a test of cognitive efficiency. Descriptions of all assessment measures are listed below.\nSRT.\na\n,\nb\n,\nc\nThe subject taps on the location of the yellow asterisk symbol as quickly as possible each time it appears. This task measures pure reaction time.\nPRT.\na\n,\nb\n,\nc\nThe screen displays one of four numbers for 3\u2009sec. The subject presses on a left button (\u201c2\u201d or \u201c3\u201d) or right button (\u201c3\u201d or \u201c4\u201d) depending on the number pressed. A choice reaction time measure of accuracy, reaction time, and impulsivity. This choice reaction time task targets simple executive functioning with easy decision-making capabilities.\nGNG.\na\n,\nb\n,\nc\nThis is a forced choice reaction-time task relevant to warfighters. A house is presented on the screen with several windows. Either a \u201cfriend\u201d (green) or \u201cfoe\u201d (white) appears in a window. The respondent must push a \u201cfire\u201d button only when a \u201cfoe\u201d appears. A choice reaction time measure of sustained attention and impulsivity. The test assesses speed and accuracy of targets, omissions, and commissions.\nSPD.\nb\n,\nc\nPairs of four-bar histograms are displayed on the screen simultaneously, and the subject is requested to determine whether they are identical. One histogram is always rotated either\u00b190 degrees with respect to the other histogram. Assesses visuospatial analytic ability.\nCDS.\nc\nSubjects refer to a code set of nine symbol-digit pairs that are shown across the upper portion of the screen. A sequence of single symbol-digit pairs is shown below the key, and the subject indicates whether or not the single pair matches the code by pressing Yes or No. Assesses visual scanning and attention, learning, and immediate recall.\nCode Substitution\u2013Delayed Memory\nb\n,\nc\n(CDD)\nAfter a delay of several intervening tests, the same symbol-digit pairs are presented without the code. The subject indicates whether or not the pairing was included in the code that was presented in the earlier Code Substitution learning section. Assesses learning and short-term memory.\nSTN.\nc\nThe subject memorizes a set of five letters, after which letters appear on the screen one at a time, and the subject determines if the letter on the screen is a member of the memory set. Assesses working memory.\nSelf-report measures\nSelf-report psychological questionnaires were programmed in DANA and administered on the handheld device after the neurocognitive assessments. One question appeared at a time. Wording was unchanged from the original questionnaires. Service members were instructed to answer as accurately as possible, but that they could skip a question if it disturbed them.\nPCL-M.\nc\nA 17-item scale assessing symptoms in response to stressful military experiences. This scale assesses PTSD, with subscales including Re-Experiencing, Avoidance/Numbing, and Hyperarousal. Higher scores indicate increased PTSD symptomatology. In a military population, scores >50 are in persons likely to have PTSD. For greatest specifically, scores >44 with three Re-Experiencing, one Avoidance/Numbing, and two Hyperarousal endorsed as at least \u201cmost of the time\u201d are more specific for PTSD and correlate very highly (0.92) with the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS).\n43\nPrimary Care PTSD Screen\nb\n(PC-PTSD)\nFour screening questions designed for use in clinical settings to screen for PTSD, with three of four endorsed items suggestive of likely PTSD. Questions assess Hyperarousal, Re-Experiencing, and Avoidance for PTSD Screening. This test is more sensitive than specific, but correlates highly with the PCL.\n44\n,\n45\nPHQ8\nAn eight-item Depression Scale assessing symptom severity and diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder. For research purposes, item #9 (concerning suicide) was not included, yet previously published results indicate that the scoring, reliability, and clinical validity are similar.\n46\nA person with a score of 0\u20139 is likely to have no depression, 10\u201314 mild depression, 15\u201319 moderate depression, and 20+ severe depression.\nCES.\nc\nA seven-item self-report measure that assesses wartime stressors experienced by service members. The total CES score (ranging 0 to 41) is calculated by using a sum of weighted scores, which can be classified into one of five categories of combat exposure ranging from \u201clight\u201d to \u201cheavy.\u201d This scale rates cumulative combat exposure and is highly predictive of PTSD, pain and injury, TBI, depression, and other behavioral sequellae.\n47\nDSI\nThe DSI is an adaptation of the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory\u201322 (NSI), with six additional questions assessing anger and distress adapted for a deployment context. Consistent with others,\n48\nfactor analysis revealed factors referred to as post-concussive symptom subscales in the current analysis: Neurocognitive (worsening focus, concentration, memory), Sensory (alterations in sensitivity to light, sound, smell), Somatic (increased pain, sleep, discomfort), and Vestibular (difficulties with balance or feeling dizzy), as well as total score. Because emotional complaints are better assessed through other measures included in the battery, they are not included in the current analysis of the DSI.\nInsomnia Screening Index\nb\n(ISI)\nA five-item scale evaluating perceived insomnia severity and sleep habits. Each item is rated on a five-point scale (0\u20134). The total score ranges 0 to 28, and higher scores indicate more severe insomnia. A cutoff score of 10 has been shown to indicate insomnia.\n49\nPittsburgh Sleep Quality Index\nc\n(PSQI)\nNineteen self-rated items and 5 partner-rated items, which measure sleep quality during the previous month. This scale differentiates \u201cgood\u201d from \u201cpoor\u201d sleepers based on seven areas: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction over the last month. This scale is the most widely used sensitive and specific self-report measure for insomnia. A score above 6 indicates a \u201cpoor\u201d sleeper.\n50\nDemographics and background questionnaire\nService members were asked about age, gender, rank, deployment history.\nConcussion questions\nBased on the Post-deployment Health Assessment used for all deployed personnel, service members were asked about their history of concussion, including number of lifetime concussions, when their most recent concussion occurred, the immediate effects of the concussion on their cognitive status (dazed and confused, loss of memory, loss of consciousness), and current post-concussive symptoms.\n\nHypotheses\nThe relationship of recency and number of lifetime concussions on emotional distress, post-concussive symptoms, and neurocognitive functioning was examined. It was predicted that recency of last concussion and number of lifetime concussion would be negatively associated with emotional distress, post-concussive symptoms, and neurocognitive functioning, and further that concussion uniquely contributes to these factors independent of PTSD (PCL-M) or depression (PHQ-8) scores or deployment factors (time since deployment, CES).\n\nPlanned analyses\nIBM SPSS v20.0 was used to calculate power and conduct all analyses. Sample size was initially determined from a power estimate of the differences between two groups (concussed \u2013 not concussed) to find at least a small effect size in SRT or PCL, based on the expected presence of at least 15% reported concussion, 15% PCL-M scores >50, and 15% PHQ >10 in those recently returned from a recent combat deployment. Power was also calculated based on stability of measures and expected standard errors determined in the Phase 1 pilot study.\n41\nDescriptive reporting includes mean correct responses (Mean), SD, percent correct (%Correct), and TP for all neurocognitive scores; mean and SD for self-report psychological scores, and mean or number of cases and SD for age, sex, and number and recency of concussions. TP was used for analyses of interest for all cognitive tests, except for GNG and CDD where %Correct is the metric of relevance.\nThe effects of recency of concussion and number of lifetime concussions on neurocognitive, emotional, and post-concussive scores are examined first with a univariate General Linear Model on continuous variables. Generalized Linear Modeling (with Wald statistic and Robust Estimator) was used to confirm significance when groups were associated with unequal variances per the Levine test of homogeneity. Pairwise comparisons between type of deployment and number of concussions using the Bonferroni correction were used to adjust for type-I error. PTSD (PCL-M), depression (PHQ-8), deployment history (never, recently within 6 months, and previously\u2014longer than 6 months ago), and combat exposure (CES) scores were used as covariates to determine the unique contribution of concussion to emotional, post-concussive, and neurocognitive measures. PCL-M and PHQ-8 scores were not used as covariates when they were the outcome under investigation.\nLogistic Regression was used to determine the odds ratios (OR) for the contribution of concussion to clinical cutoff scores for emotional measures (PCL-M >49; PHQ-8\u2009>10; DSI-Anger >1 SD), and for neurocognitive functioning scores more than one SD from the mean. PCL-M, PHQ-8, deployment history, and CES covariates are included in these analyses as well unless the covariate is the outcome measure of interest (PCL-M, PHQ-8). Effect sizes are reported as partial eta\n2\n(\u03b7\n2\np\n) for analysis of variance and ORs for Logistic Regression. Description of effect sizes as small, medium, and large is based on the Cohen interpretation.\n51\nBecause this is a single period analysis, data will be analyzed for the exact number of subjects who took the tests in the analysis without extrapolating for missing data."

    "Methods": "Human NgR1(310)-Fc production\nHuman NgR1(310)-Fc was expressed in a stable CHO-S cell line at Axerion Therapeutics. The expression vector encodes aa residues 1-310 of human NgR1 with the Cys266Ala and Cys309Ala substitutions fused to the Fc domain of human IgG1, as described for rat protein previously.\n33\nAfter vial thaw, the cells were expanded in protein free, animal origin component-free media. Shake flask cultures were grown in appropriately sized, nonbaffled tissue culture flasks. Cell expansion continued until a sufficient number of cells were attained to inoculate 1-liter bioreactors. The bioreactors were run in fed-batch mode, with commercially available feed plus glucose. The pH and dissolved oxygen were controlled throughout the bioreactor run. Antifoam was added as needed. The bioreactor process ran for approximately 2 weeks. At the conclusion of the bioreactor run, the supernatant was harvested by centrifugation and clarified by sequential filtrations through 0.8 micron and 0.2 micron polyethersulfone membranes.\nThe purification scheme consisted of three chromatography steps: Protein A (bind-elute mode), Q-Sepharose FF (flow-thru mode), and Q-Sepharose FF (bind-elute mode) chromatography steps. hNgR1(310)-Fc was captured from clarified harvest using Protein A (bind-elute mode) chromatography. After low pH elution, the protein was held at room temperature for 1 hour as a viral inactivation step. After the viral inactivation step, the pH and conductivity of the protein solution was adjusted for load onto an anion exchange chromatography column (Q-sepharose FF). This column was run in flow-thru mode and removed impurities such as host cell protein and DNA. The final column purification step, Q-Sepharose FF (bind-elute mode), was a polishing step to remove additional impurities and to concentrate the protein before dialysis. After the final column chromatography step, the hNgR1(310)-Fc was buffer-exchanged into phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.0). The final concentration of the protein was 10\u2009mg/mL.\n\nhNgR1(310)-Fc binding activity\nThe ability of hNgR1(310)-Fc to bind independently to Nogo-66, MAG, and OMgp was tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based binding assays. In this assay, a tagged ligand (biotinylated Nogo-66, MAG-6xHis-StrepTagII, or OMgp-6xHis-StrepTagII) was bound to Streptavidin (Nogo-66) or Strep-Tactin (MAG or OMgp) coated microtiter plates. The plate was blocked with bovine serum albumin (BSA), standards were added in duplicate, and the plate incubated for 16\u2009h. Detection antibody (goat antihuman antibody to the Fc region) was added, and the plate was incubated for 1 hour. Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate was added and incubated for 30\u2009min before the reaction was stopped with HCl. Biotinylated Nogo-66 (Biotin-RIYKGVIQAIQKSDEGHPFRAYLESEVAISEELVQKYSNSALGHVNSTIKELRRLFLVDDLVDSLK-Amide) was obtained by commercial synthesis. MAG-6xHis-StrepTagII (MAG) and OMgp-6xHis-StrepTagII were produced from stable cell lines developed at Axerion Therapeutics. The background values without ligand coating were subtracted from the values obtained from ligand-coated plates.\n\nAxon regeneration assay\nThe culture of E18 rat neurons and their exposure to Nogo-22\u2009kDa inhibitory fragment has been described previously.\n13\nHere, the purified NgR1(310)-Fc or Nogo-22 or both were added immediately after the scrape injury. Five days later, the extent of axonal regeneration was scored by automated analysis of \u03b2 III-tubulin staining with an ImagExpressMicro machine (Molecular Devices).\n\nhNgR1(310)-Fc tissue levels\nTissue from rat or nonhuman primate was collected and frozen at \u221280\u00b0 before assays. The tissue was homogenized in nine volumes of radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (150\u2009mM NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100, 0.5% Na deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50\u2009mM Tris, pH 8.0) containing enzyme inhibitor cocktail at 4\u00b0. After incubation, the homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000\u00d7\ng\nfor 30\u2009min. The supernatant was assayed for NgR1(310)-Fc level. To detect NgR1(310)-Fc, microtiter plates were coated with Donkey Anti-Human IgG, Fc Fragment Specific (Jackson ImmunoResearch), and then blocked with 1% BSA. Tissue lysates were incubated in these plates for 12\u201318\u2009h at 4\u00b0, and then washed with Tris buffered saline (TBS), 0.1% Tween (TBS-T) before adding goat anti-NgR1 antibody (R&D Systems, #AF1440) followed by biotin-conjugated Bovine Anti-Goat IgG(H+L) secondary antibody. Bound material was detected with DELFIA Eu-labeled Streptavidin (Perkin Elmer) using time resolved fluorescence at excitation at 340\u2009nm and emission at 615\u2009nm. The assay was linear over the range from 0.3\u2013200\u2009ng/mL of NgR1(310)-Fc in samples. Undiluted tissue extracts from untreated rat brain did not alter the standard curve detectably.\n\nhNgR1(310)-Fc pharmacokinetic studies\nAnimals were housed, dosed, and tissue collected at Northern Biomedical Research, Inc. (Spring Lake, MI). For rat studies, Charles River Crl:CD\n\u00ae\n(SD)BR male rats of 250\u2013275\u2009g were anesthetized with isoflurane. A catheter was inserted at the cisterna magna level and advanced 8\u2009cm, past the lumbar enlargement. The proximal end of the catheter was extended through the skin and plugged. Postsurgically, the animals received a single intramuscular dose of ceftiofur sodium (5\u2009mg/kg), butorphanol tartrate (0.05\u2009mg/kg). After a surgical recovery period of >5 days, a slow bolus dose of NgR1(310)-Fc was administered through the catheter system at a dose volume of 20\u2009\u03bcL followed by 20\u2009\u03bcL of PBS to flush the dose from the catheter system. Animals were sacrificed at 1\u2013168\u2009h after dosing and the brain and spinal cord removed for further analysis.\nFor multidose pharmacokinetic studies, rats received exactly the same dosing procedure as in the intermittent lumbar intrathecal bolus spinal cord contusion experiments described below, but there was no spinal cord contusion.\nFor cynomologus monkeys of 3\u20135 years of age and 3\u20134.5\u2009kg body weight, intrathecal catheters were placed under ketamine and isoflurane anesthesia with the tip located at the thoracolumbar junction (IT-L). After a surgical recovery period of >5 days, a slow bolus dose of 2.0\u2009mg NgR1(310)-Fc was administered through the IT-L catheter system at a dose volume of 400\u2009\u03bcL followed by 600\u2009\u03bcL of PBS vehicle to flush the dose from the catheter system. Animals received an additional four 2.0\u2009mg doses of NgR1(310)-Fc given at 3-day intervals. After completion of dosing, animals were sacrificed at 1\u2013168\u2009h after dosing and the brain and spinal cord removed for further analysis.\n\nRat spinal contusion model\nFemale Sprague-Dawley rats (10\u201311 weeks, 220\u2013240\u2009g) were used in this study. Animals were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (60\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg) mixture. A laminectomy was conducted at the caudal portion of T6 and all of T7 spinal levels. A T7 moderate contusion injury (weight of 10\u2009g, height of 25\u2009mm) was produced with the MASCIS impactor as described previously.\n27\n,\n29\nAfter the spinal contusion, muscle and skin layers were sutured with 4.0 polyglactin.\n\nIntracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) cannulation and continuous infusion therapy for SCI\nRats received i.c.v. infusion as described.\n27\n,\n29\n,\n30\nImmediately after the spinal contusion injury, rats were placed in a stereotactic frame. A midline, sagittal incision starting slightly behind the eyes through the skull was made on the scalp and the skull was exposed. A right-sided burr hole was drilled and a cannula (Alzet brain infusion kit 2; DURECT) was introduced into the right lateral ventricle at stereotaxic coordinates 0.6\u2009mm posterior and 1.2\u2009mm lateral to bregma and 4.0\u2009mm deep to the pial surface. The cannula was connected to an osmotic minipump (ALZET osmotic pumps, 2ML4; 2\u2009mL volume, 2.5\u2009\u03bcL/h, 28 day continuous delivery; DURECT) containing PBS placed subcutaneously over the scapulae. The cannula was glued in place with cyanoacrylate, and the skin was sutured. Three days after contusion injury, the rats were reanesthetized with isoflurane (5% induction and 1\u20132% maintenance) and the PBS minipumps were replaced with new osmotic minipumps connected to the same cannula and containing test substance. These pumps were filled with NgR1(310)-Fc in 2\u2009mL PBS or PBS alone. Two sets of experiments were conducted in this study. In the first set of experiments, the osmotic pumps were filled with 0.66\u2009mg of hNgR1(310)-Fc protein in 2\u2009mL PBS (medium dose treatment group 0.09\u2009mg/kg/d,\nn\n=18), 4.0\u2009mg of hNgR1(310)-Fc protein in 2\u2009mL PBS (high dose treatment group, 0.53\u2009mg/kg/d,\nn\n=16), or 2\u2009mL PBS alone (vehicle group,\nn\n=16). In the second set of experiments, osmotic pumps were filled with 0.10\u2009mg of hNgR1(310)-Fc protein in 2\u2009mL PBS (low dose treatment group, 0.014\u2009mg/kg/d,\nn\n=14) or 2\u2009mL PBS alone (vehicle group,\nn\n=6).\n\nRat intrathecal catheterization and IT-L bolus injection for SCI therapy\nFor rats receiving lumbar intrathecal infusion, a laminectomy was conducted at the caudal portion of L3 and rostral portion of L4 spinal levels immediately after the spinal contusion injury. The dura was incised using a 25-gauge needle. An ALZET rat intrathecal catheter (item #0007740, DURECT) was introduced into the subdural space over the spinal cord. The catheter was secured to the lumbar muscle to prevent removal. The proximal part of the catheter was introduced subcutaneously through the thoracic area and exited the skin of the interscapular area. The tip was closed with sterile glue. Muscle and skin layers were sutured with 4.0 polyglactin. Three days after SCI, the rats were reanesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane as mentioned above. Fifteen \u03bcL of PBS or hNgR1(310)-Fc protein (10\u2009mg/mL) was delivered through the intrathecal catheter and additional 15\u2009\u03bcL of PBS was injected to flush the catheter after each bolus injection before sealing the catheter tip. The rats were injected at 4-day intervals from the third day after SCI for 4 weeks, with doses at post-injury days 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, and 27. A total of seven different bolus injections were given to each rats with the total amount of 1.05\u2009mg hNgR1(310)-Fc protein (with total dose equivalent to 0.14\u2009mg/kg/d continuous infusion).\n\nChoice of control conditions\nWe used the PBS vehicle as control in these experiments. In previous studies, we have compared rat NgR-Fc with either PBS or rat IgG control protein, and demonstrated efficacy compared with either control.\n26\n,\n27\n,\n30\n,\n34\nThere was no obvious difference in the outcome depending on which control is used. The PBS control is of the greatest translational relevance because this is the vehicle and can be considered \u201cno treatment.\u201d The IgG control is a selective control for the effect of NgR domain, a mechanistic question. We have conducted a pilot experiment comparing human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, containing the Fc moiety) head-to-head with PBS (\nSupplementary Fig. 1\n; see online supplementary material at\nftp.liebertpub.com\n). The two control groups are identical in the primary outcome, the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) score. Thus, the choice of control protein has no obvious effect in this model at these doses.\n\nBehavioral testing\nAll behavioral tests were performed by two researchers, both of whom were blinded to the identity of the compound in the osmotic pump. The BBB locomotor scale was used for the rat behavioral testing.\n35\nTests were run 3 days after SCI and once a week starting from the first week of the injury. The grid walk test was performed at day 56 or 63 in different experiments. In this task, the animals are required to cross a 20\u00d760\u2009cm horizontal wire grid with 2.5\u00d72.5\u2009cm square gaps and successful forelimb steps, successful hindlimb steps (foot does not slip below the grip), and hindlimb faults (foot slips below the grid) were counted from videotapes over a 50\u2009cm distance. Three measures were calculated and scores were recorded as total hindlimb steps, hindlimb missteps, and the ratio of successful hindlimb steps to forelimb steps. To perform well on this examination, the animals must demonstrate normal limb coordination, which is mediated by ventrolateral tracts, have an intact reticulospinal system for initiation of stepping rhythm, and possess voluntary motor control, which is mediated by corticospinal and rubrospinal systems.\n\nHistology and analysis\nAt the end of the study, animals were perfused transcardially with PBS, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS solution and analyzed as described.\n8\n,\n26\n,\n27\n,\n29\n,\n36\nThe spinal cord 10\u2009mm rostral to and 10\u2009mm caudal to the lesion center was embedded in a glutaraldehyde-polymerized albumin matrix and cut parasagittally in the thickness of 40\u2009\u03bcm on a vibratome. Transverse sections (40\u2009\u03bcm) were collected from the spinal cord 11\u201316\u2009mm rostral to and 11\u201316\u2009mm caudal to the lesion center. Both sagittal and transverse sections of spinal cord were incubated with anti\u20135-hydroxytryptamine (anti-5HT) antibody (1:10,000; Immunostar, Hudson, WI) and then with Alexa Fluor 568-labeled secondary antibody (Invitrogen) to detect raphespinal fibers. Image analysis was performed with National Institutes of Health (NIH) image version 1.62, as described previously.\n26\n,\n27\n,\n29\n,\n36\nFor analysis of serotonin innervation, immunoreactive serotonin fibers in the ventral horn of transverse sections caudal to the lesion center were selected by thresholding; then the length of serotonin fiber per area was measured after using the \u201cskeletonize\u201d function.\nFor the groups receiving intermittent lumbar intrathecal bolus administration after spinal cord contusion, lesion area and tissue sparing were scored in 40\u2009\u03bcm thick parasagittal sections spaning the lesion site after staining with anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody, as described previously.\n27\nEvery fifth consecutive section (spaced 200\u2009\u03bcm apart) was stained and scored by an observer unaware of the treatment condition. Areas of high-intensity of GFAP staining, cavity, and GFAP-negative fibrotic scar were measured as the lesion area. The dorsal-ventral width of spared tissue at lesion center and at 10\u2009mm rostral to the lesion were measured. The values from these sections were averaged. All measurements were performed by using Zeiss AxioVision Rel. 4.8 software.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical comparisons included one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and repeated measures ANOVA with\npost hoc\npairwise comparisons, as specified in the figure legends, using SPSS or Prism statistical software."

    "Methods": "Patients\nPatients with TBI were prospectively recruited from consecutive admissions in the neurosurgery department of the University Hospital of Larissa (a tertiary referral institution in central Greece) as previously described.\n13\n,\n14\nPatients were included if they sustained isolated blunt head trauma, were of Greek origin, and 18 years of age or older. Patients with penetrating TBI, multiple organ injury, or anoxic brain damage were excluded. In total, 363 patients with TBI were enrolled in the study. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by our Institutional Review Board and a detailed written informed consent was obtained from each participant (or a close relative in the case of unresponsive or comatose patients).\nDemographic and TBI related data regarding age and sex of the participants, severity of the initial injury, findings of the initial CT scan, and 6-month clinical outcome were also prospectively collected. The clinical severity of head injury at admission was measured by means of the Glascow Coma Scale (GCS).\n15\nPatients were allocated into one of the three categories based on the GCS score: severe TBI (GCS=3\u20138), moderate (GCS=9\u201312), and mild TBI (GCS=13\u201315).\n16\nSix months after TBI, most of the patients were reevaluated in the outpatient neurosurgical clinic. For 54 (14.8%) patients, information was received by telephone from the patients themselves or their caregivers. With respect to the functional recovery, patients were allocated to one of the categories of the Glascow Outcome Scale (GOS) by an examiner who was unaware of the initial GCS score at admission and the results of the performed genotyping. For the analyses, GOS was dichotomized into good (good recovery, moderate disability) and poor (severe disability, vegetative state, death) outcome to provide a binary primary outcome variable corresponding to functional independence or not, respectively.\n15\n,\n16\n\nIsolation of DNA, SNP selection, and genotyping\nGenomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using a salting out method.\nBased on the HapMap data for northern and western Europe (CEU) population (Release 27, Phase II+III, Feb09, on NCBI B36 assembly, dbSNP b126), tag SNPs across the entire region of AQP4 gene (13.7Kbp spanning from 22686005 to 22699714 in chromosome 18) were selected using the tagger algorithm (\nhttp://www.broadinstitute.org/mpg/tagger/\n) with a pairwise approach, an r2 cutoff of \u22650.8 and a minor allele frequency >0.05. A total of seven tag SNPs in three distinct gene regions were retrieved: in the 3\u2032UTR region (rs335929, rs3763043), in intronic region between exons 4\u20135 (rs11661256, rs335931), and in intron 1\u20132 (rs3763040, rs4800773, rs3875089). The positions of tag SNPs along AQP4 gene are depicted in\nSupplementary Figure 1\n(see online supplementary material at\nftp.liebertpub.com\n).

Pair-wise D\u2019 and r2 LD measures between SNPs were made using the JLIN program.\n20\nUnivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate possible associations between individual tag SNPs or constructed haplotypes and patients' initial TBI severity (mild [GCS score: 13\u201315] vs. severe [GCS score: 3\u20138] TBI), the presence or not of intracranial hemorrhage and the 6-month clinical outcome (GOS good vs. poor outcome at 6 months) after TBI. Models for TBI severity and presence of intracranial hemorrhage were adjusted for age and sex, whereas models for GOS outcome were also adjusted for GCS score at admission. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated assuming different modes of inheritance (dominant: [AA] vs. [Ab+bb], recessive: [AA+Ab] vs. [bb] and allele difference model [A] vs. [b]).\n21\nAlthough conservative for tightly linked SNPs,\n22\nthe Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was applied, and the significance threshold was set to 0.05 divided by the number of the tested SNPs.

    "Methods": "Participants and procedures\nParticipants included children and adolescents who had been hospitalized for either a TBI or OI at least 12 months, but no greater than 63 months, before study participation. Participants were at least 3 years of age at the time of the injury, and the vast majority of children were at least 4 years of age. Children were 8 to 13 years old at the time of participation. The TBI group was restricted to children with complicated mild to severe TBI. Severe TBI was classified based on a lowest post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8 or less, and moderate TBI was classified based on a GCS score from 9 to 12. Complicated mild TBI was classified based on a GCS score of 13 to 15 in association with trauma-related abnormalities on neuroimaging at the time of hospitalization; children with GCS scores of 13 to 15 without neuroimaging abnormalities were not eligible.\nThe OI group consisted of children who sustained fractures without loss of consciousness or other indications of brain injury (e.g., facial fracture). For the current study, children were grouped into those with severe TBI (STBI), those with complicated mild to moderate TBI (MTBI), and those with OI.\nThe following exclusion criteria were applied to all participants: (a) history of more than one injury necessitating hospitalization; (b) premorbid neurological disorder or mental retardation; (c) injury from child abuse or assault; (d) history of severe psychiatric disorder necessitating hospitalization before the injury; (e) sensory or motor impairment that prevented valid administration of the measures included in the study; (f) primary language other than English; (g) full-time placement in a special education classroom; and (h) medical contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging.\nParticipants were recruited at children's hospitals at three metropolitan sites: Toronto, Canada, Columbus, Ohio, and Cleveland, Ohio. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Boards at participating institutions. Children and their parents were invited to participate only after parents gave informed consent. The study used a cross-sectional design with two study visits. Some parent ratings of social adjustment were initially obtained at the second study visit, but they were subsequently elicited during the first visit to reduce missing data.\nOf those eligible for recruitment and approached about the study, 82 (47%) of those with TBI and 61 (26%) of those with OI agreed to enroll. Despite significant differences in participation rate between groups, participants and nonparticipants did not differ in terms of age at injury or age at study contact, sex, race, or socioeconomic status (SES) based on census tract median family income. Among children with TBI, participants and nonparticipants did not differ on measures of injury severity.\nInclusion in the current article was limited to participants for whom at least one measure of social adjustment (i.e., Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-Second Edition [ABAS-II] or Behavior Assessment System for Children-Second Edition [BASC-2]; see below) was available. Of the 143 participants in the overall study, 19 children with STBI, 41 children with MTBI, and 57 children with OI met this requirement, for a total sample of 117 (81.8% of the total sample). No differences were found between those included versus those excluded from analyses in terms of age at injury or age at study participation, sex, SES (measured using a standardized composite based on parental education, parent occupational status, and census tract median family income), mechanism of injury, maternal education, or maternal marital status.\nChildren with TBI were more likely to be excluded than children with OI (24.4% vs. 6.6%). This is partly because children with TBI were recruited earlier than those with OI, when measures of social adjustment were collected at the second study visit rather than the first, and also because children with TBI had more difficulty arranging for a friend to accompany them to the second visit. Race was also related to exclusion, with white children less likely to be excluded than black children or children from a multiracial background (11.9% vs. 41.7% and 57.1%, respectively).\nDemographic characteristics of the three groups are presented in\nTable 1\n. The groups did not differ in terms of sex, race, age at injury, or age at study participation. The groups differed significantly in terms of SES. The groups also differed in distribution of mechanism of injury, with motor vehicle accidents being most common among the children with STBI and sports/recreational injuries being most common among children with OI. Group differences in SES were not significant when injury mechanism was taken into account, consistent with epidemiological studies showing that the risk of TBI, particularly those linked to motor vehicles, is highest for children of lower SES and minority status.\n13\u201315\nFor that reason, we did not treat SES as a covariate in data analyses, because the SES differences appeared to be intrinsic to the injury groups.\n16\nTable\n1.\nGroup Demographics and Injury Characteristics\n*\nSTBI (\nn\n=19)\nMTBI (\nn\n=41)\nOI (\nn\n=57)\nF/X\n2\np\n\u03b7\n2\n/V\nChild age at testing\n10.12 (1.54)\n10.75 (1.47)\n10.64 (1.69)\n1.05\n0.35\n0.02\nChild age at injury\n7.46 (2.19)\n8.29 (1.91)\n7.79 (1.80)\n1.45\n0.24\n0.03\nChild sex\n11 boys (58%)\n26 boys (63%)\n34 boys (60%)\n0.22\n0.90\n0.04\nChild race\n88% White\n93% white\n91% white\n1.80\n0.77\n0.09\nSES\na\n\u22120.66 (0.51)\n\u22120.08 (0.90)\n0.29 (0.99)\n8.37\n<0.01\n0.13\nInjury mechanism\n29.67\n<0.01\n0.36\nMVA\n52.6%\n26.8%\n1.8%\nSports/Rec\n26.3%\n41.5%\n71.9%\nFall\n21.1%\n31.7%\n26.3%\nOpen in a separate window\na\nMeasured using a standardized composite based on parental education, parent occupational status, and census tract median family income\n*\nValues in parentheses indicate standard deviation.\nSTBI, severe traumatic brain injury; MTBI, mild to moderate traumatic brain injury; OI, orthopedic injury; SES, socioeconomic status; MVA, motor vehicle accident.\n\nMeasures\nExecutive functions\nExecutive functions were assessed using two Processing Speed Index subtests (i.e., Cancellation, Symbol Search) from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV), and selected subtests from the Test of Everyday Attention for Children (TEA-Ch).\n17\n,\n18\nThe WISC-IV Processing Speed Index provided a measure of response speed and focused attention that is known to be sensitive to childhood TBI.\n19\nThree subtests of the TEA-Ch were administered. The Walk/Don't Walk subtest was used to assess inhibitory control, and requires a child to mark footprints on a path for a \u201cgo\u201d tone and inhibit marking for a \u201cstop\u201d tone. The Code Transmission subtest assesses working memory and requires a child to listen to a series of single-digit numbers and recall the digit presented immediately before two consecutive 5s. The Creature Counting subtest was administered to assess cognitive flexibility and requires a child to count creatures with one-to-one correspondence, but to use up and down arrows as cues to count forward or backward. The TEA-Ch has been shown to be sensitive to childhood TBI.\n20\n,\n21\nTheory of mind\nChildren were administered three measures assessing different aspects of theory of mind.\n10\nThe first measure assessed cognitive theory of mind, which is the original mindreading sense of theory of mind, as reflected in understanding of false beliefs. In the Jack and Jill task, children were shown sequences of three cartoon frames on a computer screen.\n22\nEach frame included a character (Jack and/or Jill), two hats (red and blue), and a ball. Frame A of the sequence showed Jack placing the ball in a hat, an event witnessed by Jill. In Frame B, Jack either dropped the ball further down into the hat, or switched the ball to the second hat. This event was sometimes witnessed, and sometimes not witnessed, by Jill. Frame C showed Jill \u201cthinking\u201d about either the red or blue hat. Children responded \u201cyes\u201d if Frame C represented what was now in Jill's mind about the ball's location, and they responded \u201cno\u201d if it did not. The task measured cognitive theory of mind by presenting switched, unwitnessed trials that measured false belief, as compared with a series of switched, witnessed trials that measured true belief. The percent accuracy for switched, unwitnessed trials was the primary measure of cognitive theory of mind.\nThe Emotional and Emotive Faces Task (EFFT) was used to assess affective theory of mind, or the child's understanding of the distinction between felt versus displayed emotion.\n23\nIt evaluated children's appreciation of the distinction between emotional expression (how a character actually feels) and emotive communication (the emotion a character expresses socially, which may be different from the felt emotion). Children listened to short narratives that described a character in situations that were meant to evoke one of five basic emotions: happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, and anger. In each situation, a discrepancy existed between the emotion felt \u201cinside\u201d and the character's facial expression. Children were asked in all trials how the character felt inside and how the character looked on his/her face. The percent accuracy for emotive communication trials (i.e., \u201con his/her face\u201d) was the primary measure of affective theory of mind.\nThe Ironic Criticism and Empathic Praise task was used to assess conative theory of mind, which refers to forms of social communication in which we try to influence the mental and emotional state of others.\n24\nIn this task, children were presented with six pictured situations involving two children, one of whom was engaged in an activity and another who commented on their performance of the activity. The pictures were accompanied by a narrative and an audiotape of the speaker's utterances with neutral, ironic, or empathic intonation. Children were told the goal of the child engaged in the activity (e.g., to build a tower), the outcome (e.g., \u201cthe tower was\u2026\u201d), the speaker's character (e.g., \u201cshe liked to cheer people up\u201d), and what the speaker said (e.g., \u201cYou made a great tower\u201d). Children were asked two factual questions, two belief questions, and two intent questions. The percent accuracy for indirect speech acts, which reflected the understanding of belief and intent for empathic praise and ironic criticism conditions, was the primary measure of conative theory of mind.\nSocial adjustment\nParents rated their child's emotional and behavioral adjustment using the BASC-2.\n25\nThe BASC-2 assesses both adaptive and problem behaviors, which are rated on a four-point scale from \u201cnever\u201d to \u201calmost always.\u201d For the present study, the BASC-2 Social Skills subscale and the overall Behavioral Symptom Index were used as measures of social adjustment.\nParents also rated their child's social functioning using the ABAS-II.\n26\nThe ABAS-II is a parent report measure of behavioral skills that are important in coping with the demands of daily life across multiple settings (e.g., home, school, community). The measure is normed for young children through adults and consists of ratings of behaviors on a scale from \u201cis not able\u201d to perform a given action to performs the action \u201calways or almost always when needed.\u201d For the purposes of the current study, social adjustment was assessed using the Social, Self-Direction, and Communication subscales, which are those that most directly assess social functioning.\n\nData reduction and analysis\nPooled within-group correlations were computed to examine the associations among the measures of executive function and theory of mind (\nTable 2\n). In general, the measures of executive function were significantly correlated with one another, as were the measures of theory of mind. Exploratory factor analysis was also largely consistent with these groupings. Therefore, individual scores on subtests comprising each domain were transformed to the same metric (i.e., % correct for theory of mind tasks; standard scores for executive function tasks), and composite scores were generated for each participant by averaging performance across tasks within domains. This yielded overall indicators of executive function and theory of mind for use in subsequent analyses.\nTable\n2.\nPooled within-group Correlations among Individual Measures of Executive Function and Theory of Mind\nMeasure\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\nExecutive Function:\n1.

We then examined multiple mediator models using ordinary least squares path analysis to determine the relative contributions to social adjustment accounted for by group, executive function, and theory of mind.\n27\nThis analytic strategy was selected because it allows for the simultaneous inclusion of multiple mediators, but reports individual effects for each mediator while controlling for others. Further, this approach allows for the inclusion of covariates, as well as the use of categorical predictors.\nThe procedure yields unstandardized path coefficients (betas) for each individual path of the model. Unstandardized path coefficients are scaled according to the measurement of variables included in each path of the model and are preferable over standardized coefficients in this type of modeling, particularly when independent variables are categorical.\n28\nThe procedure yields tests of direct, indirect, and total effects (i.e., combined direct and indirect effects) within each model. Indirect effects are examined using 95% bias-corrected confidence intervals based on 10,000 bootstrap samples; if the intervals for a specific effect do not contain zero, the effect is considered significant.\nWe computed models for each measure of social adjustment. In each model, group was first entered as an independent variable, coded as two dichotomous dummy variables (STBI vs. OI; MTBI vs. OI), and the executive function and theory of mind composites were entered simultaneously as mediators of the group effects on social adjustment. Age at testing was added as a covariate in each model given the significant correlation between age at testing and the theory of mind composite (\nr\n=0.59,\np\n<0.001). In the presentation of results, the direct effects of each included variable are presented in\nFigures 1 a\u2013e\n.

    "Methods": "Participants\nThe current study included both cross-sectional and longitudinal components. Cross-sectional analyses included 23 individuals with moderate-to-severe TBI and 18 HCs. One individual's data in the clinical group were discarded because of excessive head motion to yield a final cross-sectional sample of 22 participants with TBI (ages 19\u201369; x = 34.05; standard deviation [SD]=15.04) and 18 HCs (ages 19\u201361; x = 29.83; SD=12.57). The groups did not differ significantly in age or years of education. TBI severity was defined using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)\n38\nobtained on admission to the trauma unit. Individuals with either a GCS score less than 13, loss of consciousness for 30\u2009min or more, or with positive neuropathological findings upon structural neuroimaging were eligible for participation. Individuals with chronic TBI sustained their injury a median of 2 years before scanning. The goal of examining this chronic sample was to first establish the connectivity effects observable in chronic-phase TBI in rs-fMRI data. In order to gain insight into the evolution of these effects, we also studied a subset of the chronic sample (\nn\n=13), where data were available at approximately 3 months after the resolution of post-traumatic amnesia, herein referred to as the subacute stage. There was no temporal overlap in latest subacute and earliest chronic scans acquired. Demographic and clinical characteristics of all participant groups are found in\nTable 1A,B\n.

Individuals were also excluded if they had a history of inpatient treatment for substance abuse. These exclusions were assessed by medical chart review, covered in the institutional review board\u2013approved consent form, and communicated to the study participant and/or family member(s) of each participant before enrollment.\n\nNeuropsychological testing\nParticipants in the longitudinal arm of the study were administered a neuropsychological test battery to assess cognitive functioning at both time points. Testing was targeted toward the domains of attention and working memory, given that these are the most commonly encountered types of deficits after TBI. To standardize all measures on the same normative group,\nz\n-scores were created for each participant using the mean and SD of test results from 12 normal-performing HC participants. Cognitive and connectivity measures were included in post-hoc exploratory analyses to investigate potential brain-behavior relationships. To avoid individually correlating multiple test scores without\na priori\nhypotheses, an attentional composite score was constructed for each individual by summing\nz\n-scores of tests sensitive to TBI. Comprising this composite score were the Trail Making Test\u2013Part A,\n39\nWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III Digit Span,\n40\nand the Visual Search and Attention Test (VSAT).\n41\nComposite scores for each participant were used in regression analyses with connectivity results.\n\nScan protocol and preprocessing\nAll included participants underwent MRI and fMRI scanning and completed multiple runs of working memory tasks. After completion of these tasks, they were instructed to stare at a fixation cross and stay as motionless as possible during a 5- to 6-min rs-fMRI scan. For the purposes of the current article, we discuss data analyses on the rs-fMRI time series.\nImaging data were acquired for each participant using either a Philips (Ph) 3T system and a six-channel SENSE head coil (Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) or a Siemens (Si) 3T Magnetom Trio (Siemens, New York, NY).\n*\nData collection was parameterized to maximize consistency between magnets. Three-dimensional (3D) high-resolution T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE) image sequences were optimized across scanners and acquired for each participant to provide high-resolution underlays for functional brain activation. Echo planar imaging (EPI) was used for resting-state functional imaging. EPI sequences were acquired with a 2000 ms repetition time, 30(Si) or 34(Ph) ms echo time, 90-degree flip angle, 230\u00d7230(Si) or 240\u00d7240(Ph) mm\n2\nfield of view, 80\u00d780 acquisition matrix, and 34 or 35 axial slices (4 mm thick) with no gap between slices. Between 150 and 180 functional volumes were collected for each participant.\nPreprocessing of fMRI data was performed using SPM8 software (\nhttp://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm8\n). To control for initial signal instability, the first five volumes (10\u2009sec) were removed from analyses for all participants. The following 145 volumes were subject to analyses; participants with sequences beyond 150 volumes had these extra volumes excluded from analyses. Preprocessing steps included realignment of functional volumes to the first functional image of the series by affine transformation.\n42\n,\n43\nEach participant's functional images were then coregistered to their respective T1 MPRAGE, and all data were normalized using a standardized T1 template from the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) using a 12-parameter affine approach and trilinear interpolation. Normalized time-series data were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 6\u00d76\u00d78\u2009mm\n3\nto minimize anatomical differences and increase signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nRegion of interest (\u201cseed\u201d) determination\nBased upon a literature article examining network connectivity after moderate and severe TBI, we focused analyses on connectivity of the PCC, left hippocampus, and right hippocampus. To do so, we selected seed regions of interest (ROIs) within the CONN Toolbox.\n44\nFor the PCC, we selected a well-established spherical ROI (\u20136, \u201352, 40; 10 mm radius) frequently used in DMN investigations. This ROI was originally identified in the seminal article by Fox and colleagues\n4\nand derived from a previous meta-analysis of deactivated regions during passive versus active tasks.\n45\nIn contrast, the hippocampus has more recently been implicated in the DMN, and a reliable functional ROI has not yet been established for this region. Therefore, hippocampal seeds were defined as analogous anatomical regions in each hemisphere and extracted as ROI masks from the widely used Automatic Anatomic Labeling atlas,\n46\nalso available in CONN. This approach to hippocampal seeding has been employed previously in resting-state studies of neurodegenerative disease.\n47\n,\n48\n\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging data analyses\nPreparation and extraction of seed time series for functional connectivity analyses were performed using the CONN Toolbox. This toolbox employs the aCompCor technique for noise correction,\n49\na method that avoids the spurious introduction or magnification of negative correlations between voxels associated with global mean signal regression.\n50\nThe toolbox performed segmentation of individual structural volumes into gray matter, white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) maps. WM and CSF maps along with six motion regressors obtained from data preprocessing in SPM were entered as confounds in accordance with aCompCor procedures. A temporal bandpass filter of 0.008 to 0.09\u2009Hz was applied to isolate the frequency window of interest.\nFirst- and second-level connectivity analyses followed similar processing streams in the cross-sectional and longitudinal arms of the study. For both seeds and in each individual, using CONN, bivariate correlations (Pearson's\nr\n) were computed between the average blood-oxygen-level\u2013dependent value in the seed (i.e., across all voxels in the seed) and every other voxel in the brain as measures of functional connectivity. Correlation values were Fisher (\nz\n)-transformed to normalize their distribution and to facilitate later analyses with neuropsychological variables.\nAnalyses of group differences in positive and negative connectivity profiles were carried out in a two-step procedure, with correction for multiple comparisons at both levels. For simplicity, we discuss here the analytic stream for positive connectivity, while noting that an identical procedure was followed for investigating negative connectivity. In each group (or time point) of interest, we first identified regions showing significant positive connectivity to a specified seed by constructing a seed-voxel connectivity map corrected for the family-wise error (FWE) rate at\np\n<0.05. This was achieved using an individual voxel threshold of\np\n<0.005 and a corresponding cluster size threshold determined by Monte Carlo simulations in the 3DClustSim program of AFNI (\nhttp://afni.nimh.nih.gov\n).\n51\u201355\nResearch has shown that this threshold provides optimal balance between type I and II errors.\n56\nSimulations were conducted on explicit whole-brain masks with 10,000 iterations and a Gaussian filter width of 10\u00d710\u00d712 to account for intrinsic smoothness of the data.\nIn the second step, positive connectivity maps from the two groups were added together using the ImCalc function in SPM to create a combined sample-wide positive connectivity map. This map was used as an inclusive mask in subsequent\nt\n-tests for group differences, again at a corrected threshold of\np\n<0.05 (using an uncorrected voxel threshold of\np\n<0.01 and a cluster size determined by simulations on the mask). Thus, second-level comparisons were restricted to functional connections that were significant for at least one group. This approach is based on previous studies using similar thresholds and masking techniques together in connectivity analyses\n57\u201360\nand has two important advantages. First, it permits differences in positive and negative connectivity to be examined separately, which was a major goal of this study. Second, it ensures that observed group differences are meaningful in that they reflect effects that are also of primary significance within groups.\nTo explore whether functional connectivity is related to cognition, we regressed positive and negative Fisher-transformed correlation values of our three seeds on attentional composite scores within each time point of the longitudinal analysis. We also investigated whether connectivity in the subacute stage is associated with behavior in the chronic stage. Positive and negative connectivity masks obtained above for each time point of interest were used to restrict connectivity-behavior correlations to areas showing significant seed-voxel connectivity at that time point. For all regressions, we implemented a FWE-corrected threshold of\np\n<0.05 using a voxel threshold of\np\n<0.01 and a corresponding cluster threshold determined by simulations on these masks.\nAnatomical locations of clusters were identified using the xjView toolbox (\nhttp://www.alivelearn.net/xjview\n) in SPM. Connectivity results were visualized in MRIcron (\nhttp://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/mricro/mricron/index.html\n), and these images are presented herein."

    "Methods": "Animal care\nAdult female Wistar rats (250\u2013300\u2009g) for this study were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). All animal care procedures were designed in accord with the\nGuide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals\nestablished by the Canadian Council of Animal Care and were approved by the University Health Network Animal Care Committee.\n\nClip-compression spinal cord injury\nThis study made use of the aneurysm clip-compression model of SCI that has been extensively characterized in our laboratory. Animals were anesthetized using inhalant isoflurane (1\u20132%) delivered in a 1:1 mixture of O\n2\n/N\n2\nO. The surgical area was prepared by shaving and disinfection using isopropanol. A mid-line skin incision was made in the cervical area (C5\u2013T2), and the three muscle layers overlaying the vertebrae were individually retracted. Animals received a C6\u2013C7 laminectomy in preparation for 18-g clip-compression injury (Walsh, Oakville, Ontario, Canada) at the C6 spinal level lasting 1\u2009min. A small square of Surgifoam\n\u00ae\n(Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) was placed over the injury site, and the overlaying muscle and skin was sutured. Postoperatively, animals were treated with analgesics, anti-inflammatories, and saline (0.9%; 5\u2009mL) to prevent dehydration. Animals were housed individually in standard rat cages with absorbent bedding at a temperature of 27\u00b0C for recovery. Injured animals had their bladders manually expressed three times daily until natural bladder function returned.\n\nNeurobehavioral testing\nBasso, Beattie, and Bresnahan open-field locomotion score\nThe general locomotor ability of animals was assessed using the BBB Locomotor Rating Scale. For this measure, rats are placed individually in an open field where locomotion can be assessed by two observers. Hindlimb locomotor function is scored using a 22-point (0\u201321) scale that evaluates parameters including joint movement, stepping ability, coordination, and trunk stability. Animals displaying normal locomotion receive a score of 21. Animals were scored once per week by two independent observers.\n\nInclined plane test\nAnimals are placed individually on a 28\u00d730\u2009cm board covered with a grooved rubber surface, and their ability to maintain body position is observed as the board is incrementally raised to increasing angles. The angle of incline is continually increased toward a vertical position until the animal can no longer maintain stability. A score is assigned by recording the greatest angle of incline at which the animal can maintain a stable body position for 5\u2009sec. Animals were scored once per week.\n\nHand grip strength test\nThis test is used to assess forelimb motor function based on the ability of the animal to exert a pulling force on a metal grid attached to an electronic grip strength meter (SDI Grip Strength System, model DFM-10; San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA). Animals were tested once per week, and each trial consisted of five separate pulls. The highest and lowest forces were omitted and the remaining three were averaged.\n\nAutomated gait analysis (CatWalk)\nGait analysis was carried out using the CatWalk system (Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, The Netherlands).\n13\nBriefly, as animals traverse a horizontal glass plate, their footfalls are recorded by a video camera positioned beneath the walkway. Data files were collected and analyzed using version 7.1 of the CatWalk software. For analysis, crossing speed was standardized, and one uninterrupted crossing of the walkway was required. Individual paw prints were labeled by one observer blinded to the groups. Recordings were taken at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks postinjury. We selected the following parameters for analysis: stride length, print area, print width, print length, swing speed, maximum area of contact, and intensity. For all parameters, data analysis was performed with a threshold value of 25. Paw intensity was measured in arbitrary units (with a possible range of 0\u2013250).\n\nTissue processing\nAfter an overdose of isoflurane, animals were transcardially perfused using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Spinal cords were removed, placed in 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C and transferred to 30% sucrose the next day. A 2\u2009cm portion of the cervical spinal cord centred on the injury was embedded on dry ice using tissue-embedding medium (Shandon M-1; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Tissue sections were cut at a thickness of 30\u2009\u03bcM using a cryostat and mounted on charged glass slides.\n\nQuantitative lesion analysis\nThe cervical enlargement was serially sectioned, in a transverse plane, at intervals of 30\u2009\u03bcM. The cellular stain hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) was used in combination with the myelin-specific stain, Luxol fast blue (LFB), to distinguish between gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), lesional tissue, and cavity. A total of 3.6\u2009mm of cord was sampled every 360\u2009\u03bcM. Volume measurements were obtained for individual tissue sections using the Cavalieri method of Stereo Investigator software (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT). The percentage of preserved WM and GM, lesional tissue, and cavity was determined by dividing the volume of GM, WM, and lesional or cavity by the total volume of the cord.\n\nThree-dimensional reconstruction of the spinal cord\nThree-dimensional (3D) reconstructions were completed using Neurolucida software (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT). Reconstructions were generated based on contours for the total cord (green), GM (yellow), lesional tissue (pink), and cavity (blue). Contours were traced using LFB-H&E-stained spinal cord sections. Reconstructions were based on data from three histological sections (30\u2009\u03bcM thick) separated by an interval of 360\u2009\u03bcM and thus represent a 1-mm section of the cord.\n\nIn vivo\nelectrophysiology\nForelimb sensory-evoked potentials\nForelimb SEPs were recorded from na\u00efve rats and C6-injured rats at 8 weeks post-injury. Recordings were carried out under isoflurane anesthesia with the animals positioned in a stereotactic holder in a prone position. The ligamentum flavum was removed between C1 and C2 to allow for two pairs of 1.0-mm ball electrodes to be placed extradurally over the spinal cord. The forepaw was stimulated by two stainless-steel needle electrodes using a constant current 0.1\u2009ms in duration and 2.0\u2009mA in intensity applied at a rate of 5.7\u2009Hz. A total of 2000 SEPs were averaged and replicated at a bandwidth of 10\u20133000\u2009Hz. SEP peak latency was measured from the initiation of stimulus (S) to the peak of the first negative peak (N1). Amplitudes were calculated as the voltage difference from the peak of the first positive peak (P1) to the peak of the first negative peak (N1).\nHoffman reflex recording\nAs with SEPs, H-reflex data were obtained from na\u00efve rats and C6-injured rats 8 weeks postinjury. Under isoflurane anesthesia, recording electrodes were positioned 2\u2009cm apart in the mid-calf region and the posterior tibial nerve was stimulated in the popliteal fossa using a 0.1-ms duration square wave pulse at a frequency of 1\u2009Hz. The recordings were filtered between 10 and 10,000\u2009Hz. H-reflex is a representation of two electromyography (EMG) responses\u2014an early M wave and later H wave. The M response is elicited by direct activation of motor axons, thus bypassing spinal circuits. The H wave is an EMG response of the plantar muscle that results from synaptic activation of motor neurons by muscle afferents. H-reflex data are represented as H\nmax\n/M\nmax\n; this ratio is calculated based on threshold for both the M and H waves.\nMagnetic resonance imaging\nMRI studies were performed using a 7-T Biospec 70/30 USR (Bruker Corporation, Ettlingen, DE), equipped with a B-GA12 gradient coil insert and 7.2-cm inner diameter radiofrequency (RF) volume coil. Rats were oriented in prone position, ventral side down, on a custom slider bed, with isoflurane delivered at 1.8% to a nose cone. A respiratory trace was provided using a pneumatic pillow and the SA II physiologic monitoring system (Small Animal Instruments, Inc., Stony Brook, NY). Magnetic resonance scanning consisted of respiratory-gated multi-parametric scanning in a sagittal plane, which bisected the length of the cord, with shared geometric features between acquisitions (0.2\u00d70.2\u2009mm in-plane resolution over a 40\u00d740\u2009mm field of view, 1-mm slice thickness). Acquisitions consisted of a T2-weighted rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement T2-weighted image set (echo time [TE] 80\u2009ms; repetition time [TR] matched to respiratory rate; 18 average, 5\u2009min 24\u2009sec at 40 breaths per minute), T2 mapping (64 evenly spaced TEs between 12 and 768\u2009ms; successive repetitions triggered by first breath beyond 8\u2009sec, two averages; 40+-min scan time), and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) mapping by sequential two-dimensional fast low-angle shot acquisitions with and without MT contrast (4.9-ms TE, 39.9-ms TR, 30-degree flip angle, 40 averages, 5\u2009min 20\u2009sec per image). MT contrast was generated using a 27-ms Gaussian-shaped RF pulse applied at 3 kHz off-resonance with 10-\u03bcT peak RF amplitude.\nT2 and MTR map processing used custom MATLAB scripts (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA). Regions of interest (ROIs) characteristic of core and peripheral regions of injury as well as remote cord were drawn manually using MIPAV software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), considering contrast patterns in all three acquisitions by visualization of ROI copied across image sets. Mean and standard deviations of T2 and MTR were calculated using MIPAV histogram analysis functionality.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analysis was performed using SigmaStat software (SSPS, Inc., Chicago, IL). All data are represented as the mean\u00b1standard error of the mean. After one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and two-way ANOVA, Tukey's post-hoc testing was applied.\np\n<0.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "Osmotic transport device\nThe specifics of the OTD (\nFig. 1\n) are similar to those of the HFHD (described elsewhere).\n16\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSchematic of direct osmotherapy by an osmotic transport device (OTD). After craniectomy and opening of the dura, the OTD is placed with a hydratable material onto the exposed brain surface. Flexible hollow fibers are placed to maximize the surface area treated. An aqueous solution containing an impermeable osmotic agent is pumped across the injured surface area through the semipermeable hollow fiber membrane lumen. The hollow fiber membrane is selected such that it rejects the osmotic agent, but allows easy passage of ions and water. The lumen solution induces an osmotic pressure driving force for water removal. The rate of pumping is controlled to allow fluid from the tissue to flow up to the membrane device as a result of the chemical potential gradient of water. A hydratable material with significantly large permeability is used to maintain membrane-tissue contact and to cover the entirety of the exposed brain tissue. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nBriefly, the OTD consists of hollow fibers embedded in a moldable hydratable material, such as a hydrogel or dura substitute material. The hydratable material is in direct contact with, and conforms to, the exposed injured tissue, following a craniectomy, to maximize the treatment area. A lumen solution is flowed through the hollow fibers at a flow rate so that the Reynolds number is between 50 and 100. The lumen solution consists of an osmotic agent, such as proteins or polymers, in an aqueous salt solution. The osmotic agent is chosen for its ability to: 1) induce osmotic pressure greater than the transmembrane pressure of the hollow fiber; 2) allow for a range of osmotic pressures to be achieved by varying its concentration; and 3) be impermeable to the hollow fiber pores.\nIn this study, the lumen solution was 350\u2009g/L of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; pH 7.4). BSA was the chosen osmotic agent because its concentration-dependent osmotic pressure range is well known\n17\n,\n18\nand its concentration-dependent viscosity is manageable.\n19\nThe BSA is also impermeable to the hollow fibers used (regenerated cellulose, 13\u2009kDa molecular weight cutoff [MWCO], 132294; Spectra/Por\n\u00ae\n; Spectrum Laboratories, Los Angeles, CA). aCSF, chosen in order to aid in ion balance, was prepared as previously described.\n20\nThe hydratable material used was an agar hydrogel (0.3% agar in aCSF). The treatment area of the cerebral cortex was 13.9\u00b10.5\u2009mm\n2\n(mean\u00b1standard error of the mean [SEM]).\n\nAnimals\nAll experiments were conducted under protocols (A-2010-0018) approved by the University of California Riverside Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Adult female CD-1 mice were used in all experiments.\nThe six experimental groups were: 1) no injury (control); 2) no treatment (TBI only); 3) TBI plus treatment with a craniectomy only; 4) TBI plus treatment with a craniectomy and a hydrogel placed on the exposed tissue; 5) TBI plus treatment using an OTD without BSA (only aCSF, no osmotic agent); and 6) TBI plus direct osmotherapy by an OTD.\n\nSurgical technique and controlled cortical impact model\nBefore induction of cerebral edema by controlled cortical impact (CCI), animals were anesthetized with an 80-mg/kg ketamine, 10-mg/kg xylazine mixture (0.09% of body weight). After determining an adequate plane of anesthesia through the loss of paw pinch reflex, surgical procedures began. Reflex activity was monitored continuously throughout the entire study and supplemental doses of half of the initial dose were administered as needed.\nAnesthetized animals were placed into a standard rodent stereotactic frame. A mid-line skin incision was made and reflected. A right-sided craniectomy was performed (anterior border: coronal suture; posterior border: lambdoid suture; medial border: mid-line; lateral border: temporalis attachment).\nsTBI was induced by CCI. A 3-mm impactor tip was discharged at a 20-degree angle with a velocity of 5.0\u2009m/s with a 200-ms dwell time and an impact depth of 1.0\u2009mm. After TBI was induced, the skull was replaced for 3\u2009h to allow for the formation of edema. Cyanoacrylate gel (Plastics One, Roanake, VA) was used to adhere the bone flap to the skull, closing the craniectomy. For the TBI-only group, the skull remained for an additional 2\u2009h (total of 5\u2009h).\nAfter the formation of edema (3\u2009h), treatment began and lasted for 2\u2009h. For all treatment groups, the bone flap was removed after 3\u2009h and the dura was carefully and atraumatically opened with microdissection. After dura removal, treatment began and was either a craniectomy only, a craniectomy with a hydrogel, an OTD without BSA, or an OTD.\nReduction of cerebral edema was determined by analyzing brain water content. After the treatment procedure, brains were dissected out postmortem, separated into four pieces (right-left cerebral hemispheres and right-left cerebellum pieces), and subjected to wet-dry weight comparisons to determine percent water content, as previously described.\n21\n,\n22\nIntergroup comparisons of brain tissue water content were done using one-way analysis of variance and post-hoc Bonferroni's tests. Brain tissue water content is presented as mean\u00b1SEM. During the monitoring period, animals that expired were not used for brain water content data analysis."

    "Methods": "Animals\nTen-week-old C57Bl/6 female mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were housed in a pathogen-free barrier facility and maintained on a 12-h dark/light cycle with food and water provided\nad libitum\n. Sentinels were housed in the same room and periodically checked for pathogens. All animal protocols were approved by the New Jersey Medical School Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nSpinal cord contusion injury\nBoth injured and uninjured mice were used for the current study. Mice were handled for 1 week for acclimatization before surgery and behavioral testing. Mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (80\u2009mg/kg; Vedco, St. Joseph, MO) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg; Akorn Inc., Decatur, IL), administered intraperitoneally. Using aseptic approaches, a midline posterior incision was used to expose the dorsal elements of the T7\u2013T9 vertebrae. A laminectomy was performed at the eighth thoracic vertebral level (T8), and a severe contusion injury (70 kdyne force) was induced using the Infinite Horizon Impactor device (Precision Systems & Instrumentation, Lexington, KY). A layered closure with sutures and wound clips completed the surgical procedure.\nAfter surgery, the mice were group-housed in cages with Aspen shavings, and the cages were placed on a water-jacketed heating pad at 37\u00b0C. For postoperative care, mice received subcutaneous injections of lactated Ringer solution (Baxter, Deerfield, IL), physiologic saline (Baxter, Deerfield, IL), Baytril (0.05\u2009mL; Bayer, Kansas City, KS), and buprenorphine (0.02\u2009mL; Hospira, Lake Forest, IL). Antibiotics, analgesics, and 2\u2009mL lactated Ringer solution were administered immediately postoperatively. Additional antibiotics, analgesics, and 1\u2009mL saline were administered twice a day for 7 days. Mice were observed daily for signs of infection and to ensure appropriate wound healing.\n\nIntrathecal delivery of TLR9 ligands by lumbar puncture\nThe antagonist CpG ODN 2088 was purchased from InvivoGen (San Diego, CA) and suspended in vehicle (endotoxin-free distilled water), aliquoted, and conserved at \u221220\u00b0C until use. Mice were assessed for locomotor recovery using the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS)\n22\non day 1 post-injury (PI) to confirm equivalent and proper injury severity, and were randomly divided into treatment groups. Intrathecal delivery of ligands and vehicle began 24 after injury, and was repeated every 48\u2009h thereafter for the duration of the study.\nThe mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (1.0 L/min at a concentration of 3.0% in oxygen). A 27-gauge needle attached to a Hamilton syringe was inserted percutaneously into the interlaminar space between L5 and L6. On successful entry into the intrathecal space, CpG ODN 2088 (150\u2009ng/g body weight; InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) or vehicle was injected in a total volume of 3\u2009\u03bcL. The needle was maintained in place for 30\u2009sec before it was slowly removed to prevent egress of the injectate. Animals were allowed to recover in their home cages.\n\nEvaluation of bladder function\nThe assessment of bladder function by measuring the weight of manually voided urine during daily bladder expression has been previously documented in the literature.\n23\u201325\nBecause this approach was used primarily in injured rats, it was modified for mice because it is best for mice that have sustained a SCI to have their bladders expressed when prone, and also because the volume of urine that is expressed in uninjured mice is often too small to capture without significant error.\nBladders of all mice were expressed every 12\u2009h after the surgical procedure for the duration of the study. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (1.0 L/min at a concentration of 3.0% in oxygen) and weighed on an analytic balance before and after the bladder was expressed. The weight of urine voided was determined by calculating the difference in the two weights. After bladder assessment, the mice were returned to their home cages.\nTo determine fluid intake, a cohort of uninjured and SCI mice were singly housed and treated as described above. The volume of water in the bottles was measured at 48-h intervals.\nThe urinary retention data are pooled from several iterations of this experiment, in which all three experimental groups were represented.\n\nUrinalysis\nExpressed urine underwent urinalysis once every 7 days. Urine was applied to Multistix\u00ae 10SG urinalysis strips (Siemens, Tarrytown, NY) and, following the prescribed amount of time (30\u2013120\u2009sec), strips were scored according to the manufacturer's instructions. Levels of ketones, bilirubin, protein, nitrites, leukocytes, and pH were determined by matching the color on the test strip with the reference material. Each biomarker had an ordinal scale assigned to each of the possible colors, with 2 to 6 possible levels, depending on the biomarker. A score of 1 corresponds with a negative reading for all biomarkers, with increasing numbers corresponding to increasing signal strength.\n\nImmunohistochemistry and assessment of lesion volume and tissue sparing\nMice were sacrificed by sodium pentobarbital (1.95\u2009mg/g) anesthesia followed by transcardial perfusion with saline and 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4). Spinal cords, bladders, and kidneys were dissected, post-fixed overnight, cryoprotected in 27% sucrose, embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound, frozen in a dry ice-ethanol slurry, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. In the case of bladders, the inside of the bladder was also filled with OCT before embedding.\nTwo methods were used to determine the spinal cord lesion volume. In both cases, 30\u2009\u03bcm thick transverse sections, obtained at 150\u2009\u03bcm intervals and spanning the rostro-caudal length of the lesion, were used. In the first, sections were labeled with rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody (1:1000; Dako). The signal was visualized using goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 antibody (1:400; Invitrogen). The lesion was defined as the GFAP-negative area of the section that was bordered by the GFAP immunopositive astroglial scar.\n26\nImages were captured on either a Leica DM5500B microscope using Leica Application Suite 4.2 software or a Zeiss Axio Imager M2 using Axio Vision 4.8.2 software.\nThe lesion area was outlined and measured using NIH ImageJ analysis software.\n27\nThe lesion area for each section was then multiplied by the distance between sections (150\u2009\u03bcm) to determine the lesion volume for that section. The overall lesion volume was calculated by summing each of these section volumes. The individual section with the greatest amount of GFAP-negative area was defined as the lesion epicenter.\nFor the second estimate of lesion volume, sections adjacent to those stained for GFAP were stained for Luxol fast blue and counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin (LFB-H&E).\n28\u201330\nIn these sections, the lesion is defined as any area of aberrant histopathology, notably recognized by degenerating white matter or eosinophilic (degenerating) neurons.\n31\nThe images were captured and volume calculated as above.\nFor the quantification of white and gray matter sparing in the spinal cord, sections adjacent to those used for the measurement of lesion volume, and spanning the rostro-caudal length of the lesion, were stained for myelin with LFB.\n32\nThe amount of spared white matter and the total circumferential spinal cord area were delineated and measured using NIH ImageJ analysis software. Spared gray matter was calculated by subtracting the spared white matter and the GFAP-negative lesion area from the total spinal cord area for each section.\nFor kidney histology, the tissue was dissected, cryoprotected, and frozen as described above. Thirty micron thick sections were thaw-mounted onto slides and stained with H&E as described previously.\n24\nThree sections/mouse and six mice/group were used for the analyses.\n\nBladder weight and volume\nAfter sacrifice, bladders were dissected out, blot-dried, and weighed. The length and width of each bladder was then measured. The bladder volume (V) was calculated by the equation for a prolate ellipsoid: V=4/3 * p * L/2 * W/2 * W/2, where L is the bladder length and W is the bladder width. This method does not account for the elastic nature of the fully distended bladder and may therefore be an underestimation of the actual bladder volume.\n25\n\nBladder wall thickness\nBladder sections (6\u2009\u03bcm thick) were prepared transverse to the longest axis of the bladder, beginning at the bladder dome, and thaw-mounted onto slides. Every fifth section was stained with H&E. The thickness of the bladder wall was determined using NIH ImageJ analysis software. Bladder sections between 900\u2009\u03bcm and 1200\u2009\u03bcm from the bladder dome were selected for measurement. On each section that was measured, four bladder regions were chosen at random and averaged to determine the thickness of that section.\n\nStatistical analysis\nIBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 (Armonk, NY) and GraphPad Prism 6.0 software (San Diego, CA) were used to determine the statistical differences between experimental conditions. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for comparison of daily urinary retention and urinalysis. Where appropriate, repeated measures ANOVAs were followed by multiple group comparisons using the Bonferroni correction. One-way ANOVAs were used to compare the results of daily water consumption, bladder weight, bladder volume, and bladder wall thickness. Two-way ANOVAs were used to compare white and gray matter sparing. Where appropriate, one-way and two-way ANOVAs were followed by the Tukey post-hoc test. The Student\nt\ntest was used to compare the results for lesion volume. A\np\nvalue<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Data are reported as mean\u00b1standard error of the mean (SEM) throughout."

    "Methods": "We performed an institutional review board (IRB)-approved (UTSW IRB #STU 062012-023) retrospective review of all patients presenting to our urban level 1 trauma center with ICH between February 2010 and November 2012. During this time, all patients presenting with ICH were prospectively entered into a dedicated TBI database, which, in addition to standard demographics, tracked intracranial injury type and size, Parkland Protocol risk category at presentation and at final disposition, any clinical change in neurological exam, any radiographic progression on subsequent computed tomography (CT) scans, and the timing and type of VTE prophylaxis administration. All head CT scans were reread by a neurosurgeon or radiologist, and it was this interpretation that served as the data source. For the purposes of this investigation, we excluded those patients who only had one CT scan throughout their clinical course as well as those who were on warfarin at the time of their injury. Subjects on antiplatelet therapy at the time of their injury were included in the sample. During the time period of this study, it was our local standard of care to not perform duplex screening of the extremities of asymptomatic TBI patients. Duplex ultrasounds were performed based on the physical finding of a swollen extremity, whereas CT angiography was performed for the finding of idiopathic hypoxia and/or tachycardia.\n\nPatients were assigned to one of the Parkland Protocol's three risk categories at presentation. These risk categories represent the risk of spontaneous progression of the ICH pattern before initiation of pharmacological anticoagulation for VTE prophylaxis. Low-risk TBI are those patients with any or all of the following: a subdural hemorrhage \u22648\u2009mm at its thickest point, epidural hemorrhage \u22648\u2009mm thick, no more than a single parenchymal contusion per lobe, all contusions \u226420\u2009mm in their greatest diameters, and/or any amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage or intraventricular hemorrhage. Moderate-risk TBI included any injury larger than the low-risk criteria, but not undergoing craniotomy or monitor placement. High-risk TBI were those patients with any TBI that underwent craniotomy or monitor placement.\n\nRepeat CT scans were performed between 6 and 24\u2009h after injury at the discretion of the attending trauma surgeon or neurosurgeon at the point of care in a nonstandardized fashion, either for clinical concerns of progression or for routine screening for progression. Progression on head CT scan was defined as any enlargement of an existing lesion or the development of a new lesion. The incidence and timing of radiographic progression before chemoprophylaxis initiation was recorded for each category.\n\nBecause our goal was to validate the modified Berne-Norwood criteria as predictors of injury progression, we focused our analysis on spontaneous progression between the time of initial placement in one of the three risk categories and the subsequent CT scan. Per protocol, patients may or may not be reclassified in a different risk category if they experience progression on their second CT scan (e.g., a low-risk patient showing radiographic progression on subsequent CT scans will be reclassified as moderate risk, but a moderate-risk who progresses would only be reclassified as high risk if they subsequently underwent monitor placement or craniotomy). Therefore, progression, rather than reclassification, was the endpoint of the study.\n\nAn omnibus analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to assess for significant differences in spontaneous progression rates among the three risk categories overall, which was followed by a Tukey's post-hoc comparison. Descriptive statistics were calculated for the incidence and time frame of pharmacological VTE prophylaxis initiation. SAS version 9.3 (Cary, NC) was used for all statistical analyses."

Four common euthanasia protocols were used for RNA analysis in the healthy brain (Study A, na\u00efve animals) and in the traumatized brain (Study B, animals with controlled cortical impact [CCI]).\nThe effect of anesthetics on hippocampal mRNA expression of actin-1-related gene (Act1), FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (FosB), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1), heat shock protein beta-1 (HspB1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tight junction protein 1 isoform 1 (TJP1=ZO-1), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1\n\u00df\n), cyclophilin A (PPIA, control gene), micro RNA 497 (miR497), and small cajal body-specific RNA 17 (scaRNA17, miRNA control gene) were determined by real-time RT-PCR (Lightcycler).\n\nTraumatic brain injury\nAnesthesia was induced in a bell jar filled with 4% sevoflurane (Abbott, Wiesbaden, Germany) and maintained by inhalation via face mask (2% sevoflurane in 40% O\n2\nand 60% N\n2\n). A thermostatically regulated, feedback-controlled heating pad was used to maintain body temperature at 37\u00b0C (Hugo Sachs, March-Hugstetten, Germany). The brain trauma model was performed as described previously.\n7\nThe skull was fixed in a stereotactic frame (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA), and a craniotomy was performed above the right parietal cortex between the sagittal, lambdoid, and coronal sutures and the insertion of the temporal muscle with a saline cooled high-speed drill.\nThe lesion was induced perpendicular to the surface of the brain with a custom fabricated pneumatic controlled cortical impactor device (L. Kopacz, Mainz, Germany; diameter of the impactor tip: 3\u2009mm; impact velocity: 8\u2009m/sec; impact duration: 150\u2009msec; displacement: 1\u2009mm). The craniotomy was closed with the initially removed bone flap using conventional tissue glue (Histoacryl,\n\u00ae\nBraun-Melsungen, Germany). The skin was carefully closed, sevoflurane discontinued, and the animals transferred into their cages. For a maximum of 6\u2009h, animals were placed in a neonatal incubator (IC8000, Draeger, Luebeck, Germany) with controlled air temperature (33\u00b0C) and ambient humidity (35%) to maintain constant body temperature.\n\nEuthanasia and tissue preparation\nThe animals were killed by cervical dislocation without anesthesia (NA), ISO via face mask, COMB, or CH. After immediate decapitation, the brain was cut in coronal orientation and the right hippocampus was collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. At the same time, a second investigator performed arterial blood gas analysis.\n\nRNA isolation, quality control, and cDNA synthesis\nBrain tissue samples of hippocampus were homogenized and lysed with Qiazol-reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and with a MM300 mill mixer (Retsch, Haan, Germany) operated at 20\u2009Hz for 2\u2009min. Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and eluted with 30\u201350\u2009\u03bcL of RNase-free water. RNA concentration was calculated using the Quanti-iT\u2122 RNA Assay Kit with the Qubit\u2122 fluorimeter (Molecular Probes,\u2122 Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and with the NanoVue system (GE Healthcare Europe, Munich, Germany). 0.5\u2009\u03bcg extracted RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA by Verso\u2122 cDNA Kit (ABgene, Hamburg, Germany) and miScript RT Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nPCR standard generation for absolute qPCR quantification\nPCR fragments of all applied genes were generated by PCR on an Eppendorf Thermocycler gradient. PCR cycling parameters were as follows: thermal activation for 10\u2009min at 95\u00b0C and 50 cycles of PCR (melting for 45\u2009sec at 94\u00b0C, annealing for 45\u2009sec at 55\u201365\u00b0C, and extension for 60\u2009sec at 72\u00b0C). Applied primers are listed in\nTable 1\n. To verify the specificity of the PCR reaction, PCR products underwent electrophoresis alongside the 50\u2009bp DNA Molecular Weight Marker XIII (Roche) through a 2% (w/v) agarose gel (Invitrogen). The gels were stained with SYBR green (Roche), and images were captured using a Kodak EDAS 120 Image System (Eastman Kodak S\u00e0rl, Gen\u00e8ve, Switzerland). The PCR products were purified with QIA quick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) according the manufacturer's instructions, and the DNA concentration was determined using NanoVue. The copy number was calculated and serial 10-fold dilutions were made in the range of 1\u00d710\n7\nto 1\u00d710\n1\ncopies. A standard curve for absolute quantification was generated for each PCR product, showing good efficiency and linearity. For miRNA assays, a standard curve was generated for miR497 and scaRNA17 expression by serial 10-fold dilutions of a highly concentrated cDNA.\nTable\n1.\nSpecific Primer and Probes and Optimized Temperature Conditions for Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction\nPCR assay (amplicon size, annealing temp)\nOligonucleotide sequence (5\u2032-3\u2032)\nGenBank No.\nCyclophilin A (PPIA)\nForw: 5\u2032-GCGTCTSCTTCGAGCTGTT-3\u2032\nNM_008907\n(146\u2009bp, 55\u00b0C)\nRev: 5\u2032-RAAGTCACCACCCTGGCA-3\u2032\nR670: Red-TTGGCTATAAGGGTTCCTCCTTTCACAG-Phos\nFL: 5\u2032-GCTCTGAGCACTGGRGAGAAAGGA-FL\nIL-1\u00df\nForw: 5\u2032-GTGCTGTCGGACCCATATGAG-3\u2032\nNM_008361\n(348\u2009bp, 55\u00b0C)\nRev: 5\u2032-CAGGAAGACAGGCTTGTGCTC-3\u2032\nR640: Red-CAGCTGGAGAGTGTGGATCCCAAGC-Phos\nFL: 5\u2032-TAATGAAAGACGGCACACCCACCC-FL\nIL-6\nForw: 5\u2032-TCGTGGAAATGAGAAAAGAGTTG-3\u2032\nNM_031168.1\n(471\u2009bp, 55\u00b0C)\nRev: 5\u2032-TATGCTTAGGCATAACGCACTAG-3\u2032\nR640: Red-TGCTCTCCTAACAGATAAGCTGGAGTCAC-Phos\nFL: 5\u2032-CATAAAATAGTCCTTCCTACCCCAATTTCC-FL\nTJP1 (=ZO-1)\nForw: 5\u2032-TGTCCCTGTGAGTCCTTCAG-3\u2032\nNM_009386\n(331\u2009bp, 55\u00b0C)\nRev: 5\u2032-CCAGGTTTTAGGGTCACAGT-3\u2032\nR640: Red-ATGCCACGAGCTGTAGCCACTAC-Phos\nFL: 5\u2032-CTCAACACACCACCATTgCTgTT-FL\nTNF\u03b1\nForw: 5\u2032-TCTCATCAGTTCTATGGCCC-3\u2032\nNM_013693\n(212\u2009bp, 58\u00b0C)\nRev: 5\u2032-GGG AGTAGACAAGGTACAAC-3\u2032\nFosB\nForw: 5\u2032- CCGAGAAGAGACACTTACCC-3\u2032\nNM_008036\n(142\u2009bp, 58\u00b0C)\nRev: 5\u2032- CTCTTCAAGCTGATCAGTTTCC-3\u2032\nHspB1\nForw: 5\u2032- GACGAACATGGCTACATCTC -\u2032\nNM_013560\n(244\u2009bp, 58\u00b0C)\nRev: 5\u2032- CTGATGGCTTCTACTTGGCT-3\u2032\nAct1\nForw: 5\u2032- TGATCAAGATGACAGCATGG-3\u2032\nNM_009652\n(224\u2009bp, 58\u00b0C)\nRev: 5\u2032- GCCCACAGTAGAAACATCCT-3\u2032\nMir497\nMir497 miScript Primer Assay (Qiagen)\nMm_miR-497_1\nSCARNA17\nSCARNA17 miScript Primer Assay (Qiagen)\nHs_SCARNA17_1\nOpen in a separate window\nPCR, polymerase chain reaction; Forw, sense primer; Rev, anti-sense primer; R640/670, Lightcycler\n\u00ae\nRed640/670; Phos, phosphate; FL, fluorescein.\n\nQuantitative PCR\nEqual amounts of cDNA (1\u2009\u03bcL) were analyzed of each sample and in duplicates by real-time Lightcycler 480 PCR System (Roche).

    "Methods": "Contusion injury\nAll experimental procedures were performed under a protocol approved by the University of British Columbia's Office of Research Services Animal Care Committee (Vancouver, BC, Canada) in accord with the guidelines published by the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Forty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats (\u223c300\u2009g) were separated equally into six different injury groups and one surgical sham group (\nTable 1\n). Sham animals received the same surgical procedure and touch force from the impactor, but did not receive an injury. Each injury group received a maximum impact speed of 8, 80, or 800\u2009mm/s to a maximum impact depth of either 0.9 or 1.5\u2009mm. The speed and impact depth parameters were chosen to obtain a wide range of injury severities and enable the investigation of the depth-velocity interaction. Animals were exposed to the facilities 1 week before injury and individually handled for 15\u2009min daily to familiarize them with human interaction to reduce stress both before and postinjury.\nTable\n1.\nExperimental Impact Injury Conditions\nInjury group\nDisplacement (mm)\nSpeed (mm/s)\nNo. of rats\n1\n0.9\n8\n8\n2\n0.9\n80\n7\n3\n0.9\n800\n8\n4\n1.5\n8\n6\n5\n1.5\n80\n7\n6\n1.5\n800\n7\n7\nSurgical sham\nSurgical sham\n5\nOpen in a separate window\nUpon arrival to our vivarium, animals were allowed to explore the open field for 4\u2009min to acclimatize them before any baseline behavioral assessment. To obtain baseline behavioral assessment, each rat was placed in an open field for 4\u2009min and scored by two independent researchers using a modified open-field cervical SCI scale.\n24\nThis also served as an additional way for the animals to familiarize themselves with the open field before injury. Once baseline behavior was obtained, rats were deeply anesthetized with aerosolized isoflurane (induction, 5%; maintenance, 2%; Baxter Co., Mississauga, ON, Canada). Subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of buprenorphine (0.03\u2009mg/kg) was given to mitigate any possibility of acute pain. After anesthetization to a surgical plane, the spinal column was exposed dorsally from the second to the seventh cervical vertebrae (C2\u2013C7). A laminectomy was performed between the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae (C5\u2013C6) to expose the spinal cord and dura. Custom stainless-steel vertebral clamps were attached rigidly to hold both the C5 and C6 vertebrae in place. The custom contusion injury device and stereotaxic frame, as well as vertebral clamps used in this study, were designed by Choo and colleagues and first described in 2007.\n25\nThis device consists of an electromagnetic actuator, impactor tip, stereotaxic frame, and sensors used to measure force, displacement, and acceleration (\nFig. 1\n). Sensors were limited to sampling the data at 4000\u2009Hz. Once the clamps were attached to the contusion device, the 2-mm diameter impactor head was lowered in 50-\u03bcm increments until a touch force of 0.03\u2009N was reached, dimpling the surface of the dura to achieve a consistent datum for all injuries.\n26\nThe impactor was then retracted 6\u2009mm above the dura before accelerating downward to impact the cord using the predetermined depth and speed. Immediately after injury, the impactor was retracted 6\u2009mm above the starting point with no dwell time.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nPhotograph of the custom-designed UBC multi-mechanism injury system. The speed and depth of the impactor is computer controlled through the electromagnetic actuator. The linear variable differential transformer, accelerometer, and load cell record the biomechanical data.\nAfter contusion injury, the vertebral clamps were removed and the skin and muscle were sutured to promote healing and avoid infection. Animals were monitored four times daily and given s.c. buprenorphine (0.03\u2009mg/kg) three times daily for 3 days. After the 7-day survival period, each animal was reassessed in the open-field behavioral test before sacrifice with an overdose of chloral hydrate (0.5\u2009g/kg, intraperitoneally; Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO). All animals then were perfused with an intracardial needle with 250\u2009mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and followed with 500\u2009mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in order to fix the tissue. The spinal cord was dissected from the animal approximately \u00b15\u2009mm rostral and caudal around the injury epicenter and fixed overnight in 4% PFA. Each cord was cryoprotected in increasing concentrations of sucrose solutions (12%, 18%, and 24%) for 12\u2009h at each grade and frozen in optimum cutting temperature compound using isopentane and dry ice before being cryosectioned in 20-\u03bcm increments in the transverse plane (cross-sectional) in serial sets.\n\nOpen-field behavioral analysis\nThe more sensitive open-field evaluation tool developed by Martinez and colleagues was modified for mid-line injuries by including a bilateral assessment of individual limb score and used for this study.\n24\nAnimals were placed in the open field (120\u00d7150\u2009cm) for a period of 4\u2009min, and their forelimb movement, weight support, paw stepping, digit position, running coordination, and tail position were evaluated and scored as described in detail below. If the animal did not move for a period of 20\u2009sec or longer, it was picked up and placed at the center of the open field. Two examiners, blinded to the injury each animal received, scored the behavior for each animal by consulting with each other to complete each category. All categories were scored separately with a maximum total score of 72. In addition to scoring the fore- and hindlimbs separately, both the left- and right-side limbs were scored individually.\n\nLuxol fast blue imaging and analysis\nAfter serial sectioning of the spinal cord tissue, one set of slides was stained with Luxol fast blue (LFB) for WM and GM tissue sparing analysis. Slides were thawed and dipped into a 1% LFB solution overnight at 60\u00b0C and differentiated in lithium carbonate the following day. All images were captured on an AxioPlan2 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) using a 2.5\u00d7objective. Images were captured through the attached monochrome camera (Retiga Exi; QImaging, Burnaby, BC, Canada) using Northern Eclipse acquisition software (Empix Imaging, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Each set of serial images was stitched together using Adobe Photoshop CS3 (v10.0) using the photomerge function to represent the entire section. The injury epicenter was defined as the section containing the largest lesion area. Images were captured with 1-mm spacing between each section from 3\u2009mm rostral to 3\u2009mm caudal of the injury epicenter.\nEach cross-sectional image was segregated into damaged WM, damaged GM, intact WM, and intact GM regions in Photoshop using the magic wand tool to select areas of similar pixel intensity. In some sections, the tissue was so damaged that an estimation of the GM and WM boundary was hand drawn based on nondamaged tissue in the sham spinal cords. After being sectioned into these four regions, each image was converted to an 8-bit image and measured for total area using a constant threshold of 215/255 using ImageJ (v1.47c; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Total percentage of GM spared and total percentage of WM spared were recorded as the measured areas normalized to the total area of GM or WM in the section being analyzed identified by the LFB stain.\n27\nSectioning using the magic wand tool, allowing the user to select pixels based on tone and color as opposed to a defined shape, was compared to completely manual sectioning and found to only have a root mean square difference of 6.5%.\n\nImmunohistochemistry imaging and analysis\nA second set of slides was immunostained with chicken anti-myelin-based protein (MBP), mouse anti-neurofilament-200 (NF-200), and mouse anti-beta III tubulin to detect demyelination of axons surrounding the injury epicenter in the subsequent analysis. All slides were thawed from frozen at room temperature for 30\u2009min before rehydrating for 10\u2009min in 0.01\u2009M of PBS, then delipidized in increasing and decreasing concentrations of ethanol (50%, 70%, 90%, 95%, 100%, 95%, 90%, 70%, and 50%). The tissue was washed in 0.01\u2009M of PBS before being blocked for 30\u2009min in 10% normal donkey serum before overnight incubation at room temperature in the primary antibody (Ab) dilution (1:200 chicken anti-MBP; Aves Labs Inc., Tigard, OR; 1:500 mouse anti-NF-200; Sigma-Aldrich; 1:500 mouse anti-beta III tubulin; Sigma-Aldrich; and 1:1000 rabbit anti\u2013glial fibrillary acidic protein; Dako Canada Inc., Burlington, ON, Canada) in 0.01\u2009M of PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. After incubation, slides were washed for 5\u2009min in 0.01\u2009M of PBS three times and incubated in the secondary Ab dilution (1:200 Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-mouse, 1:200 Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-chicken, and 1:200 Alexa Fluor 405 donkey anti-rabbit; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 2\u2009h in a light opaque container. Sections were then washed for 5\u2009min in 0.01\u2009M of PBS and mounted in Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL), to help prevent photobleaching, and covered with glass cover-slips (No. 1.5; VWR, Radnor, PA).\nAll images were acquired using a Zeiss microscope (Axio Observer Z1; Carl Zeiss) with a 40\u00d7 objective and equipped with a Yokogawa spinning disc confocal device (CSU-X1; Yokogawa Corporation of America, Sugar Land, TX) and a motorized scanning stage (MS-2000; Applied Scientific Instrumentation, Eugene, OR). Exposure settings for image capture were automatically optimized through the Zen software (Blue v1.0.1.0; Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany) for each section because pixel intensity or area was not a factor in identifying the final outcome measure. The injury epicenter was defined as the section with the largest lesion area. Sections were imaged with a spacing of 1\u2009mm from 3\u2009mm rostral to 3\u2009mm caudal around the injury epicenter. Systematic random sampling through the cross-sectional images through the ventral and lateral white funiculi regions was used to image the WM. The lateral funiculi region was determined as all WM lateral to a line drawn in the anterior-posterior direction connected to the outermost edge of the lateral horn. The ventral funiculi region was captured as all WM located between the anterior median fissure and the medial edge of the anterior horn.\nA 75\u00d775\u2009\u03bcm grid was overlaid on top of the image, and sampling frames were selected at every fourth 75\u00d775\u2009\u03bcm square until the entire region of interest (ROI) was sampled. Images were not sampled at the edge of the tissue or on the GM and WM border. Within each 75\u00d775\u2009\u03bcm square, a smaller, 25\u00d725\u2009\u03bcm, ROI at the center was used to identify and count all demyelinated, swollen, and pathological axons (\nFig. 2\n). A demyelinated axon was classified if most of its myelin sheath was missing, whereas pathological axons were defined as axons that were no longer tightly wrapped by myelin. All demyelinated, swollen, and pathological axons were considered damaged nerve fibers used to calculate the percentage of damaged nerve fibers in the tissue region.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nShown is a 25\u00d725\u2009\u03bcm axon counting region of interest. Examples of healthy nerve fibres (yellow) and damaged nerve fibres (white) are shown. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\n\nComputational model\nA finite element model of the rat cervical spine developed by Russell and colleagues was used to compute the maximum principal strain in specific regions of the cord during a contusion injury.\n28\nHexahedral three-dimensional elements were used for the GM, WM, and dura mater while tetrahedral elements were used for the vertebrae and intervertebral discs. A total of 235,734 three-dimensional elements made up the C3\u2013C6 segment of the spine, and 18,972 smooth particles were created to mimic the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) surrounding the cord. For this study, the impactor speed during the survival study was used as input to the finite element analysis (FEA) to control the speed and depth of the impactor tip for each injury group. Loading and boundary conditions for contusion injuries were modeled to replicate the experimental setup. All vertebrae and intervertebral discs were created as rigid bodies, and the clamped vertebrae around the injury epicenter were fixed in PAM-CRASH (Version 7.5; ESI Group, Paris, France). The rostral and caudal ends of the dura were constrained thoroughly, preventing motion along the axis of the cord. Specific ROIs quantified by Choo and colleagues and Russell and colleagues were modified and outlined in the model to reflect the dorsal, lateral, and ventral regions of the WM and GM.\n28\n,\n29\nEach cross-section was spaced at 1-mm increments rostral-caudally from the injury epicenter. Maximum principal strain was recorded in each of these regions during contusion simulation for comparison with the demyelination, tissue sparing, and behavioral deficit recorded experimentally.\n\nStatistical analysis\nFor the open-field behavioral results, the scores were compared using a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis' analysis of variance (ANOVA) comparison of ranks for statistical significance. Any scores that displayed a\np\nvalue of less than 0.05 were further evaluated using multiple comparisons of mean ranks. A total of 16 individual group comparisons, between groups with similar impact depth, impact speed, and impact energy were done with Mann-Whitney's U test using a Bonferroni's correction, bringing the corrected alpha value to\n.\nFor the LFB and MBP tissue analysis, normal distribution was determined using Shapiro-Wilk's test. Both the arcsine transformation of tissue sparing and percentage of damaged nerve fibers were normally distributed. A two-way ANOVA test was carried out to compare the effects of impact speed and impact depth on demyelination as an indicator of secondary injury. An alpha level of 0.05 was used for the ANOVA and a post-hoc unequal N Tukey's test followed if significance was found.\nFor the normally distributed data sets, a linear correlation analysis was employed to identify the strength of the relationship between the tissue sparing and percentage of damaged nerve fibers with the mechanical impact factors and the regional maximum principal strains. Correlation coefficient values were recorded for all comparisons and were reported along with complete scatterplot graphs to visualize the data pool. Nonparametric Spearman's rank-order tests were used to determine the correlations between the open-field scores with impact speed and depth, as well as maximum principal strain."

    "Methods": "Animals\nSubjects were male Sprague-Dawley rats (8\u201312 weeks old) obtained from the Animal Resources Centre (Western Australia). Rats were housed individually under a 12\u2009h light/dark cycle with food and water\nad libitum.\nEach animal was randomly allocated to receive either a mild LFPI (\nn\n=9) or a sham-injury (\nn\n=5) treatment, and given 24\u2009h post-injury to recover before electrophysiological testing. Experiments were performed in accordance with the National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines for the care and welfare of experimental animals, and received approval from the Monash University Standing Committee on Ethics in Animal Experimentation and the Melbourne Health Animal Ethics Committees.\n\nLFPI\nInjury procedures were based on a standard protocol as described previously and used by our group.\n25\u201328\nBriefly, anesthesia was induced with 4% isofluorane in oxygen (2 L/min) via inhalation, and maintained throughout surgery with 2% isofluorane and 500\u2009mL/min oxygen flow delivered through a nose cone. Under aseptic conditions, rats underwent craniotomy to create a circular window (5\u2009mm diameter) centered at A/P \u22123.0\u2009mm, M/L 4.0\u2009mm with reference to bregma to expose the dura mater. A modified female Luer-Lock cap was secured over the craniotomy window by cyanoacrylate and dental acrylic, the cap was filled with sterile fluid, and the rat was removed from anesthesia and attached to the fluid percussion device via the female Luer-Lock cap. Once the rat responded to a toe pinch, a mild fluid percussion pulse (1.0\u20131.5 atmospheres) was delivered by the fluid percussion device to the intact dura, to produce a mild TBI.\n28\u201330\nSham-injury rats underwent the same procedures except that no fluid percussion force was delivered. Immediately after the injury, the female Luer-Lock cap was removed, the scalp was sutured, and acute post-injury measures consisting of duration of apnea, duration of unconsciousness, and latency to occurrence of the self-righting reflex were monitored.\n27\u201330\nAll rats were treated with analgesic (carprofen, 5\u2009mg/kg).\n\nElectrophysiology\nAt 24\u2009h post-surgery, electrophysiological recordings from posteromedial barrel subfield (PMBSF; barrel cortex) were obtained using methods previously established in our group,\n17\n,\n31\n,\n32\nat both ipsilateral and contralateral locations relative to the site of injury. Animals were anesthetized using 5% halothane and tracheotomized to maintain anesthesia at 0.5\u20133.0% halothane through continuous ventilation. Depth of anesthesia was regularly monitored using electrocardiographic/electromyographic recordings from forepaw musculature, pinch withdrawal reflexes, and palpebral reflexes. Body temperature was maintained between 37\u00b0C and 38\u00b0C.\nThe skull was exposed to anchor a head bar with a screw and dental cement to the bone rostral of bregma, to hold the head firmly in place for recording. A craniotomy over the barrel cortex (either ipsilateral or contralateral to injury; approximately 4\u2009mm diameter, centered approximately A/P \u22122\u2009mm to bregma; M/L 6\u2009mm) was made via drilling, and the exposed barrel cortex (with dura intact) was penetrated with a tungsten microelectrode (2\u20134 MOhm; FHC) using a fast-stepping microdrive (Kopf Model 2660) mounted on a complex of translators and goniometers.\n31\n,\n32\nAdvancement of the electrode was monitored via high-power microscopy, by monitoring electrode depth on the calibrated microdrive, and by monitoring the amplified and filtered electrode output through speakers and on an oscilloscope.\nThe microdrive was zeroed at the cortical surface under high-power microscopy and then used to advance the electrode to a depth between 600 and 800\u2009\u03bcm from the cortical surface for accurate determination of the Principal Whisker (PW; the whisker providing main excitatory input) via manual whisker deflection, using methods and criteria as described previously.\n31\n,\n32\nAfter unequivocal determination of the PW, the electrode was retracted to the surface, rezeroed again under high-powered microscopy, and then advanced systematically in 10-\u03bcm steps to record from the various cortical laminae, while monitoring depth on the microdrive.\nRecording site was not altered once a PW had been obtained, because deflection of the PW invariably produced finely tuned responses in L4/L5, regardless of which whisker was the PW. Recording locus was largely determined by proximity to blood vessels and physical accessibility of the recording apparatus. Septal regions were avoided and easily demarcated on the basis of multiwhisker evoked responses that were weakly driven and tended to be more rapidly adapting.\nOutput signals from the electrode were amplified and band-pass filtered from 0.3\u201310\u2009kHz.\n31\n,\n32\nOn-line displays of rasters of spike occurrences and peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) were generated using Spike2 software. A copy of the filtered neural signal was also recorded by Spike2 to allow for offline extraction of single neuron data from the cluster population responses.\n\nControlled whisker deflections\nThe methods for applying motion patterns to the PW have been detailed previously.\n31\nThe PW was threaded through a hole on a motor-controlled level arm system positioned 5\u2009mm from the face. The lever arm was moved under computer control in well-defined motion patterns while neural recordings were obtained from the barrel cortex. We used a range of simple and complex whisker stimuli, as we have found previously that differing complexity of afferent input is an important variable capable of highlighting changes in post-injury cortical processing.\n17\nA suite of five trapezoidal stimuli was initially used to characterize basic cluster responses in lamina and to extract single unit waveforms. Only the onset ramp velocity varied with these stimuli (30, 60, 150, 250, or 400\u2009mm/sec), with deflection amplitude fixed at 3.6\u2009mm, the trapezoid hold duration kept constant at 20 msec, and the offset ramp duration fixed at 40 msec. The suite of five stimuli was repeated 100\u2013150 times, with each repetition consisting of the five stimuli presented pseudorandomly. The number of repetitions of each stimulus was chosen to ensure that there were enough waveforms obtained for reliable spike sorting.\nStandard Spike2 template matching algorithms were applied to generate individual spike waveform templates from the responses, and in most cases, 3\u20134 waveforms were obtained at any recording location. These templates were applied at that recording point to separate responses of different presumptive neurons to the trapezoid stimuli and the subsequent complex whisker motion stimuli (see below), for later off-line analysis.\nTwo complex \u201cnaturalistic\u201d whisker deflections were then applied in turn to the PW, one modeling the whisker motion videographed in rats making contact with a rod placed in the path of the whiskers and then moving the whiskers past the rod,\n33\nand the other modeling the whisker motion across rough surfaces exhibited by rats trained to discriminate between rough and smooth surfaces.\n34\nThe use of both sets of complex stimuli was important to ascertain whether different neuronal output could be detected depending on the nature of the complex afferent sensory information used to evoke responses.\nThe methods for extracting these stimuli from the original reports\n33\n,\n34\nand storing and playing them out from text files have been detailed previously.\n17\nTen stimulus amplitudes were used for each of the two complex whisker motions, beginning with an amplitude of 0.2\u2009mm and then continuing from 0.4\u20133.6\u2009mm, in 0.4-mm steps. Each stimulus amplitude was presented 50 times in a pseudorandom order.\n\nData analysis\nAs in our recent studies, clusters and single neurons were collated into laminae by depth as Layer 2 (150\u2013300\u2009\u03bcm from the cortical surface); Upper Layer 3 (350\u2013500\u2009\u03bcm); Deep Layer 3 (550\u2013700\u2009\u03bcm); Layer 4 (750\u20131000\u2009\u03bcm); and Layer 5 (1100\u20131400\u2009\u03bcm). All neuronal recordings are shown as firing rate (Hz) in 1 msec bins over the period from 200 msec before stimulus onset until 100 msec post-stimulus offset. The data from the clusters was used for off-line analysis to generate population PSTHs; PSTHs for all neuronal clusters in a lamina were averaged to produce a laminar Grand PSTH to show the pattern of population responses within a lamina. A responsive unit was defined as one with responses significantly greater than spontaneous rate over at least three successive stimulus amplitudes (naturalistic stimuli)/velocities (trapezoids).\nThe PSTHs were generated by averaging responses to each stimulus amplitude (for the complex stimulus waveforms) or each stimulus ramp velocity (for the trapezoid stimuli) across all presentations of that stimulus. The averages were corrected for spontaneous firing rate, using the 200 msec pre-stimulus firing rate. Then a five-point weighted moving average was applied to smooth out any noise in the responses, and the data averaged across all multiunits to produce a Grand PSTH.\nWhile the Grand PSTH was used to visualize the overall pattern of responses in a lamina to a stimulus, neuronal response metrics were derived separately from each cluster and single cell within a lamina. Thus, the peak firing rate, excitatory area under the curve, latency to peak firing rate, and half-peak width were calculated for clusters and single cells for each stimulus. For the trapezoidal whisker motion stimuli, these metrics were calculated separately for each trapezoid defined by a particular onset ramp velocity, and for the complex whisker motion stimuli, these metrics were calculated separately for each stimulus amplitude. For the short duration trapezoidal stimulus and the complex object contact stimulus, a 5\u201350 msec window after stimulus onset was used; for the longer rough texture discrimination stimuli, a 5\u201330 msec counting window was used. These counting windows were set to encompass the maximum response over the stimulus presentation period. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for all data comparisons.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nAfter electrophysiology recording, the animal was overdosed with sodium pentobarbitone (Lethobarb; 300\u2009mg/mL), perfused transcardially first with ice-cold saline to remove blood and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The brain was removed from the cranium and post-fixed in paraformaldehyde for 24\u2009h before processing for paraffin embedding. Then 10-\u03bcm thick sections were obtained from a region of approximately 1.3\u2009mm caudal to bregma and processed for neurofilament heavy chain (NF-200) immunohistochemical staining using techniques described previously.\n19\nMonoclonal NF-H antibody (1:1000; Invitrogen) was used in conjunction with the peroxidase-diaminobenzidine method to visualize injured axons. Stained sections were scanned by ScanScope AT Turbo slide scanner (Aperio, CA) and visualized and analyzed by Aperio ImageScope (v11.2.0.780, Aperio, CA) and ImageJ (NIH).\nScanned tissue sections were viewed using Aperio ImageScope, and the perimeter of the region to be examined was defined. For cortex, this constituted a region beginning from the midline and following the border of the cingulum and the external capsule to the level of the rhinal fissure. The cingulum and external capsule were also analyzed separately. For each region of interest (ROI), multiple photos were obtained at 15x magnification to cover the entire region without overlapping. Within each ROI, automated densimetric analysis was used to calculate the total area stained for NF-200 (cell body, axons, dendrites) as a percentage of the total area within the ROI. The analysis was conducted using ImageJ. The data were analyzed by Mann Whitney\nU\ntest between treatment groups; each region of interest was treated independently. Data are presented as mean\u00b1standard error of the mean (SEM)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nTwenty-seven male Long-Evans rats, approximately 350\u2009g at the time of surgery, were used in this study. The procedures conducted in this study were reviewed and approved by the Southern Illinois University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and the study was conducted in a laboratory certified by the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. Rats were housed singly in standard cages on a 12-h light: dark cycle. Behavioral testing took place during the light cycle. Rats were maintained at 340\u2013350 g; water was available\nad libitum\n.\n\nOperant training\nApparatus\nTesting occurred in a bank of four standard modular operant chambers measuring 29\u00d729\u00d724\u2009cm (Coulbourn Instruments, Whitehall, PA). Each chamber was positioned inside a sound-attenuated chamber with white noise in the background. Operant chambers were interfaced with a computer via a PCI-PDISO-16 board (Measurement Computing, Norton, MA) and controlled by custom programs written in the VisualBasic.net programming language (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). One side of the chambers was blank. The other side was equipped with three levers (2\u2009cm long\u00d73.5\u2009cm wide), each with a panel of three light-emitting diode lights above them. A dipper (Coulbourn) was located below the center lever to deliver reinforcer (0.04\u2009mL sweetened condensed milk per delivery; diluted 3:1, water:milk). There was a Sonalert audio signal (Coulbourn; 2000\u2009Hz, 10 dB) as well as a house light located at the top of the chamber for general illumination.\nDiscrimination training\nRats were put through the steps listed below to shape their behavior to perform the two-choice discrimination. The time spent on each training step varied from rat to rat, but the average training times were not different across the groups. Sessions lasted approximately 1\u20131,5\u2009h and were conducted 7 days per week (\nFig. 1\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nThe top part of this figure shows the steps of training for the discrimination andprogressive ratio tasks. The bottom part shows the timeline of behavior after injury, divided by experiments 1 and 2. Rats that were not responding at least 25% of the time by the end of experiment 1 were retrained in experiment 2. Testing continued normally for those that were responding at least 25% of the time. PR, progressive ratio; MWM, Morris water maze.\nLever-pressing behavior was shaped through the method of successive approximations.\n33\nInitially, rats were food restricted and placed into chambers, with each of the three levers set to deliver reinforcer on being pressed. Milk was presented for 3\u2009sec, followed by a 6\u2009sec intertrial interval (ITI). Once rats were reliably pressing levers, differing fixed ratio schedules (ranging from FR-1\u2013FR-10) were presented across the levers to distribute pressing behavior roughly equally across the three levers. Sessions lasted 1\u2009h. Once responses were distributed evenly, rats were moved on to discriminative stimulus training.\nDuring discriminative stimulus training, an FR-1 schedule of reinforcement was in effect for a given lever when the light panel above it was illuminated (solid light). Pressing of an unlit lever caused all lights to go out and a 15\u2009sec ITI to begin. Correct responses resulted in reinforcer being presented for 3\u2009sec followed by a 12\u2009sec ITI. Sessions initially lasted 200 trials and were tapered down to 100 trials once rats began responding robustly and then a maximum trial time of 30\u2009sec was instituted, after which it went straight to the ITI. Once rats reached 85% accuracy on this phase, they were moved on to behavioral chain training.\nThe behavioral chain training was exactly the same as the discriminative stimulus training, except that each trial began with the light above the center lever illuminated and a press on the center lever randomly turned on one of the side stimuli. Only presses to the lever on the lit side were reinforced. Presses on the lever on the unlit side resulted in a 15\u2009sec ITI. Sessions lasted 100 trials. Once the chain was acquired, the FR-1 center response was gradually stepped up to FR-3, and then a 30\u2009sec maximum trial duration was imposed. Once an 85% accuracy criterion was reached, rats were moved onto training on the PR schedule.\nPR training\nThis task was conducted in the same apparatus as the discrimination, but used a slowly blinking house light as well as a slowly blinking center stimulus light to distinguish the contexts of the tasks (700\u2009ms pulse; 0.71\u2009Hz). Procedures for this task were adapted from previously published protocols,\n34\nbut changed to preferentially sample the lower range of response requirements (see below). Only presses to the center lever were reinforced; the side levers had no programmed consequences. Initially, under the PR schedule of reinforcement, two responses were needed to the center lever for reinforcer to be delivered. After the delivery of reinforcer, the response requirement increased by two responses. Thus, the second reinforcer required four presses and the third reinforcer required six presses, and so on. The step size was increased to five when the response requirement equaled 20. Thus, the 11th reinforcer required 25 presses, the 12th required 30, and so on. When the response requirement equaled 50, the step size was increased again up to 10. Thus the 17th reinforcer required 60 presses, the 18th, 70 presses, and so on. The final sequence of requirements was as follows: (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70\u2026\nn\n).\nBecause break points have been shown to be relatively independent of step size,\n35\n,\n36\nthis sequence allowed for differential sampling at the low end of break points and thus increased sensitivity to injury effects in those ranges. If the rat did not press the center lever for a 5-min period, the session was terminated. Any press to the center lever reset this interval. After 2 days of learning on this task, rats were moved into pretesting.\n\nPretesting (baseline)\nDiscrimination and PR\nTo establish a baseline for comparison post-surgery, on alternating days, rats were given a session of two-choice discrimination testing and a session of PR testing for 12 days (six sessions on each task). Baseline accuracy on the two-choice discrimination was recorded as were baseline break points on the PR schedule.\nMotor assessment\nGross motor ability was assessed on the last day of pretesting by evaluating spontaneous motor activity in a square Plexiglas open field (Photobeam Activity System, San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA) measuring 40.5\u2009cm wide by 40.5\u2009cm long by 38\u2009cm high according to a previously published protocol.\n37\nRats were placed and allowed to explore freely for 10\u2009min. Sixteen crossing infrared beams recorded position and locomotor behavior to a computer database. A separate set of eight beams tracked rearing behavior. Distance traveled and rears, measured in number of beams broken, were the primary dependent measures.\nBaseline fine motor assessments in the operant chamber were also made by recording the lever hold duration throughout the PR task. The PR hold durations were chosen because there is a fairly regular pattern of responding and higher number of overall responses in this task compared with the discrimination. Hold duration has been used previously for the evaluation of motor dysfunction in Parkinson disease and Huntington disease models.\n38\n,\n39\nAfter all pretesting, rats were moved on to surgery.\n\nSurgery\nSurgical procedures were performed according to previous studies under aseptic conditions.\n7\n,\n11\nRats were anesthetized under a mixture of isoflurane (2\u20134%) and oxygen (0.8 L/min) and then placed into a stereotaxic frame on a heated surgical stage. A bilateral CCI procedure or sham procedure was performed. A midline incision was made through the skin and fascia. A 6.0\u2009mm diameter craniotomy centered at 3.0\u2009mm from bregma (AP +3.0, ML +0.0) was created using a microdrill. Special care was taken to avoid any damage to the meninges or cortex. The cortical region containing the prefrontal cortex was exposed. A circular, flat-faced stainless steel impactor tip with a diameter of 5.0\u2009mm was then used to induce the injury. It was attached to an electromagnetic impactor device (Leica Biosystems, St. Louis). To induce a severe brain injury, the tip impacted the cortex at a rate of 3.0\u2009m/sec for 0.5\u2009sec to a depth of 2.5\u2009mm. After injury, bleeding was stopped and the incision sutured closed. Rats were then placed in a heated recovery chamber until locomotor behavior returned. Sham procedures followed an \u201cintact sham\u201d procedure.\n18\n,\n40\nThis consisted of a midline incision, suturing of the incision, and then placement in the recovery chamber.\n\nDrug administration\nRats were given injections of NAM (150\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneally [i. p].) or 0.9% sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 1\u2009mL/kg, i.p.) starting at 2\u2009h post-surgery and then at 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72\u2009h according to previous protocols.\n41\n,\n42\nRats were matched for pre-injury performance and then randomly assigned to one of three groups. Group 1 received a CCI and was given NAM injections (NAM,\nn\n=10). Group 2 received a CCI and was given saline injections (vehicle,\nn\n=9). Group 3 received sham procedures and was given saline injections (sham,\nn\n=8).\n\nExperiment 1\nThe purpose of the first experiment was to characterize the performance of rats on the discrimination task and compare with the motor measures, progressive ratio task, and MWM to determine if NAM administration improved performance. A secondary goal was to determine if motivation or motor impairments contributed to discrimination performance. After surgery, rats were allowed 6 days to recover before testing resumed on day 7. The two-choice discrimination was assessed on days 7\u201327 with a break every 5 days to assess the PR motivation task. The gross motor abilities of rats were assessed on days 7, 14, and 27 in the locomotor activity monitors. On days 15\u201318 post-surgery, rats were tested on the reference memory paradigm of the MWM. On days 21\u201323, rats were tested on the working memory paradigm of the MWM (\nFig. 1\n).\nDiscrimination\nDiscrimination testing followed the procedures described above. Rats were required to press the center lever three times to turn on a light on either the left or the right lever, then were required to make a correct choice to receive the reinforcer. Accuracies were recorded for each day and averaged into bins of 4 days of testing for analysis.\nPR\nThe PR testing followed the procedures described above and was tested every fifth day. The break points of rats were recorded for analysis.\nMotor assessment\nThe beams broken in the activity monitors were recorded for gross movement as well as rears and recorded for analysis of gross locomotor ability. The durations of the lever holds in the operant chamber during PR sessions were also recorded and averaged for analysis of fine locomotor ability.\nMWM\nThe MWM testing followed a previously published protocol in a 1.5\u2009m diameter circular tank with two phases of testing: reference memory and working memory.\n7\nConsistent reference cues were present on the three walls surrounding the tank throughout testing. During the reference memory paradigm, a clear platform (10\u2009cm\u00d710\u2009cm) was submerged in 32\u2009cm of 22\u00b0C water in the center of the northeast quadrant of the tank. Rats were lowered into the water at pseudorandomized start points (one trial starting from each cardinal direction) facing the wall of the tank. Once in the water, rats were allowed to freely explore until they located the submerged platform and climbed onto it or 90\u2009sec elapsed. If a rat was unable to locate the platform after 90\u2009sec, it was guided by hand to the platform. Rats were allowed to remain on the platform for 10\u2009sec before being removed and placed in a heated cage to dry. The latencies were recorded by hand. There were four trials per day. The latencies from the four trials were averaged to form a score for the day.\nThe working memory paradigm of the MWM was the same as the reference memory paradigm, except that on each day, the platform was placed in a new pseudorandom quadrant (northwest, southwest, southeast). Testing occurred as before, except that the first trial was considered a learning trial and not included in the analysis. The latencies from the last three trials were averaged to form a score for the day.\n\nExperiment 2\nThe purpose of the second experiment was to evaluate how effective retraining was for injured rats. It used the same animals and started immediately after Experiment 1 was completed. After 16 sessions of discrimination testing in Experiment 1, rats that were not completing at least 25% of the response chains were stepped back to the previous training step\u2014a simple discrimination in which the stimulus lights appeared automatically without requiring a centering response. These rats were given eight sessions of retraining and then placed back on the chain to reassess their responding. Rats that were completing greater than 25% of the discrimination chains continued testing under the conditions from Experiment 1 (\nFig. 1\n).\nDiscrimination\nDiscrimination testing continued as described above with a centering response for the rats that had been responding more than 25% of the time. The rats that were not responding at a high rate were stepped back a training step and the left or right light appeared without a centering response. The accuracies and response rates were collected for analysis.\nPR\nThe PR task continued to be assessed every 5 days while the retraining occurred. The break points were recorded for analysis.\n\nHistology and lesion analysis\nForty-three days after injury, rats were anesthetized with a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital (Euthasol; Virbac Animal Health, Fort Worth, TX; 0.3\u2009mL, i.p.) and transcardially perfused with ice-cold (5\u00b0) PBS, followed by 10% phosphate-buffered formalin. The brain was then removed from the skull and post-fixed in formalin for 24\u2009h, then placed in a 30% sucrose solution until saturated and sliced frozen, coronally, on a sliding microtome at 40\u2009\u03bcm. After slicing, brain sections were mounted to gel-subbed slides for staining.\nBrain sections were stained with cresyl-violet to visualize and analyze the extent of the lesion according to a previous protocol.\n7\nAn Olympus microscope (BX-51; Center Valley, PA) with an Olympus 13.5 megapixel digital camera (DP-70) attached to it was used to capture images of the coronal sections transversing the lesion cavity (+5.0, +4.0, +3.0, +2.0, +1.0 from bregma, see\nFig. 2\n). ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD) was used to measure individual brain slices. The lesion volume was then calculated according to previous studies.\n18\nThe area of five slices was averaged together using the Cavalieri method, then multiplied by the thickness and number of sections to estimate the volume (formula: 0.04 * 5 *\naverage area\n).\n43\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nPanel\nA\nshows the remaining brain volume (+SEM) after surgery. Both NAM and vehicle groups had significantly less brain volume than the sham group. Superimposed dots represent the volumes of individual rats. Panel\nB\nshows representative brain sections, demonstrating the extent of the injury. Numbers are the location relative to bregma in mm.\n\nAnalysis\nMeans and standard error of the mean were collected for all data and analyzed using SPSS 15. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVAs) were used to examine differences in performance between groups on measures with multiple time points. Univariate ANOVAs were used to examine differences on single point outcome measures. Tukey Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) was used to conduct pairwise\npost-hoc\ncomparisons. The Huynh-Feldt correction was used to correct for violations of sphericity. Pearson correlation was used to examine the relationship between lesion size and performance. Statistical significance was determined by a\np\nvalue<0.05."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll mice were progeny of C57BL/6J mice bred in our colony, originally purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were maintained on a 12-h light/dark schedule with\nad libitum\naccess to food and water, except during ethanol consumption testing, when water was replaced by 15% ethanol as described. All experiments were performed using male mice, 6\u20137 weeks of age at the time of injury. Animal use protocols were in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Wayne State University.\n\nTraumatic brain injury\nMice were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL) using an anesthesia induction chamber. After initial sedation, 2.5% isoflurane was used for maintenance during the surgical procedure and injury using a nose cone secured to the stereotaxic frame. Sterile lubricant ophthalmic ointment (Rugby Laboratories, Inc., Duluth, GA) was applied to prevent drying of the eyes immediately after the removal of fur from the surgical area with an electric razor.\nOn loss of the pain reflex, as assessed by paw pinch, mice were secured in a stereotaxic frame and a midline incision (1.0\u2009cm) was made to expose the skull using sterile techniques. The periosteum was reflected after prepping the scalp with betadine and isopropyl alcohol solutions. The animal was supported by a soft pad to maintain proper orientation of the head with the body while receiving isoflurane via a nose cone. To induce an injury of moderate severity, an electromagnetically-driven impactor tip (Leica-Microsystems, Northbrook, IL) was positioned over the exposed skull at the midpoint between lambda and bregma along the midline suture and the stainless steel hemispheric indentor (5\u2009mm diameter) was displaced 2\u2009mm at 5\u2009m/sec. Automated retraction of the impactor occurred 100 msec after impact.\nImmediately after impact, ear bars were released, anesthesia was removed, and animals were monitored for length of apnea, respiration time, and seizure behaviors. Skulls of injured animals were evaluated for the presence of hairline fractures, herniation, and hematoma. Sham-injured animals (control) experienced all procedures except the impact. Scalp incisions were closed with tissue adhesive (3M, St. Paul, MN). Triple antibiotic ointment was applied to prevent infection at the incision site and the animals were placed on a heating pad maintained at 37\u00b0C during recovery from the injury/anesthesia.\nThe length of time until animals regained the righting reflex (to spontaneously orient onto four paws from a side-laying position) and the return of the pain reflex were monitored until mobility was recovered. After recovery, mice were returned to their home cages. The total time from initiation of anesthesia to removal of the nose cone after injury was approximately 15\u2009min. The injury was the first procedure to occur in all experimental animals.

No significant differences were observed among groups used for individual experiments noted. Data presented are average time until righting reflex is regained after removal of anesthesia (min)\u00b1standard deviation.\n\nTissue preparation and histopathology\nMice were anesthetized with 2.5% Avertin (0.7\u2009mL) and perfused transcardially, first with 30\u2009mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 50\u2009mL 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS at 6, 24, 48, 72\u2009h, or 7 days post-injury (N=3/time point). From an independent set of mice, tissues were similarly collected for histological analysis 24\u2009h after ethanol treatment, which was administered 14 days after the TBI or sham procedure. After perfusion, brains were immediately post-fixed in 4% PFA for 24\u2009h at 4\u00b0C then transferred to 30% sucrose solution. After 5 to 7 days in sucrose at 4\u00b0C, brains were sectioned in the coronal plane at 40\u2009\u03bcm using a cryostat and stored in PBS/0.1% sodium azide at 4\u00b0C until use. Sections were collected in a 10-slice series with one set stained with 0.3% cresyl violet and three additional sets used for immunohistochemistry as described individually in the following sections.\nAPP immunohistochemistry\nAfter three washes in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), selected sections were placed in 60\u00b0C 10\u2009mM sodium citrate, pH 6.5, in a water bath for 20\u2009min, then allowed to cool at room temperature for 15\u2009min. After another three washes in TBS, sections were incubated in hydrogen peroxide, methanol, and TBS (1:3:6, v/v) for 15\u2009min at room temperature. After an additional four washes in TBS, sections were blocked in 5% normal horse serum (NHS) in TBS with 0.001% Triton X-100 (TBS-T) for 60\u2009min at room temperature with continuous agitation.\nTissues were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in anti-APP (C-terminal) (Invitrogen, Camarillo, CA) diluted 1:2000 in 5% NHS/TBS-T. Sections were incubated in biotin Donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) diluted 1:1000 in 5% NHS/TBS-T for 2\u2009h at room temperature with continuous agitation after washing in TBS three times. After an additional 3 TBS washes, tissues were incubated for 1\u2009h in 1:3 AB solution from the ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and washed four times in TBS. Brain slices were then immersed in a solution containing 1 tablet of 3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 15\u2009mL 30% hydrogen peroxide solution for 7\u2009min and rinsed twice with water and once with TBS-T. Tissues were stored in TBS-T at 4\u00b0C until mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA).\nGFAP immunohistochemistry\nAfter three washes in TBS, selected sections were blocked in a solution of 5% NHS, 0.1%Triton X-100, and TBS for 1\u2009h and incubated in a 1:10,000 anti-GFAP (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 5% NHS/TBS-T solution overnight at 4\u00b0C with continuous agitation. Tissues were washed three times in TBS and immersed in 1:500 biotin-Donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) in 5% NHS/TBS-T for 2\u2009h at room temperature. After an additional three washes in TBS, the selected sections were incubated in hydrogen peroxide, methanol, and TBS (1:3:6, v/v) for 15\u2009min and rinsed four times in TBS. Tissue was immersed in 1:3 AB solution from the ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) with TBS/bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1\u2009h at room temperature and washed three times with TBS. Brain slices were incubated in a solution containing 1 DAB tablet (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 15\u2009mL 30% hydrogen peroxide solution for 7\u2009min, then rinsed twice with water. Finally, sections were washed once with TBS-T and stored at 4\u00b0C until mounted on Superfrost Plus slides.\nIgG immunohistochemistry\nAfter one rinse in TBS, selected brain slices were incubated in a blocking solution of 5% NHS, 0.1% Triton X-100, and TBS for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Tissue was exposed to 1:10,000 5% NHS/TBS-T diluted biotin-Donkey anti-Mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 2\u2009h at room temperature. After washing three times in TBS, sections were immersed in hydrogen peroxide, methanol, and TBS (1:3:6, v/v) for 30\u2009min at room temperature and washed six times in TBS. Tissue was incubated in 1:3 AB solution from the ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) with TBS/BSA for 1\u2009h at room temperature, washed four times with TBS, and immersed in a solution comprising one tablet of DAB (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) dissolved in 15\u2009mL 30% hydrogen peroxide solution for 5\u2009min. Finally, sections were rinsed with water three times before being mounted on Superfrost Plus slides and stored at 4\u00b0C for at least 48\u2009h.\n\nProtein lysate preparation and immunoblotting\nAt 14 days post-injury, mice were administered a single intraperitoneal injection of saline or ethanol (20% [v/v] solution in 0.9% saline) to achieve a dose of 4.0\u2009g/kg. Thirty minutes after saline or ethanol administration, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The striatum was rapidly dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Using an electric pestle, tissues were homogenized in a buffer containing 4% (w/v) 3-([3-cholamido-propyl]dimethylammonio)-1-propanesulfonate, 2\u2009M thiourea, 7\u2009M urea, and 30\u2009mM Tris, pH 8.5. One tablet of Complete Protease Inhibitor mixture (Roche Products, Indianapolis. IN) was added to 50\u2009mL of lysis buffer.\nAfter homogenization, samples were centrifuged at 10,000\u00d7g for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C, and the supernatants were collected. A Pierce 660 Protein Assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) was used to determine protein concentrations. Equal amounts of protein were submitted to 4\u201312% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were probed with primary antibodies at the following concentrations: anti-phosphorylated DARPP-32 (Thr34) and anti-DARPP-32 at 1:2000 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) and anti-actin at 1:5000 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies and signals were visualized using chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Dura kit; Pierce, Rockford, IL).\nDensitometric analysis was performed using Image J Software. For each sample, phosphoprotein signals were normalized to total protein signals and averaged within groups. In addition, phosphoprotein and total protein signals were independently normalized to actin signals and averaged within groups (data not shown).\n\nAccelerating Rota-Rod\nMotor performance of an independent group of injured and sham animals was evaluated using an accelerating Mouse Rota-Rod (Ugo Basile, Collegeville, PA). Mice were tested repeatedly at consecutive time points of 24 and 48\u2009h; 7 and 14 days post-injury. The rod (3\u2009cm in diameter and 14\u2009cm above a platform) accelerated from 3.5 rotations per minute (RPM) to 36 RPM at a constant rate over a 5\u2009min testing interval. Latency to fall from the rotating rod or to traverse around the rod for one full rotation was recorded for each mouse. This motor performance test was administered once per testing time point, with no pre-injury training session.\n\nDetermination of behavioral ethanol sensitivity and blood ethanol concentration\nAt 14\u2009d after TBI, a separate group of mice was evaluated for the loss of righting reflex (LORR) after acute ethanol challenge. Mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of ethanol to achieve a dose of 4.0\u2009g/kg (20% [v/v] solution in 0.9% saline) and placed on their back in a U-shaped trough after losing the ability to right themselves. Sedation time was defined as the time until the mice regained the ability to right themselves onto three of four paws three times within 30\u2009sec. On regaining the righting response, blood samples, taken either from tail or trunk, were collected in lithium heparin-coated tubes (Sarstedt, Newton, NC) to evaluate blood ethanol concentration (BEC). At 14 days post-TBI, blood was similarly collected from an additional group of mice 30\u2009min after acute ethanol administration (4.0\u2009g/kg), regardless of sedation status. Ethanol concentration was determined using the Pointe Scientific Alcohol Reagent (Pointe Scientific, Canton, MI) according to manufacturer instructions.\n\nEthanol consumption: Drinking-in-the-Dark (DID) paradigm\nOne week before injury, mice were introduced to a 12-h reversed light:dark schedule (lights on at 1800\u2009h) and maintained on this schedule for the duration of the DID paradigm. Immediately after injury or sham surgery, which occurred at the start of the light cycle, mice were allowed to recover in group housing for 1 week, then switched to single-housing conditions for an additional week in preparation for DID evaluation.\nFor DID assessment, beginning at 14\u2009d post-TBI, each mouse was provided with a single bottle containing tap water for 3 days followed by 7 days of 15% ethanol ([v/v] in tap water) for a 2-h limited access period starting 3\u2009h into the dark cycle (0900\u20131100\u2009h). Mice were weighed on the first and last day of DID testing, and bottles were weighed before and after each DID session to measure intake volume. Volume consumed was calculated from weight of solution consumed daily and normalized to body weight. After rapid decapitation, brains and trunk blood samples were collected immediately after the last DID drinking session. BEC measurements were performed as previously described for the LORR study.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were performed using SigmaPlot 12 software, unless noted. Two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey\npost-hoc\ntest was used for statistical analysis of Rota-Rod data to assess neurological impairment and volume of water or ethanol consumed across days (Statistica 6.0.668.0). Two-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey\npost-hoc\ntest was used for statistical analysis of surgical righting time across TBI studies and immunoblot data. Student\nt\ntest was used for all other measurements. Effects were considered to be statistically significant at\np\n\u22640.05. In some instances, statistical outliers (greater than 2 standard deviations\u00b1the group mean) were excluded from analysis. Likewise, in the case of BEC measurements, animals that did not yield sufficient blood volumes for BEC measurement were excluded from analysis."

    "Methods": "This prospective cohort study enrolled a convenience sample of adult trauma patients with and without suspected mild or moderate TBI (MMTBI; Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score of 9 to 15) presenting to the emergency department (ED) within 4\u2009h of trauma. The study site was the ED of a Level I Trauma Center in Orlando Florida. This study was approved by the institutional review board and written informed consent was obtained from each patient and/or their legal authorized representative prior to enrollment.\n\nEligibility for suspected MMTBI was determined by the treating physician based on the history of blunt head trauma followed by either loss of consciousness, amnesia, or disorientation and presenting to the ED within 4\u2009h of injury with a GCS of 9 to 15. Eligibility also was prospectively verified by the research team prior to enrollment. Head CT scans were performed at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients were excluded if they: 1) were younger than 18 years old; 2) had no history of trauma as their primary event (e.g., syncope or seizure); 3) had known dementia, chronic psychosis, or active central nervous system pathology; 4) were pregnant; 5) were incarcerated; or 6) had a systolic blood pressure of less than 100\u2009mm Hg.\n\nThe non-TBI general trauma group included patients with a GCS score of 15 presenting to the ED with a traumatic mechanism of injury but without TBI. They experienced similar mechanisms of injury as the MMTBI group but all had a normal mental status since injury (as verified by the research team) and had no evidence of acute brain injury or hemodynamic instability. These patients were carefully screened to ensure they had no loss of consciousness, no amnesia, and no alteration in sensorium at any time after injury. The purpose of enrolling both TBI and general trauma patients was to simulate the real world setting in which TBI biomarkers would be used.\n\nAll initial patient assessments were made by board certified emergency medicine physicians trained by a formal 1-h session on evaluating patient eligibility. At the time of enrollment, the study team carefully reassessed every patient to ensure each patient met inclusion criteria and verified any exclusion. Blood samples were obtained from each TBI and trauma patient within 4\u2009h of the reported time of injury. A single vial of approximately 5\u2009mL of blood was collected and placed in clot tubes with a serum separator and allowed to clot at room temperature. The blood was centrifuged within 30\u2009min and the serum was placed in bar-coded aliquot containers and stored in a freezer at \u221270\u00b0C until it was transported to a central laboratory (Banyan Biomarkers Inc.; Alachua, FL). There, the samples were analyzed in batches using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to GFAP and S100\u03b2. After assessment and treatment in the ED patients were either discharged home or admitted to hospital based on severity of their injuries and patient management was not altered by the study.\n\nTrauma patients underwent standard CT scan of the head according to the judgment of the treating physician. The CT scan ordering pattern at the participating Level I trauma centers is such that most patients with blunt head injury with subsequent symptoms have a head CT scan performed as part of usual care. Physicians also ordered CT scans of the head on the general trauma controls based on mechanism or clinical circumstances. CT examinations were interpreted by board-certified radiologists who recorded location, extent, and type of brain injury. Radiologists were blinded to the study protocol but had the usual clinical information. Lab personnel running the samples were blinded to the clinical data.\n\nOutcome measures\nThe primary outcome measure was the presence of intracranial lesions on initial CT scan. Intracranial lesions on CT included any acute traumatic intracranial lesions visualized on CT scan. The secondary outcome measure included the performance of the biomarkers in the presence of extracranial fractures, including both 1) extracranial fractures on head CT (scalp or facial hematomas, facial fractures, and isolated skull fractures), and 2) extracranial fractures below the head including torso (chest, pelvis, and spine fractures) and extremity (limb) fractures.\n\nData analysis\nDescriptive statistics with means and proportions were used to describe the data. For statistical analysis, biomarker levels were treated as continuous data, measured in ng/mL and expressed as medians with interquartile range. Data were assessed for equality of variance and distribution. Logarithmic transformations were conducted on non-normally distributed data. Group comparisons for different CT categories were performed using analysis of variance with multiple comparisons using Bonferoni's correction. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were created to explore the ability of the biomarkers to detect intracranial lesions on CT scan. Estimates of the area under these curves (AUC) were obtained (AUC=0.5 indicates no discrimination and an AUC=1.0 indicates a perfect diagnostic test). Classification performance was assessed by sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value with 95% confidence intervals. GFAP and S100\u03b2 cut-off points were selected based on the ROC curve to maximize the sensitivity and correctly identify as many patients with CT lesions as possible. All analyses were performed using the statistical software package PASW 17.0 (IBM Corporation\n\u00ae\n; Somers, NY).\nSample size calculations took into consideration earlier studies on GFAP and S100\u03b2.\n26\n,\n27\nAdditionally, preliminary data from our group on the performance of GFAP and S100\u03b2 provided data to calculate a sample size for distinguishing TBI patients with a positive CT versus a negative CT in the presence of fractures. A sample of 10 patients from the positive CT group and 100 from the negative CT group achieves 80% power to detect a difference of 0.17 (estimated to be between 0.15 to 0.20) between a diagnostic test (GFAP) with an AUC of 0.90 and another diagnostic test (S100\u03b2) with an AUC of 0.73 (estimated to be between 0.70 to 0.75) using a two-sided\nz\n-test at a significance level of 0.05.\n\nBiomarker analysis\nSerum GFAP levels were measured in duplicate for each sample using a validated ELISA platform (Banyan Biomakers Inc.). The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for this assay is 0.030\u2009ng/mL and upper limit of quantification is 50\u2009ng/mL. The limit of detection (LOD) is 0.008\u2009pg/mL. Serum S100\u03b2 levels were measured in duplicate for each sample using an ELISA platform which is for research purposes only. The assay calibrators range from 0.016ng/mL to 2ng/mL. LOD of the S100\u03b2 assay at 0.017\u2009ng/mL and the LLOQ at 0.083\u2009ng/mL. Any samples yielding a signal over the quantification or calibrator range were diluted and re-assayed."

    "Methods": "Animals\nMale C57BL/6N mice (12\u201316 weeks old; CLEA Japan, Tokyo, Japan) were housed and allowed to habituate for more than 1 week before the start of experimentation. Food and water were available\nad libitum\nthroughout the experiments. Animals were maintained in a temperature- (23\u00b11\u00b0C) and humidity-controlled room (55\u00b12%) on a 12-h light-dark cycle. All experimental protocols conformed to the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health\nGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\n(1996) and were approved by the committee for care and use of laboratory animals at Kochi University (Kochi, Japan).\n\nExperimental concussion and drug treatment\nExperimental concussion was induced using the concussive head trauma device. Detailed descriptions of this device can be found in previously published articles.\n24\n,\n25\nBriefly, the device consisted of a vertical metal guide tube (diameter, 15\u2009mm; length, 90\u2009cm) through which a metal weight (40\u2009g) was dropped from the full length of the tube. The right temporal region of the mouse's head, between the corner of the eye and the ear, was positioned under the tube while the head was manually supported and immobilized by a sponge. Sham control animals were anesthetized, but did not undergo concussion.\nMice were divided randomly into four groups for each treatment: 1) concussion plus vehicle-treated group; 2) concussion plus edaravone, selective 5-LOX inhibitor (BWB70C), or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitor (apocynin)-treated group; 3) sham plus vehicle-treated group; and 4) sham plus edaravone, BWB70C, or apocynin-treated group.\nEdaravone, which was donated by Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharm (Osaka, Japan), was dissolved in 1\u2009M of NaOH and titrated with 1\u2009M of HCl to a pH of 7.4. This solution was then diluted with saline to an edaravone concentration of 0.3\u2009mg/mL. Immediately after the concussive brain injury, mice received a single 3.0-mg/kg intravenous (i.v.) injection of either edaravone or vehicle.\nBWB70C (Sigma-Aldrich, Louis, MO) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Immediately and 24\u2009h after concussive brain injury, mice received 2 consecutive i.v. injections of either BWB70C (0.1 and 3\u2009mg/kg) or vehicle. Mice received a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of apocynin (50\u2009mg/kg; Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in DMSO or vehicle 30\u2009min before concussion.\nFor the dose-response study, mice were divided randomly into five groups and were subjected to concussion following the procedures described earlier. Mice were then administered edaravone at 0.1, 1.0, or 3.0\u2009mg/kg. For the therapeutic time-window study, mice were divided randomly into six groups, subjected to concussion, underwent the same procedure of concussion as described, and administered edaravone at 1, 3, or 6\u2009h after concussion.\n\nNeurological assessment\nThe neurological status of each mouse was assessed with an extensive set of tests 1 and 24\u2009h after the concussive brain injury.\n24\nThe tests evaluated the hind-leg flexion reflex (when raised by the tail), righting reflex (ability to fall on all four legs after a short drop), secreting signs (around the mouth and eye), balance beam task, beam walking coordination task, and exploration and locomotor activity tests previously described by Royle and colleagues and Shapira and colleagues.\n26\n,\n27\nImportantly, none of the injured mice showed any abnormalities in these neurological tests. Mice were allowed to recover from the concussion procedure for 2 days before performing the forced swim test (FST) to avoid influence of neurological assessment.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging\nAnimals were examined with a 9.4-T scanner (Varian NMR Systems 400WB; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) with an actively shielded gradient coil (ID=25\u2009cm). A custom-built birdcage resonator (ID=55\u2009mm) was used as a radiofrequency coil. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI], T1, and T2) was conducted during the 4\u2009h after the CBI and was repeated at 24 and 72\u2009h. A DWI was acquired for each animal using a spin echo/echo planar imaging sequence with the following parameters: field of view (FOV)=2\u00d72\u2009cm; matrix=128\u00d7128; slice thickness (THK)=1\u2009mm; number of slices (NS)=9; repetition time (TR)=2500 ms; echo time (TE)=38 ms; number of averages (NA)=1;\nb\n-values=1.94, 64.38, 251.71, 563.92, and 1001.01\u2009s/mm\n2\n; \u0394=5 ms; and \u0394=25\u2009ms. T1-weighted images were acquired using a multiple spin echo sequence (FOV=2\u00d72\u2009cm; matrix=128\u00d7128; THK=1\u2009mm; NS=9; NA=1; TR=290 ms; and TE=14\u2009ms); T2-weighted MRIs were acquired using a multiple spin echo sequence (FOV=2\u00d72\u2009cm; matrix=128\u00d7128; THK=1\u2009mm; NS=9; NA=1; TR=3000 ms; and TE=60\u2009ms).\n\nForced swim test\nUsing previously described procedures, we conducted the FST 3 days after the CBI to assess depressive-like behavior.\n23\n,\n25\nBriefly, each mouse was placed in a glass cylinder (height, 24\u2009cm; diameter, 13\u2009cm) containing 14\u2009cm of water maintained at 22\u201323\u00b0C. The mouse remained in the cylinder for 6\u2009min, and the duration of immobility was recorded during the last 4\u2009min of the 6-min testing period. A mouse was considered immobile when it stopped swimming and floated in the water motionless, except for movements necessary to keep its head above water. Two observers blinded to the treatment condition scored the immobility times. The observers' scores agreed in over 94% of the behavioral tests.\n\nTissue preparation and immunohistochemistry\nMice were killed 24\u2009h postconcussion or 3\u2009h after the last BWB70C injection. Brains were removed after transcardial perfusion (TCP) with 0.9% saline and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were postfixed overnight in 4% PFA and then cryoprotected by immersion in 20% sucrose for 24\u2009h. Coronal sections were cut with a 30-\u03bcm thickness for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC).\nIHC was performed on corresponding serial sections. In brief, sections were blocked for 30\u2009min in 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 in 10\u2009mM of phosphate-buffered saline. For single labeling of 5-LOX, sections were incubated with goat anti-5-LOX antibody (Ab; dilution, 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) overnight at 4\u00b0C followed by the addition of Alexa Fluor 594\u2013conjugated donkey anti-goat immunoglobulin G (IgG; dilution, 1:500; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at room temperature for 2\u2009h. For 5-LOX/CD11b or 5-LOX/GFAP double-labeling immunofluorescence (IF), sections were incubated with goat anti-5-LOX Ab and rat anti-CD11b Ab (1:100; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), or rabbit anti-GFAP Ab (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4\u00b0C, which was followed by the addition of Alexa Fluor 594\u2013conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (dilution, 1:500; Invitrogen) and Alexa Fluor 488\u2013conjugated donkey anti-rat IgG, or Alexa Fluor 488\u2013conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (dilution, 1:500; Invitrogen) at room temperature for 2\u2009h. Nuclei were stained by 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), and fluorescent signals from double-labeled sections were analyzed using a confocal microscope (FV-100D; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) at 400\u00d7 magnification. Nuclei double labeled with DAPI and 5-LOX were counted in representative micrographs of each hippocampal region to quantify the fluorescent signal.\n\nWestern blotting\nWestern blotting was used to detect nitrotyrosine or 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) levels in mouse brains subjected to either concussion or sham operation. Briefly, the cortex and hippocampus were rapidly dissected on an ice-chilled stage 1 day postconcussion and were then lysed using M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were centrifuged for 10\u2009min (15,000\u2009rpm at 4\u00b0C), and the supernatants were collected. Protein concentrations were determined with a bicinchoninic acid assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n29\nAn aliquot from each protein sample was separated on a sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis precast gel and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated with primary anti-nitrotyrosine Ab (1:2000; Millipore, Billerica, MA), anti-4-HNE Ab (1:5000; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), or anti-\u03b2-actin Ab (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4\u00b0C overnight. The following day, membranes were incubated with horseradish-peroxidase\u2013linked anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000; GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) for 1\u2009h at room temperature and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare). Quantitation was performed with a densitometric analysis using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are expressed as the mean\u00b1standard error of the mean, and the statistical analyses were performed using Statview (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Quantification of IHC and depressive-like behaviors were analyzed with a one- or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by a post-hoc Fischer's protected least significant difference multiple comparison test."

    "Methods": "All animal use protocols were approved by the Purdue University Animal Use and Care Committee (West Lafayette, IN). Adult Long Evans rats (\u223c300\u2009g) were anesthetized with 90\u2009mg/kg of ketamine and 5\u2009mg/kg of xylazine. A T10 laminectomy was performed to expose the underlying thoracic spinal cord. Spinal cord contusion was produced using a weight-drop device developed at New York University (NYU model).15Briefly, the exposed dorsal surface of the cord was subjected to a weight-drop impact using a 10-g rod (2.5\u2009mm in diameter) dropped from a height of 12.5\u2009mm. After the injury, the muscles and skin were closed in layers, and rats were placed on a heating pad to maintain their body temperature until they awoke. Two hours after injury, ferulic-acid\u2013conjugated glycol chitosan (FA-GC) nanomedicine in 1\u2009mL of saline was given to rats by intravenous injection into the jugular vein. Both ferulic acid and glycol chitosan have neuroprotective effects, such as antioxidation and -inflammation.16\u201322. The analgesic, buprenorphine (0.05\u20130.10\u2009mg/kg), was administered every 12\u2009h through subcutaneous injection for the first 3 days postsurgery for postoperation pain management. Bladder expression was manually carried out 3 times a day until reflex bladder emptying was established. Because this study is a proof of concept, we did not conduct a quantification analysis, and 1 rat was used for each group.\n\nFour weeks postinjury, animals were anesthetized and transcardially exsanguinated with 150\u2009mL of physiological saline followed by fixation with 300\u2009mL of ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4). A 1.5-cm thoracic spinal cord segment at the lesion center was dissected and then fixed for 4\u2009h by 4% PFA in PBS (PH 7.4) and transferred to 30% sucrose in PBS (pH 7.4). For cross-sectional imaging, spinal cord tissue was sectioned at 80\u2009\u03bcm, transferred into heavy water (D2O) for 5\u2009min, and then was placed in a glass-bottomed dish and embedded in D2O agarose gel.\n\nAs shown inFigure 1, a Nd:YAG pumped optical parametric oscillator (OPO; Panther\u00aeEx Plus; Continuum, Santa Clara, CA) was used as the excitation source. The excitation module provides 10-Hz, 5-ns pulses laser with the wavelength range from 400 up to 2500\u2009nm. The near-infrared light, produced at the idler beam from the OPO, was directed to an inverted microscope (IX-71; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) for spectroscopy and imaging purposes. The laser irradiation was focused by an achromatic doublet lens (30-mm focal length; Thorlabs, Inc., Newton, NJ). A focused-type, 20-MHz ultrasound transducer with a 50% bandwidth (V317; Olympus NDT) was employed to detect the PA signal. A 30-dB low-noise preamplifier (5682; Olympus NDT Inc., Waltham, MA) and a receiver (5073PR-15-U; Olympus NDT) with adjustable gain were applied for receiving signal. The signal was then sent to a digitizer (USB-5133; National Instruments Corporation, Austin, TX), recorded by personal computer (PC) by a LabVIEW (National Instruments) program. PA spectra were taken by automatic laser wavelength scanning of the OPO system. For the 3D PA imaging, a two-dimensional (2D) scanning stage (ProScan H117; Prior Scientific, Inc., Rockland, MA) was employed for the raster scanning. All 2D images were reconstructed using a MATLAB program (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA), while 3D images and movies were built by ImageJ (National Institutes of Health [NIH], Bethesda, MD)."

    "Methods": "The protocols used in the present study were approved by the animal ethics board (AUP979) of the University of Health Network, Toronto, Canada. The study design is summarized inFigure 1.\n\nSurgical preparation and SCI model\nFemale Wistar rats weighing approximately 250\u2013300\u2009g were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and placed on a platform (Vevo imaging station, Visualsonics, Toronto, Canada) with a custom-made animal stabilization frame (\nFig. 2\n). The incisor teeth were used to secure the rat into a nose cone attached to the frame and connected to the anesthesia system. A laminectomy was performed from the 10th thoracic (Th10) vertebra to Th12. The tips of a hemostatic forceps connected to the frame were bent to fit the transverse processes of Th13. Once Th13 was clamped, the spine was slightly tightened and lifted up from the platform, and then stabilized by locking the frame. Stabilization prevented spinal cord movements induced by the animal's respiration without affecting breathing. Spinal cord injury was performed at Th11 using a 35\u2009g custom-modified aneurysm clip, and compression was maintained for 60\u2009sec.\n24\n,\n25\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nExperimental approach and ultrasound platform schematic. If the spine is not stabilized, the respiratory motions generate distortions in the reconstructed axial slice (red arrows). With stabilization, the respiratory artifacts are no longer observed.\n\nUS imaging\nUltrasound gel (Ultrasound Scanning Gel, Medi-Inn, Canada) was applied on the dorsal aspect of the dura mater. The VHRUS probe (44\u2009MHz, Vevo 770, Visualsonics, Toronto, Canada) was attached to the rail mount of the Vevo Integrated Rail system III (Visualsonics, Toronto, Canada) by an integrated clamp. At the junction between the clamp and the rail, the motor stage allowed three-dimensional (3D) acquisitions. The rail mount was then pulled down until the distance between the acoustic window (top of the real-time image) and the middle of the spinal cord (identified by the central canal) was 6\u2009mm (the focal length of the transducer). The scanhead was rotated and tilted to obtain a strict sagittal view and its position was locked. VHRUS acquisitions were made either in B-mode or in power Doppler mode. For each mode, two-dimensional (2D) and 3D acquisitions were performed.\nTo perform 3D acquisitions, the 3D motor stage traveled a distance of 6\u2009mm in a series of steps from the left to the right of the spinal cord. At each step, the scanhead took a 2D image (i.e. slice), and the distance between each slice was 102\u2009\u03bcm. Each slice was stacked and assembled together to form a 3D file. Each 3D acquisition took 7\u2009sec in B-mode and 4\u2009min in power Doppler mode.\n\nHistology\nAnimals were anesthetized terminally with an overdose of inhalation isoflurane and perfused intracardially with 60\u2009mL phosphate buffered saline 5 times, then with 60\u2009mL 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) once. The spinal cord was isolated, placed in 4% PFA for tissue fixation and then in 30% sucrose at 4\u00b0C overnight. The spinal cord was then embedded in OCT\n\u2122\n(Tissue-Tek,\n\u00ae\nSakura,\n\u00ae\nTorrance, CA) and sagittal cryosections 20 microns thick were obtained and placed on slides for histological analysis stained using hematoxylin and eosin (HE).\nIn the animals kept alive for imaging at 24\u2009h, the extent of BSCB disruption was examined by injecting 2% Evans blue dye through the femoral vein 30\u2009min before sacrificial perfusion. Evans blue binds to albumin and can only extravasate across a disrupted BSCB. It autofluoresces and in the case of BSCB disruption, its extravasation can be directly imaged with a fluorescent microscope (DMR8, Leica, Solms, Germany).\n\nPart 1. Structural and vascular anatomy of the intact spinal cord\nIn six sham-operated animals, two 3D acquisitions were successively performed in B-mode and power Doppler mode before harvesting the spinal cords for histologic evaluation. These 3D files were subsequently processed with Osirix software (Pixmeo, Geneva, Switzerland) to obtain multiplanar reconstructions (MPR) that describe the structural (gray and white matter) and vascular anatomy of the intact spinal cord.\n\nPart 2. Characterization of post-SCI changes observed with VHRUS\nTwo sets of 12 animals each (6 injured, 6 sham-operated) were used to characterize the images obtained at the acute (90\u2009min) and subacute (24\u2009h) phases. For each animal, the spinal cord was harvested for histological analysis to characterize the tissue changes detected by VHRUS.\n\nPart 3. Quantification of PH and BSCB disruption with VHRUS\nTwo sets of 22 rats each (\nn\n=16 injured rats, 6 sham-operated) were used to assess PH in the acute phase (90\u2009min) with VHRUS as well as with Drabkin reagent. The extent of BSCB disruption in the subacute phase (24\u2009h) was measured by examining vascular permeability, which is correlated with the amount of extravasated parenchymal Evans blue.\n26\nSpectrophotometric quantification of PH\nAfter 24\u2009h post-SCI, Evans blue was injected through the femoral vein 30\u2009min before sacrificial perfusion. A 1-cm segment of spinal cord centered on T11 (the lesion epicenter) was isolated, crushed into powder, sonicated, weighed, and split into two equal samples\u2014one to quantify the amount of extravasated hemoglobin (PH) using Drabkin assay and the other to quantify the amount of extravasated Evans blue by spectrophotometry (Wallac 1420 VICTOR2\n\u2122\nPerkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) as described previously.\n27\u201330\nVHRUS quantification of PH\nThe 3D files were analyzed with ImageJ software. First, the contrast was set to maximum so that each pixel whose value was inferior to \u201c127\u201d became black (i.e., \u201c0\u201d) whereas the other ones became white (i.e., \u201c255\u201d) (\nFig. 3\n). The analysis was then performed on a stack of 15 sagittal slices centered on the midline. On each slice, a 10-mm long region of interest (ROI) corresponding to a complete segment of spinal cord was delineated, and the software calculated the sum of values of all pixels belonging to the ROI (\u201cVHRUS-Slice-Score\u201d). All the VHRUS-Slice-Scores were added together to obtain the \u201cVHRUS-Global-Score.\u201d Each VHRUS-Global-Score was measured by three independent observers to determine the interobserver variability and twice by one observer to determine the intraobserver variability.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nVery high resolution ultrasound (VHRUS) quantification analysis methodology. The pixel brightness in contrast-enhanced images can readily and reliably identify the difference between \u201cinjured\u201d and \u201cuninjured\u201d spinal cord tissue. ROI, region of interest.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed with Graphpad Prism software (La Jolla, CA). To determine whether a correlation existed between the values obtained by spectrophotometry and the VHRUS-Global-Score, the Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated. The intraobserver and interobserver variabilities in measuring the VHRUS-Global-Scores were similarly assessed by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient.\nTime-lapse VHRUS video recording\nTo characterize the development of the PH, a time-lapse video was generated by acquiring a midline slice every minute. The first slice was acquired at 2\u2009min post-SCI, and the VHRUS-Slice-Score was calculated at 2 (used as the baseline), 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90\u2009min post-SCI. Each VHRUS-Slice-Score was expressed as a percentage of the baseline."

    "Methods": "Patients and data collection\nThe ethics committee of Helsinki University Hospital (Helsinki, Finland) approved the study and waived the need for informed consent. The study population constituted of patients with moderate-to-severe TBI (admission Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] 3\u201312) or complicated mild TBI (mTBI; admission GCS 13\u201315) treated in the ICU of one of the largest level 1 trauma centers in Scandinavia (T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6 Hospital, Helsinki University Hospital, catchment area population approximately 2 million) during a 4-year period (January 2009\u2013December 2012). Definition of TBI was an S06.1\u2013S06.9 ICD-10 (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Edition) diagnosis, caused by an external force.\n17\nPatients with a history of head trauma, but no intracranial pathological findings (by computed tomography [CT] imaging) during the hospital stay, and those with subacute head injuries (>24\u2009h) were not considered. Further exclusion criteria were age <16 years, penetrating head injury, dead on arrival, and death before CT imaging and/or ICU admission.\n10\n,\n11\nAdmission characteristics were assessed by an emergency department physician and were retrieved from subsequent electronic records. Patient head CT scans were retrospectively classified by a radiologist-neurosurgeon (R.K.) according to the Marshall and Rotterdam CT classification systems.\n18\n,\n19\nThe APACHE II variables were extracted from the ICU software (PICIS, Anesthesia Manager\n\u00ae\n) by 5-minute intervals to pinpoint the worst physiological and laboratory values measured in the first 24\u2009h in the ICU.\n11\nTreatment standards in the hospital followed the Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines.\n20\nOutcome was 6-month mortality and neurological outcome. Non-Finnish citizens were excluded from the study, because they are not routinely followed up. Data on mortality were retrieved from the Finnish population register center (available for 100% of Finnish patients). Neurological outcome was determined based on outpatient clinic follow-ups by a neurosurgeon or neurologist 6 months from injury according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), independently by two authors (R.R., J.S.), and dichotomized to unfavorable (GOS 1\u20133: death, vegetative state, or severe disability) and favorable (GOS 4\u20135: moderate disability and good recovery) outcome.\n21\nGOS assessment agreement was good, with a kappa of 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86\u20130.95); discrepancies were resolved by verbal discussion.\n\nPrediction models\nThe IMPACT and APACHE II scores were calculated using the original methods.\n10\n,\n11\nThe APACHE II is based upon 12 physiological variables (the most abnormal value measured in the first 24\u2009h in the ICU), age, and chronic health status, giving a single score of 0\u201371. The IMPACT consists of three different models with increasing complexity (core, extended, and lab). The simplest IMPACT core consists of only age, motor score, and pupillary light reactivity and gives a single maximum score of 15. Addition of CT (epidural hematoma, traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, and Marshall CT classification) and secondary insult (hypoxia and hypotension) variables results in the IMPACT extended (maximal score, 22), and further addition of glucose and hemoglobin concentrations gives the IMPACT lab (maximum score, 29). None of the variables from the IMPACT and APACHE II overlap because they are measured on two separate occasions (measured on admission for IMPACT and measured during the first 24\u2009h in the ICU for APACHE II).\nFor the development and internal validation of the new models, a split-sample technique, where the study population was randomly divided into a development and validation cohort, was used to mimic randomization.\n22\nThree new models were created using logistic regression: 1) the IMPACTcore\u2013APAHCE II; 2) the IMPACText\u2013APACHE II; and 3) the IMPACTlab\u2013APACHE II. Each model was designed for 6-month mortality and unfavorable neurological outcome prediction using the following equation: 1/(1+e\n-logit\n), where each model has its own defined logit. To validate our results, secondary internal validation, using a resample bootstrap technique, was performed.\n23\nThe equations of the new prediction models and the bootstrapped coefficients are found in the\nSupplementary Equations\n(see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n).\n\nStatistical analyses\nCategorical data are presented as\nn\n(%) and continuous data as median (interquartile range; IQR), unless otherwise mentioned. Differences between patients with good and poor outcome and between the validation and development cohort were tested using the chi-square (\u03c7\n2\n; two-tailed) test for categorical variables. Continuous data were tested for skewness and appropriate statistical test chosen accordingly for univariate analyses: the Mann-Whitney's U test for skewed data and the Student's\nt\n-test for normal distributed data.\nThe performance of the models was evaluated by assessing discrimination (by area under the receiver operator characteristic curve [AUC]), calibration (by GiViTI [Gruppo Italiano per la Valutazione degli Interventi in Terapia Intensiva, or Italian Group for the Evaluation of Interventions in Intensive Care Medicine] calibration belt and the Hosmer-Lemeshow \u0108-test [H-L]), and precision (Brier score).\n24\nDiscrimination refers to the model's ability to distinguish patients with good and poor outcome and is measured by the AUC. The AUC ranges from 0.5 (worst) to 1.0 (perfect). Generally, AUCs >0.90 are considered excellent, >0.80 good, >0.70 satisfactory, and <0.70 poor.\n25\nThe AUC of the new models were compared to the original models using the Venkatraman test.\n26\nWe also compared the performance of the new models to the original models by the continuous net reclassification improvement (NRI) test.\n27\nThe NRI calculates the proportion of patients with outcome correctly assigned a higher probability and patients without outcome correctly assigned a lower probability by the new model, compared to the original model.\nCalibration refers to the model's ability to differ between good and poor outcome over the whole risk spectrum. The calibration is classically measured using the H-L (also called the goodness-of-fit test). The H-L test divides the patients into equal-sized deciles (compared to the \u0124 test, which divides patients into deciles based on risk rather than group size), for which it calculates a \u03c7\n2\nbetween the observed and predicted risk.\n28\np\nvalues over 0.05 indicate no statistical difference between the predicted and observed risk and the calibration is considered good, whereas\np\nvalues under 0.05 indicate a significant difference between predicted and observed risk and the model is consequently considered to be poorly calibrated.\n28\nHowever, the H-L test is largely sample-size dependent and has been criticized.\n29\nTo meet the critique of the H-L test, the GiViTI calibration belt was developed.\n30\nThe GiViTI test calculates the relationship between the observed and predicted risks by fitting a polynomial function between the two and calculates the 80% CI (light gray area) and 95% CI (dark gray area). The diagonal bisector line indicates perfect calibration, and a statistically significant deviation between the predicted and observed outcome (i.e., poor calibration) occurs when the 95% CIs do not encompass the bisector line. This makes it possible to visually identify risk intervals of model over- and underprediction.\nPrecision is an overall performance indicator, and measured by the Brier score is the average of the sum of the squared difference between observed and predicted risk.\n31\nThe Brier score ranges from 0.0 (perfect) to 0.25 (worst), with a 50% incidence of the outcome. When the outcome incidence is lower, the worst Brier score is lower. Accordingly, we performed the scaled Brier test calculating specific cut-off points for our data.\nSPSS (version 21.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY), R (A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing; R-Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), and Analyze-it for Microsoft Excel (version 3.5; Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) were used for the statistical analyses. The PredictABEL library and was used for the H-L and NRI tests, the GiViTI library for the calibration belts, and the pROC library for the Venkatraman test.\n30\n,\n32\n,\n33"

    "Methods": "Patients\nThe Committee for Clinical Investigations approved this study, including review of medical records. General medical consent for treatment and/or an additional consent for sedation (if indicated) was obtained from parents and/or legal guardians.\nAHT infants and toddlers\nWe conducted a retrospective review of term infants and toddlers greater than 3 months of age admitted to an academic children's hospital between 2005 and 2008, who underwent MRI with DTI during clinical assessment and had a subsequent diagnosis of AHT. AHT patients less than 3 months of age were excluded because different DTI protocols are used for this age group. For the purposes of this study we grouped all head injuries caused by abuse into the single category of AHT. In reaching a diagnosis of AHT,\n5\n,\n32\n,\n33\nthese infants/toddlers underwent a comprehensive assessment by the hospital's child protection team that included evaluation by a pediatrician board-certified in Pediatrics, Child Abuse Pediatrics, and Developmental-Behavioral Pediatrics and a social worker with extensive expertise in the field of child abuse.\nFactors taken into account included histories provided by the caregivers, findings on physical examination, other unexplained injuries, consultation with subspecialists, review of available previous radiographic studies and/or medical records, and information provided from law enforcement and Child Protective Services. In all cases, underlying medical conditions and/or accidental trauma, which could mimic AHT, were ruled out. Defining abuse using the assessment of a child protection team is a commonly used standard employed in previous studies.\nClassification of outcome within the AHT cohort\nAHT outcomes were classified in accordance with the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category Scale (PCPCS) based on medical chart review performed by the same pediatrician who conducted the acute comprehensive assessment and provided follow-up clinical care to the infants and toddlers in this cohort. The PCPCS was performed between 6 and 9 months after discharge. The PCPCS includes six categories used to summarize the level of neurological function in pediatric patients with TBI with the following outcomes: (1) normal (e.g., can perform all age-appropriate activities); (2) mild disability (e.g., conscious alert and able to interact in most age-appropriate activities but may have mild neurological deficit); (3) moderate disability (e.g., conscious, with sufficient cerebral function for age-appropriate independent activities of daily living, but has significant cognitive impairment); (4) severe disability (e.g., conscious but dependent on others for daily support because of impaired brain function including need for rehabilitation services and gastrostomy tube placement); (5) coma or vegetative state; and (6) brain death. Patients were dichotomized into two groups: (A) mild or moderate (categories 1\u20133 on the PCPCS) and (B) severe neurological dysfunction (categories 4\u20136 on the PCPCS).\nComparison cohort\nFor comparison purposes, we also included data from term infants of similar post-conceptual age (PCA) who underwent MRIs at the same institution during the same period. Clinical indication for MRIs included possible seizure activity, concern for meningitis, vascular malformations, and/or hydrocephalus, with findings indicating no structural abnormalities. Medical records were reviewed by a board certified neonatologist and neuropsychologist who determined that all comparison cohort participants did not have histories of chromosomal abnormalities, mitochondrial diseases, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, neurologic symptoms, and/or other underlying medical conditions that would portend a poor neurologic outcome.\n\nMR and CT imaging\nA board certified neuroradiologist reviewed all neuroimaging. All imaging was obtained in a 1.5T General Electric System (GE-Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) with a neonatal or pediatric head coil and included the following sequences: Fast Spin Echo T2-weighted imaging (TE/TR=85/5000\u2009msec, field of view=20\u2009cm, matrix=320\u00d7160 or 256\u00d7128); Axial Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery FLAIR (TE/TR=120/9000\u2009msec, field of view=20\u2009cm, matrix=320\u00d7160 or 256\u00d7128); and diffusion tensor imaging (an echo-planar imaging sequence with the following parameters: TE/TR=80/10000\u2009msec, field of view=22\u2009cm, matrix=128\u00d7128, slice thickness=5\u2009mm, spacing=0 applied along 25 non-collinear directions with a b-value of 700\u20131000\u2009s/mm\n2\n. CT imaging protocol included a standard multi-detector 5\u2009mm collimated slice acquisition using low-dose pediatric protocols.\n\nBrain metric measurements\nBrain metrics previously validated as measures of brain growth and/or atrophy in infants and toddlers were measured on T1- and T2-weighted images using Synapse software (Fuji) in accordance with previous publications.\n34\nThese 15 standard head and brain measurements (\nSupplementary Tables 1\nand\n2\n; see online supplementary material at\nftp.liebertpub.com\n) were manually placed by a single person who was blinded to subject status and then confirmed by a neuroradiologist.\n\nDTI metrics\nThis study focused on mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and fractional anisotropy (FA). These metrics can be readily calculated from DTI data using available post-processing tools and reflect both the extent and directionality of water diffusion. Specifically, AD indicates the amount of diffusion along the principal axis, RD indicates the mean of the diffusivity along the two minor axes, and MD indicates the average diffusion along all three axes. FA indicates the strength of directional diffusion, ranging from 0 (isotropic) to 1 (anisotropic).\n\nDTI post-processing\u2014Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS)\nDTI data analysis was performed using Oxford University's FMRIB FSL software (Version 4.1.4;\nwww.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fsl/downloading.html\n).\n35\nOur protocol for TBSS\n36\nwas similar to other published methods previously optimized for infants and toddlers.\n37\nVoxelwise statistics were performed using Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement and corrected for age and multiple comparisons.\n\nAnalysis of DTI metrics in gray matter\nBecause the TBSS methods are only sensitive for analyzing microstructural changes in WM, we included additional regions of interest (ROI) measurements in select gray matter structures known to be vulnerable to injury in the setting of hypoxic-ischemia or trauma: basal ganglia (BG), thalamus (Thal) and medial occipital-parietal cortical gray matter. Consistent with previous publications in our laboratory,\n36\ncontours were placed on the anatomically defined ROIs using the combined information from the FA and MD maps.\n\nStatistical analysis (brain metric measurements and clinical data)\nBilateral measurements were compared using the Student\nt\ntest. Clinical variables and conventional imaging comparisons between outcome groups (mild/moderate vs. severe) were performed using the Mann-Whitney\nU\ntest (non-parametric alternative to the Student\nt\ntest for independent samples) and the Fisher exact test. Comparisons of DTI outcome data (mild/moderate vs. severe) were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney\nU\ntest. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Version 19.5 (IBM SPSS, IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, 2010) was used for all statistical analyses."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats obtained from Harlan (Houston, TX) were used as subjects. Animals were 90\u2013110\u2009d old (350\u2013400\u2009g), and were individually housed in Plexiglas bins (45.70 [length]\u00d723.50 [width]\u00d720.30 [height] cm) with food and water available ad libitum. Subject's bladders were expressed manually in the morning (8:00\u20139:30\nam\n) and evening (6:00\u20137:30\npm\n) until they regained bladder control, which was defined as three consecutive days with an empty bladder at the time of expression. Animals were maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle.\nAll of the experiments reported here were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Texas A&M and all National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of animal subjects were followed.\n\nSurgery\nJugular catheterization\nTo allow for the self-administration of morphine, animals were implanted with a jugular catheter as described previously by Woller and colleagues.\n34\nRats were anesthetized using a combination of 80\u2009mg/kg ketamine and 10\u2009mg/kg xylazine intraperitoneally (IP). While under anesthesia, a catheter consisting of a length of PE50 tubing was inserted into and tied to the jugular vein. Using an 11-gauge stainless steel tube as a guide, this catheter was passed subcutaneously through the body of the animal so that it exited in the back. A back mount cannula pedestal (model 313-00BM-10-SPC; Plastics One Inc., Roanoke, VA) was then implanted subcutaneously and connected to the catheter. The back mount exited the skin between the scapulae and was covered with a dust cap. All incisions were closed using VetBond.\nFor the first 24\u2009h after surgery, the rats were housed in a recovery room maintained at 26.6\u00b0C. The subjects were treated with 100,000\u2009U/kg penicillin G potassium IP immediately after surgery and again 2\u2009d later. To help maintain hydration, the subjects also were given 3.0\u2009mL of saline (0.9%, IP) following surgery. During the 5-d recovery period following surgery, the catheters were flushed with heparinized saline (0.25\u2009mL).\nContusion injury\nFive days after implantation of the jugular catheter, subjects were given a contusion injury as described by Hook and colleagues.\n39\nBriefly, subjects were anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane (5% to induce anesthesia and 2\u20133% for maintenance), and an area approximately 4.5\u2009cm above and below the injury site was shaved and disinfected. A 7-cm incision was made over the spinal cord, and two incisions extending 3\u2009cm rostral and caudal to T12 were made on each side of the vertebral column. The lamina of the T12 vertebra was removed, exposing the spinal tissue. The vertebral column was then fixed within a Multicenter Animal Spinal Cord Injury Study impactor device.\n42\n,\n43\nAnimals were given a moderate contusion injury by allowing a 10\u2009g impactor (outfitted with a 2.5\u2009mm tip) to drop 12.5\u2009mm. The wound was closed with Michel clips. Sham subjects received a laminectomy only.\nFor the first 24\u2009h after surgery, the rats were housed in a recovery room as described previously. All subjects were treated with 100,000\u2009U/kg penicillin G potassium (IP) immediately after surgery and again 2\u2009d later. To help maintain hydration, the subjects also were given 3.0\u2009mL of saline (0.9%, IP) following surgery. The Michel clips were removed 14\u2009d following surgery.\n\nAssessment of motor and sensory recovery\nLocomotor recovery\nLocomotor behavior was assessed using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scale in an open enclosure (99\u2009cm diameter, 23\u2009cm deep) on the day following the contusion injury.\n44\nSubjects were acclimated to the apparatus for 5-min per day for 3\u2009d prior to surgery. Twenty-four hours after surgery, each subject was placed in the open field and observed for 4\u2009min to score locomotor function. All observers had high intra- and inter-observer reliability (all r's>0.89) and were blinded to the subject's experimental treatment.\nLocomotor scores were transformed to help assure that the data were amendable to parametric analyses.\n45\nThis transformation pools BBB scores 2\u20134, removing a discontinuity in the scale. The transformation also pools scores from a region of the scale (14\u201321) that is very seldom used for a moderate contusion injury. By pooling these scores, we obtained an ordered scale that is relatively continuous with units that have approximately equivalent interval spacing. Meeting these criteria allowed us to apply metric operations (computation of mean performance across legs), improve the justification for parametric statistical analyses, and increase statistical power.\nMechanical reactivity\nReactivity was assessed using von Frey stimuli formed from nylon monofilaments (Semmes-Weinstein Anesthesiometer; Stoelting Co., Chicago, IL) and applied to the plantar surface of the hind paws. Subjects were placed into Plexiglas tubes (7.00\u2009cm [internal diameter]\u00d720.00\u2009cm [length]) that had 6.00\u2009cm (length)\u00d71.70\u2009cm (width) notches removed from the sides, to allow the hind limbs to hang freely. After a 15-min acclimation period, the von Frey stimuli were applied to the L5 plantar dermatome between the footpads sequentially at approximately 2\u2009sec intervals until subjects withdrew the paw and vocalized.\n46\nIf no response was observed, testing was terminated at an intensity of 6.65. Both a spinal (motor withdrawal) and supraspinal (vocalization to stimulation) measure of nociceptive reactivity were recorded. Testing continued until both a motor or vocal response was recorded or the maximal intensity of 6.65 was applied. Each subject was tested twice on each foot in a counterbalanced ABBA order. Test sequences were spaced 2\u2009min apart. Stimulus intensity was reported using the formula provided by Semmes-Weinstein: Intensity=log10 (10,000*g force).\nGirdle test\nA measure of at-level neuropathic pain was derived using the girdle test, as described by Christensen and Hulsebosch.\n47\nFor this task, a grid map of the girdle zone for allodynic responding was made on the rats using an indelible marker (44 squares). A single von Frey filament with bending force of 204.14\u2009mN (26\u2009g force) was applied to each point on the grid, and vocalization responses were recorded on a grid map of that animal. Girdle stimulation began at the left-rostral area and continued in a caudal direction until each of the 11 squares in that column was completed. The testing then began in the next column and was repeated until each of the 44 zones had been stimulated. For each subject, the total number of vocalizations was recorded.\nThermal reactivity\nThermal reactivity was assessed using radiant heat in the tail-flick test. Subjects were placed in clear Plexiglas tubes with their tail positioned in a 0.5\u2009cm deep groove, cut into an aluminum block, and allowed to acclimate to the apparatus (IITC Inc., Life Science, CA) and testing room for 15\u2009min. The testing room was maintained at 26.5\u00b0C. Thermal thresholds were then assessed. Thermal reactivity was tested using a halogen light that was focused onto the rat's tail. Prior to testing, the temperature of the light (focused on the tail) was set to elicit a baseline tail-flick response in 3\u20134\u2009sec (average) in intact subjects. This pre-set temperature was maintained across all subjects. In testing, the latency to flick the tail away from the radiant heat source (light) was recorded. If a subject failed to respond, the test trial was automatically terminated after 8\u2009s of heat exposure to prevent tissue damage. Two tests occurred at 2-minute intervals, and the second test tail-flick latencies were recorded as an index of spinal nociceptive reactivity. To confirm that subjects did not respond in the absence of the stimuli, blank trials were also performed. A \u201cfalse alarm\u201d was recorded if subjects made a motor or vocalization response during the blank tests. The blank trials were performed 1\u2009min before or after each sensory test (in a counterbalanced fashion). No false alarms were recorded.\n\nSelf-administration procedure\nApparatus\nSelf-Administration took place in operant chambers (Model E10-10 Coulbourn; Allentown, PA) enclosed in sound-attenuating cubicles. Each chamber was equipped with two levers with a stimulus light positioned over each. During the self-administration sessions, only depressions of the reinforced (right) lever were associated with morphine administration. The left lever was not reinforced. This distinction between the two levers allowed for the assessment of drug-seeking behavior, as animals will press the reinforced lever significantly more times than the non-reinforced lever if they find the drug to be rewarding. Animals in the control, saline, group do not learn an association and should not show increased responding on either lever.\nDrug or saline delivery was controlled by infusion pumps (Razel Scientific Instruments; Stanford, CT) placed outside of the operant box. A 20-mL syringe was placed in each infusion pump and upon depression of the reinforced lever, advanced to deliver an intravenous infusion (160\u2009\u03bcL) over a 6-sec time frame. The chambers were interfaced with two IBM computers, which controlled drug delivery and recorded lever depressions.\nSelf-administration procedure\nIn this experiment, animals were given a sham or contusion injury 5\u2009d after the implantation of a jugular catheter. Twenty-four hours after the contusion injury, baseline tests of locomotor and sensory reactivity were conducted. Based on BBB scores, animals were divided into groups, with scores balanced across groups (\nFig. 1\n). In one group, animals were placed into the self-administration chambers for seven nights beginning 24\u2009h after injury. In the chambers, animals were given access to 0.0 or 1.5\u2009mg morphine (National Institute of Drug Abuse, Bethesda, MD), up to 30\u2009mg morphine/ session. In this early phase post-injury, animals show little to no movement in the hind limbs. This, however, does not affect the ability of the animal to perform the required response. In a previous publication, we showed that contused animals given access to 3.0\u2009mg morphine self-administered the full amount available to them, while those given access to 1.5\u2009mg per infusion did not administer the full amount available.\n34\nAnimals in each group had equivalent BBB scores prior to the self-administration sessions, indicating that the differential responding across doses was not due to differences in motor recovery per se. In addition, animals in the 3.0\u2009mg group would continue to press the lever after the drug was exhausted, further indicating that they can perform the task without difficulty related to their SCI.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nAnimals were implanted with a jugular catheter, and received a contusion or sham injury 5\u2009d later. One group of rats was placed into the self-administration chambers 24\u2009h following spinal cord injury (SCI) or the sham surgery, another group 14\u2009d following SCI or the sham surgery, and a third group 35\u2009d following SCI or the sham surgery. Each group had access to 1.5\u2009mg morphine/ lever depression and up to 30\u2009mg each session.\nA second group of animals were placed into the self-administration chambers in the early chronic (Days 14\u201321) phase of injury. As with the acute group, these animals were placed into the self-administration chambers for 12\u2009h during their dark cycle for seven nights. In the chambers, they were given access to 0.0 or 1.5\u2009mg morphine, up to 30\u2009mg morphine/session. Animals in the final group were placed in the chambers in the late chronic phase of injury (Days 35\u201342). These animals had access to 1.5\u2009mg morphine, up to 30\u2009mg/session, for seven sessions. The dose of morphine per lever press and total dose of morphine available was chosen based on previous studies. This dose of morphine per lever press significantly differentiated self-administration behavior in SCI and sham-injured subjects in the acute phase of spinal injury.\n34\nWoller and colleagues demonstrated that although sham subjects administered the total 30\u2009mg available in the acute phase of injury, contused subjects only administered approximately 10\u2009mg morphine when 1.5\u2009mg was administered with each lever press.\n34\n\nStatistical analysis\nComparisons between the amounts of morphine administered across surgery, dose, and phase of injury, as well as the effects of morphine on recovery of function and molecular endpoints, were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and trend analyses. In experiments with a continuous independent variable (e.g., recovery period), mixed-design ANOVAs were used. In cases where significant between-subject differences were obtained (main effect of a single variable), group means were compared using the Duncan's new multiple range test (\np\n<0.05)."

    "Methods": "Patients and control subjects\nEthical approval for the study protocol was granted by the Research Ethics Committee of the Universidade Luterana do Brasil (CEP ULBRA 2008-239H). From September 2008 to September 2011, in three regional trauma centers, 188 persons with severe TBI (GCS 3\u20138 at emergency department admission) were enrolled in this prospective study. Only patients \u226516 years old and without a history of neurological or psychiatric disease were included in this cohort. On admission to the trauma emergency department, patients were initially evaluated, resuscitated (with crystalloids), and underwent emergency operation when necessary. Only the patients transferred to the trauma ICU within 12\u2009h of the head injury were included in the study.\nClinical outcome variables of severe TBI comprised short-term survival, time for ICU discharge, and neurological assessment using the GCS at the ICU discharge. The circulatory function and GCS scores were monitored at hospital admission, ICU admission, and during ICU stay. All patients were sedated and mechanically ventilated. Corticosteroids were not administered. To establish normal values of plasma DNA, a negative control group was included consisting of 14 healthy male and nine female volunteers without a history of brain damage (median age 30 years; range 19\u201345 and 44 years; range 34\u201365 years, respectively).\n\nBlood sampling\nPeripheral venous blood was collected into ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-containing tubes at ICU admission. Blood samples were centifuged at 1000\u2009g for 10\u2009min; then the plasma was removed (with great care taken not to disturb the pellet) and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until batch evaluation. Blood samples from the control group were collected and processed in the same way.\n\nDNA extraction from plasma samples\nDNA from plasma samples was extracted according to the protocol developed by Boom and associates.\n42\nBriefly, 100\u2009\u03bcL of plasma samples were lysed in 900\u2009\u03bcL of a guanidine thiocyanate (GuSCN) buffer. After lysis, nucleic acids were bound to silica particles and subsequently washed with several solvents (a GuSCN-containing wash buffer, 70% ethanol and acetone) in consecutive steps. After being dried, the nucleic acids were released from the silica particles in 50\u2009\u03bcL of elution buffer.\n\nReal-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\nTheoretical and practical aspects of real-time quantitative PCR were described by Heid and colleagues.\n43\nReal-time quantitative PCR analysis was performed using StepOnePlus\u2122 Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The amplification and product reporting system was based on the 5\u2032 nuclease assay (Taqman assay).\n44\nPlasma DNA was measured using a real-time quantitative PCR assay for the \u03b2-globin gene.\n31\nOur study used primers and probe sequences from human beta globin gene, based in several previous studies related with circulating cell-free DNA. This target is the most studied for this purpose.\n31\n,\n32\n,\n35\n,\n40\n,\n41\n,\n45\nThe \u03b2-globin Taqman system consisted of the amplification primers beta-globin-354F (5\u2032-GTG CAC CTG ACT CCT GAG GAG A-3\u2032), beta-globin-455R (5\u2032-CCT TGA TAC CAA CCT GCC CAG-3\u2032), and a dual-labeled fluorescent probe beta-globin-402T [5\u2032-(FAM) AAG GTG AAC GTG GAT GAA GTT GGT GG (TAMRA)-3\u2032].\n31\nThe expression of quantitative results as kilogenome-equivalents/L was described previously.\n31\nOne genome-equivalent was defined as the amount of a target sequence contained in a single diploid human cell.\n\nStatistical analysis\nContinuous variables were analyzed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to determine the distribution type. Those with a normal distribution were analyzed by the Student\nt\ntest, while those with a non-parametric distribution were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney\nU\ntest or Kruskal-Wallis analysis followed by the Dunn post-test. Correlations were analyzed using the Spearman nonparametric correlation method or linear regression method. The extent to which the DNA concentrations differed between persons surviving or dying in the ICU after severe TBI was assessed using receiver operator characteristics (ROC) plots. The ROC plot is obtained by calculating the sensitivity and specificity for every distinct observed data value, and plotting sensitivity against 1-(specificity). The ROC curve was used to evaluate the optimal cutoff values measured at study entry for prediction of unfavorable outcome. A cutoff point on the curves was chosen to attain the best compromise between sensitivity and specificity for death in the ICU. Logistic regression analysis was performed to eliminate confounding factors, and the dependent variable was the primary outcome (dead/alive). The independent variables tested were age, associated injury, craniotomy, GCS score at hospital admission, and plasma DNA levels. All\np\nvalues presented are two-tailed and the values of\np\n<0.05 were considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "This Canadian multicenter observational study utilized data prospectively collected for the Rick Hansen Spinal Cord Injury Registry (RHSCIR). This ongoing cohort study recruited patients with acute tSCI presenting to one of 31 RHSCIR sites located in 16 cities representing nine of 10 Canadian provinces. Patients presenting to any RHSCIR site within one month from an acute tSCI are eligible for consent and enrollment. Non-traumatic etiologies of SCI (infection, neoplasm, iatrogenic, acute vascular) were excluded. The specific details of the data collection and registry structure is reviewed elsewhere.25\n\nThe subjects were recruited to the RHSCIR from 2004 to December 2012. The final follow-up neurological examination was performed prior to March 31, 2013. We included patients who had a baseline ISNCSCI neurological assessment performed up to a maximum of 30\u2009d from injury, and a follow-up assessment at least 30\u2009d after their baseline assessment. These broad inclusion criteria were selected for several reasons. Unlike a clinical trial where there are set times for assessments, registry data reflects clinical practice and the baseline neurological assessment is performed within a wider range, usually at the time of presentation to a specialized SCI center. Further, some clinical trials in SCI recruit in the very early acute phase while others recruit sub-acutely; thus, we included baseline examinations up to 30\u2009d post-injury to enhance the generalizability of our results.\n\nThe change in upper extremity motor score (UEMS; maximum, 50) and change in total motor score (TMS; maximum, 100) were defined as the difference between the most recent follow-up and baseline respective motor scores.26Physicians, nurse practitioners, and physiotherapists who had been extensively trained in the ISNCSCI neurological examination performed detailed baseline and follow-up neurological assessments. The date and time of injury and each neurological assessment were recorded.\n\nThe neurological level of injury was defined as the most caudal segment with normal neurological function according to the ISNCSCI. The neurological level of injury was subdivided into high cervical (C1-C4), low cervical (C5-T1), thoracic (T2-T10), and thoracolumbar (T11-L2) based upon the neuroanatomical and physiological variability of these regions and the literature.19,21The division of cervical into those with measurable motor efferent roots (C5-T1) and those without measured motor segments (C1-C4) is intuitive. Unlike the thoracic levels for which no measurable motor correlates exist, many segments through the thoracolumbar region (T11-L2) contain within the cord motor cell bodies whose function can be reliably measured using the ISNCSCI. Patients with a neurological level below L2 were excluded since these were likely to be predominantly cauda equina injuries.\n\nThe severity of neurological impairment was defined according to the AIS with grades from A (complete injury, no sensory or motor function is preserved in the sacral segments S4-5) to D (motor function is preserved below the neurological level). The AIS has been used as a primary outcome measure22,23and has been proposed as a surrogate measure of injury severity.19\n\nStatistical analysis\nParametric tests were used if variables had a normal distribution and non-parametric tests were used if either the data were not normally distributed or if there was a small sample size. Chi-square or Fisher's exact test were used for categorical data depending upon the number of the sample in each cell.\nTo evaluate the effect of the injury severity and the level of injury on changes in motor score, subgroup analyses were performed using a general linear model. A one-way between-subjects analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted when there were three or more groups. Post hoc comparisons using the Duncan and Scheffe's tests were used to detect any differences between the level/severity-based subgroups. Comparisons between two groups were analyzed using independent t-tests with Levene's test to assess the equality of variance. Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for comparing two groups or more than two groups, respectively, if the data were not normally distributed. We acknowledge the work of Geisler and his colleagues\n19\n,\n27\nthat described how motor and sensory scores do not follow the assumptions underlying normal-theory and that by pooling data from different strata may result in different probability distributions and give misleading results. We performed our statistical analyses specific to the distribution of data in each individual subgroup, thus minimizing heterogeneity and analyzing more statistically homogenous and clinically relevant subgroups. A\np\nvalue of \u22640.05 was considered statistically significant. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS (version 20) and SAS (version 9.3).\nA hypothetical SCI clinical trial scenario was created by randomly assigning participants from our RHSCIR study cohort to two equal groups (Group 1 and Group 2) using a computerized random number generator. The primary outcome in this hypothetical trial was an improvement in total motor score. The scenario was created not as a demonstration of the fundamental statistics and epidemiology of type I, or alpha error, but to demonstrate, using real world data, the methodological issue that we believe is plaguing many small SCI clinical trials. We used this example to highlight how acknowledging the heterogeneity in our proposed categories can explain imbalances that may lead to statistical error and how the reader, reviewer, and investigator can address this inadvertent selection bias through either a priori stratification or subsequent balancing of the heterogeneous participant population.\nThe hypothetical example also is presented to provide a real-world example of how conventional reporting of study participants is inadequate at exposing the imbalances in study populations. We demonstrate how the acknowledgment of our classification categories aids in appropriately powering trials."

    "Methods": "Animals\nMale animals that were 10\u201314 weeks of age were subjected to TBI and used for flow cytometry studies. Animals that were 12\u201316 weeks of age were subjected to TBI for behavior and histology studies.\nCcr2\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice backcrossed onto a C57BL/6 background for nine generations\n34\nwere originally from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and were bred in the AALAC-approved transgenic animal facility of the San Francisco VA Medical Center. C57BL/6 mice were from the same source as the\nCcr2\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice (Jackson Laboratories) and housed in the same room at the San Francisco VA Medical Center.\n\nSurgery\nControlled cortical impact (CCI) surgery or sham surgery was performed on anesthetized animals under a protocol approved by the San Francisco VA Medical Center Animal Care Committee. Briefly, bupivacaine was administered subcutaneously above the skull. Under general anesthesia produced by isoflurane, an incision was made followed by a 2.5\u2009mm circular craniectomy. TBI was inflicted by a 2-mm circular, flat pneumatic piston traveling at 3\u2009m/s, penetrating 1.5\u2009mm, for 150\u2009ms (Amscien Instruments, Richmond, VA, with extensive modifications by H&R Machine, Capay, CA). Target brain coordinates for the center of injury were 1.5\u2009mm lateral, 2.3\u2009mm posterior to the bregma point. Sham animals received all surgical procedures without piston impact.\n\nBrain and blood leukocyte isolation\nBrain leukocytes were harvested similarly to previously published methods.\n35\n,\n36\nBriefly, following perfusion, brain tissues were cut along the sagittal midline to separate the contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres. Tissues were pooled from two animals for each sample. Tissue was mechanically disassociated through a 100\u2009\u03bcm nylon cell strainer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and washed in ice-cold GKN buffer (8\u2009g/L NaCl, 0.4\u2009g/L KCl, 1.41\u2009g/L Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.6\u2009g/L NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, and 2g/L D(+) glucose, pH 7.4). Cells were re-suspended in NOSE buffer (4\u2009g/L MgCl\n2\n, 2.55\u2009g/L CaCl\n2\n, 3.73\u2009g/L KCl, 8.95\u2009g/L NaCl, pH 6\u20137) supplemented with 200\u2009U/mL DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO and 0.2\u2009mg/mL collagenase type I (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) at 37\u00b0C in a CO\n2\nincubator for 30\u2009min with shaking every 5\u201310\u2009min, and then washed with GKN buffer. Leukocytes were separated on a discontinuous isotonic Percoll (90% Percoll, 10% 1.5M NaCl, GE Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) gradient where cells were suspended in 20\u2009mL of a 1.03\u2009g/mL Percoll solution in GKN buffer, and underlayed with 10\u2009mL of a Percoll solution of 1.095\u2009g/mL in phosphate buffered saline. Cells were spun at 900\u2009g for 20\u2009min with no brake. The buffy layer was isolated for further study.\n\nFlow cytometry and antibodies\nFc receptors were blocked with 10% rat serum (Sigma) and cells were stained with fluorescent antibodies. Leukocyte analysis used a combination of the following antibodies: anti-CD45 (clone Ly5) allophycocyanin (eBioscience, San Diego, CA), anti-CD11b (clone M1/70) PE (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY), or PE-Cy5 (eBioscience), anti-Ly6G (clone 1A8) PE-Cy7 (BD Biosciences). SYTOX Blue (Invitrogen) was used to gate out dead cells. Cells were sorted on a FACSAria (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed by using FlowJo Software (Treestar, Ashland, OR, version 9.6). All data represent mean\u00b1standard error of the mean (SEM), and animal group sizes for each day are as follows for wild-type TBI mice: day 1 (\nn\n=14), day 4 (\nn\n=8), day 7 (\nn\n=4), day 14 (\nn\n=8). Animal group sizes for\nCcr2\n\u2212/\u2212\nTBI mice are as follows: day 1 (\nn\n=5), day 4 (\nn\n=6), day 7 (\nn\n=5), day 14 (\nn\n=6). Sham group sizes for all time points were two to four mice.\n\nHistology, tissue volume assessment, and stereology\nBrains were perfused with saline, followed by 3.7% formaldehyde. After a 2-h fixation period, brains were incubated in 30% sucrose overnight and frozen in tissue-freezing medium (Sakura, Inc., Torrance, CA). For F4/80 staining, 5-\u03bcm sections were quenched for endogenous peroxidases and blocked with streptavidin and biotin (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA), then immunostained with an anti-F4/80 antibody diluted at 1:200 (Clone BM8, eBioscience), followed by biotinylated rabbit anti-rat antibody diluted at 1:100 (Vector Labs), and biotin was visualized by using the Vectastain ABC elite kit (Vector Labs). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Three animals per group and at least five sections per animal were analyzed. All sections were imaged through use of an Olympus BX-51 microscope.\nFor assessment of tissue loss volume, nine weeks after surgery, euthanized mice were perfused with saline, after which harvested brains were fixed overnight, followed by a 30% sucrose overnight incubation. Frozen tissues were sectioned as free-floating sections. Mounted sections were counterstained with cresyl violet (FD Neurotechnologies, Ellicott City, MD). Beginning approximately 1.82\u2009mm posterior from the bregma point, cortical and hippocampal areas were traced using OsteoII software (Bioquant, TN). For each animal, 40-\u03bcm thick sections (with each analyzed section equally spaced at 0.24\u2009mm apart) that spanned across a total distance of 1\u2009mm were analyzed. Contralateral (left hemisphere) and ipsilateral (right hemisphere) substructure (cortex or hippocampus) volumes were calculated using Cavalieri's formula, volume=\u2211A\u00d7I\nSF\n\u00d7\nt,\nwhere A is the area, I\nSF\nis the inverse of the sampling fraction, and\nt\nis section thickness. Volume of tissue loss for each substructure was calculated by subtracting the right hemisphere substructure volume from the left hemisphere substructure volume. Animal group sizes for sham groups were five to six mice, for wild-type TBI group (\nn\n=5), and for the\nCcr2\n\u2212/\u2212\nTBI group (\nn\n=9).\nFor CA volume assessment and stereological counting of neurons, multiple 40-\u03bcm thick sections (each equally spaced at 0.24\u2009mm apart) near the lesion site encompassing the hippocampus were assessed. For each section, the cumulative CA region (CA1-CA3) was traced and the volume calculated by using StereoInvestigator software (MicroBrightField, Williston, VT). Cresyl violet stained neurons in the traced region were counted by random sampling under high power magnification (600\u00d7) using StereoInvestigator software. Five animals per group were analyzed.\n\nBehavioral studies\nThree weeks after TBI, mice were assessed for motor coordination and balance through use of rotarod tests.\n37\u201340\nSpecifically, mice (\nn\n=20 per group) were placed on a rotating rod that accelerated 5\u2009rpm every 15\u2009sec with a maximum speed of 40\u2009rpm, and the length of time that the mouse remained on the rod (fall latency) was recorded and averaged for five consecutive trials with 5-min intervals between trials. The trials were repeated on three separate days.\nFollowing rotarod testing, basic locomotor activity and exploratory behavior were determined by the open field test.\n37\n,\n38\n,\n40\n,\n41\nIndividual mice (\nn\n=20 per group) were placed in a brightly lit, square Plexiglas enclosure (40\u00d740 inches) surrounded by automated infrared photocells that interfaced with a computer (Hamilton & Kinder) to record data. Beam breaks generated by movement were monitored, allowing measurements of the number of basic movements and total path length traveled during the exploration.\n40\nFor analysis of the exploratory behavior, the arena was divided on a zone map consisting of a center region and a peripheral region. Time spent in the center versus peripheral zones was used as an indicator of anxiety-like behavior. On each of three consecutive days, open field activity was recorded for 10\u2009min.\nSpatial learning and memory were evaluated by using the Morris water maze,\n35\n,\n37\u201341\nstarting at eight weeks after TBI or sham surgery.\n38\n,\n40\u201344\nMice (\nn\n=12 per group) were trained to locate a platform in opaque water in a circular pool (135\u2009cm diameter) during two successive daily sessions (three trials per session, 60\u2009sec per trial) with a 1-h intersession interval. The starting positions of the animals were altered and counterbalanced to one of four pre-determined quadrants to rule out spatial preference. During the cued platform test on days 1 and 2, a submerged platform that was marked by a visible flag mounted on the platform was placed in a different quadrant in every session. On days 3 to 5, mice were then trained to locate a hidden platform (no flag) where the platform remained stationary. Latency, path length, swim speeds, and percent time spent swimming in a zone near the walls of the maze (zone of 13.5\u2009cm from the maze wall), the latter of which is known as thigmotaxis, were recorded and derived from the use of a video tracking system (Noldus EthoVision, Noldus, Leesburg, VA). On the sixth day, a one-minute probe trial during which the platform was removed from the pool was performed to test memory retention.\n\nStatistical analysis of behavior studies\nData were analyzed with Statview 5.0.1 software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). and Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc, La Jolla, CA version 6.0). Data were expressed as mean\u00b1SEM (some error bars were too small to be visible). For analyses of rotarod tests, open field tests, and the non-probe trial days of the Morris water maze tests, statistical significance was evaluated by using a two-way repeated measure analyses of variance (RANOVA). For analysis of the percent of time spent in each quadrant during the probe trial of the Morris water maze, three paired Student's\nt\n-tests within each group were performed to determine statistical differences between the time spent in the target quadrant versus each of the other quadrants, as previously analyzed.\n40\n,\n44\n,\n45\nFor analysis of crossing frequency and latency to first crossing of the platform location during the probe trial, two-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) was conducted. Post hoc paired comparisons using the Bonferroni test were used when appropriate.\n\nStatistical analysis of flow cytometry and histological assessments\nTwo-way ANOVA for main effects of injury, genotype, and interaction was conducted for each time point in our flow cytometric analyses of macrophage and neutrophil numbers by using Prism software. Repeated measures analysis was not conducted, since separate groups of mice were sacrificed at each time point. For statistical analysis of tissue loss volume, hippocampal volume, and neuronal density, two-way ANOVA for main effects of injury, genotype, and interaction was performed."

    "Methods": "Participants\nAll concussed participants were varsity-level college students enrolled in the Princeton University (Princeton, NJ) concussion program for high-risk sports. The program ensures systematic documentation of athletic history, physical exam, and baseline NP testing, including SCAT2\n13\nand Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT).\n34\nPrinceton's concussion program also provides acute care and long-term monitoring. All athletes involved in this study were diagnosed with a concussion by team physicians using criteria outlined by the 4th International Consensus Conference on Concussion in Sport.\n5\nPostinjury testing included SCAT2, traditional paper-and-pencil NP tests, ImPACT, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)\n35\nand the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire.\n36\nThe PHQ-9 and the GAD-7 are assessments for depression and generalized anxiety, respectively. Baseline and postinjury testing protocols were identical to those described in our earlier publication.\n10\nSubsequent to their most recent concussion, a certified athletic trainer and team physician at the University Health Services evaluated athletes within 48\u2009h postinjury. None of the athletes experienced an LOC and their overall symptomatology did not warrant further assessment by the GCS or use of a clinical radiological exam. All concussed athletes underwent NP testing within 24\u201348\u2009h after injury. Abnormal NP performance was determined through comparison of postinjury NP scores to the athlete's baseline scores. Specifically, abnormality of ImPACT clinical composites was based on reliable change indices at the 0.8 confidence interval.\n34\n,\n37\nSimilarly, scores on the traditional NP test performance were examined using Princeton-specific normative data. Data from both ImPACT and the NP test were integrated and interpreted by an experienced clinical neuropsychologist.\nAthletes were kept out of activity until they were symptom free and their clinical exam, including balance and NP evaluations, was considered to have returned to baseline levels. Return-to-activity decisions were made by the team physician, who supervised a personalized return-to-play progression that exposed athletes to gradual increases in physical exertion as per the 3rd International Consensus Conference on Concussion guidelines.\n38\nAthletes were cleared to return to full contact play once they were symptom free at rest, had successfully completed the exertional program, and were neurocognitively functioning at baseline levels.\nA total of 21 right-handed, male, varsity-level contact sport athletes (mean age, 20.19 years; standard deviation [SD], 1.03; age range, 18\u201322) who suffered an SRC were enrolled in the study. In addition to having no contraindications to MRI, participants had no self-reported history of medical, genetic, or psychiatric disorder. History of concussion was obtained through self-report after a personal interview with the athlete. The reported count (see\nTable 1\n) of previous concussions also includes concussions suffered preceding enrollment into the Princeton University concussion program for high-risk sports. It should be noted that under-reporting of concussion by athletes has been suggested in previous studies.\n39\nAn objective evaluation of the number of previous concussions in contact sport athletes is therefore difficult. Among the pool of 21 concussed athletes, 12 reported no previous history of concussion, 5 reported one previous concussion, 3 reported two previous concussions, and 1 reported three previous concussions. Mean time since the last self-reported concussion for the latter 9 concussed athletes was 2.75 years (SD, 3.02; see\nTable 1\n).\nTable\n1.\nDemographics of Controls and Concussed Athletes\nControls\nConcussed\nMRI Inclusion\nSubject\nAge (years)\nSport\nMRI Inclusion\nSubject\nAge (years)\nSport\n# Prior concussions\nNP Normal post injury (days)\nSymptom free (days)\nreturn to play (days)\n2 days scan\n2\u2009wks. scan\n2\u2009mon. scan\n1\n18\nCrew\nY\n1\n20\nFootball\n1\n24\n17 (1\nst\n), 77 (2\nnd\n)\n31\na\nY\nY\nY\n2\n18\nSquash\nY\n2\n19\nWater polo\n0\n6\n6\n24\nY\nY\nY\n3\n21\nCrew\nY\n3\n18\nLacrosse\n0\n14\n11\n20\nY\nY\nY\n4\n18\nCrew\nY\n4\n21\nIce hockey\n3\n15\n162\nno return to play\nM\nY\nY\n5\n20\nTrack+Cross country\nY\n5\n22\nLacrosse\n0\n17\n10\n23\nY\nY\nY\n6\n18\nCrew\nY\n6\n20\nWrestling\n0\n11\n3\n18\nY\nY\nM\n7\n21\nTrack\nY\n7\n19\nIce hockey\n1\n2\n4\n23\nY\nM\nM\n8\n21\nVolleyball\nY\n8\n20\nBasketball\n0\n10\n8\n15\nY\nY\nM\n9\n22\nTrack+Cross country\nY\n9\n20\nRugby\n0\n23\n10\n31\nY\nY\nY\n10\n22\nCross country\nY\n10\n21\nRugby\n0\n11\n2\n12\nY\nY\nY\n11\n19\nCrew\nY\n11\n21\nRugby\n0\n6\n10\n16\nY\nY\nM\n12\n22\nTrack\nY\n12\n20\nRugby\n1\n17\n12\nno return to play\na\nY\nY\nY\n13\n19\nTrack\nY\n13\n22\nRugby\n2\nna\nb\n7\nna\nb\nY\nY\nM\n14\n18\nSwimming\nY\n14\n20\nBasketball\n1\nna\nb\n31\nna\nb\nM\nY\nY\n15\n19\nVolleyball\nM\n15\n19\nFootball\n0\n60\nc\n14\nno return to play\nY\nX\nY\n16\n22\nCross country\nM\n16\n21\nsoccer\n1\nna\nd\n11\n32\nY\nY\nD\n17\n21\nIce hockey\n0\n3\n5\n12\nX\nY\nY\n18\n20\nFootball\n0\n6\n5\n15\nY\nM\nX\n19\n20\nBasketball\n1\n9\n6\n12\nY\nX\nY\n20\n19\nFootball\n0\n18\n10\n22\nX\nY\nY\n21\n21\nSprint Football\n1\n13\n7\n16\nX\nY\nM\nOpen in a separate window\na\nReturned to play after 1st injury at 31 days, sustained a 2nd concussion and decided not to return to play\nb\nNP testing never reached normal range before athlete graduated/season ended\nc\nNot normal at 2 weeks, not repeated until 2 months since season over\nd\nSubjected discontinued from study and decided not to return to play (although cleared to do so for next, season)\ne\nno return to play, graduated\nY: Scan included in analyses, M: Scan excluded due to motion exceeding threshold, X: Period of study during which scanner amplifier failed, D: Subject discontinued\nHealthy control participants included 16 age-matched, right-handed, male varsity noncontact athletes (mean age, 19.9 years; SD, 1.67; age range, 18\u201322), with no contraindications to MRI and no self-reported history of previous head trauma, psychiatric, neurological, or developmental disorders. All athletes (concussed and controls) gave written consent to participate in the study, which was approved by the Princeton University's Institutional Review Panel for Human Subjects Research. Concussed athletes were scanned at \u223c2 days, \u223c2 weeks, and \u223c2 months postinjury. Controls were scanned once. All athletes repeated SCAT2, PHQ-9, GAD-7, and NP testing assessments synchronized with the three imaging sessions of the concussed athletes. Concussed athletes participated in additional NP testing in between imaging sessions, as clinically indicated and requested by the team physician. There were eight instances (during a single contiguous time period identified by \u201cX\u201d in\nTable 1\n) when data collection was not possible on concussed athletes in the time interval required by the experimental design of the present study because of hardware maintenance issues. There was also one instance of a concussed athlete deciding to discontinue participation in the study (identified by \u201cD\u201d in\nTable 1\n). A strict data quality-assurance protocol (described in the\nData Preprocessing and Quality Assurance\nsection) resulted in the exclusion of scans for 10 concussed and 2 controls (identified by \u201cM\u201d in\nTable 1\n). In total, 14 controls, 16 concussed athletes at\u223c2 days, 17 concussed athletes at 2 weeks, and 13 concussed athletes at 2 months were included in the analyses (identified by \u201cY\u201d in\nTable 1\n). From this pool of concussed athletes (see\nTable 1\n), only 12 were imaged at both the 2-day time point and at 2 weeks, whereas 11 were imaged at both 2 weeks and 2 months postinjury.\n\nImaging protocol\nDiffusion-weighted images (single-shot spin echo pulse sequence with parameters adapted from our earlier publication\n12\n) were acquired with a 16-channel, phase-array coil (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) on a whole-body 3T Siemens Skyra scanner: repetition time (TR)=12,100\u2009ms; echo time (TE)=96\u2009ms; 70 axial slices; voxel size, 1.88\u00d71.88\u2009mm\n2\nin plane; slice thickness=1.9\u2009mm; field of view (FOV)=256\u2009mm; 64 gradient directions, b-value, 1000\u2009s/mm\n2\n; 8 volumes with no diffusion weighting (b=0); and 2 runs, yielding a total scan time of 26\u2009min 52\u2009sec. In order to facilitate image volume registration to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, a high-resolution T1-weighted MPRAGE image was additionally acquired at the start of each imaging session: TR=1900\u2009ms; TE=2.13\u2009ms; 192 sagittal slices; 0.90\u00d70.94\u00d70.94\u2009mm\n3\nvoxel resolution; flip angle=9 degrees; FOV=240\u2009mm; and a total anatomical scan time of 4\u2009min 26\u2009sec. Care was taken to minimize subject motion with prescan instructions and comfortable neck padding. Participants watched a preselected movie of their choice from an online streaming service during the entire scanning session.\n\nData preprocessing and quality assurance\nAll data processing was done within the FSL suite (version 4.1.9).\n40\nThe two averages of the acquired diffusion-weighted images of each subject were concatenated in the order of image acquisition and visually inspected for signal dropoffs and other imaging artifacts. All acquired data passed visual inspection. Eddy current correction was done for each subject's concatenated data set, employing the first B0 volume for reference. Each volume's registration parameters from the eddy correction step was then used to implement a strict, quantitative, quality-assurance protocol based on recent findings.\n41\nMean motion estimates (translation and rotation in three dimensions) were calculated for each group separately. All individual subject scans with motion estimates greater than 3 SDs from the mean or scans with a net translational motion estimate exceeding two voxels were excluded in their entirety (10 scans of concussed athletes and 2 controls). The concatenated B vectors corresponding to the applied diffusion gradients were then corrected for motion (rotation component\n42\n) before the FSL function \u201cdtifit\u201d\n43\nwas applied to fit a diffusion tensor model,\n44\ngenerating the three principal eigenvalues\nat each voxel. This step additionally provides scalar diffusion measures of WM microstructure: FA=\nand AD=\u03bb\n1\n.\nand\nvolumes were generated using the radial eigenvalues \u03bb\n2\n, \u03bb\n3\n.\n\nStatistical analyses\nBetween-group\nt\n-tests using the function \u201crandomise\u201d were performed via tract-based spatial statistics\n43\n(TBSS; FSL version 4.1.9) on the skeletonized WM fiber tracts for all derived scalar diffusion measures of WM microstructure FA, AD, RD and MD. All TBSS processing steps followed recommended guidelines.\n43\nThe \u201cFMRIB58_FA_1mm\u201d image volume in MNI space, included in FSL version 4.1.9, served as the target for initial nonlinear registration\n45\nof subject FA volumes. The mean WM skeleton, based on the included participants FA volumes, was thresholded to only include voxels with FA>0.25 in order to restrict the analyses to the core WM tracts. The brain stem and the cerebellum were removed (mask included in FSL suite 4.1.9) from all analyses because individual subject variability in brain volumes resulted in omission of inferior parts of these structures in a few cases. The number of randomise permutations was set at 10,000 with the threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) option enabled.\n46\nBetween-sessions comparisons of the concussed athletes were made by paired\nt\n-tests (TBSS, TFCE, all permutations, and variance smoothing of two voxel sizes) for all four diffusion measures of WM microstructure (FA, AD, RD, and MD).\nTwo post-hoc tests, a traditional univariate mixed-effects approach\n47\nand a multi-variate bootstrap method,\n48\nwere selected to test whether regions identified by a whole-brain TBSS analysis differed (in terms of diffusion metrics of WM microstructure) between groups over time. The mixed-effects model incorporates both fixed and random effects and is particularly useful in longitudinal studies because of its ability to deal with repeated measures and missing values (see\nAppendix A1\nfor details). The multi-variate bootstrap has the added advantage of accounting for combined responses of identified diffusion measures WM microstructure and is preferred in situations of moderate sample sizes, such as this study (see\nAppendix A2\nfor the algorithm). All post-hoc tests were run using the open-source statistical software R (\nhttp://www.r-project.org\n)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nCD11b-TK mice were acquired from Jean-Pierre Julien at Laval University (Qu\u00e9bec City, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada). CD11b-TK mice express HSV TK under the CD11b promoter expressed in microglia and macrophage. Male CD11b-TK\n+/\u2212\nfounder mice were crossed to C57bl/6j female mice (catalog no.: 000664; JAX; The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). The resulting offspring were genotyped using previously published methods.\n31\nMice carrying the CD11b-TK transgene were termed CD11b-TK\n+/\u2212\nmice, and littermates not carrying the transgene were termed CD11b-TK\n\u2212/\u2212\nmice and are genetically WT. All mice were housed under a 12-h light/dark cycle and given food and water\nad libitum\nin accord with the protocols of the animal studies committee at Washington University (St. Louis, MO).\n\nOsmotic pumps\nAlzet osmotic pumps (catalog nos.: 1002 and 2004; DURECT Corporation, Cupertino, CA) with flow rates of 0.25\u2009\u03bcL/h were used for these experiments. A complete description of pump assembly can be found elsewhere.\n33\nBriefly, cannula tubing (catalog no.: 312VT) and osmotic pump connector cannula (catalog no.: 3280PM/SP, cut 2.5\u2009mm below pedestal) were purchased from Plastics One, Inc. (Roanoke, VA). Pump reservoirs were filled with either valganciclovir (catalog no.: SML0191; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in 0.9% sterile saline (NaCl) or with 0.9% NaCl. Osmotic pump flow tubes were stripped of their plastic caps, and the flow tubes were connected to 1-in lengths of cannula tubing. The other end of the cannula tubing was attached to the osmotic pump connector cannula. The entire assembly was primed by placing the reservoir in conical tubes containing 0.9% NaCl, and tubes were stored at 37\u00b0C for 36\u201348\u2009h before implantation. This longer priming step was deemed necessary because cannula tubing was not filled with drug\u2014preliminary experiments with 1.5% Evan's blue in saline showed that it takes \u223c36\u2009h for solution to travel from the reservoir of 14-day 0.25-\u03bcL/h pumps to the end of the cannula under these conditions.\n\nSurgical procedures\nSix to 8-week-old CD11b-TK\n+/\u2212\nand WT littermate controls were used in all experiments. Mice were randomly assigned to either NaCl or valganciclovir treatment groups. For implantation of osmotic pumps, mice received inhaled isofluorane anesthesia and the head was fixed in a stereotaxic frame. Temperature was regulated using a heat pad (Sun Microsystems II; Sun Microsystems, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). A midline incision was made to expose the skull and a small (0.9-mm) burr hole was drilled contralateral to the repetitive closed-skull TBI (rcTBI) impact site at anterior/posterior (A/P) \u22120.84\u2009mm relative to bregma, mediolateral (ML)+1.5\u2009mm relative to mid-line at bregma. Pumps were implanted subcutaneously, and a drop of cyanoacrylate glue was applied to the bottom of the plastic portion of the cannula. A cannula guide was used to drive the metal osmotic pump connector cannula through the burr hole into the lateral ventricle (dorsoventricular \u22122.5\u2009mm) and to hold it firmly in place for 1\u20132\u2009min while the glue set. The top of the cannula was trimmed, and the incision was sutured closed. Mice received antibacterial ointment and were placed on a heat pad for recovery. Once animals were ambulatory, they were housed individually to prevent cagemates from tampering with pumps.\nSeven days after pump implantation, pumps were removed, fitted with new cannulas, placed in individual conical tubes containing 0.9% NaCl and 0.01% sodium azide (NaN\n3\n), and stored at 37\u00b0C. Mice then received two repetitive closed-skull injuries 24\u2009h apart, as described previously.\n29\nBriefly, a rubber tip was fitted on an electromagnetic impact device that was used to impact the skull with the tip centered at A/P \u22121.8, ML \u22121.5 bregma to a depth of \u22123.3\u2009mm. Sham-injured mice underwent the same surgical procedures, but did not receive impacts. Immediately after the second impact, pumps were rinsed in filtered phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and reimplanted as described above to resume drug delivery.\n\nHistology\nMice were sacrificed by isofluorane overdose and decapitation either 7 or 21 days after the first repetitive closed-skull injury. All mice were perfused with 10\u2009mL of cold 0.03% heparin in PBS. Brains were then removed and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 24\u201348\u2009h at 4\u00b0C and then in 30% sucrose in PBS for 24\u201348\u2009h at 4\u00b0C. Once equilibrated in sucrose, they were frozen on dry ice and sliced into 50-\u03bcm sections on a freezing microtome. Serial sections were collected in cryoprotectant (30% ethylene glycol, 15% sucrose, and 0.03\u2009M of phosphate buffer) and stored at 4\u00b0C until use.\nImmunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on sections to visualize rabbit polyclonal anti-Iba-1 (catalog no.: 019-19741; Wako Chemicals USA, Inc., Richmond, VA), chicken polyclonal anti\u2013glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; catalog no.: ab4674; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), rabbit polyclonal anti\u2013beta-amyloid precursor protein (\u03b2-APP; catalog no.: 512700; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), or mouse monoclonal RM014 (catalog no.: 34-1000; Novex\n\u00ae\n; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). For this, sections were washed 3 times for 5\u2009min in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), incubated in 0.03% H\n2\nO\n2\nfor 10\u2009min, washed 3 times for 5\u2009min in TBS, then blocked for 30\u2009min in either 3% normal goat serum (NGS; catalog no.: S-1000; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) or 3% normal donkey serum (catalog no.: 017-000-121; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) in 0.25% Triton-X TBS (TBS-X). After blocking, primary antibodies (Abs) were applied at a 1:1000 dilution in blocking solution and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with gentle shaking. The following day, sections were again washed, incubated 1\u2009h at room temperature (RT) in either biotinylated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG; catalog no.: BA-1000; Vector Laboratories) or biotinylated donkey anti-chicken IgG (catalog no.: 703-065-155; Jackson ImmunoResearch) secondary Abs were diluted 1:1000 in TBS-X, washed again, then incubated in 1:400 avidin-biotin complex (ABC) reagent (catalog no.: PK-6100; Vector Laboratories) in TBS for another hour. Finally, sections were washed and placed in 3-3\u2032-diaminodebzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB; catalog no.: D5905) for 5\u20136\u2009min. After development in DAB, sections were washed, placed on slides, and allowed to air dry, then cover-slipped with cytoseal (catalog no.: 8312-4; Richard-Allan Scientific Co., Kalamazoo, MI). For RM014 staining specifically, the following modifications to the above-described protocol were made: 1) Sections were blocked in 1:10 mouse serum; 2) the primary Ab was incubated 1:2 with biotinylated goat anti-mouse Fab IgG (catalog no.: 115-007-003; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 20\u2009min before application to the sections overnight; and 3) the secondary Ab was unnecessary, and sections were immediately incubated in ABC on day 2.\nAdjacent sets of floating sections were subjected to silver staining (catalog no.: PK301, NeuroSilver Kit II; FD Neurotechnologies, Inc., Elliot City, MD), following the manufacturer's instructions with minor modifications, as previously reported.\n29\nSections were incubated for 5 days in PFA before silver staining and were only incubated in solution C once for 2\u2009min.\nFor cresyl violet staining, sections were rinsed in TBS twice for 5\u2009min, then mounted on glass slides. Once air-dried, they were placed in cresyl violet solution (catalog no.: PS102-1; FD Neurotech) for 5\u2009min, then rinsed and cover-slipped, following manufacturer's protocol.\nFor terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling/neuronal nuclear antigen (TUNEL-NeuN) double-immunofluorescence (IF), 50-\u03bcm free-floating sections were washed with TBS and incubated for 15\u2009min with 0.02\u2009mg/mL of proteinase K in TBS. A positive control for TUNEL labeling was generated by incubating a tissue section in 1\u2009\u03bcg/mL of DNAse I for 20\u2009min at RT. Sections were then washed and blocked in 3% NGS in TBS-X for 30\u2009min and incubated overnight in 1:1000 rabbit polyclonal anti-NeuN (catalog no.: ABN78; Millipore, Billerica, MA) in blocking solution. The following day, sections were washed and incubated in donkey anti-rabbit IgG cyanine 3 (catalog no.: 711-165-152; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1\u2009h at RT in the dark. Sections were then washed, mounted on glass slides, and allowed to air dry for 1\u2009h. A hydrophobic barrier was drawn with a PAP pen around each section, and TUNEL staining was performed according to the FragEL DNA Fragmentation Detection Kit (catalog no.: QIA39; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), following the manufacturer's instructions. Double IF images were captured using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany).\n\nElectron microscopy\nFor electron microscopy, mice were perfused with 10\u2009mL of PBS-Heparin followed immediately by 10\u2009mL of 1% PFA, and 1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1\u2009M sodium cacodylate buffer. Brains were fixed using the same solution for 1\u2009h, then sliced into two to three 1-mm coronal slabs per mouse. Slabs were fixed for 5 days before being incubated in 1% osmium tetroxide in sodium cacodylate buffer overnight, followed by dehydration in ascending ethanol series, and embedding Polybed 812 (catalog no.: 08792; Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA). Embedding media were cured for 24\u2009h in a dessicator and then in a 60\u00b0C oven for 48\u2009h. Semithin sections stained with toluidine blue were prepared using glass knives to identify the region of CC and EC ipsilateral to injury in each coronal slab. Tissue was then thin sectioned (70\u201390\u2009nm) on a Leica Ultracut E Microtome (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany), stained with 4% uranyl acetate and Reynolds lead citrate, and viewed on a JEOL 100C Electron Microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). Three to five grids were prepared from each block of tissue, and two blocks (1-mm separation) were prepared from each animal. At least one grid from each block was qualitatively assessed blinded to injury status or genotype for evidence of axonal injury.\n\nStereological quantification and optical density measurements\nFor all histological analysis, the region of interest (ROI) was defined to include the CC and EC underlying the impact site. For each mouse, the ROI began with the most anterior section containing hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and ended with the most posterior section containing CC fibers that cross mid-line. This yielded 3\u20134 sections for analysis per animal. The mid-line served as the medial boundary for the ROI, whereas the lateral boundary was formed by drawing a horizontal line between the ventral hippocampus and dorsal thalamus in each coronal section.\nIba-1 stereological methods have been previously published.\n29\nIn brief, stereological quantification was performed blinded to genotype or drug treatment status using StereoInvestigator's (MicroBrightfield) optical fractionator technique. The ROI was traced in each section, and a 180\u00d7180\u2009\u03bcm grid size and 80\u00d780\u2009\u03bcm counting frame was applied to determine the number of Iba-1-positive cells in the CC and EC. This ensured that Gunderson's coefficient of error was <0.1.\nFor quantification of silver staining, 20x images were captured of all sections using the Olympus NanoZoomer Whole Slide Imaging System (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), as previously reported.\n29\nFrom the NanoZoomer file, 1.25\u2009\u00d7 .tiff images of sections containing the DG of the hippocampus and CC were exported and opened in ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Background (gold color) was subtracted from each image using the color splitter and image calculator functions, so that only the gray-black silver deposits were visible. ROIs were traced as described for Iba-1 analysis on 32-bit images and measurements were taken to acquire mean gray values corresponding to the intensity of silver staining (0\u2013255) within each ROI. Three serial sections were averaged from each animal to produce a final silver staining value. Optical density measurements were also taken blinded to genotype and drug treatment status.\nFor GFAP optical density measurements, 5x images of the CC and EC were captured using the NanoZoomer. The .tiff files were converted to 32-bit images in ImageJ, and positive signal on each image was selected using Li's minimum cross-entropy thresholding method, a function of the Auto Threshold plugin. ROIs were selected and drawn as described for Iba-1 stereology and silver staining. The summarize function under analyze particles was used to acquire the area fraction occupied by positive GFAP signal. These values were averaged from three serial sections, and the resulting value is reported.\n\nQuantitative polymerase chain reaction\nQuantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed to determine gene expression levels of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS), chemokine (C-C motif\u2009) ligand 2 (CCL2), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1). Immediately after sacrifice, brains were harvested and a 2-mm coronal slice was collected. The anteriormost portion of the slice corresponded to the anterior end of the hippocampus. The section was further dissected by making a cut parallel to the interface between the hippocampus and thalamus, and only the dorsal portion (approximately 30\u2009mg) was reserved for qPCR. Sections were frozen on crushed dry ice and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Tissue was later lysed in Qiazol (Qiagen, Jena, Germany) and disrupted using a rotor-stator homogenizer, following the manufacturer's protocol for homogenization of fatty tissues. The final RNA pellet was resuspended in 100\u2009\u03bcL of RNAse-free water and further purified using an RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). DNAse was applied to the column to remove genomic DNA contamination. For complementary DNA (cDNA) preparation, 1\u2009\u03bcg of RNA was used in each RNA-cDNA reaction (High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For each qPCR reaction, 1\u2009\u03bcL of undiluted cDNA was added to 15\u2009\u03bcL of Syber Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 13\u2009uL of ddH\n2\n0, and 1\u2009\u03bcL of 10-mM forward and reverse primers (\nTable 1\n). Samples were loaded on a MicroAmp Fast Optical 96-Well Reaction Plate (Applied Biosystems), and qPCR was carried out on a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The following conditions were used: 95\u00b0C for 10\u2009min followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15\u2009sec and 60\u00b0C for 1\u2009min.\nTable\n1.\nPrimer Sets Used for qPCR\nEncoded protein\nAccession no.\nDirection\n5\u2032-3\u2032\nAmplicon size (bp)\nPGK1\nNM_008828.2\nForward\nctccgctttcatgtagaggaag\n117\nReverse\ngacatctcctagtttggacagtg\nGAPDH\nNM_008084\nForward\ncatggacttccgtgttccta\n55\nReverse\ngcggcacgtcagatcca\nHPRT1\nNM_013556.2\nForward\ncctaagatgagcgcaagttgaa\n86\nReverse\nccacaggactagaacacctgctaa\nIL1-\u03b2\nNM_008361.3\nForward\nacggaccccaaaagatgaag\n139\nReverse\nttctccacagccacaatgag\nIL-6\nNM_031168.1\nForward\ncaaagccagagtccttcagag\n150\nReverse\ngtccttagccactccttctg\niNOS\nNM_010927\nForward\ntggtccgcaagagagtgct\n108\nReverse\ncctcattggccagctgctt\nCCL2\nNM_011333\nForward\naggtgtcccaaagaagctgta\n85\nReverse\natgtctggacccattccttct\nTNF-\u03b1\nNM_013693\nForward\ncttctgtctactgaacttaggg\n134\nReverse\ncaggcttgtcactcgaattttg\nOpen in a separate window\nqPCR, quantitative polymerase chain reaction; PGK1, phosphoglycerate kinase 1; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HPRT1, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1; IL, interleukin; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthetase; CCL2, chemokine (C-C motif\u2009) ligand 2; TNF-\u03b1, tumor necrosis factor alpha; bp, base pairs.\n\u0394\u0394Ct values were calculated by normalizing the expression of each gene to the geometric mean of three reference genes (\nhprt\n,\npgk1\n, and\ngapdh\n).

    "Methods": "Protocol overview\nAll participants were instrumented with the HITS system for acquisition of real-time biomechanical exposure data during all practices and games. All participants also received baseline pre- and postseason MRI and Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT). The data for this study are part of an ongoing study of high school and youth football players involving biomechanics, MRI, magnetoencephalography, and cognitive testing.\n31\n,\n32\n\nSubjects\nPlayers from a local Winston-Salem varsity high school football team were enrolled to participate in the study for the 2012 season. This study was approved by the Wake Forest School of Medicine (Winston-Salem, NC) Institutional Review Board Committee. Exclusion criteria included any history of previous neurological illness, psychiatric illness, brain tumor, concussion within the past 6 months, and/or contraindication to MRI. A certified athletic trainer (ATC) was present during all games and practices and evaluated all players for clinical signs of concussion using the Sports Concussion Assessment Tool version 2. Players identified by the ATC with suspected concussion were then evaluated by a sports-medicine physician experienced in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of concussion. During the season, 2 players had clinically diagnosed concussions and were excluded from further analysis. Before the season, 1 player had a clinically diagnosed concussion and was excluded from further analysis. This provided 24 complete pre- and postseason imaging data sets from players without clinical evidence of concussion. These subjects were all male, with a mean age (in years) of 16.9 (standard deviation [SD], 0.6), a mean body mass index (BMI) of 26.3 (SD, 3.7), and mean time between pre- and postseason scans of 4.9 months (SD, 0.6).\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging acquisition and processing\nMRI data were acquired in accordance with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Common Data Elements advanced protocol recommendations on a 3T Siemens Skyra MRI scanner using a high-resolution 20-channel head/neck coil (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). T1-weighted anatomical images were obtained using a three-dimensional volumetric magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo sequence with isotropic resolution of 0.9\u2009mm (repetition time [TR]=1900\u2009msec; echo time [TE]=2.93\u2009msec; inversion time=900\u2009msec; flip angle=9 degrees; and 176 slices). DTI images were acquired using a two-dimensional single-shot echo planar imaging sequence (TR=10,500\u2009msec; TE=99\u2009msec; flip angle=90 degrees; spatial resolution=2.2\u00d72.2\u2009mm; slice thickness=3\u2009mm; 54 slices; 10\u2009b=0 volumes; and 15 diffusion directions with b=1000/2000 each). Structural T1 images were normalized to Montreal Neurologic Imaging (MNI) space using the Dartel high-dimensional warping and the SPM8\n37\nnew segment procedure, as implemented in the VBM8 toolbox (\nhttp://dbm.neuro.uni-jena.de/vbm.html\n). Diffusion tensor preprocessing was performed using the Functional MRI of the Brain Software Library (FSL).\n38\nEddy current correction of the diffusion tensor images was performed using FSL dti_eddy by normalizing each image to the baseline (B0) image using the mutual information registration algorithm. DTI scalar metrics, including FA and MD, as well as shape anisotropy coefficients, including linear anisotropy (C\nL\n), planar anisotropy (C\nP\n), and spherical anisotropy (C\nS\n), were computed using DTI-TK.\n39\nDistortion correction was performed by normalizing the B0 image to the T1 image and applying this transformation to the computed maps. The resulting scalar maps were then normalized to MNI space based on the parameters computed from the structural normalization. All normalizations and scalar maps were visually inspected to ensure the quality of normalization procedures.\n\nHead Impact Telemetry System data collection\nAll players were fitted with Riddell Revolution or Riddell Revolution Speed football helmets containing MxEncoders that fit into the spaces between padding in the helmet. The MX Encoder weighs 4 ounces and includes six nonorthogonally mounted single-axis accelerometers, a digital encoder, and instrumentation to transmit signal to the base unit. Riddell helmets incorporating the HITS have been certified by the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment. Trained research assistants monitored the HITS at all hitting practices and games. Acceleration threshold was set at 10\ng\n. Once this threshold was achieved, information from all six accelerometers was collected at 1\u2009kHz for a period of 40\u2009ms (8\u2009ms before the trigger and 32\u2009ms after the trigger). All games and practices were also videotaped to remove any false impacts, such as a dropped helmet. A complete description of the processing algorithm and validation of the HITS has been previously described.\n40\n\nHead Impact Telemetry System data analysis\nQuantitative HITS data include number of impacts, peak linear acceleration in gs, peak impact rotational acceleration in radians per second,\n2\nas well as azimuth and elevation for measures of impact location (e.g., angle >60=top; 45 from sagittal anterior/posterior=front/back; and 45 from frontal plane=side). The time history of acceleration is also obtained for the resultant translational acceleration. The biomechanical metric computed from the HITS data for this study was the risk-weighted cumulative exposure (RWE).\n31\nThis metric is defined as the collected risk of concussion over the course of the season. The risk of concussion for each impact for each player was calculated using three different risk functions previously described in the literature. The three risk functions include the logistic regression equations and regression coefficients for 1) linear acceleration,\n41\n2) rotational acceleration,\n42\nand 3) the combined probability from linear and rotational acceleration\n43\n(\nTable 1\n). The risk for each respective head acceleration specific to the given risk function for a single player was summed to generate the RWE for the season. RWE is favorable to previously-described exposure metrics in football head impacts because it is based on the player specific distribution of impacts and the associated risk of concussion for each impact during the season for each player. The RWE calculated from each respective risk function is simply referred to as RWE\nLinear\n, RWE\nRotational\n, and RWE\nCP\n. Because RWE\nCP\nis comprised of both linear and rotational forces that are experienced with every head impact, our primary hypothesis relates to changes in the brain associated with RWE\nCP\n. The equations for RWE are provided in\nTable 2\n.\nTable\n1.\nLogistic Regression Equations and Regression Coefficients of the Three Injury Risk Functions Utilized in the Risk Calculation for Each Impact\na\nEquation\nLogistic regression equation\nRisk function\nRegression coefficients\n(1)\nLinear\n\u03b1=\u22129.805,\n\u03b2=0.0510\nRotational\n\u03b1=\u221212.531,\n\u03b2=0.0020\n(2)\nCombined probability (CP)\n\u03b2\n0\n=\u221210.2,\n\u03b2\n1\n=0.0433,\n\u03b2\n2\n=0.000873,\n\u03b2\n3\n=\u22129.2E-07\nOpen in a separate window\na\n\u03b1 and \u03b2 are the regression coefficients and x is the measured acceleration for the linear and rotational risk functions. \u03b2\n0\n, \u03b2\n1\n, \u03b2\n2\n, and \u03b2\n3\nare the regression coefficients, a is the measured linear acceleration, and \u03b1 is the measured rotational acceleration for the combined probability risk function.\nTable\n2.\nRisk-Weighted Cumulative Exposure (RWE) Equations\na\nOpen in a separate window\na\na\nL\nis the measured peak linear acceleration, a\nR\nis the measured peak rotational acceleration, and n\nhits\nis the number of head impacts in a season for a given player.\n\nDiffusion tensor imaging scalar z-scores\nDelta post-preseason maps were computed for each DTI scalar metric (FA, MD, C\nL\n, C\nP\n, and C\nS\n). The group mean and standard deviation (SD) of the delta maps were used to create a normative reference for each scalar metric. Voxel-wise z-scores were computed using the normative reference. The z-maps were thresholded at 2 SDs above the mean and 2 SDs below the mean to identify any abnormally high or low scalar values. A cluster threshold requiring a minimum 1-mL contiguous volume was applied to reduce false positives. The total number of abnormal voxels for each subject and scalar metric was computed for regression analyses. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine for threshold effects, with analyses repeated at a range of SD cutoffs (0.5\u20133.0).\n\nComparison of Head Impact Telemetry System and imaging data\nLinear regression analyses were performed to examine the relationships between RWE metrics and brain imaging using JMP software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Our primary hypothesis was that there would be an association between RWE\nCP\nand FA. Secondary analyses were performed to better characterize any associations between the biomechanical metrics (RWE\nLinear\n, RWE\nRotational\n, and RWE\nCP\n) and other DTI measures, including MD and subcomponents of the FA (C\nL\n, C\nP\n, and C\nS\n). For the primary linear regression analysis, a model was constructed for RWE\nCP\nand FA. Number of abnormal FA voxels was used as the dependent variable. Log transformation was applied to satisfy assumptions of normality. Age at preseason, BMI, and time between scans were used as covariates. The proportion of variance (r\n2\n) in FA associated with RWE\nCP\n, without and with covariate adjustment, was used to portray the strength of relationships. Secondary analyses were performed in a similar fashion using FA, MD, C\nL\n, C\nP\n, C\nS\n, and all biomechanical metrics (RWE\nLinear\n, RWE\nRotational\n, and RWE\nCP\n). For each linear regression performed, the Cook's distance of each point was calculated and analyzed for potential outliers.\n\nImmediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing\nNeuropsychological testing using version 2.1 of the ImPACT computer-administered test battery was successfully completed pre- and postseason for 14 of the 24 subjects. The test consists of multiple modules that assess different measures of cognitive function reported as composite scores, including verbal memory, visual memory, visual motor (processing speed), and reaction time. The test takes approximately 25\u2009min to complete and was administered in the school's computer laboratory under the supervision of the team's athletic trainer. These 14 subjects had a mean age (in years) of 17.03 (SD, 0.6), mean BMI of 23.2 (SD, 4.1), and mean time between pre- and postseason scans of 4.8 months (SD, 0.6).\n\nImmediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing delta scores\nDelta post-preseason scores for each individual were computed using the four ImPACT composite measures (verbal memory, visual memory, visual motor, and reaction time). These four delta scores were then compared to the number of abnormal DTI voxels using Spearman's rank-correlation coefficient."

    "Methods": "Sample-size considerations\nSample size was estimated before the initiation of this study using a formula available in a commercially available software package (S-PLUS statistical software Version 8.2; TIBCO Software, Inc., Seattle, WA). For all estimates of sample size, we assumed statistical power of 80%, a significance level of 5%, and normal distribution of data and residual errors. The study was powered to address our central hypothesis: that inflammatory cytokines would be elevated after canine SCI. Expected IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations were used because these cytokines have been previously shown to be robustly increased after SCI in humans.\n13\n,\n16\nBased on published distributions of CSF cytokine concentrations in humans with SCI,\n13\nwe estimated that 5 control dogs and 10 SCI dogs were needed to detect the assumed magnitude of difference between groups in IL-6 concentration. Additionally, 14 control dogs and 28 SCI dogs were needed to detect assumed differences between groups in IL-8 concentration. We elected to use all canine CSF samples that met inclusion and exclusion criteria listed below (39 SCI and 21 control dogs) to improve precision of estimates, because CSF IL-6 and IL-8 have not been assessed in dogs previously and because our assay for determining these cytokines differed from that used in humans with SCI.\n\nSpinal cord injured and healthy control dogs\nAll animal procedures were approved by the Texas A&M University (College Station, TX) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (AUP 2007-115; AUP 2011-145), and in the case of client-owned dogs, were performed with written consent from each dog's owner. All studies adhered to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\nAn archival bank of CSF samples housed at Texas A&M University since December 2009 and stored at \u221280\u00b0C was searched in March 2013 for samples from dogs with SCI resulting from IVDH. Dogs had to meet the following inclusion criteria: 1) IVDH located between the T3 and L6 vertebrae; 2) <7-day duration of neurological dysfunction; 3) treatment consisting of surgical decompression and physical rehabilitation; and 4) sufficient archival CSF available for cytokine and chemokine determination. Dogs were excluded from the study if they were enrolled in ongoing neuroprotective clinical trials, did not have 42-day postsurgical follow-up examination, or had undergone a myelogram.\nArchival CSF samples from purpose-bred dogs with normal neurological examination, physical examination, complete blood cell counts, and serum biochemical analysis were used as a control population. CSF samples were obtained and stored using the same methods as described below for SCI dogs. Samples of CSF from control dogs were required to have normal total nucleated cell count (TNCC; <5 cells/\u03bcL) and microprotein (\u226435\u2009mg/dL).\n\nAnimal procedures\nDogs with SCI received physical and neurological examination, complete blood count, and serum biochemistry before anesthesia. Dogs were premedicated with a combination of glycopyrrolate (Robinul-V; West-Ward Pharmaceutical Corp., Eatontown, NJ) and oxymorphone (Numorphan; Endo Pharmaceuticals, Chadds Ford, PA) or hydromorphone, induced with propofol (Rapinovet; Abbott Labs, Chicago, IL), and then intubated and maintained under general anesthesia with a combination of sevoflurane and oxygen inhalant. CSF was acquired from the cerebellomedullary cistern for routine analysis, and a 200-\u03bcL aliquot was stored at \u221280\no\nC for cytokine and chemokine determination. The thoracolumbar vertebral column was imaged in dogs with SCI after CSF collection with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography. The imaging technique utilized depended on the availability of equipment. A hemilaminectomy surgery was performed in all cases after imaging procedures to remove herniated disk material and any associated epidural hemorrhage; IVDH was confirmed by gross inspection or histopathology of herniated disk material. After surgery, dogs were hospitalized in an intensive care unit for 24\u2009h, where analgesia and bladder evacuation were performed. Physical rehabilitation exercises were initiated beginning 24\u2009h after surgery and consisted of passive range of motion, supported standing, and supported overland walking. Animals were released to owners if they could voluntarily void urine or undergo manual bladder expression and had postsurgical pain that was well controlled. Owners were instructed to continue physical rehabilitation exercises at home for 6 weeks.\n\nNeurological scores\nDogs with SCI were neurologically examined at initial admission and at 42-day, in-hospital recheck using two ordinal SCI scores.\n17\nIn both scoring systems, dogs were considered ambulatory if they could spontaneously rise and take 10 steps without support. Postural reactions were evaluated by placing the paw on its dorsum while the dog was held in a standing position and waiting for correction. Superficial and deep nociception were tested by pinching the interdigital webbing and cross-clamping the nail bed with hemostats, respectively. Nociception was deemed to be present if there was a behavioral (e.g., vocalizing) or physiological (e.g., tachycardia) response to stimulation. Both ordinal SCI scores used in this study were previously validated in dogs with IVDH and have been shown to have excellent inter-rater agreement, correlate to MRI signal changes within the spinal cord after injury, and predict long-term outcome.\n17\nThe modified Frankel score (MFS)\n17\nwas developed as a coarse SCI score that would permit stratification of the population into groups that parallel those used in the American Spinal Cord Injury Association Impairment Scale (ASIA). MFS scores were as follows: 0=paraplegic with no deep nociception; 1=paraplegic with deep nociception intact; 2=paraplegic with superficial nociception intact; 3=nonambulatory paraparetic; 4=ambulatory paraparetic; and 5=paraspinal hyperesthesia as the sole clinical sign.\nThe Texas Spinal Cord Injury Score (TSCIS)\n17\nwas developed to be a more refined grading system than the MFS and was used for analyses that did not require stratification into large functional categories. Scores were performed in each pelvic limb. Nociception was scored as follows: 0=absent; 1=deep nociception present only; and 2=both superficial and deep nociception present. Gait scores ranged from 0 to 6 and reflected the degree of weight support and limb protraction. Gait classifications included: 0=no voluntary motor function present when supported; 1=intact limb protraction with no ground clearance; 2=intact limb protraction with inconsistent ground clearance; 3=intact protraction with consistent ground clearance; 4=ambulatory, consistent ground clearance with moderate paresis-ataxia (will fall occasionally); 5=ambulatory, consistent ground clearance with mild paresis-ataxia (does not fall, even on slick surfaces); and 6=normal gait. Proprioceptive positioning was classified as: 0=absent; 1=delayed (correction occurred in >1\u2009sec); or 2=normal response.\n\nCerebrospinal fluid analysis and cytokine/chemokine determination\nApproximately 1\u2009mL of CSF was analyzed within 1\u2009h of collection for microprotein concentration, TNCC, red blood cell (RBC) count, and cell count differential. CSF pleocytosis was defined as >5 TNCC/\u03bcL. Normal CSF protein concentration was considered to be \u226435\u2009mg/dL. Cytokine and chemokine concentrations were determined using archival CSF frozen at \u221280\u00b0C within 1\u2009h of collection. CSF concentrations of IL-2, -6, -7, -8, -10, -15, and -18, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3), keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC)-like protein, IFN-\u03b3-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), MCP-1, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) were measured using a Canine Cytokine Magnetic Panel kit. Assays were performed according to manufacturer instructions (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA) on a Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) Bio-Plex system employing Luminex technology.\n\nStatistical analysis\nBaseline population data that were continuous were summarized using medians and ranges and categorical data were summarized using contingency tables. Cytokine and chemokine concentrations in the CSF of SCI and control dogs were compared using Wilcoxon's rank-sum tests and chi-squared tests.\n18\nWilcoxon's rank-sum tests, chi-squared tests, and Kruskal-Wallis' tests were used to assess relationships between CSF cytokine and chemokine concentrations and duration of SCI before CSF acquisition, SCI severity, long-term recovery as measured by TSCIS, and cytologic characteristics of CSF. Significance was set at\np\n<0.05.\n18\nMultiple comparison adjustment was performed using the method of Hochberg.\n18\nCorrelation between continuous variables was assessed using a generalized linear model to calculate regression coefficient parameters,\nR\n2\nvalues, and statistical significance that the coefficient was significantly different than 0.\n19\nWhen necessary, data were transformed (log\n10\nfunction) to meet distributional assumptions of modeling. Goodness of model fit was assessed by visual inspection of diagnostic residual plots. All analyses were performed using S-PLUS statistical software (version 8.2; TIBCO)."

The mice were housed in standard cages in 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and given food and water\nad libitum\n. The animal protocol was approved by the Emory University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, in compliance with National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines.\nThe experimental TBI method used in this study was performed as described previously with minor modification.\n33\n,\n34\nMice were anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane and placed on a stereotaxic frame. After a midline skin incision, a 3.5\u2009mm circular craniotomy was performed midway between lambda and bregma, 2.0\u2009mm to the right of central suture using an electric drill. During the craniotomy, mice were excluded from the study if dura matter was breached. CCI was induced with an electric impact device using an impact tip. In this study, we used a PCI3000 precision cortical impactor (Hatteras Instruments, Cary, NC) and a 2.0\u2009mm diameter flat fact tip with a slightly rounded edge (velocity=3\u2009m/sec, depth=1.0\u2009mm, and contact time=150\u2009msec). Temperature was monitored by a rectal thermometer in all groups and maintained at 37\u00b10.5\u00b0C during surgery, using a heating pad controlled by a homeothermic blanket control unit (Havard Apparatus, Holliston, MA).\nAfter the injury, the skin was sutured, and mice were allowed to recover in a humidity-controlled incubator (Thermocare, Incline Village, NV). Animals in the sham and TBI groups were injected with saline after TBI, and their body temperatures maintained at 37\u00b0C in a humidity-controlled incubator for up to 6\u2009h after TBI. In the hypothermia group, animals were subjected to HPI-363 injections, and no human intervention of temperature change was applied.\n\nDrug administration and induction of hypothermia\nHPI-363 was dissolved in saline and injected intraperitoneally. To determine the dose-response relationship, HPI-363 was first tested at 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 1\u2009mg/kg in C57BL/6 male mice without TBI surgery. Mice were randomly divided into five groups: (1) saline control (\nn\n=3); (2) 0.1\u2009mg/kg HPI-363 group (\nn\n=6); (3) 0.3\u2009mg/kg HPI-363 group (\nn\n=11); (4) 0.5\u2009mg/kg HPI-363 group (\nn\n=6); and (5) 1\u2009mg/kg HPI-363 group (\nn\n=5). In the investigation of the brain protection after TBI, mice were randomly divided into two groups: (1) TBI plus saline injection (\nn\n=8); (2) 0.3\u2009mg/kg HPI-363 group (\nn\n=7).\nFor the HPI-363 treatment group, the first bolus injection (0.3\u2009mg/kg) was given immediately or at 15, 60, 120, or 180\u2009min after TBI, followed by additional injections at a half of the initial dose (0.15\u2009mg/kg). The interval between the injections was \u22651.5\u2009h, with adjustments made to keep a constant mild hypothermia (32\u201334\u00b0C). Anesthesia was applied only during the TBI procedure; animals recovered from the isoflurane anesthesia and received HPI-363 intraperitoneally (i.p.) without other sedation measures.\nPhysical forced cooling was tested as a hypothermia control. The targeted body temperature was the same as in the pharmacologically induced hypothermia (PIH) experiments (32\u201334\u00b0C). Animal were placed on ice during the first 10\u201315\u2009min and then in a \u22654\u00b0C chamber during the maintenance period.\n\nMeasurements of body and brain temperature\nRectal temperature was monitored using a rectal probe (Harvard Apparatus) for \u22656\u2009h after TBI, and measurements were repeated every 15\u2009min for the first hour and every 60\u2009min thereafter. Brain temperature was measured using a Physitemp probe (temperature data acquisition system, Physitemp, Clifton, NJ) placed on the surface of the cerebral cortex.\n20\n,\n35\nThe Physitemp system allows simultaneous monitoring and data acquisition from seven animals either during or after anesthesia. The implantable thermocouple probe has a tip diameter of 0.16\u2009mm in diameter. The microprobe was connected to a guide cannula that attached to the caps of two dummy cannulas (model C313 DC, Plastic Products Co., Roanoke, VA). A small hole was drilled into the caps of a size sufficient to accommodate the shaft of the microprobe. The microprobe was then inserted through caps, positioned, and glued into place with epoxy resin. The cap closer to the needle tip was used to screw the modified probe into an implanted guide cannula; the other cap provided additional mechanical strength. The probe was connected with an extension wire to the data acquisition system controlled by a laptop computer.\n\nPhysiological parameter measurements\nTo evaluate the effects of HPI-363 on physiological parameters, blood pH and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) were monitored. MABP was recorded using the Blood Pressure Analyzer-400 system (Digi-Med, Mobile, AL) after left common-carotid artery catheterization with PE-10 polyethylene tubing (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) under anesthesia before, immediately after, and at 30 and 60\u2009min after HPI-363 injection. Animals were awake and freely moving between measurements, and the indwelling catheter was treated with heparin. Whole-blood samples were also collected to evaluate blood pH. Blood serum was separated by centrifugation at 15,000\u2009g for 5\u2009min at 4\u00b0C and was then applied on Hydrion pH test paper (Micro Essential Laboratory, Brooklyn, NY) to measure the blood pH value.\n\nNissl staining and measurement of contusion volume\nTo measure the contusion volumes, Nissl staining was performed at 3 or 21 days after TBI. 10-mM-thick fresh-frozen brain sections containing target lesions were collected every 200\u2009mM and then fixed with a 1:1 mixture of 10% formalin and acetic acid for 10\u2009min. After washing with distilled water for 5\u2009min, slices were stained with a working solution containing buffer solution (0.1\u2009M acetate acid and 0.1\u2009M sodium acetate. 94:6) and Cresyl Violet acetate at a ratio of 5:1. The sections were then dehydrated in 100% ethyl alcohol and mounted.\nAfter Nissl staining, the sections were digitized using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD), and the areas of the contusion and the two hemispheres quantified by an investigator blinded to the treatment of the animals (\nn\n=9\u201310 per group). Contusion volume was assessed based on the Cavalieri method of stereology.\n36\nThe number of sections and the section thickness (10\u2009\u03bcm) were multiplied by the mean area of the remaining cortex. Contusion volumes were calculated based on the contusion areas (C) obtained from 10\u201312 sections as follows: C1*D+0.2(C1+C2+3+\u2026\u2009C12), with D being the distance between two sections (0.2\u2009mm). In addition, to consider the effects of swelling or edema, hemispheric tissue loss was calculated as a percentage calculated by ([contralateral hemispheric volume-ipsilateral hemispheric volume]/[contralateral hemispheric volume] \u00d7100%). The calculated result is reported as ratio of lesion volume against the corrected hemisphere volume.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nMice were euthanized with 10% chloral hydrate and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed and kept overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde and then transferred to 30% sucrose (\nn\n=6\u20137 per group). Frozen perfused brain tissue was sliced into 10\u2009mm-thick coronal sections using a cryostat vibratome (Leica CM 1950; LeicaMicrosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). Sections were dried on a slide warmer for 30\u2009min, fixed with 10% formalin buffer, washed with \u221220\u00b0C precooled ethanol:acetic acid (2:1) solution for 10\u2009min, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X 100 solution for 5\u2009min.\nAll slides were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (5\u2009min each) after each step. Tissue sections were blocked with 1% fish gelatin (Sigma) in PBS for 1\u2009h at room temperature, then incubated with the primary antibody occludin (1:200; Millipore, Billerica, MA), ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1; 1:200; Biocare Medical, Concord, CA), and NeuN (1:300; Millipore, Billerica, MA) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Next day, the slides were washed three times with PBS for 5\u2009min, then reacted with the secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor\u00ae488 goat anti-mouse (1:300; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (1:300; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) or Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-mouse or rabbit (1:400; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 90\u2009min at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (1:20,000; Molecular Probes) for 5\u2009min as a counterstain, then mounted with Vectashield fluorescent mounting medium (Vector Laboratory, Burlingame, CA), and a coverslip applied for microscopy and image analysis.\n\nTerminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUPT nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining\nA TUNEL assay kit was used to examine cell death by detecting fragmented DNA in 10-mM-thick coronal fresh frozen sections as described previously (\nn\n=9\u201310 per group).\n20\nAfter fixation (10% buffered formalin for 10\u2009min and then ethanol:acetic acid (2:1) solution for 5\u2009min) and permeabilization (0.2% Triton X-100 solution), brain sections were incubated in the equilibration buffer for 10\u2009min. Recombinant terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (rTdT) and nucleotide mixture were then added on the slide at 37\u00b0C for 60\u2009min in the dark. Reactions were terminated by 2X SSC solution for 15\u2009min. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (1:20,000; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 5\u2009min.\n\nQuantification of immunostaining positive cells\nCell count was performed as described previously.\n20\nCell counting was performed following the principles of design based stereology. Systematic random sampling was used to ensure accurate and non-redundant cell counting. Six brain sections per animal were collected at 100\u2009mm distance between sections for non-overlapping multistage random sampling. Six fields were chosen in each section in the penumbra region and viewed at 40\u00d7 for cell counting. ImageJ (NIH) was used to analyze each picture. The percentage of immunoreactive cells (e.g. TUNEL-positive cells) among total Hoechst 33342-positive cells in the pericontusion area were counted and summarized in a total of six non-overlapping fields.\nAll analysis was performed in a double-blinded fashion. The researcher who counted the cells was blinded to the treatment group. The number of counted cells was also confirmed by two persons to verify the accuracy of the result.\n\nExtravasation of Evans blue (EB) dye\nBBB permeability was investigated by monitoring extravasation of Evans blue (EB) dye as previously described.\n20\nThe red auto-fluorescence of EB dye-albumin conjugate is evident in tissue sections examined by fluorescence microscope. Sterilized 2% EB dye (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) solution was administered intravenously (i.v.) at a dosage of 0.1\u2009mL per mouse 6\u2009h before sacrifice to visualize the BBB leakage. At 6\u2009h after 2% EB injection, and 12\u2009h after TBI, mice were sacrificed with an overdose of pentobarbital (100\u2009mg/kg) and decapitated (\nn\n=6\u20137 per group). Brains were removed. Coronal sections were used to examine the EB extravasation by photographing under the TRITC (red) excitation wavelength at 1.25\u00d7 for fluorescent microscopy (BX51, Olympus, Japan). Photoshop Professional was used to make an image mosaic (Adobe\n\u00ae\nPhotoshop\n\u00ae\nCS5, San Jose, CA).\n\nWestern blot analysis\nWestern blot analysis was used to detect the expression of apoptotic and BBB disruption markers. Three animals were included in the sham group, five animals in the TBI group, and five animals in the TBI plus HPI-363 group. After sacrifice, animals were subjected to transcardial perfusion using PBS (pH=7.4). Brain penumbra tissue was lysed in a buffer containing 0.02\u2009M Na\n4\nP\n2\nO\n7\n, 10\u2009mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100\u2009mM NaCl, 1\u2009mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (pH 8.0), 1% Triton, 1\u2009mM ethylene glycol tetracetic acid, 2\u2009mM Na\n3\nVO\n4\n, and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 15,000\u2009g for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. Protein concentration was determined with a bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). Equivalent amounts of total protein were separated by molecular weight on an SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel, and then transferred to a polyvinyl fluoride membrane. The blot was incubated in 10% nonfat dry milk for 1\u2009h and then treated with primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight.\nThe primary antibodies used and the dilutions for each were rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) at 1:400, rabbit anti-B-cell lymphoma-2 (bcl-2; Cell Signaling) at 1:1000, rabbit anti-bcl-2 associated X protein antibody (Cell Signaling) at 1:2000, mouse anti-actin (Sigma) at 1:5000, rabbit anti- matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 antibody (Millipore, Billerica, MA) at 1:2500, rabbit anti-MMP-2 antibody (Millipore) at 1:2500. After washing with TBST, membranes were incubated with AP-conjugated or HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) for 2\u2009h at room temperature. After final washing with TBST, the signals were detected with bromochloroidolylphosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium (BCIP/NBP) solution (Sigma) or film. Signal intensity was measured by ImageJ (NIH) and normalized to the actin signal intensity.\n\nIsolation of total RNA and real-time\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)\nTotal RNA from tissues of TBI mice was isolated according to the manufacturer's instruction (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Three animals were included in the sham group (\nn\n=5), the TBI control group (\nn\n=5), and the TBI plus HPI-363 group (\nn\n=5). RNA integrity was confirmed by detection of a 28S and 18S rRNA band. RNA was confirmed to be free of genomic DNA contamination by PCR in the absence of reverse transcriptase. The RNA samples were reverse transcribed in 20\u2009mL of a reaction mixture containing 2X RT buffer and 20X RT enzyme mix according to the manufacturer's instruction (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) at 37\u00b0C for 60\u2009min. The samples were then incubated at 95\u00b0C for 5\u2009min and transferred to 4\u00b0C. The RT product (1\u2009mL) was subjected to PCR amplification with 10 pmole primer, 10X standard Taq reaction buffer, 10\u2009mM dNTP, and 0.625 unit Taq polymerase in 20\u2009mL PCR reaction buffer (New England Biolabs Inc., Ipswich, MA).\nPCR primers were used as follows (5\u2032-3\u2032): for tumor necrotizing factor (TNF)-\u03b1, GATCTCAAAGACAACCAACTAGTG (forward) and CTCCAGCTGGAAGACTCCTCCCAG (reverse): for interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, TCGGCCAAGACAGGTCGCTCA (forward) and TGGTTGCCCATCAGAGGCAAGG (reverse): for IL-6, GAGGATACCCCCAACAGACC (forward) and AAGTGCATCATCGTTGTTCATACA (reverse): for IL-10, CACCCACTTCCCAGTCGGCCA (forward) and TGCTTCTCTGCCGGCATCA (reverse): for 18s, GACTCAACACGGGAAACCTC (forward) and ATGCCAGAGTCTCGTTCGTT (reverse). PCR mixtures were heated to 95\u00b0C for 10\u2009min and cycled 30\u201337 times for each primer; cycles consisted of 95\u00b0C for 15\u2009sec, 60\u00b0C for 1\u2009min, and 72\u00b0C for 30\u2009sec. After additional incubation at 72\u00b0C for 10\u2009min, the PCR samples were transferred to 4\u00b0C. PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel with ethidium bromide. Relative intensity of a PCR band was analyzed using InGenius3 manual gel documentation systems (Syngene, Frederick, MD).\n\nAdhesive removal test\nThe adhesive removal test measures sensorimotor function as described previously.\n20\nA small adhesive dot was placed on each forepaw, and the amount of time (sec) needed to contact and remove the tape from each forepaw was recorded. Recording stopped at 6\u2009min. The test was performed three times per mouse, and the average time was used in the analysis. Mice were trained three times before TBI surgery to ensure that they were able to remove the tape. Mice that showed no response or prolonged time to remove the tape during the training period were excluded from future experiments. In this behavioral study, 9 animals were randomly assigned to the TBI control group, 11 animals for the HPI-363 15\u2009min delay group, 7 animals for the HPI-363 60\u2009min group, 7 animals for the HPI-363 120\u2009min delay group, and 8 animals for the HPI-363 180\u2009min delay group.\n\nCylinder test\nA unilateral injury to the motor cortex results in an asymmetry in the forelimb used for support during rearing, which can be measured using the cylinder test. The mice were placed in a glass cylinder (9.5\u2009cm diameter and 11\u2009cm height), and the number of times each forelimb or both forelimbs were used to support the body on the wall of the cylinder was counted for 5\u2009min. The animals were evaluated at 1, 3, 7, 10, and 14 days after TBI. Two mirrors were placed behind the cylinder to view all directions. The numbers of impaired and non-impaired forelimb contacts were calculated as a percentage of total contacts.\n37\n\nHome Cage behavioral tests\nBehavioral changes of experimental mice were monitored and analyzed using the HomeCageScan (Clever Sys Inc., Reston, VA). The system had four cameras that monitored four cages, with each cage (191\u2009mm \u00d7292\u2009mm \u00d7127\u2009mm) containing one mouse. The behavior patterns were continuously recorded for 12\u2009h during nighttime. After finishing the recording, the videos were analyzed by the Home Cage Software 3.0 (Clever Sys Inc.). To perform this behavioral study, we used 3\u20136 animals per group. The HomeCageScan System was also performed to measure the shivering activities during hypothermia (\nn\n=3\u20135 per group). Subtle twitch-like behavior was detected by the monitoring camera and analyzed by the Home Cage Software 3.0 (Clever Sys Inc., Reston, VA) for shivering activity. To distinguish the shivering from twitch behavior, the detection factors in the data acquisition system were modified as the following: (1) animal size threshold (pixel)=160; (2) contrast threshold=24; (3) muscle twitch max length=30; (4) twitch/sleep merge limit=10. Shivering was measured in a 3-h period soon after the hypothermic treatment in normal animals.\n\nStatistical analysis\nGraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) was used for statistical analysis and graphic presentation. Student two-tailed\nt\ntest was used for comparison of two experimental groups, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni correction was used for multiple-group comparisons. Two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni correction was used for repeated measurements. Significant differences between groups were identified by a\np\nvalue of <0.05. All data are presented as mean\u00b1standard error of the mean."

    "Methods": "Participants\nSixteen patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) were recruited as part of a longitudinal observational study at the intensive care unit of Parkland Memorial Hospital. Thirteen patients participated in a longitudinal follow-up scan because three participants could not be contacted to participate at the second time point. All patients enrolled in this study sustained a closed-head TBI through a mechanism consistent with TAI, demonstrated acute subcortical white matter lesions visible on clinical MRI scans, and were at least 16 years old. Exclusion criteria included prior history of TBI, presence of focal lesions (including contusion, extra-axial hematoma, and intraparenchymal hemorrhages) with volume greater than 10\u2009mL visible on cranial CT, midline shift, and preexisting neurologic/psychiatric conditions that may result in abnormal MRI findings and compromise cognitive functions (i.e., prior brain tumor, Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment, human immunodeficiency virus encephalopathy, schizophrenia, etc.). Participants were taken from a sample of convenience, as all participants underwent neuroimaging as standard of care and there were no adverse events related to the scanning (i.e., during transportation to scanner, in scanner, post-scan). In addition to the standard clinical scans, an extra ten minutes were added to research-related sequences, and no complications were encountered by any of the patients. Also, a convenience sample of ten healthy volunteers was recruited as controls. The controls were recruited to match the cohort of patients in age, gender, and ethnicity (\nTable 1\n). All healthy volunteers were cognitively normal and had no known history of neurocognitive disorders.\nTable\n1.\nSignificance Comparison of Participant Characteristics\nNC\nAcute\nChronic\nMedian\nMean\nSD\nRange\nMedian\nMean\nSD\nRange\nMedian\nMean\nSD\nRange\nAge\n33.00\n36.80\n15.28\n17\u201360\n25.50\n29.11\n11.29\n17\u201358\n23.00\n28.56\n12.14\n16\u201358\nEducation (years)\n16.00\n16.10\n3.42\n11\u201321\n13.00\n13.14\n*\n2.03\n10\u201316\n12.50\n12.63\n2.71\n*\n5\u201316\nGender (% male)\n60%\n89%\n81%\nEthnicity (% Caucasian)\n90%\n78%\n81%\nHandedness (% right)\n90%\n93%\n94%\nGCS\n4.50\n6.81\n4.56\nDays in ICU\n3.00\n3.93\n4.55\nDays in hospital\n7.00\n8.87\n6.63\nTime to scan\n1.00 (days)\n1.11\n0.66\n0\u20133\n7.00 (months)\n7.03\n1.01\n6\u20139\nOpen in a separate window\nNC, normal controls; SD, standard deviation; GCS, Glasgow Coma Scale; ICU, intensive care unit.\nThis study was approved by the institutional review board at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. Informed consent was obtained from all participants or their legally authorized representative. All research was conducted in concordance with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki, 1964).\n\nImage acquisition\nMRI data were collected using a General Electric Signa Excite 3.0 Tesla (T) scanner (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). Each patient was scanned twice (with the exception of three patients who could not be contacted to undergo scanning at the second time point) once within three days of the injury (mean, 1.11 days; standard deviation [SD], 0.66 days), and a second scan conducted post-injury (mean, 7.03 months; SD, 1.01 months). The DTI images were obtained using a single shot, spin-echo, echo-planar imaging sequence with field of view=240\u2009mm, slice thickness/gap=3/0\u2009mm, approximately 45 slices, repetition time=12,000\u2009msec, echo time=75.5\u2009msec, flip angle=90\u00b0, number of excitations=2, and a matrix of 128\u00d7128. The diffusion-sensitizing gradients were applied at a b value of 1000\u2009sec/mm\n2\nper axis with 19 noncolinear directions and 3\nb\n0 images. The acquisition time was 9\u2009min with a voxel size of 2\u00d72\u00d73\u2009mm\n3\n.\n\nImage preprocessing\nDTI images were skull-stripped using the Brain Extraction Tool (BET) from the FSL software package (The Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain Software Library.\n21\nThe images were then corrected for eddy currents using FSL's Diffusion Toolbox. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and DTI tensor maps were calculated using FSL's DTIFIT program.\n\nTract-based spatial statistics\nTract-based spatial statistics (TBSS)\n22\nwas used to examine white matter diffusion in a whole-brain voxel based manner. TBSS initially created a warp matrix to transform individual subjects into a common MNI152 space (\nhttp://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/MniTalairach\n). The warp matrix is then applied to each individual subject and a mean image is derived from the subjects' data. All aligned FA images are then averaged to create a mean FA image. The mean generated image that TBSS created was then used to form a core white matter skeleton. Each individual FA image was then projected onto a one-voxel width group mean skeleton template to represent the core white matter for the group.\n22\nThe core skeleton applies a given threshold of 0.2 as determined by previous TBSS methodology and searches for the highest FA values within the surrounding voxels. Voxel based analysis across subjects was carried out for all voxels with a threshold of FA\u22650.2 derived from the mean FA skeleton image. The core skeleton reduces the probability of noise from surrounding gray matter and registration artifacts to produce an analysis with fewer constraints from noise and morphing problems. The average FA value for the entire white matter skeleton for each patient was recorded for subsequent analysis. AD, MD, and RD data were processed using the same procedure for analysis. Two individual raters visually checked each step within the TBSS processing to ensure accuracy of the analysis.\n\nClinical measures\nAcute injury severity measures include Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) taken at the time of the acute scan, days spent in the intensive care unit (ICU), and days spent in the hospital.\nChronic-stage outcome evaluations were administered approximately six months post-injury by a trained research coordinator and were supervised by a neuropsychologist; both the research coordinator and the neuropsychologist were blinded to imaging results. General functional recovery was measured using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE).\n23\nGOSE scores range from 1 to 8, with higher scores suggesting better functional outcomes. Neuropsychological assessments were conducted at chronic stage scanning and included measures for processing speed, learning and memory, and executive function,\n24\u201328\nand demographically corrected scores were utilized when available.\nProcessing speed was assessed by using performance on Trail Making Test A.\n28\nLearning and memory was assessed using the California Verbal Learning Test-II.\n29\n,\n30\nLearning was assessed by the total number of items learned across five trials, and memory was assessed by the number of words recalled after a 20-minute delay. Executive functions, defined as cognitive switching and selective attention, were assessed by using Trail Making Test B\n28\nand Stroop interference condition,\n31\nrespectively.\n\nStatistical analysis\nBetween-group differences for demographic variables were examined using independent samples\nt\ntests (\nTable 1\n). Chi-squared analysis was utilized to determine group differences for categorical variables such as gender and ethnicity. SPSS software was used (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).\n32\nIndependent samples\nt\ntests were used to examine differences in the mean values of FA, MD, AD, and RD whole-brain distributions between acute patients and controls and chronic patients and controls, and a paired sample\nt\ntest was used to examine change in patients over time (p\u22640.05) using SPSS.\n32\nAlso, an exploratory analysis was conducted examining correlations between whole-brain averages of diffusivity measures, outcome measures, and neuropsychological assessments, also using SPSS. Due to the small sample size, there was not enough power in the analyses to correct for multiple comparisons; therefore, this correction was not done in order to find significant relationships between variables would not be seen otherwise.\n\nTBSS analysis\nThe DTI images were analyzed with the \u201cRandomise\u201d statistical package in FSL. We conducted voxel wise cross-subject analysis with group comparisons including: normal versus acute, normal versus chronic, and acute versus chronic using a Monte Carlo analysis with 5000 permutations. Average skeletal voxels from mean DTI metrics were created to exclude both ventricles and gray matter using a strict 0.2 threshold. White matter skeletons were then used to create mean DTI metrics including FA, MD, AD, and RD for pairwise comparisons. Pairwise comparisons of acute and chronic data also were conducted in this manner. Significance levels were corrected for multiple comparisons using a family-wise error rate of\np\n<0.05 on the uncorrected TBSS output. The effect of age and gender were covaried from each comparison prior to each analysis."

    "Methods": "Experimental protocol and study groups\nThe institutional animal care and use committee of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine (Pittsburgh, PA) approved all experiments. The details of our CCI+HS model have been previously described.\n8\nIn the current study, male C57BL6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME), 12\u201315 weeks of age, were used. Anesthesia was induced with 4% isoflurane in oxygen and maintained with 1% isoflurane in 2:1\u2009N\n2\nO/O\n2\nby nose cone. Inguinal cut down and insertion of femoral venous and arterial catheters were accomplished under sterile conditions using modified polyethylene 50 tubing. After placement of the mouse in a stereotaxic frame, a 5-mm craniotomy was performed over the left parietotemporal cortex with a dental drill, and the bone flap was removed. Immediately after craniotomy, the inhalational anesthesia was changed to 1% isoflurane and room air for a 10-min equilibration period before beginning the injury protocols. Monitoring included a brain parenchyma temperature probe inserted through a separate burr hole. While brain temperature was maintained at 37\u00b10.5\u00b0C, CCI was performed with a pneumatic impactor. A 3-mm flat-tip impounder was deployed at a velocity of 5\u2009m/sec and a depth of 1\u2009mm. This injury level for CCI was specifically chosen to produce a contusion without significant hippocampal neuronal death, unless HS is superimposed upon the insult.\n5\n,\n8\n,\n38\n,\n39\nHS was induced by phlebotomy to a target mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) of 25\u201327\u2009mm Hg (HS phase). Mice remained hypotensive for a total of 35\u2009min. After completion of the HS phase, a 90-min prehospital phase was initiated and 20\u2009mL/kg of lactated Ringer's (LR) was rapidly infused. Additional aliquots of 10\u2009mL/kg were infused as needed to achieve a MAP of 70\u2009mm Hg. To simulate arrival at definitive care (hospital phase), the inhaled gas mixture was switched from 1% isoflurane in room air to 1% isoflurane in oxygen, and all shed blood was reinfused. At completion of the hospital phase, catheters were removed, anesthesia discontinued, and mice recovered in supplemental oxygen for 30\u2009min before being returned to their cages.\nMice were randomized to one of five study groups (\nn\n=4 [na\u00efve] or 8 per group) and underwent procedures or equivalent anesthesia and monitoring as designated: 1) na\u00efve (no anesthesia, craniotomy, monitoring, CCI, or HS); 2) sham (anesthesia, monitoring, and craniotomy, without CCI or HS); 3) CCI alone; 4) HS alone (including monitoring, without craniotomy); or (5) CCI+HS. Mice in the CCI-only group underwent CCI without HS, but were maintained under identical anesthesia and monitoring as the combined injury group for a 90-min interval. Heart rate (HR), MAP, arterial blood gas results (pH, PaCO\n2\n, PaO\n2\n, and base deficit), hematocrit, and lactate were recorded serially.\n\nMultiplex assessment\nMice were euthanized at either 2 or 24\u2009h after finishing the experimental protocol (\nn\n=4 per time point per study group). Mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane, and a blood sample was obtained by cardiac puncture. Animals were then transcardially perfused with heparinized saline. Brains were dissected into cerebellum, parietal cortex (ipsi- and contralateral), and hippocampus (ipsi- and contralateral) and snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen. Tissue was weighed and homogenized with an 8\u00d7volume of 1\u00d7phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), sonicated, and spun for 30\u2009min at 14,000\ng\nto obtain the supernatant. Protein concentration was measured using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Vernon Hills, IL). Supernatant aliquots were assayed for inflammatory mediators by Multiplex (\nn\n=3 for 24-h CCI group; Millipore, Billerica, MA). Individual protein levels were indexed to total measured level of protein in the sample (pg/mg of protein). Levels of 10 proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-12, IL-17, interferon-gamma [IFN-\u03b3], and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-\u03b1]), three anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13), six chemokines (eotaxin [C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL)11], IFN-inducible protein 10 [IP-10; C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL)10], keratinocyte chemoattractant [KC; CXCL1; analog of human IL-8], monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 [MCP-1; CCL2], macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha [MIP-1\u03b1; CCL3], and regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed, and secreted [RANTES; CCL5]), and three growth factors (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF], granulocyte macrophage/colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF], and vascular endothelial growth factor) were measured. Though chemokines are a type of cytokine (\nchemo\ntactic cyto\nkine\n), the term \u201ccytokine\u201d is used throughout the article to mean cytokines that are not chemokines (i.e., IL-4, IL-6, and so on).\n\nComparison of sensitivity of Multiplex and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\nTo determine how the sensitivity of Multiplex compared to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) specifically in brain tissue samples, we carried out two additional experiments. First, we studied mice in the same three groups (na\u00efve, CCI, and CCI+HS;\nn\n=3/group) and sacrificed them at 2\u2009h after insult using an identical protocol to that used for Multiplex assessments. Brain samples from the same five regions were processed identically and again homogenized in PBS as described above and assayed for TNF-\u03b1 by ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Second, we again studied mice in the same threegroups (na\u00efve, CCI, and CCI+HS;\nn\n=3/group) and sacrificed them at 2\u2009h after insult using an identical protocol to that used for Multiplex and aforementioned ELISA, except that lysis buffer (radioimmunoprecipitation assay [RIPA] buffer; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used rather than PBS. Brain samples from the same five regions were again assayed for TNF-\u03b1 by ELISA (R&D Systems). The assay detection limit was 0.36\u2009pg/mL.\n\nStatistical analysis\nBrain levels of mediators are reported in pg/mg of protein (median [range]) and serum levels in pg/mL of serum (median [range]). Nonzero mediator levels outside of the lab's reference range were transformed into a standardized high or low value (2000 or 0.1\u2009pg/mg of protein for brain tissue samples; 20,000 or 1.0\u2009pg/mL for serum samples). Similar to earlier studies, mediators with levels frequently outside of the reference range (>65%) were excluded from analysis.\n40\n,\n41\nResults of mediator levels were grouped by injury mechanism, tissue sample type, and time point. Given that the data were not normally distributed, Wilcoxon's rank-sum test with Bonferroni's correction for multiple comparisons was used to make pair-wise group comparisons with sham as control for brain tissue levels and na\u00efve as control for serum levels. Physiology parameters are reported as mean. Physiology parameters were compared with a one-way analysis of variance test and with Holm-Sidak's test. A value of\np\n<0.05 was deemed significant. Only results with significant differences between groups are shown."

    "Methods": "Study population\nmTBI patients were enrolled at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH; San Francisco, CA) as part of the prospective multi-center TRACK-TBI (Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury) pilot study.\n40\nThe primary inclusion criterion for the TRACK-TBI pilot study was performance of noncontrast head CT to assess for evidence of acute TBI within 24\u2009h of injury, based on criteria from the American College of Emergency Physicians/Centers for Disease Control (ACEP/CDC) evidence-based joint practice guideline (\nSupplementary Table S1\n) (see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n).\n41\nThe TRACK-TBI pilot study exclusion criteria were limited and consisted of nonfluency in English, contraindication to MRI, pregnancy, and current incarceration/legal detention or placement on psychiatric hold.\n40\nFor the current study of DTI of mTBI, additional inclusion criteria were GCS 13\u201315 upon emergency department (ED) arrival, LOC <30\u2009min, PTA duration <24\u2009h, and age 18\u201355 years (inclusive); an additional exclusion criterion was any reported history of earlier TBI resulting in LOC >5\u2009min. Of 190 mTBI patients in the 18- to 55-year age range enrolled at SFGH for the TRACK-TBI pilot study, 87 patients did not undergo brain MRI. Of the remaining 103 patients, 18 reported a history of earlier TBI with LOC >5\u2009min or of unknown duration; 5 had a technically inadequate brain MRI exam (because of motion or, in 1 case, because of severe susceptibility artifact resulting from a metallic shunt valve within the scalp); 1 patient had an extensive area of encephalomalacia likely the result of an earlier TBI; 1 had an acute large-territory infarct resulting from acute traumatic arterial dissection; and 2 were excluded because their performance on the Trail Making Test (TMT) B and other outcome measures were extreme outliers, despite a GCS of 15 upon ED arrival, no LOC or PTA, and no CT or conventional MRI evidence of traumatic intracranial injury. The final patient group for the current study therefore consisted of 76 mTBI patients enrolled at SFGH who underwent brain MRI on a single 3T MRI scanner within 3 weeks of TBI. In addition, a control group consisted of 50 healthy subjects, ages 18\u201355 years, with no self-reported history of drug or alcohol abuse, neuropsychiatric illness, or earlier TBI, who underwent brain MRI on the same 3T scanner over the same time period, employing the same MRI protocol and software version. All study protocols were approved by the University of California at San Francisco Institutional Review Board, and all patients and control subjects or their legal representatives gave written informed consent.\nTable 1\nsummarizes demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical characteristics of participants and control subjects. We assessed for statistically significant differences in demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical features at\np\n<0.05 among the following groups: 1) CT/MRI-positive patients, defined as patients with any acute traumatic intracranial lesion or depressed skull fracture on day-of-admission CT or semiacute 3T MRI; 2) CT/MRI-negative patients, defined as patients without any such abnormality; and 3) control subjects. We used analysis of variance (ANOVA) for scale variables without significant deviation from a normal distribution, and Mann-Whitney U test for ordinal and non-normal variables. Differences in nominal variables were assessed by chi-square (\u03c7\n2\n) test for independence or by Fisher's exact test for nominal variables with an expected count of fewer than 5 subjects in any cell.

MRI was performed within 11.2\u00b13.3 days (range, 5\u201318) postinjury. All CT exams were performed on a GE Lightspeed 64-row-detector CT scanner, and all MRI exams were performed on the same 3T GE Signa EXCITE scanner equipped with an eight-channel phased-array head radiofrequency coil (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI), using the same scanner software version. Whole-brain DTI was performed with a multi-slice single-shot spin echo echoplanar pulse sequence (echo time [TE]=63 ms; repetition time [TR]=14\u2009sec) using 55 diffusion-encoding directions, isotropically distributed over the surface of a sphere with electrostatic repulsion, acquired at b=1000\u2009sec/mm\n2\n, seven acquisitions at b=0\u2009sec/mm\n2\n, 72 interleaved slices of 1.8-mm thickness each with no gap between slices, a 128\u00d7128 matrix, and a field of view (FOV) of 230\u00d7230\u2009mm. Parallel imaging was employed using the array spatial sensitivity encoding technique (ASSET) with an acceleration factor of 2.\nThe following conventional 3T MRI sequences were also performed: 1) axial three-dimensional (3D) inversion recovery fast spoiled gradient recalled echo T1-weighted images (TE=1.5 ms; TR=6.3 ms; inversion time [TI]=400 ms; flip angle, 15 degrees) with 230-mm FOV, 156 contiguous partitions (1.0-mm) at 256\u00d7256 matrix; 2) axial T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images (TE=126 ms; TR=10\u2009sec; TI=2200\u2009ms) with 220\u2009mm FOV, 47\u201348 contiguous slices (3.0-mm) at 256\u00d7256 matrix; and 3) axial magnetization-prepared gradient echo T2*-weighted images (TE=15 ms; TR=500 ms; flip angle 20 degrees) with 220\u00d7170\u2009mm FOV and 47\u201348 contiguous slices (3.0-mm) at 256\u00d7192 matrix.\n\nNeuroradiologist evaluation of CT and MRI studies for acute traumatic abnormalities\nEach patient's head CT upon ED presentation and early brain MRI (11.2\u00b13.3 days postinjury) was characterized using the TBI common data elements (TBI-CDE). The TBI-CDEs are consensus-based recommendations for data collection, data definitions, and best practices in TBI research established jointly by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Defense Centers of Excellence, National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, and Veterans Administration.\n42\u201344\nEach CT and MRI was anonymized and reviewed by a board-certified neuroradiologist blinded to demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical data, except gender and age, and without concurrent access to the patient's other head imaging studies or 3- and 6-month outcome measures.\nmTBI patients were divided into two subgroups: 1) CT/MRI positive, defined as patients with any acute traumatic intracranial lesion (epidural hematoma [EDH], subdural hematoma [SDH], subarachnoid hemorrhage [SAH], contusion, or evidence of traumatic axonal injury) and/or depressed skull fracture on either CT or MRI, and 2) CT/MRI negative, defined as patients without any such abnormality. Most previous studies of \u201ccomplicated\u201d mTBI, including Williams and colleagues,\n38\ndemonstrated poorer neuropsychiatric test performance based solely on CT findings (presence of any acute intracranial hemorrhage or depressed skull fracture). Our dichotomization of mTBI patients according to presence of abnormalities on\neither\nCT or MRI is based on more recent work that demonstrated poorer 3-month outcome associated with early MRI intracranial abnormalities, whether or not visible on CT.\n39\n\nDiffusion tensor image processing\nNonbrain tissue was eliminated from the diffusion-weighted and 3D T1-weighted images using the Functional MRI of the Brain (FMRIB, Oxford University, Oxford, UK) Brain Extraction Tool.\n45\nDiffusion-weighted images were corrected for eddy currents and registered to the b=0\u2009sec/mm\n2\nvolume using the FMRIB Linear Image Registration Tool. A diffusion tensor model was constructed using the FMRIB DTIFit algorithm\n46\nto yield fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) at each voxel. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS)\n47\nwere used to align each subject's FA data to a white matter skeleton, after low FA values below a threshold of 0.25 were excluded to limit voxels to the white matter.\nVoxel-wise nonparametric statistical comparison between 76 mTBI patients and 50 controls was performed using the FMRIB Software Library (FSL) randomise algorithm based on permutation testing, with corrections for multiple voxel-wise comparisons using threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE).\n48\nAnatomic locations of voxel clusters with statistically significant differences in FA, MD, RD, or AD between mTBI and control groups at\np\n<0.05 were determined. This analysis was also used to compare the subgroup of 32 CT/MRI-positive patients to the 50 controls and also the subgroup of 44 CT/MRI-negative mTBI patients to the 50 controls.\nIn addition to the whole-brain voxel-wise approach, we performed a complementary ROI analysis to address the possibility that a whole-brain, data-driven approach might not be sufficiently sensitive to reveal white matter injury because of possibly significant spatial heterogeneity of white matter injury across mTBI subjects. Twenty-seven white matter ROIs were delineated by the intersection of the Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, MD) ICBM-DTI-81 White Matter Labeled Atlas\n49\nand the reference white matter skeleton. These consisted of the anterior corona radiata, superior corona radiata, posterior corona radiata, anterior limb of internal capsule, posterior limb of internal capsule, external capsule, superior longitudinal fasciculus, sagittal striatum, ventral cingulum (parahippocampal gyrus), dorsal cingulum (cingulate gyrus), inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and superior fronto-occipital fasciculus, each on the left and right; and also the body, genu, and splenium of the corpus callosum. The FA, MD, AD, and RD within each of these 27 ROIs in each patient and control subject were determined. For each ROI, the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the FA within the group of 50 control subjects was calculated. Similarly, for each ROI, the mean and SD for each of the other DTI measures (MD, AD, and RD) in the group of 50 control subjects were calculated. For each of the 76 mTBI patients and 50 control subjects, an abnormal ROI was then defined as one in which a DTI measure (FA, MD, AD, or RD) was more than 2.2 SDs below or above the control-group mean, based on the distribution of the DTI measure within the 50 control patients alone.\n\nOutcome measures\nOutcome measures included the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) at 3 and 6 months postinjury, the Rivermead Postconcussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ), California Verbal Learning Test\u2013Second Edition (CVLT-II), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale\u2013Fourth Edition, Processing Speed Index (WAIS-IV PSI), and Trail Making Tests A and B (TMT A and TMT B) at 6 months. The GOS-E was obtained at 3 and 6 months postinjury through structured interview with each participant by research assistants trained to uniformly assess the GOS-E. Modeled after the 5-point Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), the 8-point GOS-E provides better discrimination among more subtle aspects of disability within mild-to-moderate, rather than mild-to-severe, TBI and is a well-validated, widely employed measure of global function after mTBI.\n50\nThe TMT A and B are tests of visual attention, visual-motor coordination, task switching, and executive function.\n51\n,\n52\nWAIS-IV PSI is a test of perceptual processing speed with additional contribution from working memory.\n53\n,\n54\nThe CVLT-II is a test of verbal learning and memory and was used in place of the TBI CDE Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test because of recent revision of the CVLT with demonstration of improved psychometric properties.\n55\n,\n56\nThe RPQ consists of 16 symptoms frequently reported after mTBI.\n57\n,\n58\nThe first three symptoms, denoted RPQ-3, are more physical symptoms (headaches, dizziness, and nausea/vomiting) typically experienced immediately after the TBI event, whereas the other 13 symptoms (denoted RPQ-13) are more psychosocial in nature (hyperacusis, sleep disturbances, fatigue, irritability, depressed mood, frustration, forgetfulness, poor concentration, requiring longer times to think, blurred vision, light sensitivity, double vision, and restlessness) and have been shown to occur later in the clinical course after mTBI.\n59\n,\n60\nWe assessed for statistically significant group differences in each outcome measure between CT/MRI-positive and -negative mTBI patients. The CVLT-II, WAIS-IV PSI, and TMT A and B scores were converted to normative scores for age, and ANOVA was used to test for group differences in these variables between CT/MRI-positive and -negative mTBI patients at\np\n<0.05. Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess for group differences in the 3-month GOS-E, 6-month GOS-E, RPQ-3, and RPQ-13 at\np\n<0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics (version 21).\n\nSpearman's correlation and ordinal logistic regression analyses\nWe calculated Spearman's correlation coefficients between each outcome measure and each of 11 demographic (age, gender), socioeconomic (employment status, number of years of formal education), and clinical (history of major neuropsychiatric diagnosis, history of drug or alcohol abuse, GCS upon ED arrival, any PTA, PTA duration, any LOC, any history of mTBI with LOC duration not exceeding 5\u2009min) predictors, 5 noncontrast head CT features (calvarial or skull base fracture, EDH, SDH, SAH, contusion), and 3 brain MRI features (contusion, hemorrhagic axonal injury, or evidence of white matter injury on DTI ROI analysis). We used Spearman's correlation, rather than its parametric counterpart, Pearson's product-moment correlation, because of the nominal or ordinal nature and/or non-normal distribution of most of these variables. We then performed multivariable logistic or linear regression of each outcome measure upon all predictors with which the outcome measure had demonstrated a statistically significant pairwise Spearman's correlation. For both Spearman's correlation and the regression analyses, the CVLT-II, WAIS-IV PSI, and TMT A and B test scaled or z-scores, as well as binary outcome variables corresponding to performance worse or better than 2 SDs worse than the normative score as determined by previous studies,\n52\n,\n54\n,\n55\nwere included as outcome variables. For the ordinal logistic regression analyses, tests for parallel lines were performed and confirmed the proportional odds assumption for each analysis. These statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics (version 21)."

    "Methods": "Lateral fluid percussion injury\nExperiments were performed on 5- to 7-week-old, 20- to 25-g C57BL/6J male mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). All experimental procedures and protocols for animal studies were approved by the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Philadelphia, PA) in accord with the international guidelines on the ethical use of animals. Experiments were designed to minimize the number of animals required. Animals used were cared for, handled, and medicated to minimize suffering (National Research Council, National Academy Press, Washington, DC, 1996). Lateral fluid perscussion injury (LFPI) was performed as previously reported.\n23\u201326\nIn brief, on day 1, animals were anesthetized with a ketamine (10\u2009mg/100\u2009g body weight; JHP Pharmaceuticals, Parsippany, NJ) and xylazine (1\u2009mg/100\u2009g body weight; Phoenix Pharmaceutical, Phoenix, AZ) mixture, and a parietal craniectomy on the right side was performed using a 3-mm trephine. A Luer-loc needle hub (3-mm inner diameter) was secured above the skull opening with cyanoacrylate adhesive and dental acrylic. On day 2, the hub was filled with saline and connected by high-pressure tubing to the LFPI device (Department of Biomedical Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA). The injury was induced by a brief pulse of saline onto the intact dura, which delivers a pressure between 1.8 and 2.1 atmospheres, generating a mild-to-moderate brain injury.\n23\n,\n26\nSham animals received all of the above-mentioned procedures except the fluid pulse. Animals were warmed with an electric heating pad until they could move freely, before they were returned to their cages and fed with regular diet and tap water.\n\nImmunofluorescent staining\nThirty minutes, 18\u2009h, 7 days, or 30 days after LFPI, injured and respective time-matched sham animals were anesthetized with 5% chloral hydrate and perfused with saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Brains were postfixed for 2\u2009h at room temperature (RT) and 50-\u03bcm-thick frontal (also known as coronal) sections were cut with a VT1000S vibratome (Leica Microsystems Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL). All brain sections were\u00b11\u2009mm from bregma. This was ensured by grossly verifying the presence of the corpus callosum and the absence of the hippocampus in each slice. For cilia staining, sections were incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody (Ab) against type IV \u00df-tubulin (1:1000 in phosphate-buffered saline; AbCam, Cambridge, MA) before visualization with Alexa Fluor\n\u00ae\n488\u2013conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (IgG; 1:200; Molecular Probes, Grand Island, NY). Basal body staining was conducted by incubating sections with a rabbit polyclonal Ab against \u03b3-tubulin (1:500; AbCam). These sections were subsequently incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:250; Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) and then with streptavidin/cyanine 3 (1:250; Sigma-Aldrich) for visualization. Primary Ab incubation was applied for 90 minutes at RT and continued overnight at 4\u00b0C, and secondary Abs were subsequently applied for 90 minutes at RT.\nConfocal images were acquired with the Olympus Fluoview 1000 System (Olympus America, Center Valley, PA), with the Z-step kept at 0.5\u2009\u03bcm. Consistent confocal settings (laser intensity, confocal aperture, photomultiplier tube, gain, offset, and resolution) were optimized and remained unchanged during the imaging of slices from both sham and injured animals for each time point. The staining pattern was confirmed in three LFPI and time-matched sham animals at each individual time point. From each mouse, 3\u20135 sections through the lateral ventricle at the rostral levels on the ipsilateral side were assessed.\n\nEpendymal cell loss assay\nSeven days after injury or sham procedure, 3 LFPI mice and 3 sham mice were processed for this assay. Fixed frontal sections (within the rostrocaudal range\u00b11\u2009mm relative to bregma) through the lateral ventricles were stained with Hoechst (Molecular Probes), a nuclear dye to stain all cells in the tissue. Confocal images of nuclei of the ependymal cells lining the ipsilateral lateral ventricle were compared between injured and sham mice. In healthy animals, ependymal cells cover the brain ventricles evenly (\nSupplementary Fig. 1\n) (see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). In case of ependymal cell loss, obvious gaps between stained ependymal nuclei can be observed along the banks of the ventricles in the sections.\n\nPre-embedding immunogold staining\nSeven days after injury, 3 LFPI mice and 3 sham-operated controls were perfused with a mixture of 4% PFA and 0.5% glutaraldehyde (GTA; Sigma-Aldrich). Brains were removed and postfixed in the aforementioned fixative for 3\u2009h at RT. After incubation with the \u03b3-tubulin Ab for basal body staining as described above, 50-\u03bcm-thick vibratome sections (\u00b11\u2009mm relative to bregma) were incubated with Ultra-Small gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100 in acetylated bovine serum albumin; Aurion, Wageningen, The Netherlands) for 6\u2009h at RT. They were post-fixed with 2% GTA for 30\u2009min. Immunogold-stained sections were silver-enhanced with the R-Gent SE-EM kit (Aurion) for 45\u2009min at RT and then saved in enhancement condition solution (Aurion) for transmission electron microscopic (TEM) processing.\n\nTransmission electron microscopy\nThe right hemisphere of 3 immunogold-stained sections (for basal body staining) and 3 unstained sections (for cilia \u201c9+2 microtubule arrangement\u201d) from each mouse were cropped and treated with 0.1\u2009M of cacodylate buffer twice, 1% tannic acid, and then 1% NaSO\n4\n, each for 10\u2009min. They were subsequently washed in deionized water (DW) twice and then dehydrated with a graded ethanol series (50\u2013100%). After the last 100% ethanol treatment, slices were placed in 100% acetonitrile (2\u00d710\u2009min each) followed by serial infiltration with epoxy resin (Embed 812): acetonitrile/epoxy (2:1); acetonitrile/epoxy (1:1); and then acetonitrile/epoxy (1:2), 30\u2009min each. Lateral ventricles were trimmed out and well oriented in Beem Capsules (2\u20133 right ventricle slices from 1 mouse in each capsule), embedded in 100% epoxy, and heat-incubated for 24\u2009h. All chemicals for TEM processing were purchased from Electron Microscopic Services (Hatfield, PA).\nTrimmed epoxy blocks were set on a 2050 Reichert Jung Supercut microtome (Leica Microsystems Inc.). Slices (1-\u03bcm-thick) were cut perpendicular to the plane of the 50-\u03bcm vibratome slices. As such, each \u201cthick\u201d slice is a 50-\u03bcm-wide belt. They were collected in drops of DW on heated slide glasses (60\u00b0C). To identify area of interest (ventricular cilia), dried slices were stained with 1% methylene blue for 13\u2009sec. Excess dye was washed away with tap water, and the samples were differentiated with 95% ethanol for 15\u2009sec. When cilia were identified under the microscope, the epoxy block was set on a Richert Ultra Cut S microtome (Leica Microsystems). Ultra-thin slices were cut at 80\u2009nm and floated on DW. They were mounted on 250 mesh nickel grids (Electron Microscopic Services). Grids were then dried thoroughly on filter paper and saved in grid cassettes for at least 24\u2009h before contrast staining. Dried sample grids were stained with 1% uranyl acetate in ethanol and then 0.1% lead citrate in DW, 30\u2009min each. Once again, grids were dried on filter paper before observation under a Hitachi 7000 Electron Microscope (Hitachi High Technologies America, Pleasanton, CA).\nMotile cilia are composed of nine peripheral doublet microtubles surrounding a central pair of single microtubules, a 9+2 axoneme. Radial spokes project from the central pair and interact with the peripheral doublets, lending to the stability of the axonemal structure, whereas the dynein arms generate the motion of the cilia by creating a sliding motion between the adjacent peripheral doublets.\n27\n,\n28\nTransverse sections of cilia were observed to test whether LFPI affects the 9+2 microtubule arrangement normal structure of cilia. Immunogold-stained basal body transverse and longitudinal sections were also observed by electron microscope (EM). These images were taken using a Hitachi EM scope with an attached CCD camera (Hitachi Technologies America). Cilia and basal body morphology were then compared between LFPI and sham animals.\n\nScanning electron microscopy\nSeven days after injury or sham procedure, 3 LFPI mice and 3 sham mice were sacrificed and their brains were processed as in the protocol for immunogold staining. Vibratome sections at 300\u2009\u03bcm (\u00b11\u2009mm relative to bregma) were dehydrated in a progression of increasing ethanol concentrations, up to 100% ethanol, as described previously.\n29\nSpecimens were then critical-point dried in CO\n2\n, mounted on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) stubs, and sputter coated with gold palladium to a depth of 12\u2009nm. The surface of brain slices was then examined with an AMR-1400 SEM (Phillips, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) at an accelerating voltage of 20\u2009kV. Representative photomicrographs were taken at various angles to effectively display the specimen so that any errors in assessment resulting from the tilt of the specimen or other artifacts are minimized.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging\nThree mice were used for ventricular volume analysis with repeated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging. They were all imaged on the same day of injury, before injury procedure, and this measurement was used as a within-subjects control. After this scan, LFPI was induced as described above. All mice were imaged again at 18\u2009h, 7 days, and 4 weeks after LFPI. Whole-brain MRI images were obtained with a ClinScan system (7\u2009T horizontal bore Bruker Magnet; Bruker Biospin, Ettlingen, Germany; and Siemens syngo software; Siemens Healthcare Global AG, Erlangen, Germany) using the linear body coil and a mouse brain 2\u00d72 surface coil array. Mice were anesthetized with isofluorane and their vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate and body temperature) monitored throughout the scan. A three-dimensional data set of the whole-mouse brain (in plane field of view of 25\u00d721\u2009mm, 192 data points, and 48 slices of 160-\u03bcm thickness resulting in voxels with dimensions of 130\u00d7130\u00d7160 microns) was acquired using a turbo spin echo technique with a turbo factor of 31. The repetition rate was 1500\u2009ms, whereas the echo time (TE) of 3.12\u2009ms corresponded to an effective TE of 66\u2009ms. The bandwidth was 592\u2009Hz/Px and five excitations were averaged. A magnetization restore pulse and the generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions technique with an acceleration factor of 2 were used to speed up the acquisition. MRI images were opened and volumes of the brain ventricles on both sides were analyzed with ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).\n\nParticle tracking with fluorescent beads\nThree LFPI mice and 3 sham controls were sacrificed at 18\u2009h, 7 days, or 30 days after LFPI or sham procedure. Brains were removed and rinsed in cold CO\n2\n/O\n2\n-balanced sucrose cutting media. Live frontal slices of 250-\u03bcm thickness were cut through the lateral ventricle (\u00b11\u2009mm relative to bregma) with a VT 1200S vibratome (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) and collected in CO\n2\n/O\n2\n-balanced artificial CSF (aCSF). Latex beads with yellow-green fluorescence (2\u03bcm in diameter; Sigma-Aldrich) were diluted in aCSF and added to cover glass-bottomed dishes that held single slices before video recording under the Olympus FV 1000 confocal system (Olympus America). A total of 450 frames of images were taken in 30\u2009sec using the XYT \u201cround-trip\u201d module, which reaches the highest imaging speed of the system (15 frames/sec). The resolution was automatically set at 256\u00d7256 pixels and 6\u00d7zoom. The 10\u00d7optical lens was used for video recording of both green fluorescent and differential interference contrast channels. This way, beating cilia could be identified while simultaneously imaging moving fluorescent beads. At least 3\u20136 slices were used from each mouse and 5 beads were tracked in each slice. Videos were opened with the MetaMorph software program (Molecular Devices, LLC, Sunnyvale, CA), and the tracks of single beads were traced for at least 15 frames (1\u2009sec). To reduce experimental variability, only beads moving along the main stream of CSF at the focus of beating cilia that could be followed for at least 15 frames of recording were used. Velocity was calculated and compared between sham and LFPI groups at each time point.\n\nStatistical analysis\nBecause of the nested nature of the data and modest sample size, a linear mixed-effect model was used to determine statistical significance when comparing different treatment groups, with \u03b1=0.05. Each dot in the group data plot in\nFigure 6\nis a mean from multiple beads from a single brain slice.

A certified athletic trainer or team physician made the diagnosis and treated all instances of concussion at their professional discretion. After concussion diagnosis, each team's medical staff provided the date and suspected time of injury as well as the approximate time of diagnosis. Anecdotal observations of the events surrounding injury (e.g., description of the impact, method of identifying the injury, and comments from coaches, trainers, teammates, or parents) were also provided. An impact recorded by the HIT System was retrospectively associated with each diagnosed concussion by cross-referencing all the information with the impact time stamp on the day of injury.\nTo minimize influence from any potential errors in measured impacts, each impact used for model simulation has been manually reviewed and found to be free of typical signs of elevated error (i.e., accelerometer signal noise, signal artifact from electromechanical malfunction, and rapid acceleration/deceleration indicating loss of head contact). The processed acceleration data were further verified against descriptions of general severity and location provided by sideline personnel as an additional qualitative check of accuracy. A total of 11 persons with concussion were evaluated.\n\nNeuroimaging acquisition\nFor all athletes, high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were acquired in the Dartmouth Advanced Imaging Center. The brain and its anatomical regions (e.g., white matter, corpus callosum) were automatically segmented from the high-resolution MRI (1\u2009mm\u00d71\u2009mm\u00d71\u2009mm; image dimension of 256\u00d7256\u00d7256) using FreeSurfer (Version 5.1). DTI were acquired using 46 diffusion directions (collected with b=1000\u2009s/mm\n2\n, NEX=1) plus an additional volume without diffusion gradients (b=0) serving as an anatomical reference map. All DTI had an image dimension of 128\u00d7128\u00d765 with a voxel resolution of 2\u2009mm\u00d72\u2009mm\u00d72\u2009mm. Diffusion tensors, eigenvectors, and scalar diffusion parameters were computed using ExploreDTI with corrections for eddy currents and motion before fitting a tensor model.\n30\n\nDHIM\nThe DHIM was created based on a template high-resolution T1-weighted MRI (MRI\ntemp\n) of a person selected from the group of concussed athletes whose head was positioned neutrally without tilting in the MRI. In addition to the automatically segmented brain, the falx and tentorium were manually delineated. The resulting anatomical geometries were imported into Geomagic (Geomagic, Inc., Research Triangle Park, NC) for parameterization and further into TrueGrid (version 2.3.4; XYZ Scientific Application, Inc., Livermore, CA) for meshing. Multiblocks for the cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, falx, and tentorium were created. The brain mesh outer surface served as a baseline to define elements for the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and skull using Hypermesh (Altair Engineering, Inc., Troy, MI). Membrane structures of the pia and shell structures of the dura surrounding the CSF were also generated.\nTo improve biofidelity in the basal region, the segmented brainstem was extended along the neural axis to include part of the spinal cord that was not captured in MRI. An elastic membrane was also included at the base to simulate the loading environment for brainstem moving through the foramen magnum.\n16\nIn addition, scalp and face including the eyes, facial bones, and other components were created based on a template head model.\n31\nAll solid (surface) parts were represented by hexahedral (quadrilateral) elements. A reduced integration with hourglass control was used (hourglass energy typically 5\u20138% of internal energy). A soft CSF layer existed between the brain surface and all of its surrounding structures to allow brain interfacial sliding through CSF deformation (nodes between all anatomical interfaces were shared).\n16\nThe DHIM model components and associated material properties used in this study are summarized in\nTables 2\nand\n\u200b\nand3.\n3\n. In total, the model contains 101,420 nodes and 115,228 elements with a combined mass of 4.562\u2009kg for the head, and 56,632 nodes and 55,062 elements with a combined mass of 1.579\u2009kg for the brain (1.558\u2009kg without the spinal cord). The average element size for the whole head and the brain is 3.2\u00b10.94\u2009mm and 3.3\u00b10.79\u2009mm, respectively.\nTable\n2.\nThe DHIM Model Components and Associated Material Properties Used in this Study\nMaterial properties\nComponents\nNumber of nodes\nNumber of elements\nElement type\n\u03c1 (kg/m\n3\n)\nE (MPa)\n\u03c5\nK (MPa)\nCerebrum\n36832\n33264\nSolid\n1040\nHyperelastic\n13\n(see\nTable 3\n)\n0.4999976\n219\nCerebellum\n7839\n6720\nSolid\nBrainstem\n4500\n3654\nSolid\nCorpus callosum\n390\n200\nSolid\nCSF\n17258\n9540\nSolid\n1000\n21.9\nDura\n36\n6136\n6112\nShell\n1130\n31.5\n0.45\nFalx\n36\n956\n880\nShell\nTentorium\n36\n867\n804\nShell\nPia\n37\n9358\n9336\nMembrane\n1130\n1.15\n0.4\nDiploe\n38\n18408\n12224\nSolid\n1750\n5660\n0.22\nCortical bones\n39\n24544\n12224\nShell\n3000\n15000\n0.22\nForamen magnum\n16\n196\n172\nShell\n1130\n31.5\n0.45\nScalp\n40\n9652\n4600\nSolid\n1300\n16.72\n0.42\n1198\n1004\nShell\nCombined facial components\n14721\n11324\nSolid\nRigid\n3126\n3170\nShell\nOpen in a separate window\n\u03c1, density; E, Young modulus; \u03c5, Poisson ratio; K, bulk modulus.\nReferences for the material properties are also provided.\nTable\n3.\nHyperelastic and Viscoelastic Material Model for the Brain Showing the Ogden Constants\n(\n\u03bc\ni\nand\n\u03b1\ni\n)\nand Prony Series Constants (g\ni\nand\n\u03c4\ni\n)\nin Abaqus Convention\n\u03bc\n1\n(Pa)\n\u03b1\n1\n\u03bc\n2\n(Pa)\n\u03b1\n2\n271.7\n10.1\n776.6\n\u221212.9\nOpen in a separate window\ni=1\ni=2\ni=3\ni=4\ni=5\ni=6\ng\ni\n7.69E-1\n1.86E-1\n1.48E-2\n1.90E-2\n2.56E-3\n7.04E-3\n\u03c4\ni\n(sec)\n1.0E-6\n1.0E-5\n1.0E-4\n1.0E-3\n1.0E-2\n1.0E-1\nOpen in a separate window\nAbaqus, Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, France.\nBecause no consensus has been reached on how best to characterize the brain material properties and experimental observations conflict on the relative stiffness of grey and white matter,\n32\nwe have chosen to model the entire brain as a homogenous medium without incorporating the possible differences in grey and white matter material properties or material property anisotropy based on WM fibers (as opposed to the WM microstructural anisotropy for strain estimation, which is the focus of this study).

Model-estimated relative brain-skull trajectories at selected neutral density target (NDT) locations were compared with those measured.\nA correlation score (CS) based on Normalized Integral Square Error (NISE) was adopted to objectively assess the quality of model estimation.\n44\nThe technical details have previously been published to validate the THUMS (Total Human Model for Safety).\n45\nBriefly, the NISE method evaluates the error measurement (EM) between a pair of time history curves in terms of phase (N-phase), amplitude (N-amp) and shape (N-shape). A corresponding CS limited to 0\u2013100 was used to assess the level of their agreement\n45\nand was categorized into five classifications according to a biofidelity rating:\n46\nExcellent:\u200286\u2264CS\u2264100\nGood:\u200265\u2264CS<86\nFair:\u200244\u2264CS<65\nMarginal:\u200226\u2264CS<44\nUnacceptable:\u20020\u2264CS<26\nIn addition, model responses were also compared with those from Kleiven\n47\nin terms of correlation coefficient for the frontal (C383-T1) and occipital (C755-T2) head impact cases.\nTo assess the fidelity of DHIM in estimating brain strain responses in a live human (as opposed to displacement responses in cadavers), experimental data in a mild head rotational acceleration study were used for further validation.\n48\nA subject-specific head FE model corresponding to Subject 1 in Sabet and coworkers\n48\nwas generated via MRI-based image registration and warping (see below) to simulate brain responses using the corresponding acceleration profile as model input. Area fractions of radial-circumferential strain above representative strain thresholds were computed, and correlation scores characterizing the level of agreement in phase, amplitude, and shape were analogously reported along with their correlation coefficients.\n\nSubject-specific head FE models\nGeometrically subject-specific FE models were necessary to relate to the corresponding neuroimaging. Because all athletes had high-resolution MRI, we used \u201cmesh-matching\u201d to generate subject-specific head models for the remaining athletes by warping the baseline DHIM via image registrations.\n49\nFirst, an affine registration was performed between MRI\ntemp\nand each subject's own MRI (MRI\nsub\n), and the resulting transformation matrix was applied to the DHIM nodes. The affine registration accounts for translation, rotation, scaling, and shear between the two image volumes, and effectively compensates for differences in head position, orientation, and size.\nTo further improve the alignment, a B-spline nonrigid registration was used to provide additional deformation to apply to the transformed nodes. Because the resulting warped MRI\ntemp\nwill be spatially aligned with the MRI\nsub\ncounterpart, the corresponding warped model will match the geometries defined in the MRI\nsub\nand can serve as a subject-specific head model.\nThese transformations mapped MRI\ntemp\nto MRI\nsub\nin a subject's native MRI space. Because the head may be tilted during image acquisition, the image coordinates in MRI\nsub\nmay be misaligned with that defined by the head anatomy (e.g., the\ni\n-axis in MRI may not be aligned with the head left-right direction; see\nFig. 1\nfor illustrations), thereby precluding a direct application of head impact biomechanics (based on head anatomy) on the FE model. To rectify this, an additional rigid body registration was performed between MRI\nsub\nand MRI\ntemp\nto transform the subject-specific head model into the DHIM space and adjust for head position and orientation.\n\nComputation of the WM fiber strain\nAbaqus/Explicit (Version 6.12) was used to simulate brain responses during head impact. The skull, scalp, and face were simplified as rigid bodies in this study because they do not influence brain mechanical responses when on-field acceleration is directly applied to the skull.\n13\n,\n16\nThe typical run time for a 40\u2009msec impact was \u223c50\u2009min on a multicore Linux cluster using 8 CPUs (Intel Xeon X5560, 2.80\u2009GHz, 126 GB memory).\nThe\nand the strain tensor were extracted from the simulation results. To compute\n, fiber orientation at each WM voxel was first obtained based on the primary eigenvector using ExploreDTI.\n30\nThe analysis was limited to the WM region by applying a binary image mask.\nFigure 2\nillustrates a typical axial image with color-coded WM fiber orientations.

The fiber orientation vectors were rigidly transformed from the diffusion tensor imaging image space into the global Cartesian coordinate system defined by the head anatomy before analysis. Color image is available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\nFor each transformed voxel or sampling point originally in the DTI image space, a local coordinate system,\nxyz\n, was established with its origin identical to the transformed voxel location and the\nz\n-axis along the fiber orientation transformed from DTI image space into the coordinate system of the head FE model. The\nx\n- and\ny\n-axis were arbitrarily established, because they did not influence the strain component of interest. A spatial transformation from the global to the local coordinate systems,\nT,\nwas determined via singular value decomposition.\n50\nFor each sampling point, the strain tensor corresponding to its closest element (typical distance of 1.7\u00b10.6\u2009mm relative to element centroid) was transformed to compute\nin the local coordinate system after tensor transformation:\n51\nThe WM fiber strain or the stretch along the local\nz\n-axis was readily obtained:\n\nComparisons of\nand\nThe peak\nand peak\nat each sampling point were defined as their respective maximum values during the entire impact regardless of the time of occurrence.

    "Methods": "Injury model\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats (245\u2013285\u2009g, Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were studied in a constrained, non-penetrating brain injury model using the TBI 0310 (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, Fairfax, VA) as described previously.\n15\nAll animal studies were performed with prior approval from the University of Notre Dame Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nBlood collection\nAt 15, 30, and 60\u2009min post-injury, rats were anesthetized and whole blood collected from the vena cava into a syringe containing heparin (68\u2009U/4\u2009mL, Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Schamburg, IL) or sodium citrate (3.2%, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) using a 20-gauge needle. Non-injured rats were used as controls.\n\nPlatelet mapping by thromboelastography\nPlatelet responses to the agonists, ADP and arachidonic acid (AA), were determined using the TEG\n\u00ae\nThromboelastograph\n\u00ae\nHemostasis Analyzer System PlateletMapping\n\u00ae\nAssay (Haemonetics Corporation, Braintree, MA) as described previously.\n14\nEssentially, MA\nThrombin\n(maximum amplitude of the curve) was determined by adding a vial of kaolin (Haemonetics Corporation) to 1\u2009mL citrated blood, and the MA\nFibrin\nwas determined by adding 10\u2009\u03bcL of Activator-F (Haemonetics Corporation) to 360\u2009\u03bcL of heparinized blood. For the MA\nAnalyte\n(effectiveness of analyte toward stimulation of platelets), AA (1\u2009mM, final concentration, Haemonetics Corporation) or ADP (50\u2009mM, final concentration, Haemonetics Corporation) as well as 10\u2009\u03bcL of Activator-F were added to 360\u2009\u03bcL heparinized blood. The analyte-specific response (%) was calculated using the following equation: (MA\nAnalyte\n- MA\nFibrin)\n/(MA\nThrombin\n\u2013 MA\nFibrin\n)\u00d7100.\n\nImmunohistochemistry for P-selectin, TF, and fibrin(ogen) expression\nAt 0, 15, and 30\u2009min post-injury and after blood collection, the rats were then perfused with saline followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were then removed and 2\u2009mm coronal sections (A\u2013J) were sliced using a bread-loaf matrix.\nSections were embedded in paraffin, and sections B, C, and D were further sectioned into 4\u2009\u03bcm sections. Antigen-retrieval for all the IHC stains was accomplished by heat-induced epitope retrieval in citrate buffer, pH 6.0 (Life Technologies, Inc., Carlsbad, CA), and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked using Peroxoblock (Life Technologies). For P-selectin immunostaining, the primary antibody was goat-anti-mouse CD 62P polyclonal antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and the secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated donkey-anti-goat IgG polyclonal antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, CA). For TF immunostains, the primary antibody was rabbit-anti-human TF monoclonal antibody (ABCAM, Cambridge, MA), and the secondary antibody was HRP-conjugated donkey-anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories).\nFor fibrin(ogen) immunostains, the primary antibody was goat-anti-mouse fibrin(ogen) polyclonal antibody (Nordic MUbio, Susteren, The Netherlands), and the secondary antibody was HRP-conjugated donkey-anti-goat IgG polyclonal antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Blocking against host secondary antibody for P-selectin and fibrin(ogen) immunostains was by Serum Free Protein Block (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) and for the TF immunostain, normal donkey serum (Dako). The chromogenic substrate for all the immunostains was Nova Red (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).\n\nQuantitation of IHC stains\nTo quantitate the extent of expression of P-selectin, TF, or fibrin(ogen) in various regions of the brain, sections from the 2\u2009mm sections B, C, and D were microscopically evaluated for positive IHC staining (P-selectin, TF, and fibrin[ogen]). The time points consisted of 15\u2009min, 30\u2009min, and 1\u2009h post-injury, and control samples (noninjured).\nThe positive (+) and negative (-) stained slides were identified and categorized according to six different regions of the brain. They included the superior aspect of the impact site (re: superior sagittal sinus, pia, layer 1, and layer 2/3 of the secondary motor cortex); the inferior aspect (ventral edge of hypothalamus); the subarachnoid spaces; the third, fourth ventricles, and subfornical organ; the lateral ventricles (re: ependyma and choroid plexus); and the deep cortical layers of supplemental somatosensory cortex and caudate putamen.\nA score of 1 for each region was given for (+) staining (maximum=6). The individual staining results were quantified according to the average of the sum of all (+) regions per rat for the given time point. Three sections/rat were analyzed and the number of rats/time point was 10 for controls, 9 for 15\u2009min injury, 10 for 30\u2009min injury, and 12 for 1\u2009h injury.\nSome sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for morphological assessment of the tissue.\n\nStatistical analysis\nInjured rats were compared with noninjured control rats using unpaired\nt\ntesting (GraphPad Prism, GraphPad software 5.0a, San Diego, CA).

    "Methods": "HUCB collection and separation of CD45\n+\ncells\nHUCB was collected according to a protocol approved by Sheba Medical Center and Israel's Ministry of Health after obtaining informed consent of the mothers. Placental blood was stored in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid\u2013containing bags immediately after delivery and was used within 24\u2009h. The blood sample volume was in the range of 70\u2013120\u2009mL, with a median volume of 75\u2009mL. HUCB-derived MNCs were separated twice on a sterile Ficoll-Hypaque gradient (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) to increase their purity. Isolated cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and the cells were counted by hemocytometer. CD45\n+\ncell separation was achieved via immunomagnetic sorting using mouse monoclonal anti-human-CD45 antibody and MACS CD45 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The purity of the separated cells was verified by flow cytometry analysis using anti-human-CD45 antibody (murine immunoglobulin G [IgG]1 anti-human-CD45-fluorescein isothiocyanate [FITC], IQproducts, Groningen, the Netherlands) as described below. After their separation, HUCB-derived MNCs, CD45\n+\ncells, or non-hematopoietic CD45-negative (CD45\n-\n) cells were evaluated for cell viability using Trypan Blue exclusion and used immediately for administration. Cell concentration was adjusted in PBS to 1000, 10,000 or 100,000 cells/\u03bcL for intracerebroventricular (ICV) transplantation or 10,000 cells/\u03bcL for IV administration. Unless otherwise stated, the dose of cells for ICV transplantation was 1\u00d710\n5\ncells and for IV administration was 1\u00d710\n6\ncells.\n\nFluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)\nAfter magnetic separation, HUCB-derived MNCs, CD45\n+\nor CD45\n-\ncells (1\u00d710\n6\n) were washed in FACS buffer (3% fetal bovine serum and 0.01% sodium azide in PBS) and incubated with one of the following fluorophore-conjugated mouse anti-human antibodies: CD4-APC, CD11b-FITC, CD20-PE-Cy5, CD90-PerCP-eFlour 710, CD105-APC, CD184-PE (all from eBioscience, San Diego, CA), CD34-PE, CD45-FITC (all from IQproducts), CD73-PE (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN) and CD133-PE (Miltenyi Biotec). Isotype-matched immunoglobulins were used as negative controls. All the steps involving fluorescence were carried-out in a dark room. Ten thousand events were acquired with a BD LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences Immunocytometry Systems, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and plots were generated using the FCS express 4 plus analysis software (De Novo Software, Los Angeles, CA).\n27\nEach FACS experiment was repeated independently five times.\n\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM)\nHUCB-derived cells were cultured on plastic 8-well chamber slides (Nunc, Rochester, NY) and fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, for 2\u2009h. Samples were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated, sputter-coated with gold, and examined in a Philips 505 SEM (30\u2009kV).\n28\n\nClosed head injury model\nThe study was conducted according to a protocol approved by the Hebrew University Faculty of Medicine Animal Care and Ethic Committee, in compliance with National Institutes of Health guidelines. Adult Sabra male mice weighing 40\u2009g were used for these experiments and transplanted with HUCB-derived cells or treated with vehicle (PBS). Five sham-operated mice served as controls. Food and water were provided\nad libitum\n. Experimental CHI was induced by using a weight-drop device method developed\n4\nand modified\n5\nin our laboratory. This is a convenient model, which provides fronto-parietal cortical injury. Briefly, surgical anesthesia was induced and maintained with 4% isoflurane gas (Terrell\u2122, Piramal Critical Care, Bethlehem, PA) O\n2\nflow rate 1.5 L/min for 8\u2009min, administered through a nose mask. Respiration rate and depth, as well as palpebral and pedal withdrawal reflexes, monitored depth of anesthesia. A midline longitudinal incision was performed, the skin was retracted, and the skull was exposed. The left anterior frontal area was identified and a tipped Teflon cone was placed 1\u2009mm lateral to the midline. The head was fixed and a 95\u2009g weight was dropped on the cone from 18\u2009cm height. After trauma, the animals received supporting oxygenation with 95% O\n2\nfor no longer than 2\u2009min. After recovery from anesthesia, the mice were returned to their home cages with post-operative care and free access to food and water. Sham controls received anesthesia and skin incision only, but no head injury was induced.\n5\n\nHUCB-derived cells administration to CHI mice\nOne day and/or eight days post-trauma, the mice were anesthetized and administered HUCB-derived MNCs, CD45\n+\ncells, or CD45\n-\ncells, or treated with vehicle. Cells were either transplanted ICV (10\u2009\u03bcL) or administered intravenously (100\u2009\u03bcL) into the tail vein (\nn\n=7-14 mice per group). Each experiment was repeated three times. All surgeries and injuries were performed by the same investigator who was blinded to the treatment allocation following injury. The experimental paradigm illustrated in\nFigure 1\nshows the different post-trauma time points in which various tests were performed.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExperimental design. Mice were exposed to closed head injured or sham surgery on Day 0. Human umbilical cord blood-derived mononuclear cells (MNCs), CD45 positive (CD45\n+\n) or negative (CD45\n-\n) cells, or vehicle (phosphate buffered saline [PBS]) was transplanted intracerebroventricularly (ICV) or administered intravenously (IV) in the tail vein one and/or eight days post-trauma. Neurobehavioral tests, cell homing, anatomical damage, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) experiments were performed at the time points indicated.\nNeutralization of CD45\n+\nantigen from HUCB-derived MNCs was performed as previously described using anti-human-CD45 antibody (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), which blocks human CD45 specifically and does not cross-react with mouse CD45.\n29\nBriefly, cells were neutralized using 0.5\u2009\u03bcg anti-human-CD45 antibody/10\n6\ncells or anti-human-IgG-control antibody/10\n6\ncells (Dako) by incubation for 1\u2009h at 37\u00b0C before their administration into CHI mice.\n\nNeurobehavioral evaluation and determination of the neurological score\nMice were weighed and examined with a standardized neurologic severity score (NSS) up to 35 days post-trauma. During the first week, testing was performed on Days 1, 2, 3 and 7, and then once a week until the end of the experiment. Ten different tasks were used to evaluate motor ability, balance, and alertness of the tested mice and score points were given for failure to perform a task, as previously described.\n30\nLoco-motor/balance activity of the CHI mice was estimated by measuring their walking ability on a 1-, 2-, and 3-cm wide beam.\n30\nThe improvement in this measure is represented by the percentage of mice in the experimental group that successfully completed the task of walking the full length of the beam. The pathologic scores correlate well with clinical disability scores and with the degree of brain edema.\n5\nThe first NSS was obtained at 1\u2009h post-trauma and reflects the initial severity of injury. NSS at 1\u2009h is predictive of both morbidity and mortality and also correlates well with the extent of damage seen by MRI.\n31\nWhile most of the mice (86%) were moderately injured, with a NSS of 6\u20137, we included in the study all mice in the NSS range of 6\u20139 at 1\u2009h post-trauma, reflecting the heterogeneity in the initial severity of injury. After determination of the initial NSS, mice were randomly separated into the different treatment groups, while keeping similar mean values of the NSS between the groups. The extent of recovery is calculated as the difference between the NSS at 1\u2009h and at any subsequent time point (\u0394NSS).\n30\n\nMeasurements of HUCB-derived cells homing to the brain using near infrared (NIR) scanning and CD45 immunohistochemistry\nNIR scanning\nTo trace the administered cells homing to the brain lesioned area, we employed a technology using epidermal growth factor (EGF) labeled with NIR dye,\n32\nsince HUCB-derived MNCs were previously shown to respond to EGF.\n33\nBriefly, 0.5-2\u00d710\n6\nHUCB-derived MNCs were treated for 30\u2009min at 37\n\u00b0\nC with 7\u2009nM of the tagged EGF-IRDye800CW (NIR-TAG; LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). The cells were then washed three times with PBS and 150,000 cells/well were plated in 12-well tissue culture plates (Nunc). Cell-associated NIR intensity was estimated using Odyssey\n\u00ae\nInfrared Imager (LI-COR Biosciences) under the following conditions: resolution, 170-340 microns; pixel area, 0.03\u2009mm\n2\n; quality, medium-low; focus offset, 1-3; channels, 800\u2009nm; intensity, 1-3. NIR intensity in control groups was measured by treatment of HUCB-derived MNCs with 7\u2009nM of the untagged IRDye800CW (NIR-control) under the same conditions (providing information about nonspecific absorption of the NIR-dye to the cells) and by measuring the NIR-TAG binding to tissue culture plates (noise, background) in the absence of HUCB-derived MNCs. One day post-trauma mice were intravenously administered with HUCB-derived MNCs either NIR-TAG-labeled or left unlabeled (1\u00d710\n6\ncells/mouse), or treated with vehicle. Additional control groups included sham, non-injured mice either administered HUCB-derived MNCs NIR-TAG-labeled (1\u00d710\n6\ncells/mouse), or left untreated. All mice were anesthetized throughout the\nin vivo\nimaging procedures.\n33\nTo minimize the NIR background during the\nin vivo\nNIR imaging, the snout and head of the mice were shaved. Mice were placed in a supine position on the LI-COR Biosciences small-animal imager of the Odyssey\n\u00ae\nImager equipped with the MousePOD instrument, while constant temperature of 37\u00b0C was maintained in the chamber.\n32\nIn vivo\nNIR images were taken 1.5 and 5\u2009h as well as one, two, and seven days post-administration, using the conditions previously described. At each time point, five mice from each group were randomly sacrificed and whole brains were dissected. The brains were then placed in PBS in a 12-well plate (BD Falcon\u2122, BD Biosciences) and immediately scanned on the Odyssey Imager. The NIR intensity was estimated semi-quantitatively using Odyssey software.\nImmunohistochemistry\nImmunohistochemistry was performed using a floating section staining procedure. For the experiments in which cells homing to the brain were evaluated, brains were removed 2\u2009h after administration. Mice were transcardially perfused, under anesthesia, with instilled PBS followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After perfusion, the brains were quickly removed and immersed in the same fixative overnight, and then cryoprotected by immersion in 30% sucrose for 48\u2009h at 4\u00b0C. The brains were then frozen on dry ice and cut serially into 30\u2009\u03bc-thick coronal sections using a cryostat (Leica CM 1850, Leica Biosystems, Nussloch, Germany) and stored at \u221220\u00b0C in cryoprotectant (28% glycerol, 29% ethylene glycol in 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffer) until assayed. Briefly, the brain sections were washed three times for 10\u2009min each with PBST (0.1% Triton in PBS, pH 7.4), treated with blocking buffer (10% normal donkey serum in PBST) for 2\u2009h at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight. The following antibodies were used: FITC-conjugated mouse anti-human-CD45 (1:500; IQproducts), FITC-conjugated mouse anti-human-IgG control (1:500; IQproducts) and mouse anti-human-nuclei monoclonal antibody (1:100; Millipore), which stains nuclei of all human cell types and does not react with nuclei from mouse or rat.\n34\nDonkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor\n\u00ae\n555 (1:400) was purchased from Invitrogen, Eugene, OR. Antibodies were diluted in 2% normal donkey serum dissolved in PBST. The next day, brain sections were washed with PBST three times for 10\u2009min each, and thereafter incubated with the corresponding secondary antibody. Finally, free-floating brain sections were carefully mounted on slides, air dried and covered with mounting medium containing 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). All the steps involving fluorescence were carried out in a dark room. Immunostained slices were examined in a fluorescent microscope (Nikon 50i) at magnifications of 100\u00d7or 200\u00d7. Photographs of different random fields around the trauma were taken and analyzed for CD45 intensity levels (mean gray level) using the image J software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Representative fields are displayed.\n\nMeasurements of brain lesion area and volume\nNIR approach\nTo evaluate the size of the brain lesion area, mice heads were scanned at 800\u2009nm with Odyssey Imager, as previously described, 1.5 and 5\u2009h as well as two and seven days post-administration. The images were transferred to SigmaScan software, the boundary of the lesioned area was marked and the lesion areas in identical regions of interest were calculated in mm\n2\n. These conditions enabled evaluation of hemorrhage on the injury area by measuring the endogenous NIR fluorescence of intracranial hematoma.\n35\nHistological approach\nTwenty one days post-trauma, mice were deeply anesthetized and perfusion fixed with instilled 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The mice were decapitated and brains were quickly removed and frozen on powdered dry ice. Frozen brains were serially sectioned to slices (\nn\n=23-31 per group) of 10-\u03bcm thickness using a cryostat (Leica CM 1850, Leica Biosystems). Thereafter, the slices were stained with Giemsa stain-modified solution (1:1 in double distilled water; Fluka, Sigma-Aldrich Corporate, St. Louis, MO) and digitally photographed. The volume of injured tissue was measured with Image J software (National Institutes of Health). Damaged tissue volume was calculated by dividing the volume of the injured/ipsilateral hemisphere (Left) by that of the non-lesioned/contralateral hemisphere (Right). The results are expressed as a percentage of hemispheric tissue. Calculations were performed according to the following formula:\n\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) measurements of neurotrophins\nOn Days 3 and 35 post-trauma, ipsilateral and contralateral cortical and hippocampal tissues (including the tissue above the rhinal fissure)\n36\nwere dissected separately, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at\n-\n80\u00b0C until analysis (\nn\n=3-4 each group per time point), each experiment was repeated three times. Frozen samples were thawed and homogenized at a speed of 30,000\u2009rpm (Polytron PT-MR2100 homogenizer, Kinematica AG, Lucerne, Switzerland) at room temperature for 5\u2009min in cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) together with a cocktail of proteases and phosphatases inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich). Homogenates were kept on ice for 30\u2009min and centrifuged at 14,000\u2009g for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. Lysates were transferred to a new tubes and protein concentration was determined using the Lowry method (Protein Assay; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until assayed. Samples were analyzed for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (\u03b2-NGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A, both the 165 and 121 isoforms) using a human BDNF ELISA Kit (Boster Biological Technology, Fremont, CA), human \u03b2-NGF ELISA Development Kit and VEGF ELISA Development Kit (both from PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ). The amount of neurotrophins in pg/mg wet tissue was calculated from a standard curve of recombinant BDNF, \u03b2-NGF and VEGF (with sensitivity of 31.2\u2009pg/mL, 16\u2009pg/mL and 63\u2009pg/mL, respectively) and normalized to protein concentrations. Preparation of plates, solutions and ELISA protocols was performed according to the manufacturers' instructions.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using a commercial statistics package (IBM SPSS Statistics Software, SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL). Data are presented as mean\u00b1standard error of the mean. NSS and \u0394NSS values in the neurobehavioral evaluations were compared using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance followed by the Mann-Whitney test between the selected groups. Data for brain hemorrhage measurements, lesion volume analysis, NIR intensity, CD45 intensity, and neurotrophin profiles were evaluated by the Student's t-test. A\np\nvalue of 0.05 or less was considered significant for all comparisons."

All experiments were performed in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the Nagoya University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The mice were provided free access to water and food.\nAfter anesthesia was induced with 1.5% halothane in an oxygen/nitrous oxide gas mixture, we performed a laminectomy at vertebral level T9\u2013T10. The dura was opened, and the dorsal half of the spinal cord was transected to a 1-mm depth using a pair of extra-fine microscissors. The muscle layers and skin were then closed with suture. After the surgery, the mice recovered for 1\u2009h on a warming blanket.\n\nAdministration of drug\nJust before surgery, the mice were randomly divided into two groups that were injected (intraperitoneally) with either phosphate buffered saline (PBS, group A) or INI-0602 (100\u2009mg/kg, group B). After surgery, administrations were continued with 100\u2009mg/kg of INI-0602 (group B) or an equal volume of PBS (group A) every other day for 4 weeks until day 28 (\nFig. 1\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nDiagram of the experimental protocol. Time schedules of each procedure are shown including INI-0602 administration, spinal cord transection, behavioral testing (Basso mouse scale, inclined plane test), electrophysiology, and the day of euthanasia.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nTen mice were deeply anesthetized with a barbiturate overdose and intracardially perfused with PBS, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffer. The lesioned spinal cord was removed and postfixed overnight in the same fixative. The fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin, and 3-\u03bcm sections were prepared for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain and immunohistochemistry.\nImmunohistochemical staining was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, sections were pre-blocked with the blocking reagent (REAL Peroxidase-Blocking Solution, DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark), and antigen retrieval was performed. After the sections reacted with rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; DAKO), anti-neurofilament (NF; Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan), and anti-CD68 antibodies (DAKO), we used diaminobenzidine to develop a subsequent polymer reagent (Chemomate Envision kit/HRP, DAKO). The corresponding tissue sections were then routinely stained for morphological evaluation using H&E stain.\nAccumulation data for these stains were determined automatically using Image J software (NIH). Image mean intensity and stain area were analyzed statistically, as described below. These data were obtained from four animals in each group.\n\nRNA extraction and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)\nPreviously frozen injured spinal cords were removed at the length of 1\u2009mm at 2 weeks after injury. Total RNA was isolated from these samples using an RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with DNase treatment. cDNA was prepared using SuperScript III RNase H-Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and 0.2\u2009ng random hexamer primer (6-mer, Fermentas). cDNA was pooled from three animals from each group treatment group (PBS or INI-0602).\nQuantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed on a Light Cycler 480 II real-time PCR system (Roche) using STAR oligo designed primers with THUNDERBIRD SYBR qPCR Mix (Toyobo, Japan) under the following thermocycling conditions: initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 1\u2009min followed by 45 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 10\u2009sec, 55\u00b0C for 10\u2009sec, and 72\u00b0C for 1\u2009min, melting at 95\u00b0C for 5\u2009sec and 55\u00b0C for 1\u2009min, and cooling at 50\u00b0C for 30\u2009sec. All samples were run in triplicate. The primer sequences are listed in\nTable 1\n. The resulting values were normalized to the endogenous control (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GAPDH]) that was consistent among all samples. Results were compared using the fits point method. GADPH was indicated as 1 standard value; other values were shown as the ratio.\nTable\n1.\nPrimer Sequences\nGAPDH\nF: CACGAACGAGTCCCTAGAGC\nR: TCACATCACCACGTCCTTGT\nTNF-\u03b1\nF: AGCCCCCAGTCTGTATCCTT\nR: CTCCCTTTGCAGAACTCAGG\nIL-1\nF: GCCCATCCTCTGTGACTCAT\nR: AGGCCACAGGTATTTTGTCG\nIL-6\nF: AGTTGCCTTCTTGGGACTGA\nR: TCCACGATTTCCCAGAGAAC\nBDNF\nF: GCGGCAGATAAAAAGACTGC\nR: CTTATGAATCGCCAGCCAAT\nOpen in a separate window\n\nBasso Mouse Scale (BMS) for locomotion\nWe measured hindlimb motor function recovery in 15 mice from each treatment group using the BMS for locomotion.\n19\nWe videotaped each animal's behavior for 5\u2009min, and two investigators scored (on a scale of 0\u20139) both hindlimbs at 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 14, 21, and 28 days after SCI. The scores for both hindlimbs were averaged, which provided a single value per animal at each time point.\n\nInclined plane test\nInclined plane test was performed to test each animal's ability to maintain its position on the incline at 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 14, 16, 22, and 28 days after injury. The mice were placed on a flat plane in the horizontal position, and the board was slowly inclined to the vertical position. The maximum inclination at which a mouse could maintain itself for 5\u2009sec was recorded. Three trials were performed for each testing session. In practice, the angle was either increased or decreased by 5-degree intervals.\n\nElectrophysiology\nTranscranial electrical motor nerve evoked-action potentials (MEPs) measured signal conduction in motor pathways at 2 and 4 weeks after SCI. When MEPs was recorded, the mice were anesthetized with 1.5% halothane and maintained in 1.0% halothane in oxygen. All recordings were performed using standard clinical electromyographical analysis with a 3000-Hz hi-cut filter and a 30-Hz low-cut filter (Nicolet, Endeavor, Madison, WI). Electrical stimulation (1.1\u2009Hz, 20 mA) was delivered over the cranium at an area 1\u2009mm lateral to bregma. Evoked responses were recorded from the contralateral femoral muscle.\nThe data measured on day 0 (before SCI) was indicated as 1 for standard value; other values were shown as the ratio each mouse. The data were obtained from five animals in each group.\n\nStatistics\nAverages for the two experimental groups are expressed as mean\u00b1standard error of the mean, which were compared statistically using the Student\nt\ntest. Statistical significance was determined at the\np\n<0.05 level."

    "Methods": "With institutional review board approval, we conducted a retrospective review of the medical records of children with AHT admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) of Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, PA) from January 2008 to May 2011. Inclusion criteria for this study were 1) age <5 years, 2) diagnosis of TBI (including mild, moderate, and severe), 3) medical diagnosis of child abuse by the Child Advocacy Center of the University of Pittsburgh, and 4) the availability of serial imaging studies during their hospital stay. Importantly, children who underwent operative procedures were included in the analysis. All children received standard care based on the judgment of the clinical team, which included trauma surgeons, pediatric intensivists, neurosurgeons, and other specialists, as needed. Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring was performed in children with a GCS score\u22648; a standardized monitoring and treatment protocol was utilized as previously described.25Of note, the final decision to place ICP monitors was made by the attending neurosurgical staff in charge of the child's care.\n\nMedical records were reviewed to determine a number of preinjury, injury, and hospital-based characteristics. Chart abstractions were performed by two of the authors (K.F. and M.R.) blinded to imaging results. If records were not available to assess a particular characteristic, it was assumed to be normal (i.e., if oxygen saturations during transport were not documented, it was recorded in this study as normal saturations). In the preinjury time period, demographics (age, sex, and race) and medical complications in the prehospital setting (documented hypoxia [saturations <94% for more than one reading or evidence of cyanosis], documented hypotension [systolic blood pressure (SBP) less than 5th percentile for age or evidence of decreased perfusion], and cardiac arrest [requirement for chest compressions to maintain cardiac output]) were collected. Based on the trauma survey, postresuscitation GCS score (using the modified GCS for infants, when appropriate) and pupil examination (stratified as bilaterally reactive, unilaterally nonreactive, or bilaterally nonreactive) performed by the neurosurgical personnel were collected. Other injury characteristics collected from records included presence of abdominal and retroperitoneal injuries (liver, splenic, gut, or renal injury or retroperitoneal hematoma), pulmonary insults (pneumothorax or pulmonary contusion), and orthopedic injuries (long bone and/or rib fractures). In-hospital data were also collected, including diagnosis of pneumonia, occurrence of one or more hypoxic events (as defined as bedside SpO2<94%, multiple consecutive readings), occurrence of cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension (defined as mean arterial pressure [MAP]<5th percentile for age), use of vasopressor therapy, administration of blood product transfusion, and highest blood glucose (mg/dL). Retinal hemorrhage was recorded as documented on a formal retinal exam performed by a pediatric ophthalmologist. These hospital-based factors were collected for the first 5 days of the patient's hospital stay.\n\nIn this series, children who underwent ICP monitoring received an external ventricular drain (EVD; Integra Neurosciences, San Diego, CA) and intraparenchymal microsensor ICP monitor (Codman). Daily maximum ICP (ICPmax) was recorded for the first 5 days of monitoring. Daily PILOT (Pediatric Intensity Level of Therapy) scores were calculated for the first 5 days in children who underwent ICP monitoring.26Whether or not the child received decompressive surgical intervention was noted.\n\nAll children were evaluated with a cranial 5-mm axial CT scan, obtained either at an outside, referring facility or immediately after resuscitation in the trauma bay at our institution. All postadmission imaging studies, including head CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), were included. Of note, all imaging studies were reviewed by a blinded observer (E.C.T.K.) and compared to radiology staff final reports.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistics were performed using commercially available software (SigmaPlot 11.0; Systat Software, Inc., Chicago, IL). Patients were stratified into two groups based on those who developed HH and those that did not, as determined by an author blinded to all other data regarding the patients (E.C.T.K.). Univariate analyses between groups were performed using Mann-Whitney's rank-sum and equal variance tests, as appropriate. For variables measured over time, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed. Statistical significance was defined as\np\nvalue less than 0.05, and all data are presented as mean\u00b1standard error of the mean (SEM), unless otherwise defined."

    "Methods": "AQP4\n\u2013/\u2013\nmice\nAll animal procedures were approved by the University of California, San Francisco committee on Animal Research. AQP4\n\u2013/\u2013\nmice were generated as previously described by Ma and colleagues.\n21\nThese mice lacked detectable AQP4 protein and phenotypically have normal growth, development, survival, and neuromuscular function. A total of 40 wild-type mice and 40 AQP4-deficient mice were subjected to initial seizure testing, with 20 wild-type and 20 AQP4-null in the sham group and 20 wild-type and 20 AQP4-null in the CCI group. In the minocycline seizure experiments, a total of 24 wild-type and 24 AQP4-deficient mice were used, with 12 wild-type and 12 AQP4-null mice in the saline-treated group and 12 wild-type and 12 AQP4-null mice in the minocycline-treated group.\n\nControlled cortical impact\nMice (12 weeks of age) were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane (Anaquest, Memphis, TN) in 70% N2O and 30% O2 using a Fluotec 3 vaporizer (Colonial Medical, Amherst, NH) and positioned in a stereotactic frame. Anesthesia was maintained using 2\u20133% isoflurane. A 5-mm craniotomy was made using a portable drill and trephine over the left parietotemporal cortex (the center of the coordinates of craniotomy relative to bregma: 1.5\u2009mm posterior, 2.5\u2009mm lateral), and the bone flap was removed. Mice were then subjected to CCI using a pneumatic cylinder with a 3-mm flat-tip impounder (E-CCI Model 6.3; Custom Design and Fabrication, New York, NY), velocity 6\u2009m/sec, set to depth of 1.2\u2009mm, and 100-ms impact duration. The bone flap was then replaced and secured with tissue sealant (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL). The scalp was sutured closed and mice returned to their cages to recover. Body temperature was monitored by a rectal probe and maintained with a heating pad throughout the procedure to a temperature of 38.0\u00b0C. There were two mortalities associated with CCI in the initial seizure cohort: one in the wild-type and another in the AQP4-null mice. Another mortality was present in a minocycline-treated wild-type mouse after CCI.\n\nAssessment of seizure susceptibility\nOne month after initial CCI, seizures were induced by PTZ (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). PTZ was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and delivered by intraperitoneal injection. PTZ was used at a concentration of 5\u2009mg/mL and a dose of 40\u2009mg/kg. For mice given PTZ, each mouse was placed in a cage and observed for 20\u2009min after administration, with video recording. An investigator blinded to genotype analyzed the videotapes to quantify the time course, latency,\n22\nand severity of seizures according to published scales.\n20\nSeizure severity scores were: 0\u2009=\u2009normal behavior; 1\u2009=\u2009immobility; 2\u2009=\u2009generalized spasm, tremble, or twitch; 3\u2009=\u2009tail extension; 4\u2009=\u2009forelimb clonus; 5\u2009=\u2009generalized clonic activity; 6\u2009=\u2009bouncing or running seizures; 7\u2009=\u2009full tonic extension; and 8\u2009=\u2009death. A pilot study showed that animals do not show increased seizure activity beyond 20\u2009min past PTZ induction. It was also shown that seizures do not evolve further after this 20-min period, and length of seizures was unrelated to experimental group. Therefore seizures were scored as the greatest seizure activity within the 20-min observation period.\n\nImmunostaining\nImmediately after assessment of seizure susceptibility, mice were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of Avertin (125\u2009mg/kg) and perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Mice were decapitated, and then the brain was dissected and post-fixed for 24\u2009h in paraformaldehyde at 20\u00b0C. Tissues were dehydrated with increasing concentrations of ethanol, treated with clearing agent, and embedded in paraffin. Some sections were deparaffinized and stained with cresyl violet (Nissl stain), using standard procedures. For immunofluorescence, epitope exposure was enhanced by incubation in citrate buffer (10\u2009mM of sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0; 30\u2009min, 95\u00b0C\u2013100\u00b0C). Sections were blocked with bovine serum albumin (3%), incubated with polyclonal anti-AQP4 antibody (1:200), monoclonal CD11b antibody (1:200), or polyclonal anti\u2013glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:200) for 4\u2009h at room temperature (Millipore, Billerica, MA), followed by Texas Red donkey/antirabbit (1:200) or biotinylated secondary antibody (1:200), and avidin horseradish peroxidase for GFAP and CD11b (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Immunolabeling was visualized brown using diaminobenzidine.\nLesion volume was assessed by digital images (8-bit jpeg format) taken of five consecutive Nissl-stained coronal sections through the injury site (200-\u03bcm separation). We used ImageJ (v. 1.33u; NIH, Bethesda, MD) to arbitrarily set pixels with intensities 175\u2013255 as white, and the remaining pixels (intensities 0\u2013174) blue, and calculated the percentage of white pixels in each image.\nA cell-counting procedure was performed with a 60\u2009\u00d7\u2009objective to quantify positive cells to each antibody tested. Sections with the highest positive cell density were taken, and an average of five different coronal sections was used for each mouse (7 mice for each treatment group, 28 mice total). Data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error. The experimenter performing the cell count was blinded to the genotype and treatment.\n\nScanning confocal laser microscopy\nImmunostained sections were mounted in Vectashield Fluorescent Mounting Media (Vector Laboratories) and imaged using a Nikon Eclipse FN1 Upright Microscope or Nikon Eclipse C1si Confocal Microscope with a 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009/0.75 Air-Plan Apo (DIC N2; Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY) objective at a resolution of 512\u2009\u00d7\u2009512 pixels to 1024\u2009\u00d7\u20091024 pixels. Nikon C1 acquisition software and NIS Elements software for three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions were used and sampled from a thickness of 50\u2009\u03bcm with a Z step of 1\u2009\u03bcm. Sections from each cohort (\nn\n=\u20096 in each) and condition were analyzed, and representative images are shown.\n\nMinocycline treatment\nMinocycline HCl (Sigma-Aldrich) was administered intraperitoneally 12\u2009h before TBI at a dose of 45\u2009mg/kg body weight. This dose was selected based on previous studies.\n23\n,\n24\nBeginning 30\u2009min after trauma, animals received minocycline injections every 12\u2009h, at a dose of 90\u2009mg/kg for the first 24\u2009h after trauma and then 45\u2009mg/kg thereafter until mice were euthanized. Control animals received equivalent saline volume.\n\nStatistical analysis\nA value of\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered significant. Error bars represent standard error of the mean. Genotype and treatment (CCI or minocycline) differences were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, followed by Tukey-Kramer's test of\npost hoc\ncomparisons."

    "Methods": "This is a retrospective, Institutional Review Board approved, chart review of patients referred to the EMU at Parkland Memorial Hospital/University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Texas, from January 1998 through June 2008 for definitive diagnosis of presumed epilepsy. During the admission, patients and their families were questioned about possible epilepsy risk factors, including perinatal injuries, febrile seizures, meningitis and/or encephalitis, family history of epilepsy, and TBI.\n\nOn admission, antiepileptic medications were suspended during the assessment period, and all patients had prolonged continuous video and scalp electroencephalography (EEG) recording. Scalp EEG data were collected using a BMSI 5000 system sampling at 400\u2009Hz (1998\u20132001) and a Stellate Harmonie system (2002\u20132008) sampling at 200\u2009Hz, both systems using the international 10\u201320 and modified combinatorial nomenclature system of electrode placement. Ictal events were identified by the patient, family, medical staff, or by computerized spike and seizure detection algorithms.\n\nPatients were included in this study if they had a documented history of moderate to severe TBI (defined as TBI associated with prolonged loss of consciousness or amnesia lasting \u226530\u2009min or prolonged hospitalization, skull fracture, intracerebral or intracranial hematoma, or traumatic encephalomalacia on neuroimaging studies obtained nonacutely during their epilepsy evaluation) preceding the onset of epilepsy that was proven during the EMU evaluation. Patients who had nondiagnostic evaluations or who had exclusive psychogenic nonepileptic seizures were excluded.\n\nAn MRI of the brain using a technique sensitive for detecting MTS was obtained. Sequences obtained included sagittal T1-weighted, axial gradient echo, and coronal T1-, T2-, and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images obtained at 3-mm slice thickness through the region of the hippocampus. MTS was defined by hippocampal atrophy, T2 hyperintensity, and/or FLAIR hyperintensity, all assessed by visual inspection by board-certified neuroradiologists who were blinded to patient risk factors. When the MRI of the brain was unavailable or contraindicated, a CT scan of the brain was used. A study was classified as nonlesional if the imaging study obtained during the epilepsy workup did not show any abnormalities.\n\nA subset of these patients had a more intensive pre-surgical evaluation that included neuropsychometric testing, Wada testing (intracarotid amobarbital), and/or intracranial/subdural EEG monitoring with or without functional mapping of the sensory, motor, and language areas. The intracranial electrode implantations were individualized to each patient depending on their suspected seizure focus. Subsequent surgical resection of the epileptogenic focus was performed if all of the pre-surgical workup was of adequate concordance in regard to seizure localization.\n\nAnteriomesial temporal lobectomy with hippocampectomy was performed in patients with mesial temporal lobe seizures or with an anterior temporal neocortical focus. Lesionectomies and tailored resections guided by results of intracranial electrode monitoring were performed in the remaining patients with lesional and nonlesional neocortical epilepsy. The surgical margins were defined in part by the intracranial EEG findings. Pathologic analysis of the resected tissue was performed using standard methods. Clinical assessment of surgical outcome was graded using the Engel classification (I, seizure-free; II, rare disabling seizures; III, worthwhile seizure reduction; and IV, no improvement) at least 1 year after operation.\n\nInformation regarding details of the TBI, the latency from injury to onset of epilepsy, the neuroimaging studies, the EEG and video recordings of seizures, and the post-surgical follow-up were collected and analyzed via retrospective chart review."

    "Methods": "FGF-2\nEscherichia coli\ncells producing recombinant mouse 18-kDa FGF-2, in which Cys78 and Cys96 had been replaced with Ser residues to improve stability, were a generous gift from Drs. Yoshitake Y. and Nishikawa K. of Kanazawa Medical University, Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan. Recombinant mouse FGF-2 was purified according to the method described previously.\n25\nHuman recombinant FGF-2 was a gift from Kaken-Pharmaceutical, Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan. Further, we used a recombinant mouse FGF-2 purchased from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). The biological activity of FGF-2 to induce the proliferation of fibroblasts cultured from injured spinal cord tissue was substantial (data not shown).\n\nSCI followed by administration of FGF-2\nThe animals were handled in accordance with the Guidelines of Experimental Animal Care issued by the Office of the Prime Minister of Japan. Female Wistar rats (7 weeks of age, weighing 120\u2013140\u2009g; SLC, Hamamatsu, Japan) were used in this study. The rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (40-mg/kg body weight), and the spinal cord was completely transected with microsurgical scissors after laminectomy at the level of the 10th thoracic vertebra. The distal stump was carefully lifted up to confirm complete transection. We also ensured that the distal stump and the proximal stump were in contact when the former was returned to its original position. After arrest of hemorrhage, 5\u2009\u03bcL of vehicle (phosphate\u2010buffered saline, PBS; vehicle-treated group), or FGF-2 dissolved in PBS (1\u2009\u03bcg/\u03bcL; FGF-2-treated group) was injected in multisite fashion into the cord tissue 1.5-mm rostral and 1.5-mm caudal from the epicenter of the lesion via a glass microcapillary tube (GD-1; Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) attached to a microinjector (PB-7; Narishige). After administration of FGF-2 or vehicle, the muscle and skin were sutured closed. The rats were then placed in standard cages and given free access to food and water. Manual bladder evacuation was performed twice a day until bladder function recovered.\n\nAssessment of locomotor function\nBBB locomotor scale\nHindlimb locomotor function was assessed by use of the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor scale in an open field, as described earlier.\n26\nEvaluation was performed 1 day after injury; it was subsequently done once a week by observers blinded to experimental treatment and was continued up to 6 weeks after injury.\nInclined plane test\nFunctional recovery of locomotion activity was also evaluated in terms of the ability of the treated rats to maintain their body position on an inclined board. The angle of incline was increased incrementally by 5 degrees. The maximum angle at which the animal could still maintain its position on the board for 10\u2009sec was recorded for each animal. This test was performed 1, 21, and 42 days after injury.\n\nRetrograde axonal tracing\nRats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital 6 weeks after cord injury, and laminectomy was performed at the level of the first lumbar vertebra. The animals were then given stereotaxic multisite injections of 5\u2009\u03bcL of 4% fluorogold (FG; Fluorochrome, Denver, CO) 5-mm caudal to the lesion site with a glass pipette attached to a microinjector. As the FG was expected to be retrogradely transported within axons into the nuclei from which regenerating axons originate, the rats were killed 3 days after injection and processed for tissue samples as described below. Observations were focused on the sensory motor cortex and the red nucleus. The fluorescence signal of the FG was histochemically monitored with a microscope (Axiovert S 100; Zeiss, Jena, Germany) or quantitatively evaluated with a fluorophotometer. For quantitative measurements, the cerebral sensory motor cortices were sonicated in PBS (5% w/v), and the homogenates were centrifuged at 3\u00d710\n4\ng\nfor 20\u2009min. The fluorescence intensity of the supernatant fluids was measured at 418\u2009nm with excitation at 331\u2009nm.\n\nTissue preparation for histological analysis\nThe animals were deeply anesthetized by an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of sodium pentobarbital, and then cardio-perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1-M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The spinal cord tissues including the lesion site were dissected out and post-fixed in the same fixative overnight at 4\u00b0C. The tissues were then soaked in cold PBS containing 20% sucrose for 15\u2009h, and frozen in embedding compound (Sakura Finetek, Tokyo, Japan). The frozen sections (20 or 25-\u03bcm thickness) were prepared with a cryostat (model CM 1800; Leica, Nussloch, Germany), placed on adhesive-coated slides (Matsunami, Osaka, Japan), and histologically analyzed under a light microscope (Axiovert S 100; Zeiss) after hematoxylin and eosin staining.\n\nImmunohistochemical analysis\nFor immunostaining, spinal cord sections were fixed with 4% PFA solution for 10\u2009min at 37\u00b0C and subsequently boiled in Antigen Unmasking Solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) by autoclaving for 15\u2009min at 121\u00b0C. The sections were then rinsed for 30\u2009min at 37\u00b0C in 0.1-M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.3% (v/v) Triton X 100. After washing with PBS, the sections were blocked for 30\u2009min at room temperature in PBS containing 2% Block Ace, and then reacted with the diluted primary antibodies for appropriate times at 4\u00b0C. After another wash with PBS, the sections were incubated with the appropriate fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies for 3\u2009h at room temperature. The following primary antibodies were used in this study: polyclonal rabbit anti-glial-fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:1000; Dakocytomation, Glostrup, Denmark); rabbit anti-fibronectin (1:1000; LSL, Tokyo, Japan); and monoclonal mouse anti-GAP-43 (1:1000; Millipore, Temecula, CA). These secondary antibodies were used: Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG), and Alexa 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The slides were washed with PBS and coverslipped with PermaFluor Aqueous Mounting Medium (Thermoshandon, Waltham, CA). The images were observed with a confocal laser microscope (LSM 510; Zeiss).\n\nCell labeling with 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (BrdU)\nFive groups of rats (\nn\n=3 per group) were used for a BrdU cell-labeling assay. For BrdU labeling, 50-\u03bcg/g body weight of BrdU (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in sterile PBS was injected IP into the rats. Immediately after that, the animals were sham-operated (sham group), received the vehicle injection without SCI (vehicle group), received FGF-2 injection without SCI (FGF-2 group), received vehicle injection with SCI (SCI/vehicle group), or received FGF-2 injection with SCI (SCI/FGF-2 group). The animals were cardio-perfused with 4% PFA 2 days after surgery. Subsequent procedures were performed as described in the previous sections. We prepared coronal sections 20-\u03bcm thick at the position 1-mm caudal to the injury site. For detection of the BrdU-labeled cells, the tissue sections were treated sequentially with 1-N HCl for 30\u2009min at 60\u00b0C, and 0.25% (w/v) trypsin for 30\u2009sec at 37\u00b0C in PBS to unmask the BrdU molecules. Then the sections were incubated with anti-BrdU mouse antibody (1:500; Sigma Aldrich), anti-BrdU sheep antibody (1:500; Abcam, Cambridge, U.K.), and/or the diluted primary antibodies for the various cell markers. The sections were subsequently reacted with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies. The following primary antibodies were used in this study: polyclonal rabbit anti-GFAP (1:1000; Dakocytomation), rabbit anti-fibronectin (1:1000; LSL), mouse anti-OX-42 (1:200; Serotec, Oxford, U.K.), monoclonal mouse anti-\u03b2III-tubulin (1:1000; Promega, Madison, WI), and polyclonal mouse anti-NG2 (1:500; Millipore). The secondary antibodies used were: Alexa 488- or Alexa 546-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and Alexa 546-conjugated goat anti-sheep IgG (all antibodies were from Invitrogen).\nWe counted a cell as being BrdU-positive when the cell showed BrdU staining with a diameter of more than 1\u2009\u03bcm in its nucleus. BrdU-positive cells were counted in seven arbitrarily selected areas 5.3\u00d710\n\u20132\nmm\n2\nwithin each section. The value was expressed as the fold increase of that over the sham-operated group. In the double-immunostained sections, the percentages of BrdU-positive cells co-expressing each cell marker of the total BrdU-positive cells were calculated.\n\nPrimary cultures\nFIFs\nThe animals were processed as described in the section above on animal surgery. Briefly, after transection of the spinal cord, FGF-2 was administered into the tissue around the injury site, and the rats were fed for 2 days. Then the spinal cord tissue including the lesion site was dissected out, and the meninges were carefully removed and discarded. The rostral and caudal stumps of the injury site were separately collected, and each was cut further into dorsal and ventral parts. These four pieces were explanted separately on 6-cm dishes coated with collagen (Cell Matrix Type IV; Nitta Gelatin, Osaka, Japan), with the central canal turned toward the dish surface, and cultured in 1\u2009mL of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with FGF-2 (10\u2009ng/mL) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone, South Logan, UT). After sufficient cell migration from the explants had occurred, the explants were briefly removed, and fresh medium was added. The cells vigorously grew, and showed a fibroblast-like morphology with expression of fibronectin. Therefore, we termed them FIFs. The FIFs were cultured from individual animals, and used separately for the following experiments.\nMeninges-derived fibronectin-positive cells (MDFs)\nThe animals were processed as described above for FIFs, except FGF-2 was not administered. Briefly, 2 days after SCI, the meninges were collected separately from the spinal cord, cut into fragments, and cultured on collagen-coated culture dishes in FGF-2-free DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The cells that had sufficiently migrated and grown were detached from the culture vessel by trypsin treatment, and cultured in medium containing both FGF-2 and FBS at least for another 3 days. These cells also grew vigorously and showed a fibroblast-like morphology with expression of fibronectin, as did the FIFs, and we termed them meninges-derived fibronectin-positive cells (MDFs). MDFs from individual animals were cultured, grown separately, and used for the experiments, as was the case for the FIFs.\nCortical neurons\nCortical neurons were cultured from the cerebral cortex of mouse embryos as described previously.\n27\nBriefly, the cerebral cortex was separated from the cerebrum of 17-day-old mouse embryos and incubated for 15\u2009min at 37\u00b0C in PBS containing 0.25% trypsin (Becton Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD) and 0.5% D glucose (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). The dissociated neurons were suspended and cultured in medium containing FBS (1%; HyClone), transferrin (5\u2009\u03bcg/mL; Sigma Aldrich), insulin (5\u2009\u03bcg/mL; Sigma Aldrich), progesterone (2\u2009pM, Sigma Aldrich), and bovine serum albumin (0.5%; Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan).\n\nInfluence of FIFs or MDFs on neurite outgrowth from cortical neurons\nFIFs or MDFs from three animals were grown separately to confluence on poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips (13-mm diameter; Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) and placed in 24 well plates. About 50,000 cortical neurons per well were seeded onto a monolayer of FIFs or MDFs and cultured for 2 days. Thereafter the cultures were stained for \u03b2III-tubulin antigen, a specific marker of neurons. One hundred neurons were randomly picked per well from each of the three cultures, and the percentage of the neurons with neurites longer than 150\u2009\u03bcm was calculated.\nNext, neurite outgrowth-promoting activity secreted into the medium by FIFs or MDFs was examined. FIFs or MDFs from each of three animals were grown to confluence, maintained for 2 days in the medium for neuronal cultures, and the conditioned media (CM) was collected. Cortical neurons (about 50,000) were seeded onto poly-L-lysine-coated 13-mm coverslips that had been placed in 24 well plates, and cultured for 2 days in the CM diluted two times with fresh medium. The cells were then fixed with 4% PFA solution, and the neurites were stained as described above. One hundred neurons were arbitrarily selected per well from each of the three cultures, and the percentage of neurons with neurites longer than 150\u2009\u03bcm was calculated.\n\nImmunostaining of cultured cells\nThe cultured cells were mildly fixed for 10\u2009min by adding the same amount of 4% PFA solution as culture medium, and post-fixed with the same fixative for 10\u2009min at room temperature. After having been washed with PBS, the cells on the coverslips were incubated for 15\u2009min at 37\u00b0C in 0.1-M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.3% (v/v) Triton X 100, to make the cell membranes permeable. After another wash with PBS, the cells were treated with 2% Block Ace for 30\u2009min at room temperature, and then reacted with diluted primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight. After the cells had been washed with PBS, they were incubated with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies or biotinylated secondary antibody for 3\u2009h at room temperature. For the avidin-biotin complex (ABC) method, the cells were incubated in avidin-biotin- antiperoxidase complex (Vector Laboratories), and the enzyme activity was visualized with diaminobenzidine (Dojin Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan), with H\n2\nO\n2\nas the substrate. The following primary antibodies were used for this analysis: rabbit anti-fibronectin (1:1000; LSL), monoclonal mouse anti-\u03b2III-tubulin (1:1000; Promega), mouse anti-NG2 (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and mouse anti-N-cadherin (1:500; BD Transduction Laboratories, Becton Dickinson and Company). The secondary antibodies used were: Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, and Alexa 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, (1:1000, both from Invitrogen), and biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (1:1000, Vector Laboratories).\n\nReverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)\nTotal RNA was isolated from confluent cultures of MDFs and FIFs using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All RNA samples were treated with DNase I to remove contaminating genomic DNA. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed as described previously\n28\nto assess mRNA levels of nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), neuregulin-1, N-cadherin, VE-cadherin, thrombomodulin, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1. \u03b2-Actin was used as internal control. Briefly, a 20-\u03bcL volume of PCR reaction contained 1\u2009\u03bcL of first-strand cDNA, 4\u2009\u03bcL of 5\u00d7Go Taq Flexi Buffer (Promega), 1.25\u2009U of Go Taq DNA polymerase (Promega), 2-mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.2\u2009mM of each of the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates, and 0.1\u2009\u03bcmol of each specific primer. The amplification was carried out with a thermal cycler at 94\u00b0C for 5\u2009min, followed by 24\u201338 cycles consisting of 94\u00b0C for 30-sec, 60\u201365\u00b0C for 1\u2009min, and 72\u00b0C for 45\u2009sec. The sequences of primers, annealing temperatures, and size of PCR products were: \u03b2-actin forward primer, 5\u2032-GCCGTC TTCCCCTCCATCGT-3\u2032, and reverse primer, 5\u2032-CCCGTC TCCGGAGTCCATCA-3\u2032, 63\u00b0C, 390\u2009bp; NGF forward primer, 5\u2032-GGGGATCCTCCACCCACCCAGTCTTCCAC-3\u2032, and reverse primer, 5\u2032-GGCAAGTCAGCCTCTTCTTGTAGCCT TCC-3\u2032, 60\u00b0C, 376\u2009bp; BDNF forward primer, 5\u2032-CCCAGGG CAGGTTCGAGAGG-3\u2032, and reverse primer, 5\u2032-CCCGCCA GACATGTCCACTG-3\u2032, 61\u00b0C, 350\u2009bp; GDNF forward primer, 5\u2032-GAGAGGAATCGGC-AGGCTGCAGCTG-3\u2032, and reverse primer, CAGATACATCCACATCGTTTAGCGG-3\u2032, 60\u00b0C, 337\u2009bp; neuregulin-1 forward primer, 5-CCCCTCCTGGGAC AAACTTTTCTG-3\u2032, and reverse primer, 5\u2032-GCATGCCA-GTGATGAACTCGTTTG-3\u2032, 63\u00b0C, 517\u2009bp; N-cadherin forward primer, 5\u2032-AGCCCCACA-CCCTGGGGATA-3\u2032, and reverse primer, 5\u2032-TTCGCAGCCTACGCCAAAGC-3\u2032, 63\u00b0C, 383\u2009bp; VE-cadherin forward primer, 5\u2032-GCAAGACCAGTG ACAGAGGCCAAT-3\u2032, and reverse primer, 5-GATGTTGGC GGTATTGTCGTGGTT-3\u2032, 63\u00b0C, 383\u2009bp; thrombomodulin forward primer, 5-TCGCGCAGAGCTGGAGTACAAGTG-3\u2032, and reverse primer, 5-AGGTTCGGGGAGGAGAATGAT GGA-3\u2032, 65\u00b0C, 580\u2009bp; and VEGFR-1 forward primer, 5\u2032-AAATCACTCGGGAGAGGGGCTTTT-3\u2032, and reverse primer, 5-CCAGGTCTGGCTCCAGCTTTTCTT-3\u2032, 63\u00b0C, 358\u2009bp. After amplification, an aliquot of the PCR products was subjected to 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The images of the bands were captured on FLA-5100 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). The optical density of each band was quantified by utilizing image-analysis software (ImageJ; National Institutes of Health). We carefully checked the reliability of the RT-PCR used in this study. That is, the quantification was performed within the range of linearity between the amount of RNA added and the obtained intensity of the band of a particular PCR product.\n\nCell transplantation\nFIFs from individual animals (\nn\n=9), or MDFs from individual animals (\nn\n=5), were grown to near confluence in 10-cm culture dishes and then labeled with the nuclear dye bis-benzimide (Hoechst 33342; Invitrogen), by adding 3-\u03bcL of a 10-mg/mL solution of the dye to 6\u2009mL of culture medium. In 2\u2009h, the Hoechst 33342 dye-labeled FIFs or MDFs were thoroughly washed with PBS, detached from the culture vessels by treatment with 0.1% trypsin, and centrifuged. The pellet was resuspended in DMEM containing 10% FBS at a density of 10\n6\ncells/10\u2009\u03bcL.\nThe spinal cord was completely transected as described above, and followed by FGF-2 administration. As indicated above, the distal stump was carefully lifted up to confirm complete transection, and we ensured that the distal and proximal stumps came into contact when the former stump was returned to its original position. Immediately after surgery, FIFs or MDFs were transplanted into the gap between the rostral and caudal spinal cord stumps. After transplantation, the muscles and skin were sutured, and the animals were placed in standard cages and given free access to food and water. No immunosuppressants were used in this study.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll numerical data are presented as group mean values with standard deviation. Statistically significant differences of various gene expressions in MDFs and FIFs were determined using the Student's\nt\ntest. Those in the experiments of retrograde axonal transport using FG, identification of the proliferating cells in the injured spinal cord using BrdU, and neuritegenesis by the cells, were evaluated with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's\npost hoc\ntest. Statistical analysis of locomotor function as assessed by the BBB scale or inclined plane test was performed by repeated-measures two-way ANOVA, followed by the Bonferroni post-test."

    "Methods": "Animals\nYoung adult male C57BL/6 mice (Taconic Biosciences, Germantown, NY; 10\u201312 weeks old) were housed on sawdust bedding in a specific pathogen-free facility (12\u2009h light/dark cycle). All animals had access to chow and water\nad libitum\n. Animal procedures were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\n\nControlled cortical impact (CCI)\nOur custom-designed CCI injury device consists of a microprocessor-controlled pneumatic impactor with a 3.5\u2009mm diameter tip as described previously.\n20\nBriefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane evaporated in a gas mixture containing 70% N\n2\nO and 30% O\n2\nand administered through a nose mask. Mice were placed on a heated pad, and core body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C. The head was mounted in a stereotaxic frame, a 10\u2009mm midline incision was made over the skull, and the skin and fascia were reflected. A 5\u2009mm craniotomy was made on the central aspect of the left parietal bone. The impounder tip of the injury device was then extended to its full stroke distance (44\u2009mm), positioned to the surface of the exposed dura, and reset to impact the cortical surface. Moderate-level CCI was induced using an impactor velocity of 6\u2009m/sec and deformation depth of 2\u2009mm. After injury, the incision was closed with interrupted 6-0 silk sutures, anesthesia was terminated, and the animal was placed into a heated cage to maintain normal core temperature for 45\u2009min post-injury.\nSham animals underwent the same procedure as CCI mice except for craniotomy and cortical impact. No differences were observed among sham groups at any time point (\nn\n=\u20094\u20135/group/time point; one-way analysis of variance [ANOVA] with\npost hoc\nadjustment using the Tukey test,\np\n>\u20090.05); therefore, pooled data from all sham groups are presented for each outcome measure.\n\nFlow cytometry\nBody weights were recorded immediately after mice were euthanized, and blood (200\u2009\u03bcL) was drawn by cardiac puncture with heparinized needles. After transcardial perfusion with 60\u2009mL of ice-cold sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS), the spleen and thymus were removed, weighed, and processed by mechanical disruption on a 70-\u03bcm filter screen. Bone marrow was harvested from the ipsilateral femur by flushing with Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) (Lonza Group, Basel, Switzerland) medium using hydrostatic pressure. Red blood cell lysis was achieved by successive 10-min incubations with Tris-ammonium chloride (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada).\nSplenocytes, thymocytes, and bone marrow leukocytes were washed subsequently and resuspended in a total of 5\u2009mL of RPMI from which 500\u2009\u03bcL was then transferred into FACS tubes. Leukocytes were washed and blocked with mouse Fc Block (eBioscience, San Diego, CA; clone 93) before staining with primary antibody-conjugated flourophores (CD45-eF450 (30-F11), CD11b-APCeF780 (M1/70), Ly6C-APC (HK1.4), Ly6G-PE (1A8), major histocompatibility complex (MHC)II- PerCP-eF710 (M5/114.15.2), CD3e-PE-Cy7 (145-2C11), CD4-FITC (GK1.5), CD8a-AF700 (53-6.7), CD44-APC (IM7), CD62L-APCeF780 (MEL-14), CD69-PE (H1.2F3), TNF-PE-Cy7 (MP6-XT22), and IL-1\u03b2-PerCP-eF710 (NJTEN3) purchased from eBioscience, whereas CD45-PerCP-Cy5.5 (30-F11), CD11b-PerCP-Cy5.5 (M/70), CD4-APC (GK1.5), and interferon (IFN)\u03b3-PerCP-Cy5.5 (XMG1.2) were purchased from Biolegend (San Diego, CA).\nFor live/dead cell discrimination, a fixable viability dye, Zombie Aqua\n\u2122\n(Biolegend), was dissolved in DMSO according to the manufacturer's instructions and added to cells in a final concentration of 1:200. Data were acquired on a LSRII using FACsDiva 6.0 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star, San Carlos, CA). A standardized gating strategy was used to identify T cell (CD45\n+\nCD11b\n-\nCD3e\n+\n), B cell (CD45\n+\nCD11b\n-\nCD3e\n-\nMHCII\n+\n), monocyte (CD45\n+\nCD11b\n+\nLy6C\n+\nLy6G\n-\n), and neutrophil (CD45\n+\nCD11b\n+\nLy6C\n+\nLy6G\n+\n) populations as shown (\nSupplementary Fig. 1\n; see online supplementary material at\nftp.liebertpub.com\n). Cell-specific fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls were used to determine the positivity of each antibody. Cell count estimations were performed using CountBright\n\u2122\nabsolute counting beads (40\u2009\u03bcL/test; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nFor intracellular cytokine staining, leukocytes were collected as described above, and 1\u2009\u03bcL of GolgiPlug containing brefeldin A (BD Biosciences) was added to 500\u2009\u03bcL complete RPMI. Cells were subsequently stimulated with PBS or Cell Stimulation Cocktail (eBioscience; 1:500) and incubated for 2\u20134\u2009h at 37\u00b0C (5% CO\n2\n). Afterward, cells were resuspended in Fc Block, stained for surface antigens, and washed in 100\u2009\u03bcL of fixation/permeabilization solution (BD Biosciences) for 20\u2009min. Cells were then washed twice in 500\u2009\u03bcL Permeabilization/Wash buffer (BD Biosciences) and resuspended in an intracellular antibody cocktail containing cytokine antibodies and fixed.\nFor detection of reactive oxygen species, leukocytes were incubated with dihydrorhodamine (DHR) 123 (5mM; 1:500 in RPMI; Ex/Em: 500/536), a cell-permeable fluorogenic probe (Life Technologies, Invitrogen). Cells were loaded for 20\u2009min at 37\u00b0C, washed three times with FACS buffer (without NaAz), and then stained for surface markers including viability stain. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/ionomycin (500X) was added after loading, and respiratory burst was measured after an additional 30\u2009min.\nPhagocytic activity of myeloid cells was performed as described\n21\nwith minor modification. Briefly, yellow-green fluorescent carboxylate-modified polystyrene latex beads (1\u2009\u03bcm mean diameter; Sigma) were added to freshly isolated cells in a final dilution of 1:100 (in RPMI). After 1\u2009h incubation at 37\u00b0C, the cells were washed three times, resuspended in FACS buffer, stained for surface markers, and fixed in paraformaldehyde. Stimulation-induced phagocytosis was assessed by the addition of PMA/ionomycin (1:500) 30\u2009min after incubation. Data presented in terms of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) reflect the relative level of phagocytic activity (i.e., number of beads ingested) within a given phagocyte (i.e., bead-positive cell) population.\n\nPreparation, culture, and treatments of bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs)\nThe BMDMs were isolated from the marrow of the femurs and tibias of age- and time-matched sham and chronically injured CCI mice (60 days post-injury;\nn\n=\u20095/group) as described previously.\n22\nBriefly, after euthanasia, the marrow was flushed out into a sterile Falcon tube in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, Gibco Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; 10%; Atlanta Biologicals, Flowery Branch, GA) and penicillin/streptomycin (1%; Gibco Invitrogen) to obtain a single cell suspension. The suspension was centrifuged (400\u2009\u00d7\ng\n, 5\u2009min), the supernatant was discarded, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 20\u2009mL of DMEM supplemented with Ladmac-conditioned media (20%). Cells were seeded in sterile cell culture flasks (T75\u2009cm\n2\nflasks) and were maintained in culture for a further 6 days, with media being replaced on day four.\nOn day six, cells were transferred to 24-well plates (0.4\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n6\ncells per well) and were cultured for a further two days (\nn\n=\u20093 replicates/animal/group). The BMDMs were incubated in the presence both of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10\u2009ng/mL; Sigma-Alrich, St. Louis, MO) and interleukin-4 (IL-4, 10\u2009ng/mL; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 24\u2009h, supernatants were collected for analysis of cytokines by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and cells were harvested for analysis of markers of macrophage activation by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western immunoblotting.\n\nWestern blotting\nProteins were extracted using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, equalized, and loaded onto 5\u201320% gradient gels for SDS PAGE (Bio-Rad; Hercules, CA). Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and blocked for 1\u2009h in 5% milk in 1x tris buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.05 % Tween-20 (TBS-T) at room temperature. The membrane was incubated in mouse antiarginase 1 (N-20) (1:1000; BD Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA) or mouse anti-\u03b2-Actin (1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 4\u00b0C, then washed three times in TBS-T, and incubated in appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 2\u2009h at room temperature. Membranes were washed three times in TBS-T, and proteins were visualized using SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Chemiluminescence was captured ChemiDoc\u2122 XRS+ System (Bio-Rad, Pleasanton, CA), and protein bands were quantified by densitometric analysis using BioRad Molecular Imaging Software. The data presented reflect the intensity of target protein band normalized based on the intensity of the endogenous control for each sample (expressed in arbitrary units).\n\nCytokine analysis\nConcentrations of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-10 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were measured in supernatant samples obtained from BMDMs by ELISA. Briefly, standards or samples (100\u2009\u03bcL) were added to antibody-coated 96-well plates and incubated for 2\u2009h at room temperature, plates were washed, and samples were incubated in detection antibody for 2\u2009h. Plates were washed and incubated in HRP-conjugated streptavidin for 20\u2009min at room temperature. Substrate solution (tetramethylbenzidine; Sigma-Aldrich) was added, incubation continued at room temperature in the dark for 30\u2009min, and the reaction was stopped using H2SO4 (1M). Absorbance measurements were read at 450\u2009nm using a Synergy HT Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Biotek, Winooski, VT). Cytokine concentrations were calculated relative to the appropriate standard curve and expressed as pg cytokine/mL.\n\nStatistical analyses\nData from individual experiments are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean. Multiple comparisons were assessed by one-way ANOVA analysis with the Dunnett test for multiple comparisons or two-way ANOVA analysis with Sidak or Tukey\npost hoc\ncorrection.\nEx vivo\nstudies were performed by an investigator blinded to surgical condition. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism Software v. 6.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA).\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Participants\nIn 2019, eight pediatric rehabilitation facilities throughout the United States began collaboration as the Pediatric Brain Injury Consortium.\n8\nEach site obtained local institutional review board (IRB) approval prior to sharing de-identified retrospective data with Blythedale Children's Hospital (data-coordinating center). Electronic medical record data for all consecutive patients admitted for a primary diagnosis of TBI to each of the eight centers over a 12-month period between June 2017 and July 2019 (exact dates varied between sites by IRB requirements) were included in the database (\nn\n=\u2009247). One site had 96 admissions whereas other sites ranged from having 11 to having 36 admissions. Admission criteria were uniform across sites including the ability to admit patients with disorders of consciousness as well as young adults 18\u201321 years of age. Age, gender, mechanism of injury, TTA, and rehabilitation length of stay (LOS) were collected for each subject.\n\nCT report collection\nText from non-contrast head CT scan reports was collected from all participating sites. Of 247 total subjects, those with penetrating injury (\nn\n=\u20097) and those with absent or inadequate description of a pre-operative day-of-injury scan were excluded (\nn\n=\u200953). This resulted in 189 subjects (77%) (Imaging Group). Of these, 79 had multiple scans that met criteria; only the report from the initial scan was used.\n\nRotterdam Score and CT variables\nA neuroradiologist (D.E.) evaluated the reports and determined the presence or absence of CT abnormalities using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Common Data Elements for TBI while blinded to injury severity markers and outcomes. A Rotterdam score (1\u20136; 6 is worst),\n22\nwhich assigns points for presence of cisternal compression, complete cisternal effacement, midline shift >5\u2009mm, tSAH, or IVH and absence of epidural hematoma (EDH), was derived for each report. Head CTs without any abnormalities tracked by the Rotterdam criteria were assigned scores of 2 (base score [1] + 1 point for absence of EDH). A score of 1 was assigned to those with EDH only without presence of other Rotterdam criteria findings. Additionally, the individual components of the Rotterdam criteria along with the presence of midline shift of 1\u20135\u2009mm, SDH, and contusion, which have demonstrated predictive significance of functional outcomes,\n17\n,\n18\nwere tracked.\n\nOutcome measures\nWeeFIM (Uniform Data System for Medical Rehabilitation, Buffalo, NY) raw scores were converted to Developmental Functional Quotients (DFQ),\n34\nreflecting percent of age-appropriate functioning. The five cognitive domains (comprehension, expression, social interaction, problem solving, memory), each scored from 1 (total assistance) to 7 (complete independence) \u2013 total raw score range of 5 (worst) to 35 (best) \u2013 were converted to a Cognitive DFQ. The 13 self-care and mobility domains (eating, grooming, bathing, dressing [upper and lower body], toileting, bladder management, bowel management, transfers [chair, toilet, tub], locomotion [walk/crawl], stairs) were totaled (range 13\u201391) and converted to a Motor DFQ, as previously done.\n26\n,\n27\nOnly subjects 6 months to 21 years of age had available DFQ data with which to perform regression analysis. Additionally, because of the retrospective data collection, there were two non-identical groups with significant overlap: 171 subjects with Cognitive DFQs and 161 subjects with Motor DFQs at discharge (\nTable S1\n).\n\nStatistical analysis\nDemographic, injury severity, and imaging variables were maintained in a local REDCap database.\n35\nDescriptive statistics were performed using median (interquartile range [IQR]) for continuous variables and frequency (%) for discrete variables. Differences in participant characteristics and outcomes between groups with any imaging findings (CT+ group) and without imaging findings (CT- group) were assessed by Mann\u2013Whitney\nU\ntest (continuous variables) or Fischer's exact tests (categorical variables). Univariate and multivariable regression models assessed the association among demographic, clinical, and imaging characteristics on both Cognitive and Motor DFQ. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) with an exchangeable correlation structure were used for regression modelling in order to account for clustering within each study site. Rotterdam score and the individual CT findings were modeled separately, as both variables capture the severity of injury. Individual imaging variables that showed significant association with outcomes (\np\n<\u20090.05) at the univariate level were included in multivariable models. Age, gender, mechanism of injury, length of acute hospital stay, and admission DFQ were included in multivariable analysis because of demonstrated predictive utility in prior literature.\n8\u201311\n,\n13\n,\n14\nAll analyses were performed with R Version 4.0.0 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria)."
