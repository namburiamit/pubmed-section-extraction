    "Methods": "Maintenance of NE-GFP-4C stem cells\nThe NE-GFP-4C clonal neuroectodermal stem cells (ATCC No. CRL-2926) were isolated from forebrain vesicles of nine-day\u2013old embryos of transgenic mice lacking the tumor suppressor gene p53, and they were made to produce eGFP as described previously.\n24\nThe NE-GFP-4C cells were maintained on Nunc\u2122 Petri dishes (Invitrogen, Austria) in High glucose Dulbecco Modified Essential Medium (H-DMEM, Sigma, Austria) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Gibco, ThermoFischer Scientific, Waltham, MA) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO\n2\n.\n\nSCI model\nAll together, 90 female Sprague-Dawley rats (Animal Research Laboratories, Himberg, Austria, 180\u2013220\u2009g body weight) were used. All of the operations were performed under deep ketamine-xylazine anesthesia (ketamine hydrochloride [Ketavet, 110\u2009mg/kg body weight]; xylazine [Rompun, 12\u2009mg/kg body weight]) and sterile precautions. Laminectomy was performed at the thoracic 11 (T11) vertebral level, the dura mater was exposed, and the spinal cord was contused using an Infinity Horizon impactor (IH-0400, PSI LLC, Glendale, CA), applying 150 kdyn force. All animals were allowed to survive two, three, or eight weeks after injury.\nThe experiments were performed with the approval of the Animal Protocol Review Board of City Government of Vienna regarding the care and use of animals for experimental procedures. All the procedures were performed according to the Helsinki Declaration on Animal Rights. Animals were given food and water\nad libitum.\n\nTransplantation of NE-GFP-4C stem cells and experimental groups\nImmediately or one week after injury, NE-GFP-4C cells were transplanted intravenously or intraspinally (depending on the experimental setup) using Hamilton pipettes. Intravenously 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n6\n(delivered in 250 microliter medium), intraspinally 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n5\nstem cells (delivered in 2 microliter) were injected into the tail vein or into the lesion cavity, respectively. In the case of intraspinal application, a one week delay of the transplantation was applied based on the study by P\u00e9ron and associates.\n27\nThis study has shown that such delay of the transplantation significantly enhances the survival and proliferation of the grafted cells.\n27\nIn a separate experimental group, stem cells were grafted intraspinally mixed with human fibrin clot matrix (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Westlake Village, CA, 500 IU/mL, human). Control animals received medium or fibrin intraspinally or medium intravenously one week or medium intravenously immediately after injury.\nThe following experimental groups (n\u2009=\u200910) were established in this study:\n1.\nFibrin-1w-isp: fibrin was injected intraspinally one week after injury (control).\n2.\nMedium-1w-isp: medium was injected intraspinally one week after injury (control).\n3.\nMedium-immed-iv: medium was injected intravenously immediately after injury (control).\n4.\nMedium-1w-iv: medium was injected intravenously one week after injury (control).\n5.\nNE4C-fibrin: stem cells in fibrin were transplanted intraspinally one week after injury.\n6.\nNE4C-immed-iv: stem cells were transplanted intravenously immediately after injury.\n7.\nNE4C-1w-iv: stem cells were transplanted intravenously one week after injury.\n8.\nNE4C-1w-isp: stem cells were transplanted intraspinally one week after injury.\nFurther, two groups (\nn\n=\u20095) were set up in separate experiments using function blocking antibodies; for details, see below.\n9.\nNE4C-isp-blocking: function blocking antibodies were used intraspinally after one week of injury.\n10.\nNE4C-isp-isospecific: isospecific antibodies were used intraspinally after one week of injury (control).\n\nRetrograde labeling\nEight weeks after surgery, five animals with long-term survival (groups 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8) were deeply anesthetized as described above. The L3 spinal segment was exposed, and a right hemisection was performed. Fast Blue (FB) crystals (Illing Plastics GmbH, Gross-Umfeld, Germany) were placed into the gap, and the wound was closed. Seven days after the application, the animals were reanesthetized and perfused transcardially. Sections taken from the brain and spinal cord were cut in a cryostat (Leica CM-1850, Leica GmbH, Germany) and mounted onto gelatinized slides. The number of FB-positive cells was determined using an epifluorescent microscope (BX-50, Olympus, Japan).\n\nAnterograde labeling\nIn the long-term survival groups (8 weeks survival, groups 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8,\nn\n=\u20095 animals in each group), the rats were anesthetized, and the left hind limb area of the motor cortex was micro-injected stereotaxically with 4\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009\u03bcL of biotinylated dextran-amine (BDA, MW 10000; Molecular Probes) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\n28\nOne week after the BDA administration, animals were reanesthetized and perfused transcardially. After cryosectioning, the BDA-labeled fibers were visualized by using the Tyramide Alexa protocol. For camera lucida drawings, three parasagittal sections were used and the camera lucida drawings were superimposed on each other.\n\nSacrifice of animals and maintenance of samples\nAfter various survival times (2, 3, or 8 weeks after injury), animals were anesthetized and perfused transcardially with saline containing heparin followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1\u2009mol/L phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The spinal cord, brainstem, and the brain of the animals were removed and placed into 4% buffered PFA for one day. The fixed tissues were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS containing 0.01% sodium-azide at 4\u00b0C until being embedded in Shandon Cryomatrix gel (ThermoFischer Scientific, United Kingdom). Parallel or serial transverse (25\u2009\u03bcm thick) and longitudinal (16\u2009\u03bcm thick) sections were cut and mounted onto gelatine-coated glass slides.\n\nImmuno- and lectin histochemistry\nNon-specific binding sites were blocked subsequently with 3% normal donkey, goat, or horse serum. Primary antibodies and lectin were used as follows: rat anti-M6 (mouse-specific neuron marker, DSHB, 1:400), rat anti-M2 (mouse-specific astrocyte marker, DSHB, 1:400), rat anti-MOG (mouse-specific oligodendrocyte marker, R&D Systems, 1:50, MAB2439), rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (Life Technologies, 1:400, 18-0063), chicken anti-beta(III)-tubulin (Merck-Millipore, 1:1000, ab9354), rabbit anti-beta(III)-tubulin (1:1000, Abcam, ab18207), rabbit anti-neurofilament 200kD (1:500, Abcam, ab8135), chicken anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Merck-Millipore, 1:1000, ab16901), mouse anti-CS-56 (1:200, SIGMA, C8035), rabbit anti-Eph-A4 (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-20721), goat anti-ephrin-B2 (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-19227), biotinylated GriffoniaSimplicifoliaisolectin B4 (1:200, Vector, B1205), rabbit anti-IL-1-alpha (1:200, Abbiotech, 250715), goat anti-IL-6 (1:200, R&D Systems, AF-406-NA), rat anti-IL-10 (1:200, BioLegend, 505011), rabbit anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (1:200, Abbiotech, 250844), goat anti-macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1-alpha (1:200, R&D Systems, AF-450-NA), rabbit anti-NT-4/5 (1:200, Abbiotech, 250792), rabbit anti-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (1:200, Abcam, ab72439), rabbit anti-glial cell derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) (1:200, Abcam, ab18956), rabbit anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-507), rabbit anti-platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-A (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-7958), rabbit anti-5-hydroxytryptamine (HT) (1:100, Abcam, ab10385) and goat anti-matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-6838).\nThe following secondary antibodies were used: biotinylated horse anti-goat immune globulin G (IgG) (H+L, BA9500), biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L, BA1000), biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG (H+L, BA2001), biotinylated goat anti-chicken IgG (H+L, BA9010) (1:200, all from VECTOR). The immune reaction was completed by using Alexa Fluor 546 donkey anti-goat (1:400, Thermo Fischer Scientific, A11056), Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:400, Thermo Fischer Scientific, A11010), Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-rat IgG (1:400, Thermo Fischer Scientific, A-21209), Streptavidin Alexa Fluor 546 Conjugate (1:400, Thermo Fischer Scientific, S-11225), Streptavidin Alexa Fluor 405 Conjugate (1:400, Thermo Fischer Scientific, S-32351), or the Alexa Fluor 546 TSA kit (1:800, Tyramide Signal Amplification; Thermo Fischer Scientific, T20933).\nFluorescent images were obtained by using an epifluorescent microscope (BX-50, Olympus, Japan) or a compact confocal microscope (FluoView\n\u00ae\nFV10i, Olympus, Japan).\n\nQuantitative assessment of anterograde and retrograde tracing\nFor quantifying anterograde labeled corticospinal axons, analysis was performed according to Hill and colleagues.\n28\nThe BDA-labeled corticospinal axons were examined in every fourth paramedian section (16\u2009\u03bcm thick) of the injured spinal cord. The labeled axons were visualized through the use of streptavidin Alexa Fluor 546 (1:400, Thermo Fischer Scientific, S-11225). A zero point was determined as the rostralmost part of the cavity. Fifteen lines, perpendicular to the rostrocaudal axis, were drawn 0.5\u2009mm apart from 2\u2009mm rostral to 5\u2009mm caudal from the zero point; axons that crossed these lines were counted at 40\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification.\nTo normalize the number of BDA labeled corticospinal axons in various groups, the total number of fibers was quantified 7\u2009mm rostral to the cranial end of the lesion cavity, and the percentage of total axons crossing the designated lines caudal to this point was determined.\nThe number of retrograde labeled neurons was determined according to Bunge.\n29\nSerial transverse sections (30\u2009\u03bcm thick) were taken from the T5, T2, C6, and C2 spinal segments, and every fifth or every tenth coronal section (30\u2009\u03bcm thick) was used from the brainstem or from the cerebral cortex, respectively. In the spinal cord serial sections, the FB-labeled neurons were mapped, and their location was compared with that of the labeled neurons in the neighboring sections. Thus, double counting of the same neuron was avoided.\n19\nIn the case of brainstem and cortex sections, the number of FB-labeled neurons was determined in each section, and the final numbers were multiplied by five or 10, respectively.\n\nQuantification of cavity length, cystic area, and tissue sparing\nEvery second transverse section from the T7\u2013L1 segments containing the lesion cavity was stained with cresyl violet. The border between the intact tissue and the lesion cavity composed of small cysts was defined. Cavity length was determined by using the following equation: cavity length (mm)\u2009=\u2009section thickness (\u03bcm)\u2009\u00d7\u2009number of sections.\nThe whole cystic cross sectional area (lesion cavity area) at the level of the epicenter was determined as follows: the number of pixels of the reference area (1\u2009mm\n2\n) and that of the cystic area was computed through the use of the NIH ImageJ analysis software (\nimagej.nih.gov/ij\n). The pixel number of the cystic area was divided by that of the reference area, and the result was expressed in mm\n2\n.\nThe percentage of spared white and gray matter was determined in a similar manner. Briefly, the number of pixels of the spared white and gray matter was measured at the epicenter (0) and 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, and 1.2\u2009mm rostrally and caudally from it. Identical spinal cord segments of intact animals were used as reference values. The amount of spared white and gray matter in the lesioned animals was given as percentage of intact spinal cord values.\n\nQuantification of 5-HT density\nFor quantifying serotonergic fibers, analysis was performed according to Karimi-Abdolrezaee and coworkers.\n30\nTo assess 5-HT immunoreactivity, photographs were taken from cross sections of L2 ventral horns. The relative density of 5-HT immunoreactivity was measured in the animals of the medium-1w-isp, NE4C-immed-iv, NE4C-1w-iv, and NE4C-1w-isp groups (\nn\n=\u20094 in each). To determine the final density, the background of unstained samples as reference intensity was subtracted from the intensity of immunoreactive samples. The density was then normalized to the uninjured value.\n\nQuantification of ephrin-B2, Eph-A4, GFAP, GSA-B4, and CS56 reactions two and three weeks after injury\nTo assess the density of ephrin-B2+, Eph-A4+, GFAP+, GSA-B\n4\n+, and CS-56+ reactivities in spinal cords of injured and treated animals (\nn\n=\u20094 in each group), two sagittal sections (150\u2009\u03bcm apart) containing the lesion cavity were analyzed for each marker. Microphotographs were taken, and the whole spinal cord section area including the cavity and a 2\u2009mm long extension of the tissue rostrally and caudally from the cavity ends was analyzed. After measuring the relative densities (ImageJ, National Institutes of Health), the values of transplanted spinal cords were divided by the relevant densities of the injured cords (control animals) and multiplied by 100. The background intensity of unstained samples was individually subtracted from the intensity of treated sections.\n\nQuantification of host-derived GDNF, IL-6, IL-10, and MIP-1 alpha\nTo quantify the density of immunoreactivity of the four secretome factors in spinal cords of medium-1w-isp and NE4C-1w-isp animals (\nn\n=\u20094 animals in each group), two sagittal sections (150\u2009\u03bcm apart) excluding the lesion or grafted area were analyzed for each marker. Using the Image J software, we measured the relative density of immunochemical fluorescence signal of four factors along a 2\u2009mm long extension of the tissue rostrally and caudally from the cavity ends or grafted area taking the total width of the cord. Then, the GDNF, IL-6, IL-10, and MIP-1 alpha intensities were divided by the outlined area to calculate the mean net intensity/unit area. We determined the level of background/autofluorescence by imaging unstained samples. This reference intensity was then subtracted from the average intensity to determine the net final density.\n\nFunction-blocking antibody experiments\nAnimals (\nn\n=\u20095 in each set of experiments) were anaesthetized deeply, and contusion injury was performed as described above. One week after the contusion injury, the animals were grafted as described above, and a miniosmotic pump (Alzet Osmotic Pumps, Cupertino, CA; type 1002, 100\u2009\u03bcL volume, actively pumping for 2 weeks) filled with a mixture of function-blocking antibodies against GDNF (AF-212-NA), IL-6 (AF-406-NA), MIP-1a (AF-450-NA) (4\u2009\u03bcg/mL working concentration, all from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and IL-10 (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, 505011) was placed subcutaneously in the dorsal region (group 9., NE4C-intraspin-blocking). All antibodies were specific to mouse epitopes only.\nA silicone tube (Degania Silicone Ltd, Kibbutz Degania, Israel, 0.3\u2009mm in internal diameter) extended from the minipump to the spinal cord, and its distal end was inserted into the dorsal part of the cord at the site of grafting into the contusion cavity. The tube was fixed to the surrounding musculature with 8-0 sutures (Ethilon) to avoid moving in or out of the spinal cord.\nControl animals received NE-GFP-4C stem cell grafts and pumps filled with identical volumes of antibody-specific IgG isotypes only including polyclonal goat IgG for the replacement of GDNF, IL-6, MIP-1-alpha antibodies, and monoclonal rat IgG2A for the replacement of IL-10 antibody (4\u2009\u03bcg/mL working concentration, all from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) (group 10,\nNE4C-intraspin-isospecific\n). Motor function was evaluated weekly for eight weeks by applying the Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) test.\n31\nAfter eight weeks survival time, rats were processed for histological analysis.\n\nAnalysis of locomotion pattern\u2014CatWalk\n\u00ae\ngait analysis\nTo determine and analyze the parameters of the movement pattern, the CatWalk automated quantitative gait analysis system\n32\n(Noldus Ltd, The Netherlands) was used (\nn\n=\u20098 each in groups 1\u20138, except group 5 where the analysis could not be performed). The following parameters were taken into account during the analysis: max area, print area, stride length, swing duration, and swing speed. We measured these parameters eight weeks after the injury. Animals had a two-week\u2013long training period before the contusion injury. Data were evaluated by the CatWalk software.\n32\n,\n33\n\nOpen field test\nIn the long-term survival groups (8 weeks), motor function was evaluated by the BBB test\n31\nthree days after the injury and then once a week for eight weeks. Two observers, unaware of experimental procedures, tested the animals (\nn\n=\u20098 in each group, except groups 9 and 10 where\nn\n=\u20094).\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe paired\nt\ntest or the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or the two-way ANOVA test followed by the Tukey all pairwise multiple comparison procedure were used to compare the data."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAdult male Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River, Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada, 225\u2013250\u2009g) were pair-housed in standard Plexiglas cages. Animals were housed on a 12-h light/dark cycle in a humidity and temperature-controlled room with lights off at 8 or 10\na.m\n. Food and water was available at all times. All studies were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines involving vertebrate animals in research and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at Western University (London, ON) and the University of Mississippi Medical Center (Jackson, MS).\n\nExperiment 1: Effect of SCI on galanin and GRP immunoreactivity in LSt cell bodies and axon terminals\nThe main objective of the first study was to determine the effect of chronic contusion injury on immunofluorescence for galanin and GRP in LSt soma and axon terminals.\nSpinal contusion injury surgeries\nAdult male rats were randomly divided into SCI (\nn\n=\u20099) and sham (\nn\n=\u200911) groups. Rats were deeply anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (83\u2009mg/kg and 13\u2009mg/kg respectively, 1\u2009mL/kg intraperitoneal injection), and backs of the rats were shaved and cleaned with betadine and ethyl alcohol (70%). A midline incision was made on the area overlying T6-7 and muscle and connective tissue surrounding the spinal column was dissected away using blunt dissection. All animals (SCI and sham) received a complete laminectomy of the sixth or seventh thoracic vertebra (T6-T7) and spinal columns were stabilized using forceps attached to the IH-400 base platform for contusion injuries. SCI (but not sham) animals received a contusion injury at the T6-T7 spinal levels of the spinal cord, using the IH-400 impactor (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, LLC, Lexington, KY). The impact rod was positioned 1.5 inches above the cord with the tip approximately 5\u2009mm above the cord, and a force of 200 Kdyn was applied to the dura of the exposed spinal cord with a dwell time of 0\u2009sec. Actual force delivered ranged from 199 to 214 Kdyn (mean: 205.56\u2009\u00b1\u20091.89 Kdyn). Spinal cord displacement values ranged from 582 to 1763\u2009\u03bcm (mean: 1319.86\u2009\u00b1\u2009180.32\u2009\u03bcm). Displacement from two animals did not register with the contusion apparatus and was recorded as zero; these values were not included in the average calculations for displacement. Velocity of the impact rod ranged from 117 to 153\u2009mm/sec (mean: 126.56\u2009\u00b1\u20093.52\u2009mm/sec). Sham animals received all treatments except the application of the contusion injury. Following surgery, the layers of muscle and skin were sutured separately, with absorbable sutures (Ethicon, Mokena, IL; Cat# J415) and wound clips (9\u2009mm; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL; Cat# 500345) respectively.\nTo alleviate pain and prevent bacterial infection, all animals (SCI and sham) received subcutaneous injections of the analgesic carprofen (5\u2009mg/mL/kg), and intramuscular injections of the antibiotic Baytril (5\u2009mg/mL/kg; Bayer Pharmaceuticals, Leverkusen, Germany; Cat# RXBAYTRIL), immediately prior to surgery and for 3 days thereafter. Bladder dysfunction occurred in all SCI animals and bladders were manually emptied by light compression twice per day until bladder function returned. Sham animals were handled, but bladders were not expressed.\nLocomotor testing\nAll SCI animals had noticeable paralysis of the hind limbs and locomotor activity was measured during the dark phase using an Open Field Apparatus (Med Associates Inc., St. Albans City, VT) surrounded by two 16\u2009\u00d7\u200916 photobeam arrays for detection of vertical and horizontal movement. Locomotor activity was measured during a 15-min period and presented as ambulatory distance in the horizontal plane (horizontal distance in cm) and time spent rearing (vertical time in seconds). Testing sessions were conducted at 3 and 4 weeks after contusion or sham injury for all animals. Both measures of locomotor activity were analyzed using a two-way repeated analysis of variance (factors: SCI and time following surgery) and Holm-Sidak\npost hoc\ntests using 95% confidence levels. Sham and SCI animals differed statistically in both ambulatory distance and vertical time during both tests (\nTable 1\n). Locomotor data was missing from one sham animal and was not included in the statistical comparison. Analysis of LSt axon connections was conducted on a subset of the animals (Sham:\nn\n=\u20095; SCI:\nn\n=\u20095). Contusion data for these animals were : Force ranged from 201 to 214 Kdyn (mean: 205.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.97 Kdyn); displacement values ranged from 1693 to 1763\u2009\u03bcm (mean: 1698.67\u2009\u00b1\u200935.62\u2009\u03bcm; displacement from two animals did not register with the contusion apparatus and was recorded as zero, and these values were not included in the average calculation); and velocity of the impact rod ranged from 122 to 124\u2009mm/sec (mean: 123.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.49\u2009mm/sec).\nTable 1.\nLocomotor Activity in Sham and SCI Male Rats\nHorizontal distance (cm)\nVertical time (sec)\nExp 1: all animals\nWeek 3\nSham (\nn\n=\u20099)\n1,575.4\u2009\u00b1\u200989.9\n150.2\u2009\u00b1\u200916.9\nSCI (\nn\n=\u200910)\n1,006.5\u2009\u00b1\u2009241.4\n65.7\u2009\u00b1\u200930.4\n*\nWeek 4\nSham (\nn\n=\u20099)\n1,557.9\u2009\u00b1\u2009163.1\n124.2\u2009\u00b1\u200917.7\nSCI (\nn\n=\u200910)\n1,056.1\u2009\u00b1\u2009245.4\n51.1\u2009\u00b1\u20099.2\n*\nExp 1: animals included in LSt axon terminal analysis\nWeek 3\nSham (\nn\n=\u20095)\n1623.1\u2009\u00b1\u2009149.9\n149.9\u2009\u00b1\u200918.3\nSCI (\nn\n=\u20095)\n660.3\u2009\u00b1\u2009157.6\n*\n15.3\u2009\u00b1\u20096.3\n*\nWeek 4\nSham (\nn\n=\u20095)\n1823.9\u2009\u00b1\u2009328.9\n146.1\u2009\u00b1\u200932.3\nSCI (\nn\n=\u20095)\n892.4\u2009\u00b1\u2009197.8\n*\n50.0\u2009\u00b1\u200914.1\n*\nExp 2: all animals\nWeek 3\nSham (\nn\n=\u200913)\n1532.8\u2009\u00b1\u2009143.3\n65.4\u2009\u00b1\u20096.68\nSCI (\nn\n=\u200922)\n1053.1\u2009\u00b1\u200969.1\n*\n40.5\u2009\u00b1\u20095.1\n*\nWeek 4\nSham (\nn\n=\u200913)\n1823.1\u2009\u00b1\u2009121.7\n\u2020\n89.39\u2009\u00b1\u200910.1\n\u2020\nSCI (\nn\n=\u200922)\n1084.4\u2009\u00b1\u200969.4\n*\n45.5\u2009\u00b1\u20095.6\n*\nExp 2: animals included in AR-Galanin analysis\nWeek 3\nSham (\nn\n=\u20095)\n1282.6\u2009\u00b1\u2009155.5\n85.0\u2009\u00b1\u200910.7\nSCI (\nn\n=\u200911)\n953.9\u2009\u00b1\u200963.1\n33.3\u2009\u00b1\u20094.8\n*\nWeek 4\nSham (\nn\n=\u20095)\n1552.1\u2009\u00b1\u2009181.1\n87.5\u2009\u00b1\u200914.2\nSCI (\nn\n=\u200911)\n975.3\u2009\u00b1\u200996.6\n*\n43.7\u2009\u00b1\u20098.0\n*\nOpen in a separate window\n*\nSignificant difference from Sham controls.\n\u2020\nSignificant difference from Week 3.\nLocomotor activity in Sham and SCI male rats shown as locomotor movement in the horizontal plane (horizontal distance in cm) and time spent rearing (vertical time in seconds), for each study and analysis at 3 and 4 weeks post-surgery (Week 3\u20134).

Data are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean.\nExp, experiment; SCI, spinal cord injury; LSt, lumbar spinothalamic.\nTissue collection\nFive to six weeks after contusion or sham surgery, animals were transcardially perfused and brains and spinal cords removed. This time-point was selected based on our previous demonstration of severe disruption of ejaculatory reflexes at 4\u20136 weeks after contusion injury.\n28\nIn these previous studies showing that SCI disrupted ejaculatory reflexes, all animals received an acute spinal transection 2 hours prior to measuring ejaculatory reflexes. Therefore, in order to examine expression of galanin and GRP under those same conditions, all animals in this experiment 1 also received an acute spinal transection under deep anesthesia using urethane (Sigma; Cat#U2500; 1.5\u2009mg/kg). Two hours after transection, animals received an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (390\u2009mg/mL/kg body weight; Fatal Plus; Vortech Pharmaceuticals, Dearborn, MI) and were perfused transcardially with 10\u2009mL 0.9% sodium chloride solution (saline; Fisher; Cat# BP-358-212) followed by 500\u2009mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA; Cat# 19210) in in 0.1\u2009M sodium phosphate buffer (PB). Spinal cords were removed and post-fixed for 1\u2009h in the same fixative and next stored in 20% sucrose (in 0.1M PB containing 0.01% sodium azide (Fisher; Cat# S227)). Lumbosacral spinal cords (containing spinal levels L1-S1) were sectioned coronally into 12 parallel series of 35\u2009\u03bcm sections using a sliding microtome (Micron; H400R; Germany) with a freezing stage (Physitemp, Clifton, New Jersey; BFS-5) and were stored in a cryopreservative solution containing 30% sucrose (Sigma; Cat# S7903), 30% ethylene glycol (Fisher; Cat#E178-1), and 0.01% sodium azide (Fisher; Cat# S227) in 0.1\u2009M PB).\nImmunofluorescence\nGeneral\nImmunostaining was performed using free-floating sections at room temperature and with gentle agitation on a horizontal shaking platform. For each analysis, sections from all animals from all groups were immunoprocessed simultaneously. Sections were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 0.1\u2009M PB with 0.9% sodium chloride) between all incubations. Prior to incubation with primary antibodies, sections were treated with 1% H\n2\n0\n2\n(Fisher; Cat# H323-500) for 10\u2009min and antibody incubation solution (PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Fisher; Cat# BP1605-100) and 0.4% Triton X-100 (Fisher; Cat# BP151-100). This antibody incubation solution was used for all primary and secondary antibody incubations. Following immunostaining, sections were mounted on SuperFrost Plus glass slides (Fisher; Cat# 22-037-246), cover-slipped with an aqueous mounting medium (Gelvatol) containing antifading agent 1,4-Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Sigma, Cat# D27802) and were stored at 4\u00b0C.\nGRP/galanin/NeuN\nOne series of sections for each animal was incubated with a polyclonal rabbit antibody specifically recognizing GRP (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA; RRID: AB_2722600, Cat# H-027-1; 1:20,000; 17\u2009h), with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA; Cat# BA-1000; 1:500; 1\u2009h), with ABC-elite (Vector; Cat# PK-6100; 1:1,000 in PBS; 1\u2009h), with tyramine sample amplification (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA; Cat# SAT700B001EA; 1:250 in PBS with 1\u2009uL of 3% H\n2\n0\n2\n/mL PBS; 10\u2009min), and with Dylight 488-conjugated streptavidin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; Cat# 21832; 1:200; 30\u2009min). Subsequently, sections were co-incubated with a polyclonal rabbit antibody specifically recognizing galanin (Peninsula Laboratories, San Carlos, CA; RRID: AB_518348, Cat# T4334; 1:3000) and a mouse monoclonal antibody against NeuN (Millipore Burlington, MA; RRID: AB_2298772, Cat# MAB377; 1:1,000; 17\u2009h), with Dylight 550 donkey anti-rabbit (Invitrogen; Cat# SA5-10039; 1:100; 30\u2009min) and subsequently with Dylight 650 goat anti-mouse (Invitrogen; Cat# SA5-10174; 1:100; 30\u2009min).\nChAT/synaptophysin/galanin or GRP\nOne series of sections for each animal was incubated with a polyclonal rabbit antibody specifically against galanin (Peninsula; RRID: AB_518348, Cat# T4334; 1:3000; 17\u2009h) or GRP (Phoenix; RRID: AB_2722600, Cat# H-027-13; 1:20,000; 17\u2009h) and with Cy3 donkey anti rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA; Cat# 711165152; 1:200; 30\u2009min). Tissue was subsequently incubated with a monoclonal mouse anti-ChAT (Millipore; RRID: AB_94647, Cat# MAB305; 1:800; 17\u2009h), biotinylated donkey anti-mouse (Jackson; Cat# 715-065-151; 1:500; 1\u2009h), ABC-elite (Vector; Cat# PK-6100; 1:1000 in PBS; 1\u2009h), tyramine sample amplification (1:250; Perkin Elmer; Cat# SAT700B001EA; in PBS with 1\u2009uL 3% H\n2\n0\n2\n/mL PBS), and Dylight 488-conjugated streptavidin (Invitrogen; Cat# 21832; 1:200; 30\u2009min). Tissue was treated with a monoclonal mouse anti-synaptophysin (Sigma; RRID: AB_477523, Cat# S5768; 1:200; 17\u2009h) and Cy5 donkey anti-mouse (Jackson; Cat# 715-175-151; 1:200; 30\u2009min).\nAntibody controls\nValidation of the antibody against GRP was accomplished with pre-absorption with GRP peptide (Phoenix; RRID: AB_2722600, Cat# H-027-13; 10\u2009\u03bcg/mL) which prevented all immunostaining. The galanin antibody has been validated previously.\n19\n,\n21\u201323\n,\n25\n,\n40\n,\n41\nChAT antibody (mouse anti-ChAT; Millipore; RRID: AB_94647, Cat# MAB305) was validated by conducting dual immunofluorescent staining with one of two other primary antibodies specifically recognizing ChAT: goat anti ChAT (Millipore; RRID: AB_11214092, Cat# AB144P; 1:100) or sheep anti ChAT (Invitrogen; Cat# OSC0042G, RRID: AB_10710007; 1:200). Complete co-labeling of ChAT-positive cell bodies and fibers in the lumbar spinal cord was observed with all three antibodies.\nAnalysis of galanin and GRP cell counts\nThe numbers of cells immunoreactive (-ir) for galanin, GRP, or both were counted using fluorescent microscope (Leica DM5000B) by two independent observers blinded to experimental treatments. For each animal, all sections were examined and numbers of immunoreactive (-ir) cells were counted per tissue section. NeuN staining was visualized when needed to confirm the location of galanin and GRP immunoreactivity within the cytoplasm. Total numbers of cells were calculated for each animal. There were no differences between groups in the numbers of analyzed sections containing galanin, GRP, or dual-labeled cells (Sham: 9.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091; SCI: 8.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8). However, in order to account for potential group differences due to individual differences in numbers of sections, the numbers of single and dual cells also were expressed as the number of cells per section (as in our previous papers).\n18\n,\n21\nStatistical comparisons between sham and SCI groups were conducted using Student's t-test with 95% confidence levels.\nAnalysis of galanin and GRP axon terminals\nTissue sections processed for triple immunofluorescence for ChAT, synaptophysin and galanin or GRP, as well as sections immunolabeled for galanin, GRP and NeuN were imaged using a Nikon D-Eclipse C1 laser-scanning confocal system (Nikon Corp, Minota, Tokyo, Japan) attached to a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope (Nikon Corp) and EZ-C1 Gold version 3.80 software (Nikon Corp). Fluorophores were detected by three lasers at wavelengths of 488, 543, and 633\u2009nm. Wavelengths were filtered by two dichroic mirrors filtering at 530 and 625\u2009nm. Confocal z-stacks of optical images (1\u2009\u03bcm optical sections taken at 60\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification at 1-2X zoom) were obtained through ChAT-ir cell soma in the sacral parasympathetic nucleus (SPN), intermediolateral (IML) nucleus, the central autonomic nucleus (CAN), and NeuN-labeled cells receiving galanin or GRP innervation in the central gray (CG) commissure of L6. Images were opened in ImageJ (NIH; 1.51W) and 10 or more cells (ChAT- or NeuN-ir) per area (IML, CAN, SPN, or CG) were analyzed for numbers of axon terminals in close apposition with the soma.\nFor each cell, optical sections in which the nucleus of the cell was visible were analyzed. For each optical section, the numbers of galanin or GRP positive terminals co-labeling synaptophysin or labeled for synaptophysin alone in close apposition to the soma were counted. A bouton was considered an axon terminal if immunoreactive for synaptophysin and counted as in close apposition if immunoreactive pixels were immediately adjacent to the soma membrane of the analyzed neuron. The perimeter of ChAT or NeuN cells was calculated for each optical section using imageJ and the numbers of galanin, GRP, or synaptophysin-only appositions were expressed per 100\u2009\u03bcm of analyzed membrane. Averages per cell were calculated over the optical sections and averages per animal were calculated over the 10 cells. Using the same methods, galanin and GRP single-or dual-labeled axon terminals in close apposition to NeuN cells in central gray were calculated in sections stained for galanin, GRP, and NeuN. For this analysis, synaptophysin was not included as an axon terminal marker, and instead NeuN was used to confirm if galanin and GRP were localized to axon terminals. Comparisons between sham and SCI groups were conducted using Student's t-test with a 95% confidence interval.\nAnalysis of galanin and GRP axon terminals based on cell sizes\nDuring the analysis described above, it was observed that galanin and GRP (LSt) contacts appeared to preferentially innervate large preganglionic neurons in the IML. Pearson product-movement correlation was conducted to test for statistically significant correlations between cell perimeter and the density of LSt contacts based on all ChAT-ir cells in sham and SCI groups and separately for IML, CAN, and SPN. Next, LSt innervation of ChAT-ir cells was again analyzed based on smaller and larger cells using soma perimeter smaller or greater than IML 60\u2009\u03bcm, CAN 50\u2009\u03bcm, and SPN 45\u03bcm). These sizes were chosen based on the overall distribution of cell sizes within these areas. Comparisons between sham and SCI groups within each area and cell size category were conducted using Student's t-test with a 95% confidence interval.\n\nExperiment 2: Effects of chronic spinal cord injury on testosterone levels and androgen receptor expression\nLSt cells express androgen receptors\n42\n,\n43\nand expression of galanin and GRP is regulated by testosterone in adult male rats.\n44\n,\n45\nTherefore, the goal of this experiment was to determine if changes in galanin and GRP immunoreactivity levels were associated with decreased testosterone levels and responsiveness following contusion injury.\nExperimental groups and contusion injury\nTestes and blood were collected from sham and SCI animals (Sham\u2009=\u200913, SCI\u2009=\u200922 [testes weights] or 18 [blood collection failed for four SCI animals]) and spinal cord tissue was obtained from a subset of these animals (Sham\u2009=\u20095, SCI\u2009=\u200910). Contusion or sham surgeries were performed as described above but without acute transection prior to perfusion. Animals used for this study received an actual force delivered of 200 to 236\u2009Kdyn (mean: 207\u2009\u00b1\u20091.63\u2009Kdyn). Spinal cord displacement values ranged from 864 to 1559\u2009\u03bcm (mean: 1054\u2009\u00b1\u200935.49\u2009\u03bcm). Velocity of the impact rod ranged from 117 to 122\u2009mm/sec (mean: 120\u2009\u00b1\u20090.29\u2009mm/sec). Blood collection was not performed on three of the SCI animals but means for the contusion injury values did not differ with this omission (mean: 207\u2009Kdyn: 1047\u2009\u03bcm; 120\u2009mm/sec). Similar were the values for the subset of SCI rats for spinal cord collections (mean: 205\u2009Kdyn; 1052\u2009\u03bcm; 120\u2009mm/sec).\nPerfusion and tissue collection\nLocomotor activity analysis was performed as described above (\nTable 1\n). Five weeks after contusion or sham surgery, during the early part of the dark phase (1\u20134\u2009h after dark onset), animals received an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (concentration), and testes were extracted and immediately weighed. Blood was drawn from the inferior vena cava using a heparinized syringe (10\u2009mL), kept on ice in heparin-coated eppendorf tubes (Fisher, Cat# 05-407-13C), centrifuged for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C; serum was pipetted away from the red blood cells and frozen at \u221220\u00b0C. A subset of the rats was perfused and spinal cords were sectioned as described for experiment 1.\nTestosterone radioimmunoassay\nBlood was analyzed for testosterone levels using a Testo-RIA-CT kit (DiaSource ImmunoAssay; S.A. Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium; Cat# KIR1709, Lot: 172004). All samples were processed in technical duplicates (conducted by the Analytical and Assay Core, University of Mississippi Medical Center). Four standards supplied in the Testo-RIA-CT kit were processed in technical duplicates. Three negative controls and two positive controls consisting of two standards were included throughout the run-in duplicate and values were as predicted by the kit (control 1: 60\u2009\u00b1\u200920\u2009ng/dL, control 2: 279\u2009\u00b1\u200972\u2009ng/dL). CV% was <10% in all samples.\nImmunohistochemistry androgen receptor and galanin\nAll procedures were performed as in experiment 1, except that chromogens were used for visualization and slides were cover-slipped with Di-N-Butyl Phthalate in Xylene (DPX; Electron Microcopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA; Cat# 13512). One series of sections of all animals was incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for androgen receptor (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX; RRID: AB_1563391, Cat# sc-816; 1:750;17\u2009h), biotinylated goat anti-rabbit (Vector; Cat# BA-1000; 1:500; 1\u2009h) ABC-elite (Vector; Cat# PK-6100; 1:1000 in PBS; 1\u2009h). Sections were next incubated were incubated in 0.1\u2009M PB containing 0.02% diaminobenzidine (DAB; Sigma Cat# D5905-100TAB), 2% nickel sulfate (Sigma; Cat# N4882-250G) and 0.012% H\n2\nO\n2\n(10\u2009min). Subsequently, sections were incubated with rabbit anti-galanin (Peninsula; RRID: AB_518348, Cat# T4334; 1:60,000; 17\u2009h), biotinylated goat anti-rabbit (Vector; Cat# BA-1000; 1:500; 1\u2009h), ABC-elite (Vector; Cat# PK-6100; 1:1,000; 1\u2009h), and finally in PB containing 0.02% DAB with 0.012% H\n2\nO\n2\n(10\u2009min).\n\nAnalyses\nTestes weights\nRight and left testicles were weighed and averaged for each animal.\nTestosterone RIA\nTestosterone levels in the technical duplicates were averaged for each animal.\nAndrogen receptor\nSections containing L3 and 4 spinal levels were examined using brightfield microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany; DM5000B). Numbers of neurons immunoreactive for galanin were counted and evaluated for co-localization with androgen receptor immunoreactivity. The percentages of galanin neurons with androgen receptor immunoreactivity were calculated for each animal. All comparisons between sham and SCI groups were determined using Student's t-test with 95% confidence levels.\nPhotography\nImages for figures were captured using identical camera settings for all groups and were selected to be representative of the data. Images were only occasionally corrected for brightness to allow optimal visualization using Adobe Creative Cloud Photoshop 2019 (Adobe, San Jose, CA)."

    "Methods": "Study design, ethics, and setting\nThe data were collected as part of a prospective, observational study. TBI patients, 18\u201375 years age and admitted to the NCCU at the Karolinska University Hospital between 2007 and 2013, were enrolled. Ethical approval was provided by the regional ethical board in Stockholm (#2005/1526/31/2), and consent was provided by next of kin, in line with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study aimed to follow the STROBE statement for cohort studies (\nSupplementary Document S1\n).\n\nTraumatic brain injury management\nTBI management at our department has been described in detail in previous studies.\n6\n,\n29\nIn short, we adhere to guidelines similar to that of the Brain Trauma Foundation.\n32\nThe upper intracranial pressure (ICP) threshold is 20\u2009mm Hg, and in patients approaching the upper ICP limit, we aim for a cerebral perfusion pressure of 50\u201370\u2009mm Hg. In patients with refractory high ICP, barbiturate coma (monitored and limited by burst suppression on electroencephalogram) was induced or decompressive hemicraniectomy was performed.\n\nDefinition of admission parameters\nStandard demographic data were acquired from hospital charts, including age and sex. Time of trauma was defined as when the alarm came in to the regional alarm central and was acquired through pre-hospital charts. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) at admission to the hospital was used and handled as a continuous, ordinal scale in the analyses as previously suggested.\n33\nPupil reaction to light was assessed at hospital admission and defined as either both reactive, unilaterally unresponsive, or bilaterally unresponsive. Pre-hospital hypoxia was defined as either an oxygen saturation <90%, or if saturation was not available if the airway was deemed obstructed at the scene of accident. Pre-hospital hypotension was defined as a systolic blood pressure <90\u2009mm Hg. Glucose and hemoglobin sampled at admission to the hospital were acquired. These variables create the foundation, together with CT parameters, of the IMPACT study group's TBI outcome prediction calculator.\n3\nAbbreviated Injury Scale (AIS), Injury Severity Score (ISS), and New Injury Severity Score (NISS) were assessed by ISS-trained specialist nurses.\n34\n,\n35\nSignificant extracranial multi-trauma, as per previous definitions,\n33\nwas noted.\n\nNeuroradiology\nCT scans at admission were assessed using Marshall CT classification, as well as Rotterdam and Stockholm CT score.\n36\u201338\nBecause the admission CT was used, all patients with focal mass lesions (>25\u2009cm\n3\n) were considered Marshall VI. Any progression of intracranial hemorrhages between the first and second CT scans was noted.\nFor a subset of patients where the CT scan and/or clinical course suggested presence of diffuse axonal injury (DAI), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed as per clinical routine. The clinical MRI protocol consisted of echo planar diffusion\u2013, fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)-, gradient echo (GRE)-, and T\n1\n- and T\n2\n-weighted image sequences. Either hemorrhagic and/or non-hemorrhagic DAI was noted.\n\nClinical outcome\nLong-term functional outcome was assessed using the five-stage Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS), where 1\u2009=\u2009death, 2\u2009=\u2009persistent vegetative state, 3\u2009=\u2009severe disability (dependent state), 4\u2009=\u2009moderate disability (independent state), and 5\u2009=\u2009recovery (including low-grade disability).\n39\nThe GOS was assessed prospectively through a quality-of-life questionnaire, including questions from structured GOS interviews, that was sent to the patient at 12 months after injury, or in case these were not returned, it was recorded at visits to the outpatient clinic. The date for GOS assessment was noted.\n\nBlood sampling\nBlood was pragmatically sampled, depending on research staff availability, for NF-L, GFAP, UCH-L1, and tau analyses. These were sampled up to three times during the first 2 weeks, if the patient did not die or was discharged. Serum blood collection tubes where used (yellow cap, clot activator with gel). Sampling was performed by arterial lines and then transported to a local biobank where they stood upright for 30\u2009min to allow coagulation. Samples where then centrifuged for 15\u2009min at 2000g and aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\nBlood for analysis of S100B and NSE were drawn twice-daily and sent directly to the Department of Clinical Chemistry at the Karolinska University Hospital, as per clinical routine.\n\nSerum analysis\nSerum GFAP, UCH-L1, NF-L and tau concentrations were measured using the Human Neurology 4-Plex A assay (N4PA) on an HD-1 Single molecule array (Simoa) instrument, according to instructions from the manufacturer (Quanterix, Lexington, MA). Measurements were performed by board-certified laboratory technicians, who were blinded to clinical data, in one round of experiments using one batch of reagents and with baseline and follow-up samples analyzed side by side. In the assay, calibrators were run as duplicates, samples as singlicates, and two internal quality-control plasma samples were run in the beginning and the end of each run. Between-day coefficient of variations (CVs) were 8.8% at 103\u2009pg/mL and 8.4% at 7.4\u2009pg/mL for NF-L, 11.9% at 1.2\u2009pg/mL and 9.7% at 22.5\u2009pg/mL for tau, 9.0% at 72\u2009pg/mL and 7.3% at 88\u2009pg/mL for GFAP, and 33.3% at 11.4\u2009pg/mL and 34.0% at 10.8\u2009pg/mL for UCH-L1.\nAll serum S100B samples collected until September 2008 were analyzed at Karolinska University Hospital, Department of Clinical Chemistry, using a quantitative automated luminometric immunoassay (LIAISON-mat S100 system; DiaSorin, Sangtec, Italy). In September 2008, the Department changed to an automatic electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Elecsys S100B; Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany). A good correspondence between the two methods has been shown, including internal validation by the Department of Clinical Chemistry, Karolinska University Hospital, Solna, Sweden.\n6\nSerum NSE samples were analyzed using an immunoradiometric assay (Liaison; DiaSorin) throughout the whole study at the Karolinska University Hospital, Department of Clinical Chemistry. The detection levels for the LIAISON ranges from 0.04\u2009\u03bcg/L for NSE and 0.02\u2009\u03bcg/L for S100B, whereas the Elecsys detects serum S100B levels down to 0.005\u2009\u03bcg/L. No patient presented with concentrations below detection levels.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented as median and interquartile range (IQR) for continuous data and grouped for categorical data. Univariate logistic regressions toward different levels of the GOS (proportional odds analysis, using \u201crms\u201d package in R) were applied to study the predictive ability of admission/IMPACT parameters as well as the protein biomarkers. Similar tests were performed toward different CT severity scores for the biomarkers, as well as linear models, were applicable. Protein biomarkers were also tested versus different dichotomizations of outcome, GOS1\u20133 (unfavorable) versus GOS4\u20135 (favorable), and GOS1 (dead) versus GOS2\u20135 (alive).\nNagelkerke's pseudo-\nR\n2\nwas used to determine model performance and was bias adjusted for multiple parameters using a bootstrap method. Nagelkerke's pseudo-\nR\n2\ndescribes performance as between \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1,\u201d where 1 fully explains the model, akin to explained variance. AUC (area under the curve) ROC (receiver operating characteristics) curves were also used to assess model performances (using the pROC package in R). Step-up, as well as a step-down, multi-variable models were used to examine how the biomarkers added explained variability to the baseline outcome predictors used in the IMPACT calculator.\n3\nThis was done for unfavorable versus favorable outcome as per IMPACT. A sliding window, assessing a proportional odds analysis of the biomarkers toward the GOS and with bootstrapped confidence intervals, was used to assess the prediction performance of a biomarker over time, after trauma.\nThe R package \u201cggplot2\u201d and conditional density plots were used to illustrate biomarker data.\n40\nLinear correlations (Spearman) were used to determine cross-correlations between the different protein biomarkers, using peak concentrations so that only 1 patient contributed one time point (visualized with \u201cGGally\u201d package). Principal component analysis (PCA) of the biomarkers was performed using R (\u201cprcomp\u201d package) to explore potential protein interactions.\n41\nA loading plot, highlighting potential covariance among the biomarkers in the two first components, was created. The statistical program R was used in the analyses with the interface R-studio (Boston, MA).\n42\nA\np\nvalue of <0.05 was considered significant.\n\nMissing data\nAll univariate regression models performed were done with unimputed data, excluding missing observations. The multi-variable prediction models were performed after multiple imputation (MI; \u201cMICE\u201d package, R), as advocated in the statistical literature and by the IMPACT TBI study group.\n43\n,\n44\nWe applied seven imputed sets of data in our MI, with the imputed data coming from a regression imputation with each imputation drawn from a distribution, retaining uncertainty caused by imputation in analyses toward the dichotomized outcomes. All seven models were checked for consistency, and an average Nagelkerke's pseudo-\nR\n2\nof these seven imputations was reported. Patients that had no corresponding S100B/NSE analyses for the three sampling time points in the multi-variable models had their peak concentrations of S100B and NSE imputed."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nFemale Sprague Dawley rats (\nn\n=\u2009112, 225\u2013250\u2009g, Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were housed with access to food and water ad libitum on a 12-h light-dark cycle. All experiments were compliant with federal guidelines and approved by the Drexel University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All subjects were handled 10\u2009min/day for a week prior to study initiation, after which they were singly housed. Baseline behavioral tests (sucrose preference, novel object recognition, and social exploration) were conducted 1 week prior to SCI. Behavioral tests were repeated at 28 days post-injury for all groups, followed by a forced swim test. A subset of rats (\nn\n=\u200953) received treatment with either XPro1595 (s.c.\nn\n=\u200922, i.c.v.\nn\n=\u200915) or sterile saline (s.c.\nn\n=\u200910, i.c.v.\nn\n=\u20096). S.c. administration began at the time of injury and was continued until sacrifice. I.c.v. administration by osmotic pump began 1 day prior to injury and was continued until sacrifice.\n\nT9 contusion\nSubjects were anesthetized by hindlimb intramuscular injection with an XAK mixture (6\u2009mg/kg xylaxine [Anased, Lloyd Laboratories, Shenandoah, IA], 6\u2009mg/kg acepromazine [Promace, Vedco Inc., St. Joseph, MO], and 60\u2009mg/kg ketamine [Ketaset, Vedco Inc.]). Sustained-release buprenorphine (1.0\u2009mg/kg s.c., Zoopharm, Laramie, WY) was given prior to skin incision. Rats received laminectomy and were stabilized at the T8 and T10 vertebrae prior to midline T9 contusive injury of 150 Kdyn with a 1\u2009sec dwell time using the Infinite Horizons Impact device (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, Lexington, KY). Probe tip diameter was 2\u2009mm. The site of probe impact was submerged in sterile saline during injury. Dorsal musculature was closed using 5-0 Vicryl coated suture. The skin incision was closed using Michel wound clips. After injury, bladders were expressed twice daily until reflexive micturition was recovered. Subjects received cefazolin (160mg/kg s.c. 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009daily, Sandoz, Princeton, NJ) and lactated Ringer's solution (3 cc, s.c.) for 7 days post-injury.\n\nXPro1595 administration\nPeripheral administration\nBeginning at the time of T9 contusion, 32 rats received s.c. injection of XPro1595 (\nn\n=\u200922, 10mg/kg [generously provided by David E. Szymkowski of Xencor]) or equivalent volume of sterile saline solution (\nn\n=\u200910) every 3 days throughout completion of behavioral testing beginning at 4 weeks post-injury.\n\nIntracerebroventricular cannulation\nOne day prior to T9 contusion, a cohort of 21 rats was implanted with a unilateral i.c.v. cannula (Alzet Brain Infusion Kit 2, Model 2004 Alzet Osmotic Pump, Durect Corporation, Cupertino, CA) into the left lateral ventricle (AP: \u22121.0. ML: +2.0, DV: \u22124.0\n\u2192\n\u22123.5). Subjects were anesthetized with isofluorane (5% induction level) prior to surgical procedure. Once hindlimb pinch reflex and corneal reflex were no longer elicited, rats were maintained at a 2.5\u20133% isofluorane level for the duration of surgery. Each subject was suspended in a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA) using ear bars, and the surgical field was sterilized using ethanol and betadine. A midline skin incision was made to expose the skull and bregma was identified to calculate lateral ventricle coordinates for each animal.\nA Dremel drill with 0.9-mm bit was used to penetrate the skull over the projected site of cannula implantation and bilaterally at two coordinates approximately 8\u2009mm rostral and caudal to the implantation site for bone screws (1.59\u2009mm O.D., 3.2\u2009mm length, Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL) to help secure the head cap with dental cement (Stoelting). The cannula (28 gauge, 5\u2009mm length) was subsequently lowered until the surface of the brain was reached and DV coordinates were calculated from this stereotaxic value. Once dental cement secured the head cap, the cannula was connected to an Alzet Osmotic Pump (28 day, 0.25 \u03bcL/h) filled with either saline (\nn\n=\u20096) or XPro1595 (\nn\n=\u200915). An incision was made between the shoulder blades and the pump was inserted subdermally. The incision was closed with 4-0 silk suture. At least 48\u2009h prior to implantation, pumps were filled and primed by immersion in sterile saline at 37\u00b0C.\n\nBehavioral testing\nRats were assessed with a battery of behavioral tests 1 week before injury and again at 28 days post-injury. Na\u00efve rats were tested 1 week prior to single-housing and again at 28 days.\nSucrose preference\nRats were habituated to 2% sucrose solution for 48\u2009h, 1 week prior to testing. For habituation, two bottles were placed one on each side of the home cage with 300\u2009mL of either water or 2% sucrose. The position of the bottles was switched after 24\u2009h to reduce bias from side preference. One week after sucrose habituation, rats were water deprived for 12\u2009h and the testing phase was conducted. At 5:00 a.m., rats were presented with two bottles (one of water, one of 2% sucrose), with the location of the sucrose bottle alternating sides between each animal. Bottles were left for 2\u2009h, with position of bottles being switched after 1\u2009h. Pre- and post-test bottle weights were recorded and % sucrose preference was calculated as the volume of sucrose consumed/total liquid volume consumed\u2009\u00d7\u2009100. A significant decrease in the preference for sucrose solution suggests an anhedonic response. Sucrose preference values of less that 10% were not included in clustering due to the sensitivity of clustering to extreme values. These instances were rare, with only eight values removed throughout the study.\nNovel object recognition\nRats were acclimated to novel object chambers (40.5\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u200940.5\u2009cm) for 3 days, 10\u2009min each day before testing. The familiar trial consisted of placing the rat in the novel object chamber with two identical objects for a 5-min exploration period, followed by a period of 1.5\u2009h in the home cage before initiation of the novel object trial. The novel object testing paradigm consisted of 5-min exploration time with one object from the familiar trial and one completely distinct object of similar size. All objects and chambers were cleaned with 70% ethanol after each trial to prevent scent-cue bias. Both the familiar and novel trials were video-recorded from above and scored post hoc. Interaction was defined as having the nose directed at the object from a distance of 2\u2009cm or closer. Climbing or sitting on the objects was not counted as exploration. Percent novel object exploration was calculated as the time spent exploring novel object (sec)/time exploring both objects (sec)\u2009\u00d7\u2009100. A decrease in time spent exploring the novel object suggests a memory deficit.\nOpen field\nRats were placed in open field chambers for 5\u2009min to assess locomotive behavior. MotorMonitor Host software (Kinder Scientific, Poway, CA) calculated movement based on beam breaks in the chamber. The chamber was digitally separated into peripheral and central segments. Less time spent in the center of the chamber is suggested to be an indicator of anxious phenotype.\nSocial exploration\nRats were acclimated to open field chambers 3 times, 10\u2009min each before testing. Rats were placed in open field alone for 5\u2009min of exploration time. After 5\u2009min, a novel female intruder rat of similar size and age was placed in the open field with test rat for 5\u2009min. Social interaction was scored as any sniffing, climbing, following, or touching initiated by test rat. Social interaction percentage was calculated as time spent interacting with intruder (sec)/600\u2009sec\u2009\u00d7\u2009100.\nModified forced swim test\nThe forced swim test was only performed in one session post-injury (as opposed to the classical 2-day testing paradigm) to avoid learned helplessness adaptation to multiple bouts of swimming. Rats were placed in a cylindrical tank of water (50.3\u2009cm height\u2009\u00d7\u200927.7\u2009cm diameter, 30\u2009cm water level, 23\u201325\u00b0C) for a 10-min swimming period. Each test was video-recorded from a point directly above the tank. Post hoc scoring was done via modified 5-sec interval method to assess time spent immobile, versus swimming or climbing.\n34\n,\n35\nThe modified scoring method has been suggested to have greater predictive validity in response to antidepressant treatment.\n34\n,\n36\nImmobility was defined as a lack of movements, except for the small movements necessary for keeping the head above water.\n37\nPercent immobility ([time spent immobile (sec)/total swim time (600\u2009sec)]\u2009\u00d7\u2009100) has been established as an indicator of hopelessness.\nBBB\nAmbulation was assessed weekly in all non-treated rats using the Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) open field rating scale.\n38\nOnce characteristic spontaneous motor recovery was established for our model, all treated cohorts (XPro1595 or saline) were tested at 4 weeks post-injury only. Rats were placed in an open field apparatus (95\u2009cm diameter) and ambulation was scored for 4\u2009min by two trained observers. The BBB scale runs from 0 (no observable hindlimb joint movement) to 21 (na\u00efve rat ambulation). A score of 10 or greater indicates hindlimb stepping with various levels of coordination and paw placement. A score of 14 indicates consistent weight-supported stepping with consistent forelimb/hindlimb coordination.\nAutomated von Frey\nSix animals per testing period were placed in a long Plexiglas chamber with five divider walls so that neighboring animals could not be seen. The chamber floor was a wire mesh to allow for microfilament probe access. After a 10-min acclimation period, the monofilament was centered below the plantar surface of the hindpaw. The automated plantar aesthesiometer (Ugo Basile, Gemonia, Italy) was raised at a 20-sec ramp speed up to a maximum of 50\ng\nof force. The force at which the animal withdrew the paw with evidence of supraspinal stimulus awareness (lifting, looking at, licking the hindpaw, vocalizing, moving away from stimulus) was recorded for each trial. Five trials/hindpaw were conducted for each animal. Complete absence of paw withdrawal was scored as 50\ng\nforce threshold (maximum). The withdrawal force for all five trials was averaged for each hindpaw to give the withdrawal threshold. A post-injury reduction in the withdrawal threshold of greater than 50% from baseline testing was considered positive for tactile allodynia. Each rat was given an inter-trial interval of at least 1\u2009min to reduce a fatigue effect.\nHargreaves thermal testing\nThree animals per testing period were placed in a Plexiglas chamber with glass-pane bottom and two divider walls so that neighboring animals could not be seen. After a 10-min acclimation period, the infrared heat source (I.R. intensity 48, Ugo Basile, Gemonia, Italy) was centered below the plantar surface of the hindpaw. Latency to withdraw the hindpaw with evidence of supraspinal stimulus awareness (lifting, looking at, licking the hindpaw, vocalizing, moving away from stimulus) after initiation of thermal stimulus was recorded for each trial. Five trials were conducted for each hindpaw in a testing period. The order of paw testing was randomized and each animal was given an inter-trial period of at least 1\u2009min to minimize fatigue effect. The withdrawal latency for all five trials was averaged for each hindpaw. A post-injury reduction in the withdrawal threshold greater than 50% from baseline testing was considered positive for thermal allodynia.\n\nProtein quantification\nProtein extraction\nRats were euthanized at 5 weeks post-injury by isofluorane anesthesia and intracardial injection of Euthasol (0.3\u2009mL, 390\u2009mg/kg sodium pentobarbital and 50\u2009mg/kg phenytoin) before decapitation. Brain tissue was removed and regions of interest (DRN, hippocampus [HP], prefrontal cortex [PFC]) were blocked into 2-mm thick coronal slices using a brain matrix. Three-millimeter diameter punches (Disposable Biopsy Punch, Robbins Instruments, Chatham, NJ) of tissue from each target region were collected and flash frozen on dry ice. Tissue was weighed and ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer was added at a volume 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009weight. Tissue was sonicated on ice in brief bursts and centrifuged for 40\u2009min at 14,000\u2009rpm, 4\u00b0C. Supernatant was removed and aliquots were stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\nProtein concentration (\u03bcg/mL) was quantified for each supernatant using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Five \u03bcL of each supernatant was diluted in 95\u2009\u03bcL nuclease-free water before BCA. Ten \u03bcL of each diluted sample and included albumin standards were added in duplicate to a 96-well microplate. The Pierce BCA Kit working reagent was prepared at a ratio of 50:1 (A:B) and 250\u2009\u03bcL was added to each well of the microplate. The plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min and read immediately using a TECAN Infinite 200 pro spectrophotometer (TECAN Trading AG, Switzerland) at 450\u2009nm. Protein values were calculated from the linear regression equation of the standards and multiplied by a dilution factor of 20 to give the final \u03bcg/mL concentration.\nTNF ELISA\nSandwich ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) Kits (ab100785, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) were used to quantify TNF levels for each brain region (DRN, HP, PFC). One hundred \u03bcL of each sample (30\u2009mg total protein diluted in Abcam 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009sample diluent buffer) supernatant was loaded in duplicate into a 96-well plate pre-coated with anti-rat TNF antibody and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight. Plate was rinsed with 300 \u03bcL wash buffer 4 times and incubated in biotinylated anti-TNF solution with shaking (500\u2013600/min) for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Wash procedure was repeated and plate was incubated in streptavidin horseradish peroxidase (HRP) solution with shaking for 45\u2009min at room temperature. Wash procedure was repeated and plate was incubated in 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) one-step solution in the dark for 30\u2009min. Fifty \u03bcL of stop solution was added to each well and the plate was analyzed immediately using a TECAN Infinite 200 pro spectrophotometer (TECAN Trading) at 450\u2009nm. Cytokine concentration (pg/mL) was determined from the linear regression of provided standards and multiplied by the appropriate dilution factor for each sample based on volume of supernatant required to reach 30\u2009\u03bcg of protein.\nWES capillary electrophoresis of pP65\nLevels of TNFR1 signaling were assessed through quantification of phosphorylated P65 (pP65) protein levels in brain supernatant, normalized to actin levels. The Wes ProteinSimple System (Santa Clara, CA) utilizes automated capillary-based electrophoresis and immunoprobing of sample supernatant to measure protein with greater sensitivity and reduced sample size compared with traditional Western blotting. Compass for Simple Western software automatically provides quantitative analysis of assay data (area under the curve minus baseline) and creates a display of detected proteins as bands in a lane view (\nFig. 1\n) similar to what one would see with a traditional Western blot. A primary antibody to pP65 (Novus Biologicals, NB100-82088) was used to detect levels of NF-\u03ba\u03b2 P65 only when it is phosphorylated at serine 536. Specificity of this antibody for the phosphorylated form was confirmed with whole cell lysate of serine/threonine phosphatase inhibited HeLa cells (Abcam, clone AC-74, A5316). A primary antibody to \u03b2-actin (Sigma, #A5316) was used as a loading control for normalization of pP65 values.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nGraphs display mean\u2009+\u2009SEM area under the curve pP65 intensity normalized to beta actin for each treatment group.\n(A)\nWES results of rabbit anti-pP65 (65\u2009kDa) and mouse anti-beta actin (48\u2009kDa).\n(B)\nOne-way ANOVA of pP65 signal in clusters of each treatment group did not reveal any significant differences.\n(C)\nOne-way ANOVA of combined subjects from each treatment group revealed a significantly higher pP65 level in animals receiving s.c. XPro compared with i.c.v. XPro (*\np\n<\u20090.05). ANOVA, analysis of variance; i.c.v., intracerebroventricular; pP65, phosphorylated P65; s.c., subcutaneous; SEM, standard error of the mean.\nLesion epicenter analysis\nThe thoracic spinal cord was extracted from each animal immediately after euthanasia and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4\u00b0C. Each spinal cord then was cryoprotected in 30% sucrose solution. The lesion site (T9 spinal cord epicenter +2\u2009mm rostral and caudal) was blocked and embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) for cryosectioning at \u221220\u00b0C (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Twenty-five micrometer sections, 250\u2009\u03bcm apart and spanning the entire tissue block were mounted directly onto Superfrost Plus slides and stored at 4\u00b0C for processing. Sections were stained with cresyl violet (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to identify Nissl substance and euriochrome cyanine (Sigma-Aldrich) to identify myelin. Slides were cover-slipped immediately after staining with DPX (dibutylphthalate polystyrene xylene) mounting medium (Fisher Scientific). The area (mm\n2\n) of spared white matter at the lesion epicenter was measured using the Cavaleri estimator method (Stereo Investigator, MBF Bioscience, Burlington, VT). Epicenter spared white matter for all animals in each cluster was averaged and compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Animals with area of sparing greater than 3 standard deviations above or below the mean were considered outliers and removed from further behavioral and biochemical analysis.\n\nStatistical analysis\nPrincipal components analysis\nAll post-injury behavioral data were analyzed with principal components analysis based on orthogonal varimax rotation. Correlation matrix generated from principal component analysis revealed that social exploration, novel object recognition, and total distance traveled in open field did not have a correlation coefficient of r\u2009\u2265\u20090.3 with any other behavioral tests. Therefore, these tests were excluded from principal components analysis. Data distribution passed Bartletts's test of sphericity (\np\n=\u20090.048). Only one component was extracted, explaining 64% of cumulative variance. Forced swim test and sucrose preference loaded on component 1 and were used to establish behavioral clusters.\nHierarchical cluster analysis\nHierarchical cluster analysis was used to identify the number of clusters that arose within injured animals based on sucrose preference and forced swim tests. Data were standardized by transformation to z score. Ward's method of hierarchical clustering was applied with a squared Euclidian distance measure.\n32\nThe resultant dendrogram and agglomeration schedules were used to determine cluster number based on the presence of a large increase in agglomeration coefficient. Once the appropriate number of clusters was determined the data were analyzed with k-means cluster analysis. Although hierarchical cluster is good for determining the number of clusters that naturally occur in a data set, it is susceptible to change with addition of subjects. K-means cluster analysis is based on a predetermined number of clusters with more stable cluster centers.\nK-means cluster analysis\nK-mean cluster analysis was used to separate subjects into three clusters according to statistical rigor and fidelity of cluster centers. Data from forced swim and sucrose preference were analyzed with a maximum of 20 iterations.\nOne-way ANOVA\nAfter k-means analysis, one-way ANOVA was used to determine significant differences between the resultant clusters in each behavioral test. The behavioral phenotype of each cluster was used to identify non-depressed, depressed, and melancholic-depressed phenotypes. One-way repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of BBB scores was used to confirm that ambulation did not differ between clusters, with BBB scores at 3 days post-injury used as a covariate. After BBB progression in our model was established in untreated rats, XPro1595-treated and saline-treated rats were only assessed for BBB ambulation differences at 4 weeks post-injury with one-way ANOVA. One-way ANOVA was used to assess differences in TNF and pP65 levels, as well as white matter sparing at the lesion epicenter between clusters. Tukey's multiple comparison test was used for post hoc analysis. If data did not adhere to a normal distribution, the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess statistical differences between clusters. Data points in each measure that were 3 standard deviations from the mean were considered outliers and removed."

The methodology and report of this review were prepared based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement.8\n\nEligibility criteria\nAll prospective, observational studies and randomized, controlled trials published between 2005 and 2018 were considered for inclusion. Studies were included if they reported data on patients with impaired consciousness of any cause, where level of consciousness was assessed using FOUR score, and where the outcome was reported in terms of mortality or a validated measure of functional outcome, such as modified Rankin Scale (mRS)\n9\nor Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS).\n10\nTo permit analysis of predictive power of FOUR score at various time points, studies reporting any time points of outcome were eligible for inclusion. Studies were excluded if they were abstracts, commentaries, letters, correspondences, reviews, and if the full-text article was not available or was not written in the English language. Studies involving pediatric patients, where the mean or median age of sample population was <18 years of age, were also excluded.\n\nInformation sources and search strategy\nThe following electronic databases were searched: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, Scopus (\nwww.scopus.com\n), Web of Science (\nwww.webofknowledge.com\n), and\nClinicalTrials.gov\n(\nwww.clinicaltrials.gov\n).\nGray literature searching was performed using the OpenGrey database (\nwww.opengrey.eu\n). The search was limited to articles listed between 2005 and April 2018 (inclusive) and was last conducted on July 22, 2018. To maximize sensitivity of our search strategy, the title and abstract of references were searched for the keywords \u201cfull outline of unresponsiveness\u201d OR \u201cfour score.\u201d No AND operators were used. Citation searching was not performed. The search strategy used for each database is in (\nSupplementary Table S1\n).\n\nData management, selection, and extraction\nCitations were de-duplicated using Mendeley reference management software (version 1.17.7; Mendeley Ltd., London, UK) before importing and screening using Covidence (\nwww.covidence.org\n). Two authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria. For abstracts which were potentially eligible, or if eligibility was unclear from abstract review, full texts were examined independently by both authors and any disagreement resolved by consensus. Reasons for exclusion at the phase of full-text review were recorded. Data extraction from included studies was performed independently by two authors using a standardized proforma as per the protocol, with any discrepancies resolved by the third author. Data items for extraction are described in the supplementary materials (\nSupplementary Table S2\n).\n\nAssessment of risk of bias of study\nRisk of bias of each study was assessed independently by two authors using the Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool,\n11\nwhich assesses risk of bias in six domains\u2014study participation, study attrition, prognostic factor measurement, outcome measurement, study confounding, and statistical analysis and reporting. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion. For the purpose of summarization of data, studies were globally rated \u201clow risk of bias\u201d if all the components were rated \u201clow risk\u201d; \u201cmoderate risk of bias\u201d if one or more components were rated \u201cmoderate risk\u201d; and \u201chigh risk of bias\u201d if one or more components were rated \u201chigh risk.\u201d\n\nData synthesis\nThe characteristics of included studies and risk of bias assessment results are described in tables. The studies were categorized according to the outcomes measured (mortality, GOS or extended Glasgow Outcome Scale\u2013Extended [GOSE],\n12\nmRS, and others). Timing of assessment in each study was recorded. Measures of predictive ability of FOUR score for each outcome are presented in terms of area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), classified into several performance levels,\n13\nor odds ratio of mortality or poor outcome associated with each increment in total FOUR score, as determined by logistic regression. On the basis of analyzing receiver operating characteristics curve, optimal predictive values of FOUR score in terms of maximum sensitivity and specificity were identified. This is termed the \u201ccut off.\u201d We describe sensitivity and specificity reported by each included study at their reported cut-off value. Results based on total FOUR score are presented, unless stated otherwise.\nIn addition, further comparisons regarding the prognostic ability of FOUR score were made in three subgroup analyses between: 1) patients with neurological and non-neurological causes of impaired consciousness; 2) patients in specialized neurological units and non-neurological units; and 3) intubated and non-intubated patients.\nThese were broadly categorized because the review is limited to data presented by published studies which differed methodologically, thus unlikely to yield sufficient studies of similar methodology for more-specific subgroup analyses. Subgroup analysis of severity of impairment of consciousness was considered but not performed given that studies have included population of full range of consciousness in statistical analysis, thus access to raw data would be necessary to perform this analysis.\nI\n2\nvalue was calculated using MedCalc software (version 17.5.5; MedCalc Software bvba, Ostend, Belgium), with I\n2\nvalue >50% considered as significant heterogeneity. The high level of statistical heterogeneity (I\n2\n=\u200984.9%) between studies, calculated using AUC values, and methodological heterogeneity, particularly of timing of initial assessment and outcome assessment,\n14\u201323\nprecluded meta-analysis. We therefore conducted a narrative synthesis alone."

    "Methods": "Case selection\nDogs were recruited prospectively from the patient pool of the Canine Spinal Cord Injury Program at the North Carolina State University (NCSU) College of Veterinary Medicine. All dogs were chronically non-ambulatory with absent or severely reduced pelvic limb and tail pain perception (with or without urinary and fecal incontinence). In all dogs, signs were due to an acute thoracolumbar SCI (third thoracic to third lumbar spinal cord segments) causing paralysis with loss of pain perception suffered a minimum of three months previously. Body weight between 3\u201330\u2009kg was required to ensure proper measurements could be recorded by the treadmill. Below 3\u2009kg, the dogs' steps would not register and dogs weighing greater than approximately 30\u2009kg had trouble maintaining all four limbs on a single belt of the two-belted instrumented treadmill, which was necessary for accurate data capture. Dogs also were required to be amenable to walking on the treadmill with only verbal encouragement since tactile manipulation can affect measurements. Informed consent was obtained for all animals and examinations were conducted in accordance with the NCSU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol #15-004-01).\n\nStandard gait evaluation\nAll cases underwent a standard gait analysis consisting of walking each dog on a non-slip surface and on a treadmill for approximately 3\u2009min, with the speed adjusted to a comfortable pace for each individual and with sling support provided for the hind quarters. All examinations were videotaped. Gait was quantified using the OFS (ranging from 0\u201312).\n7\n,\n8\nOFS of \u22654 corresponds to taking at least some weight-bearing steps. Treadmill footage was scored to quantify pelvic limb steps with pelvic limb support and used to calculate a stepping score (SS) and coordination score (RI) for comparison to instrumented treadmill data.\n12\n\nInstrumented treadmill gait evaluation\nAn instrumented force-plate treadmill (Fully Instrumented Treadmill, Bertec Corporation, Columbus, OH) designed for bipedal/human gait analysis was utilized. The set up consisted of two independent pressure-sensitive belts as well as six cameras with infrared sensors (mx-t020; Vicon) mounted on the ceiling surrounding the treadmill to track the location of specific reflective markers. All dogs were outfitted with reflective markers at the lateral aspect of each carpus and tarsus, as well as one additional marker placed on midline between the scapulae in line with the point of the elbow when the dog was standing at rest (\nFig. 1\n). Elastic tape was used to secure the markers in place without interfering with joint flexion and extension. The interscapular marker was utilized for COP measurements while the additional markers captured kinematic data (data not presented). COP was assessed in the x (lateral) and y (craniocaudal) directions. Refer to Blau and colleagues for more detailed information on COP computations.\n26\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\n(A)\nSet-up for dogs with spinal cord injury on the instrumented treadmill depicting sling support attached to the load cell and reflective marker placement.\n(B)\nClose-up view of load cell.\nA standard sling (Walk-a-bout) was used to provide hind-quarter support. Height was adjusted such that the spine was parallel to the ground and the dog was in a biomechanically appropriate stance for locomotion. The handles of the sling were attached to a load cell in order to record the percentage body weight support provided by the sling during testing. Dogs were acclimated to the treadmill for several minutes and then walked at a steady, comfortable pace for approximately 5\u201310\u2009min or until at least five \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d trials were recorded. Trials were subjectively designated as good to excellent if multiple (more than two) step cycles were recorded with minimal visible variation in thoracic limb gait, with all four limbs contained on a single belt of the treadmill, with all markers visible and no manual intervention by the handler. Anomalous movements such as lunging or stopping or other deviation from a steady stepping (in the thoracic limbs) were grounds to stop an individual trial. A leash was placed loosely around the neck but trials were only counted if the dog was walking willingly in response to verbal encouragement without pulling or re-direction with the leash. Treadmill speed was recorded for each dog. All trials also were videotaped using a digital video camera (HDR-CX580V; Sony) positioned to capture all four limbs of the dogs as they walked as a reference on dog behavior during an individual trial if needed.\nAll data for each trial in each dog were collected as .c3d files and visually inspected for quality and ability to accurately track marker position throughout the trial. Trials with marker loss were not included in analysis. Data processing consisted of converting .c3d files to .txt files (Visual 3D Software; C-Motion) which were subsequently imported into MATLAB (MATLAB Software, Mathworks) for analysis and calculations using purpose written code (see\nSupplementary Material: MATLAB Code\n).\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll analyses were performed using Jmp 13 Pro (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). COP measurements were captured in the x (right to left, COPx) and y (craniocaudal, COPy) planes for each trial in each dog. COP summary statistics were calculated for each dog (mean and standard deviation), as well as presented collectively as a mean and standard deviation across all dogs. To evaluate the variability of COP, calculations also included the root mean square (RMS) of the COPx and COPy (RMS_COPx and RMS_COPy, respectively) for each trial in each dog. Mean RMS_COPx and mean RMS_COPy and standard deviation were also determined for each dog and collectively for all dogs. The percentage weight support was also calculated for each trial with mean and standard deviation reported for each dog and across all dogs. OFS, SS, RI were each reported as mean and standard deviation or median and range, as appropriate. Associations between age, duration of injury or limb length (greater trochanter to lateral digit) and RMS_COPx or RMS_COPy were investigated using linear regression and an analysis of variance. Limb length (distance from the front foot to intrascapular marker) was noted to be associated with RMS_COP measurements in the previously acquired data in our laboratory in neurologically normal chondrodystrophic dogs using the same protocol on the same treadmill.\n26\nTherefore, a model was constructed incorporating limb length (measured as the distance from the greater trochanter to lateral digit for SCI dogs and from the front foot to the intrascapular marker in a standing position for normal dogs). An analysis of covariance was then performed to compare RMS_COPx or RMS_COPy between the SCI and normal dogs. Agreement between RMS_COP calculations and standard gait measures (OFS, SS, RI) was determined by calculating correlation coefficients. Support percentage was also compared with the standard gait measures by calculating correlation coefficients. For all analyses,\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "Study population\nThe study was introduced to members of the team in conjunction with athletic trainers. Athletes were required to be in collegiate football or volleyball and have no self-reported history of brain surgery, severe brain injury, or major neurological, psychiatric, or substance abuse disorder. All interested athletes were enrolled. We prospectively enrolled 63 high-contact (football) and 34 low-contact (volleyball) collegiate athletes over the course of 5 years (\nFig. 2\n), in accord with the Institutional Review Board and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Athletes underwent brain MRI at the start of their respective seasons, within 24\u201396\u2009h after a concussion (when possible with the athlete's schedule), and after the last season of sporting participation. During the first year of this study, athletes were additionally imaged at the end of their season. Incidences of concussion in football during the study period were identified by the athletic trainers. In total, 18 concussions occurred in 15 football athletes, 3 of whom had two concussions. None involved loss of consciousness, and mean return to play was 10.3 days (excluding 1 athlete who did not return to play). Post-concussion MRI was captured for 13 of these 18 concussions (72%) among 12 football athletes, 1 of whom had two concussions with post-concussion MRI. In 2 of the other post-concussion MRI subjects, the first imaging time point was post-concussion (1 and 13 days, respectively) without previous baseline imaging. Each athlete thus had one to eight MRI time points spanning a maximum of 4 years (\nFig. 3\n), resulting in 198 football and 99 volleyball MRI scans, for a total of 297 scans (\nFig. 2\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nEnrollment figure demonstrating exclusion criteria and final baseline and longitudinal analysis populations. FB, football athletes; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; VB, volleyball athletes.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\n(\nA\n) Distribution of years of follow-up included in final analysis for both athlete groups, with 48 of 63 football subjects (76%) and 23 of 34 volleyball subjects (68%) having two or greater time points more than 4 months apart, (\nB\n) Distribution of enrollment year for each sport, where the year denotes the first year in school (starting with freshmen year) of usable data (i.e. with a usable hippocampal segmentation) for each subject. Color image is available online.\nThere were 2 volleyball athletes that suffered concussions: 1 during volleyball and the other incidental. All subsequent post-concussive imaging for these 2 volleyball athletes, which consisted of two and three time points, respectively, was excluded from the primary analyses, except where specified, to avoid the potential effect of concussions on hippocampal volumes in the control cohort. A board- and Certificate of Added Qualification\u2013certified neuroradiologist with 9 years of post-residency experience blindly examined all scans for incidental abnormalities, resulting in exclusion of 3 athletes (each with one, two, and three time points, respectively). A single time point from 1 athlete had partially corrupted images precluding analysis. After excluding these 12 scans (\nFig. 2\n), we analyzed a total of 197 football and 88 volleyball scans from 62 football and 32 volleyball athletes. Our football population represents approximately one half the size of a collegiate football team.\nAdditional information obtained for football athletes included the self-reported number and timing of past concussions, the number of years of playing football, the current position played, and a pre-first-season Standardized Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT) evaluation.\n49\nOne football athlete and 1 volleyball athlete did not provide years of tackle football experience. The SCAT evaluation included only the cognitive assessment, balance, coordination, and standardized assessment of concussion portions of the SCAT II, with a maximum score of 61.\n49\n\nImage acquisition\nUsing a 3-Tesla scanner (GE MR 750; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) and an eight-channel receive head coil, we acquired T\n1\n-weighted axial (inversion recovery fast spoiled gradient echo brain volume imaging, 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm, repetition time [TR] 7.9\u2009ms, echo time [TE] 3.1\u2009ms, number of excitations [NEX] 1, acquisition time 5.1\u2009min) and high-resolution coronal T\n2\n-weighted images, perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus (coronal oblique fast spin echo [FSE], resolution 0.39\u2009\u00d7\u20090.52\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009mm, 0.2\u2009mm skip, TR 5000\u201315,000, TE 95\u2013109, echo train length 25, matrix 512\u2009\u00d7\u2009384, NEX 2, 32\u201340 slices, one to two acquisitions, acquisition time 4.4\u20135.8\u2009min). For 29 athlete scans, the coronal T\n2\nFSE was judged to be corrupted by motion artifact in real time and was repeated.\n\nHippocampal subfield segmentation\nWe used Automated Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields (ASHS; Penn Image Computing & Science Lab,\nhttp://picsl.upenn.edu/software/ashs/\n), which performs multi-atlas label fusion and machine-learning correction to obtain reliable segmentations of the hippocampal subfields and adjacent cortices (\nFig. 1\n).\n50\nWe manually modified the segmentations of the 29 University of Pennsylvania Memory Center atlas brains included with the software and built a new atlas both to separate anterior from posterior hippocampus (which may be functionally different)\n51\nand improve the segmentation of the subiculum.\n50\nThe hippocampal atlas was edited by three raters with 1, 6, and 20 years of neuroimaging and segmentation experience. For each segmentation, the most posterior aspect of the uncus was demarcated as the most posterior aspect of all anterior hippocampal structures.\n52\nAdditionally, the subiculum was adjusted to be thicker along the posterior hippocampus. The atlas was rebuilt with the new segmentations and run on all athletes. The separation of anterior and posterior substructures was incomplete after atlas-based segmentation, with a few pixels of anterior subfields bleeding into posterior slices and\nvice versa\n. A histogram was composed of anterior and posterior pixels within each slice for each segmentation, and the inflection point was used to automatically determine the slice that demarcated the boundary between a given athlete's anterior and posterior hippocampal subfields.\nSubfields included were: CA1, DG (which includes CA2\u20134), subiculum, and ERC/PRC (which we combined into one subfield). CA4 and DG are inseparable on imaging, and CA2 and CA3 are very tiny with highly variable individual segmentations. Therefore, CA2\u20134 and DG were all combined into one subregion (called DG) representing a similar segment of hippocampal circuitry, which additionally reduced the number of statistical tests necessary. Similarly, ERC and PRC were combined. Automated hippocampal segmentations were manually checked for accuracy by three independent, blinded raters, and segmentations with gross errors (i.e., segmenting structures outside the hippocampal formation) were removed from analysis. In addition, we checked for visual outliers on both overall volume and volume change plots to make sure there were no segmentation errors. In total, 17 scans were excluded. The final analyses included 268 scans, consisting of 183 football and 85 volleyball scans from 59 football and 32 volleyball athletes, respectively (\nFig. 2\n). Subfield subdivision volumes (i.e., left anterior CA1, left posterior CA1, etc.) were summed to obtain total subfield volume, and total hippocampus volume was derived by summing all subfields, including entorhinal and perirhinal cortices. To control for differences in head size,\n53\nwe estimated intracranial volume for each athlete using the longitudinal processing stream in Freesurfer software (v5.3; The General Hospital Corporation, Boston, MA;\nhttp://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/\n).\n54\n,\n55\n\nStatistical analysis\nSubfield volumetric data exhibited normality by evaluation of regression residuals according to D'Agostino and colleagues' test for skewness and kurtosis,\n56\nso linear regression was appropriate for subfield volumes. In contrast, demographic data did not exhibit normality, so a Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to assess for group differences in age, body mass index (BMI), years of previous tackle football, and SCAT score at baseline. Regression coefficients were unstandardized. Standard errors were derived from a Huber-White robust variance estimate. All statistics were performed using Stata software (v15.0; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX;\nhttp://www.stata.com\n).\nAll statistical calculations on volumes were performed first on the entire hippocampal formation (all subfields bilaterally) and on the bilateral subfields (DG, CA1, subiculum, and entorhinal-perirhinal). We corrected for multiple comparisons across the four subfields using a false discovery rate (FDR) approach.\n57\nThe whole hippocampus was not corrected for because it is composed of the same four subfields. Reported\np\nvalues are uncorrected. For any significant effect after FDR, secondary exploratory analyses then examined the left and right subfields separately and, for any lateralized effect, the respective anterior and posterior subfield portions.\nWe performed our statistical analyses with a minimum number of parameters to encapsulate the most relevant sources of variance. Given that head size is associated with hippocampal size, we included total intracranial volume in all regressions.\n53\nSimilarly, age has been included in other studies of hippocampal volume in football.\n6\nAlthough both race and BMI were not equivalent between groups, we did not include either race or BMI because they individually did not contribute significantly to the model by a likelihood ratio test.\nTo test group differences in volume at baseline, we performed linear regression with covariates of intracranial volume and age, using a robust variance estimator. To test for the influence of two outliers on adjusted subiculum volume at baseline, we performed the same regression with these subjects removed (the football player with the lowest volume and the volleyball player with the highest volume).\nAmong football athletes, correlations of volumes to factors possibly related to high impacts (past history of concussions, position-based concussion risk, the number of previous years of tackle football experience, and baseline SCAT score) were each tested by four separate linear regressions with covariates of intracranial volume and age, using a robust variance estimator. Past history of concussion was included as a binary variable. Position-based concussion risk was defined as Nathanson's National Football League (NFL) reported concussion incidence (ranging from 9 to 37 per 100,000 position plays, scaled up from the original article by a factor of 100 for easy interpretability of volume change) for the current athlete position at the time of enrollment for the following position categories: linebacker (9), defensive line (9.7), offensive line (12), fullback (13), quarterback (20), defensive back (20), wide receiver (27), tight end (32), and running back (37).\n58\nAdditionally, we regressed subfield volume against literature values of Head Impact Telemetry (HIT) accelerometer-based measurements for each position, which may estimate cumulative subconcussive impacts based on player position. This included linear acceleration, rotational acceleration, and the composite HITsp measure.\n59\n,\n60\nTo determine longitudinal group differences in hippocampal volume, we performed a linear mixed-effects regression with covariates of baseline intracranial volume and age, fixed effects of sport, time, and the interaction of sport and time, and random effect of athlete. To ensure adequate temporal characterization, only athletes with two or more time points and greater than 4 months of total imaging follow-up were included in the longitudinal analysis. This resulted in a total of 245 scans that were analyzed, consisting of 169 scans from 48 football athletes (representing 76% of all football athletes enrolled) and 76 scans from 23 volleyball athletes (representing 68% of all volleyball athletes;\nFigs. 2\nand\n\u200b\nand3).\n3\n). We compared football (\nn\n=\u200936) and volleyball (\nn\n=\u200923) athletes without in-study concussion to assess the effect of sport longitudinally without any component of concussion (i.e., to evaluate subconcussive injury). Next, we performed the comparison between football athletes with concussion (\nn\n=\u200912) and volleyball athletes. Finally, we assessed whether any significant differences from the previous two analyses remained when comparing the whole football cohort (\nn\n=\u200948) to the volleyball cohort. To evaluate the potential contribution of the two volleyball athletes with in-study concussions (whose two and three post-concussion time points, respectively, were excluded in the main analysis), we assessed whether significant differences remained when including these time points."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nWe studied a convenience sample of participants with SCI who were enrolled in an exercise-based clinical trial to improve bone health.\n10\nSubjects were recruited for the parent study from individuals who receive care at our outpatient rehabilitation clinic or Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Participants were eligible for the parent study if they were 18 years or older, had a C4 or lower SCI (American Spinal Injury Association classification A, B, or C) with 3/5 greater biceps strength, and were non-ambulatory due to their injury. Subjects were excluded if they were actively being treated for epilepsy, actively using medications potentially affecting bone metabolism, including parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH analogs, bisphosphonates, androgenic steroids, estrogenic steroids, anti-epileptics, lithium, or oral glucocorticoid (use for more than 3 months); if they had a history of peripheral nerve compression or rotator cuff injury that limited the ability to exercise; uncontrolled diabetes; active renal disease; implanted defibrillator or pacemaker; an active grade 2 or greater pressure ulcer in a location that could be worsened with exercise; had an active bone fracture or lower extremity contractures; or were pregnant or lactating. For this BAFF substudy, we excluded 16 participants because biomarker results were not available, six participants with acute SCI (< 1 year post-injury), and five women, as there were too few to make meaningful comparisons based on sex. The final consisted of 43 men with chronic SCI who completed baseline testing between June 2011 and June 2013. The Institutional Review Boards approved all protocols prior to initiation of the study, and all participants gave their written informed consent to participate.\n\nMotor score\nMotor level and completeness of injury were confirmed by physical exam at study entry by the study physician according to the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) as previously described.\n6\n,\n11\nParticipants were classified as AIS A (sensory and motor complete, no sensory or motor function below the neurological level of injury), AIS B (motor complete, preservation of sensory but no motor function below the neurological level of injury), or AIS C (motor incomplete, sensory and motor function preserved below the neurological level, and more than half the key muscles below the neurological level are not strong enough to overcome gravity).\n\nDual x-ray absorptiometry for bone mineral density\nWe used a 5th generation GE Healthcare iDXA dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanner with enCore configuration version 12.3 to assess body composition. Total fat mass (kg) and total lean mass (kg) were calculated by the system software from whole body scans, as previously described.\n\nBiochemical analyses\nPlasma samples were drawn into an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tube and immediately delivered to the core blood research laboratory at our facility. The samples were centrifuged for 15\u2009min at 2600\u2009rpm (1459\u2009\u00d7\u2009g) at 40\u00b0C and stored at \u2212800\u00b0C until batch analysis. All biochemical analyses were performed at the Clinical and Epidemiologic Research Laboratory, Department of Laboratory Medicine at Children's Hospital in Boston, MA. Assays were performed in duplicate and any duplicate with >10% coefficient of variation (CV) was repeated. BAFF was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The assay employs the quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique with a sensitivity of 2.7\u2009pg/mL and run-to-run imprecision at BAFF concentrations of 474, 1118, and 2111\u2009pg/mL are 9.9, 10.0 and 11.6%, respectively. Total testosterone was measured by a competitive electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). This assay is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use. The lowest detection limit of this assay is 0.02\u2009ng/mL and the day-to-day imprecision values at concentrations of 0.24, 2.75, and 7.01\u2009ng/mL are 7.4, 2.2 and 1.7%, respectively. 25OH vitamin D was measured by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) using an API-5000 (AB Sciex, Foster City, CA) with a detection limit of 1.0\u2009ng/mL.\n\nVariable definition\nInformation regarding SCI, medical history, health habits, and medication use was obtained by a questionnaire at the time of enrollment. Participants completed a health questionnaire based on the American Thoracic Society adult respiratory disease questionnaire.\n12\nSmokers were defined as smoking 20 or more packs of cigarettes or using 336\u2009g (12 oz) of tobacco or more in a lifetime or smoking 1 or more cigarettes a day for at least 1 year. Current smokers reported cigarette use within 1 month of testing. Smoking status was considered dichotomously (current smoker vs. never/past smoker). Age and body mass index (BMI), were considered as continuous variables. 25OH vitamin D level was considered as a continuous variable and categorized as sufficient (\u2265 30\u2009ng/mL) or deficient (< 30\u2009ng/mL). Lifetime alcohol consumption and alcohol consumption after SCI were calculated based on report of average daily, weekly, or monthly quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption and duration of alcohol use before and after injury. Each glass of wine (4 oz\u2009=\u200910.8\u2009g), beer (12 oz\u2009=\u200913.2\u2009g), and shot of liquor (1.5 ounce\u2009=\u200915.1\u2009g) was converted to grams of alcohol.\n13\n,\n14\nParticipants were asked about a history of urinary infections or a pressure injury in the week prior to testing.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). T-tests or \u03c7\n2\ntests were used to compare subject characteristics as appropriate. BAFF was found to be normally distributed and therefore was not logged transformed. General linear models (PROC GLM) were applied to assess associations between clinical/demographic factors and BAFF. Factors with a\np\nvalue of <0.10 in the univariate models were included in the multivariable models. Factors with a\np\nvalue of <0.05 were considered statistically significant."

Search terms relating to traumatic brain injury were taken from a previously published living review by the CENTER-TBI group\n11\nand included exploded MESH terms for \u201cBrain Injuries\u201d or \u201cCraniocerebral Trauma\u201d or word variations of \u201c((head* or brain*) adj2 (injur* or trauma*))\u201d in the title, abstract, or keywords.\n12\nThese were combined with the following search terms relating to the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS): the exploded MESH term for \u201cGlasgow Outcome Scale\u201d; or word variations of \u201c(Glasgow Outcome Scale or extended Glasgow Outcome Scale or GOS or GOSE)\u201d or \u201c((functional or neur*) adj (status or outcome*))\u201d in the title, abstract, or key words. The search was restricted to studies on human participants. As missing data guidelines for interventional studies were published in 2010,\n5\u20137\nwe only included studies published after 2011 to allow authors sufficient time to familiarize themselves with the guidelines and apply them to their study analyses.\n\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nWe included traumatic brain injury studies where GOS\n13\nor Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE)\n14\nwas used as a longitudinal outcome measure. Although a variety of outcome measures are employed in TBI research, we were concerned that some outcome measures could be more prone to non-response than others. To reduce heterogeneity and allow for a valid comparison of missing data among the studies, we opted to only select studies with a common outcome measure. GOS/GOSE was chosen as it is the most widely used outcome measure and would thus generate the most representative sample of TBI studies.\nGOS was one of the first outcome scores to assess functional outcome following TBI and remains the most widely cited and validated score in TBI. The extended version (which includes an 8-point scale rather than a 5-point scale) was also included, with the two versions showing similar validity.\n15\nGOS is currently recommended in head injury by both the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke in the United States\n16\nand the Department of Health in the United Kingdom.\n17\nFor the same reasons we only accepted studies using the adult version of GOS/GOSE. A modified version of GOSE Peds that takes account of developmental stage exists and shows a strong association with the standard version.\n18\nTherefore, we accepted studies with a small proportion of children (<25% of patients under 16 years of age) and excluded studies that focused on pediatric TBI specifically. Studies that included non-traumatic etiologies of brain injury were also excluded.\nLongitudinal was defined as any study that recruited patients or started data collection in the acute or subacute phase (within 2 months of injury) and had a single time-point or multiple follow-up time-points at least 3 months after injury. We selected larger TBI studies with an arbitrary minimum of 100 patients, in only the English language as this language was shared by all reviewers.\nBoth interventional and observational TBI studies were included. Interventional studies were defined as involving allocation of an intervention (investigative or therapeutic) by the researcher to a study group with a comparison arm. Interventional studies included both randomized and non-randomized clinical trials (RCTs and non-RCTs) differing by the use of randomization in the process of allocation. In non-randomized clinical trials, treatment or control allocation occurs through an alternative process from randomization. In terms of observational studies, before-and-after studies and cohort studies were included. Cohorts were defined as studies observing the effect of a natural exposure on outcome using an unexposed group as a control. Both retrospective and prospective observational studies were included. Before-and-after studies were defined as studies where interventions arose naturally or unintentionally without formal assignment or allocation with the treatment effect being compared before and after its implementation.\nCase-control studies, case reports, and case series were excluded, as by definition, these study designs do not have missing outcome data. Incomplete publications such as posters, abstracts, and synopses were also excluded as detailed reporting was required for data extraction.\n\nStudy selection and data extraction\nStudy selection was done using the Covidence systematic review software.\n19\nInitial screening of abstracts and titles by one reviewer (SS or SR) excluded irrelevant articles. Eligibility of full texts was assessed by two reviewers independently (two of SR, SS, and TN).\nData extraction from full texts was performed in duplicate by two independent reviewers (two of SS, SR, and TN), using a piloted extraction form. Information was extracted on study design (interventional or observational), cohort characteristics (age and severity of TBI in terms of Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS]) and features of follow-up. Specifically, we looked at the version of GOS used, its use as a primary or secondary outcome, and the timing, frequency, and success of follow-up, defined as the proportion of missing patients. Timing of follow-up was recorded as occurring at discrete time-points or within a range of months from initial injury. Pooling GOS data across a time range is a methodological approach that itself reduces missing outcome data and was analyzed separately. When loss to follow-up was not explicitly reported in the text body, the numbers of patients missing was calculated using values quoted in the figures and tables when available. Patients who died prior to follow-up were not considered to be missing, as their outcome was known (GOS 1).\nWe identified and classified five patterns of reporting of missing outcome data:\n1.\nSufficient. Authors report complete follow-up achieved on all patients.\n2.\nSufficient. Patients lost to follow-up. Authors clearly state number of patients lost at each time-point.\n3.\nInsufficient. Patients lost to follow-up and total missing reported, but timing unclear.\n4.\nInsufficient. Patients lost to follow-up but number missing unclear.\n5.\nInsufficient. Authors do not report if patients were missing.\nPatterns 1 and 2 are described as sufficient as it is transparent how many patients were followed up or missing. Studies using pattern 1 explicitly state they have no missing outcome data. Similarly, pattern 2 studies provide sufficient information to deduce how many patients were missing at each follow-up point. The remaining three patterns reflect insufficient reporting. In pattern 3, authors follow up patients at more than one time-point. Although they report how many patients were lost overall, it is unclear at which time-point patients drop out. In pattern 4, authors state patients are lost to follow-up but not how many. Studies using pattern 5 offer no comment on the follow-up rate, nor do they provide information in figures or tables on whether patients were lost. Therefore, it is unclear whether they indeed managed to follow up all patients or failed to declare their missing data.\nIn addition to identifying the reporting pattern, we described studies in reference to populations they included. Studies that recorded the baseline characteristics of all patients initially enrolled, irrespective of successful follow-up were labeled as having an \u201cinclusive approach.\u201d Alternatively, studies that described only patients successfully followed up were considered as having an \u201cexclusive approach.\u201d\nFor studies with missing outcome data, we recorded whether authors explored or stated explicitly the assumed missingness mechanism. We considered there to be two ways of exploring missingness. First, authors could compare baseline characteristics of retained with missing patients, or alternatively, they could compare the proportion of missing data in interventional or non-interventional arms in the case of interventional studies or exposed and unexposed patients in observational studies.\nIn the event of missing data, we recorded the choice of handling technique and the use of a sensitivity analyses. Techniques for handling missing data included omission, imputation, and other advanced statistical analyses. Omission, also known as listwise deletion involves omission of missing outcome data from the analysis. Imputation refers to the substitution of the missing value with an estimate. This can be single or multiple, depending on whether the data gap is filled by one or several plausible estimates. Advanced statistical techniques use all available information in the data set to predict outcome. An example includes expectation-maximization algorithms as used in multi-level modeling. We considered the techniques in reference to the number of time-points, either single or multiple, as this has implications on the appropriate technique for use.\nOnce data extraction was complete, two reviewers (SS and SR) searched for duplicate publications on the same patient cohorts to ensure a cohort would be included only once. This was done by comparing numbers, dates, centers, and inclusion criteria for recruitment across all texts. We considered a text to be a duplicate if another article reported on the identical cohort or reported on a larger cohort that fully included the smaller cohort. For inclusion in this review we chose the text that included the larger patient cohort, or in case of identical size, was published first. If patient cohorts overlapped only partially, we treated each as a unique cohort. Disagreements at any stage were resolved through discussion and consensus with a third reviewer.\n\nAssessment of risk of bias\nTo assess the quality of research being reviewed, we performed an assessment of risk of bias. This was done in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions\n8\nusing the Cochrane risk of bias tool for clinical trials\n20\nand the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale\n21\nfor cohort studies (see\nSupplementary Appendix S1\nfor details). Briefly, the Cochrane risk of bias tool looks at seven areas in trial design and implementation with potential for the introduction of bias. The risk is assessed as high, low, or unclear. Similarly, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale assesses the quality of non-randomized studies including cohorts, in eight domains using a star system. Each domain could score \u201c1 star\u201d depending on quality, with the exception of \u201ccomparability of cohorts\u201d where 2 stars could be awarded when multiple confounders were controlled for. Two reviewers assessed risk of bias independently for each study (two of SS, SR, and TN). Disagreements were resolved through discussion and consensus with the third reviewer.\n\nData synthesis\nData were only synthesized for studies that fulfilled eligibility criteria at full-text review and were included after removing duplicate studies on the same patient cohort.\nQuantification of missing data was done in two steps, depending on whether studies used an inclusive or exclusive approach. The first step was to calculate how many patients were initially enrolled in each study. The second step involved calculating the number of patients whose outcome was missing, that is, patients who were recruited to the study but lacked an outcome.\nAuthors of studies using the inclusive approach reported the baseline data on the number of patients enrolled in their study, irrespective of follow-up. Subsequently, they described the number of patients at each follow-up time-point. This could be either the same number in the case of complete follow-up, or a reduced number due to dropout. The percentage of patients missing was calculated as per Equation 1:\nOpen in a separate window\nStudies with the exclusive approach, however, provided baseline data only on the number of patients successfully followed up. If they also described the number of patients excluded because of lack of follow-up, this number was added to the number of patients described and the percentage of missing data calculated as per Equation 2:\nOpen in a separate window\nIf studies only reported how many patients were successfully followed up but did not say how many patients were excluded due to loss to follow-up, then the original number of patients enrolled in the study could not be calculated.\nIf studies using the exclusive approach had only contacted patients at a single time-point, then we knew that all loss to follow-up had occurred at that time-point. If studies excluded patients due to loss to follow-up and had tried to contact patients at multiple time-points, the first of which was hospital discharge, we assumed that loss to follow-up had occurred at the second time-point.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData were analysed in R version 3.5.0.\n22\nFisher's exact test was used to compare categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney U test was used for continuous variables. We compared values between interventional and observational studies and stated any statistically significant results. In total, seven variables were compared between observational and interventional studies, and again between RCTs and non-RCTs, yielding 14 comparisons. For more robust conclusions, a\np\n-value threshold of 0.005 was chosen.\n23\nFifteen (7.7%) of the 195 studies did not report on the quantity of missing outcome. When comparing these with the 180 studies that did report the proportion of patients missing, no difference was found in the proportion of interventional versus observational studies (\np\n=\u20091.00), retrospective versus prospective studies (\np\n=\u20091.00), studies involving pediatric patients (\np\n=\u20090.781), studies using GOS as a primary versus secondary outcome (\np\n=\u20091.00), the severity profile of patients (\np\n=\u20091.00), and the study size as judged by the number of patients successfully followed up (\np\n=\u20090.677). Formal comparison of these studies with and without reporting, using Little's MCAR test\n24\n(from R package \u201cBaylorEdPsych\u201d version 0.5), showed that the MCAR assumption was not rejected (\u03c7\n2\n4.6,\np\n=\u20090.47). Thus, we simply omitted the 15 studies from graphical representations relating to the percentage of missing data.\nMulti-level modeling of follow-up rates was performed in R using package \u201clme4\u201d version 1.1\u201318-1, with \u201cTime\u201d as a fixed effect. Studies that pooled GOS across a time range rather than discrete time-points, and studies that did not report the follow-up rate were excluded. Thus, a total of 156 studies with 368 follow-up time-points were included. To account for within-study correlation of follow-up rates over time, \u201cStudy ID\u201d was used as a random effect to allow for study specific intercepts and slopes."

    "Methods": "The experimental model\nThe experimental model was to expose mice to three consecutive days of mild blast TBI (one blast injury per day) or sham treatment. On the fourth day (one day after the last TBI), subset A mice were sacrificed and analyzed for patch clamp recording. Subset B mice were implanted with electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes on the fourth day (one day after the last TBI) and were video-EEG monitored for seizures for 72\u2009h (day 5\u20137 post-TBI). Some of these mice were also monitored at monthly intervals for spontaneous seizures. Subset C mice were sacrificed seven days post-TBI for Western blot analysis and immunostaining, as described below.\n\nAnimals\nMale adult (10 weeks old) C57BL/6J mice were group-housed in a 12-h light-dark cycle with food and water\nad libitum\n. For experiments, animals were divided between treatments so that each cage would include animals from all cohorts. During the collection of data, the experimenter was blinded to the animal's treatment. All experiments were undertaken in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Texas Health San Antonio (UT Health SA) and were in compliance with the National Institutes of Health\nGuide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\n.\n\nBlast injury model\nA blast tube apparatus was used that has been described previously.\n17\u201319\nThe air-driven shock tube (Applied Research Associates, Littleton, CO) was a 17-inch inner diameter tube with a 24-inch driver, an 8-foot long driven section, and a 4-foot expansion cone with a 7.5-degree angle of expansion. The diameter at the opening is \u223c36 inches. The shock tube was pressurized using a single 0.016-inch thick aluminum membrane of alloy AL-2200 scored once with a 5-lb weight. Pencil probe gauges (PCB Piezotronics, Depew, NY) were used as a reference sensor to monitor the peak incident overpressure of the blast wave during each blast exposure to mice.\nThe shock tube produces pressure waves having the characteristic \u201cFriedlander\u201d waveform, with peaking pressures and total energy that are characteristic of a free-field blast wave.\n20\nThe average maximum peak incident overpressure was 14.6\u2009psi\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5 (standard deviation [SD]) with a positive phase of approximately 2.82\u2009\u00b1\u20090.46 milliseconds.\nThe mice were 10 week old C57BL/6J (Jackson Labs) mice. Mice were anesthetized using ketamine (25\u201375\u2009mg/kg) and dexmedetomidine (0.25\u2009mg/kg). For the majority of the study, experimental mice underwent three blast exposures over three days, directed head-on in an apparatus that protected the mice from exposure to their torso to prevent confounding blast lung injuries. Control (sham) mice were anesthetized and placed in the shock tube without firing. Mice were monitored to ensure sufficient time for anesthesia to take full effect before the blast wave. During this time and only on the first day of the blast exposure, mice were given a subcutaneous injection of buprenorphine SR, 1.2\u2009mg/kg, in the intrascapular region.\nMice were transported to the blast section and placed in a custom built nine compartment blast holder. Once the animals were safely secured in each compartment, the holder was inserted into the expansion cone of the blast tube with the animals facing directly into the shockwave. Sham groups were placed in the same holder but received no blast exposure. The sham groups remained in the holder for the same amount of time as the blast-treated groups.\nAfterward, the mice were given a single subcutaneous injection of atipamezole, 1\u2009mg/kg, for anesthesia reversal. Mice were placed into their recovery and warming chamber until they gained full alertness and mobility. Mice were monitored for pain and distress twice daily. Mice were transported back to UT Health SA after the final blast. In this and other studies using blast trauma, we found three deaths out of 235 mice (1.2%). The day after the last blast trauma, mice were implanted with EEG electrodes as discussed below. During surgery, it was apparent that there was no obvious bleeding or trauma to the skull.\n\nEEG\nTo quantify the occurrence of seizures and study cortical activity, mice were implanted with EEG) electrodes 24\u2009h after the last blast TBI. A tethered EEG system was used. It had a pre-fabricated head mount containing screw electrodes (Pinnacle Technologies) including a ground screw (left frontal), and a reference screw electrode (left parietal) for right frontal (RF, channel 1) and the right parietal (RP, channel 2) electrodes. In addition, a bipolar subcutaneous electrode in the medial parietal region (MP, channel 3) was recorded on a third channel. The position of each electrode (\nFig. 1A\n), and their connections (\nFig. 1B\n) are shown in\nFigure 1\n. The head mount and electrodes were further secured to the skull with dental cement (Lang Dental).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\n(\nA\n) Dorsal view of mouse brain showing positions of electrode placement. Parentheses indicate absolute position in millimeters relative to medial and bregma (X,Y). The ground electrode (GND) was placed in the left frontal lobe. A reference electrode (REF, in left parietal region) served to record from right frontal (RF) and right parietal (RP) regions. Two electrodes in the medial parietal (MPa and MPb) region served as a bipolar electrode. (\nB\n) Recording electrode pairs are indicated by a dashed blue line. (\nC\n) Diagram of action potential parameters measured from a 200\u2009pA constant current injection added to a \u221280\u2009mV holding current. A description of these parameters are detailed in Methods.\nDuring video-EEG recordings, the head mount was connected to a pre-amplifier (Gain 25X; Pinnacle Technologies), which in turn was connected via a commutator to extracellular amplifiers of the Stellate Harmonie acquisition hardware. The system collected coincident video images of the animals with EEG activity. The EEG records were scored using 0.1 to 45\u2009Hz bandpass filter, and also included a 60\u2009Hz notch noise filter. Seizures\n21\u201323\nwere identified visually by the investigator who was blinded to treatments and also by the computer-assisted EEG Stellate Harmonie review software. Post-trauma video/EEG monitoring (\nn\n=\u200924 blast,\nn\n=\u20097 sham) was of 72\u2009h (beginning at day 2 after the last injury). Motor seizures were scored using coincident video recordings. A cohort of mice receiving 3X blast TBI (\nn\n=\u200913) and sham controls (\nn\n=\u20097) was monitored continuously for seizures at monthly intervals for 48\u201372\u2009h periods.\n\nWhole-cell current-clamp recordings\nMice were anesthetized deeply with inhaled isoflurane (Baxter Healthcare Corporation) before decapitation and whole brain dissection. The brain was placed quickly into ice-cold cutting solution containing (in mM) 2 KCl, 2 MgSO\n4\n, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 1 CaCl\n2\n, 1 MgCl\n2\n, 26 NaHCO\n3\n, 206 sucrose, 10 dextrose, and 0.4 vitamin C. The brain was mounted on a cutting platform where coronal brain sections were cut in a Leica vibratome at a thickness of 300\u2009\u03bcm.\nThe brain slices were then allowed to recover in extracellular solution at 30\u00b0C for 1\u2009h, and then maintained at room temperature until recording. The extracellular solution consisted of (in mM) 124 NaCl, 2 KCl, 2 MgSO\n4\n, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 2 CaCl\n2\n, 26 NaHCO\n3\n, 10 dextrose, and 0.4 vitamin C. All solutions were bubbled continuously with a mixture of 95%/5% oxygen/carbon dioxide. Intracellular solutions consisted of (in mM) 120 K-gluconate, 10 HEPES, 0.1 EGTA, 20 KCl, 2 MgCl\n2\n, 2 Na\n2\nATP, 0.25 Na\n2\nGTP, pH adjusted to 7.4 with potassium hydroxide.\nDentate gyrus granule neurons from the central region of the granule cell layer were targeted for patch clamp electrophysiology. Cells were held with a holding current to maintain a resting voltage of \u221280\u2009mV. Hyperpolarizing input resistance and cell capacitance were measured using a \u221220\u2009pA current injection step below the holding current. Input resistance (R) was measured from the steady-state voltage change (\u0394V) because of the \u221220\u2009pA current injection (R\u2009=\u2009\u0394V/20\u2009pA). Capacitance (C) was determined from an exponential fit of the hyperpolarizing relaxation time (\u03c4) divided by the input resistance (C\u2009=\u2009\u03c4/R). Voltage traces were collected using a HEKA EPC10 amplifier and Patchmaster software (HEKA Instruments). During whole-cell current clamp, cells receive both the \u221280\u2009mV holding current and additional stepwise increases of 20\u2009pA steps (lasting 500\u2009msec) with 10\u2009sec pauses between steps (\nFig. 1C\n).\nThe individual properties of action potential (AP) waveforms (illustrated in\nFig. 1C\n) were analyzed using AxoGraph software (Kagi, Berkeley, CA). The APs were detected with a derivative threshold of 20\u2009mV/msec. Latency was measured as the time from initiation of current injection to the AP threshold. The AP height was measured from threshold to peak voltage. The AP width was measured at 50% or 10% of the AP peak. Fast-afterhyperpolarization amplitude (fAHP) was measured as the maximum negative peak after an AP (always occurring less than 2\u2009msec after the spike) minus the threshold of AP initiation.\nParameters of AP properties (latency, threshold, height, width, and fAHP) are measured from the first AP during a 200\u2009pA (above holding potential) current injection, and the number of APs evoked was obtained during a 200\u2009pA, 500\u2009msec current injection (AP number). Post-synaptic currents were filtered at 2\u2009kHz frequency and measured at a holding potential of \u221280\u2009mV.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nImmunohistochemistry was performed to detect glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionized Ca\n2+\nbinding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1), markers of astrocyte and microglia activation, respectively. Seven days after the last blast, mice were euthanized via transcardial perfusion with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) only. Brains were removed, one-half hemisphere of each sample was fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences), transferred into 30% (w/v) sucrose, and kept at 4\u00b0C for three days. Brains were then embedded into histology molds (TedPella) filled with Tissue-Plus O.C.T. compound (Fisher Scientific), rapidly frozen with 2-methylbutane immersed in liquid N\n2\n, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until cryosectioning.\nThen 30-micron thick sagittal sections were prepared using an HM 505E Cryostat (MICROM International), mounted on previously gelatin (Sigma) coated Superfrost Plus Microscope Slides (Fisher Scientific), and dried overnight. Sagittal brain sections from the anatomical region that is approximately 2\u2009mm lateral to midline from each mouse brain were selected. Briefly, sections were rehydrated with PBS and their immunoreactivity was enhanced via heat induced antigen retrieval using DIVA decloaker (Biocare Medical). Slides were then washed with PBS twice for 5\u2009min and dipped into 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for another 10\u2009min.\nAfter two more PBS washes, sections were blocked with 5% (v/v) Bovine Serum Albumin (Sigma) for 1\u2009h at room temperature (RT), excess blocking solution removed, and slices incubated with primary antibodies (1:1000 GFAP, Abcam ab53554; 1:500 Iba1, Wako Cat# 019-19741) at 4\u00b0C for 20\u2009h. The following day, sections were washed with PBS 5X for 15\u2009min/each and incubated in secondary antibodies (1:200 Thermo Fisher Lot# 1640316 Donkey anti-Goat Alexa Fluor 568; 1:200 Thermo Fisher Lot# 1796684 Chicken anti-Rabbit Alexa Fluor 488) for 1\u2009h at RT. Sections were then washed 3X for 5\u2009min/each, and further incubated in DAPI (Sigma) for 10\u2009min. After a brief wash in distilled H\n2\nO, brain sections were mounted with Vectashield antifade mounting medium (Vector Laboratories).\nAll slides were imaged 24\u2009h after the staining. Images were acquired at 40X magnification (NA 1.3) using a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope in the Core Optical Imaging Facility at UT Health SA. Fluorescence settings and parameters were held constant for all sections. The Z stacks at 1\u2009\u03bcm intervals were processed using ImageJ (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health). The mean fluorescence intensity analysis was performed using custom macros in ImageJ. In brief, the Z stacked images were combined using maximum intensity projection. The background fluorescence was removed by first masking the cells using the ImageJ plug-in, stack-based spots from ICBM (Indiana Center for Biological Microscopy). The mean gray values were calculated and used for the analysis.\n\nImmunoblotting\nFor immunoblotting, brain samples were collected seven days after the last blast and were snap frozen in dry ice. To collect segregated rostral, middle, and caudal tissue samples, olfactory bulbs and cerebellum were removed, and the brain was placed in a brain matrix (Kent Scientific). A razor blade was used to cut the first 3\u2009mm section (rostral), the second 3\u2009mm section (middle), and the last section that was generally 2.6\u20133\u2009mm (caudal) (\nFig. 2A\n). Samples were homogenized on ice in a solution of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific \u2013 89901), protease inhibitor tablet (Roche \u2013 05892988001), phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 2 (Sigma \u2013 P5726), and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 3 (Sigma \u2013 P0044), using an Ultra EZgrind tissue homogenizer (Denville Scientific Inc.) at the lowest speed.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\n(\nA\n) Diagram indicating regions of the brain analyzed for Western blot detection. The brain sections included 3\u2009mm rostral, middle, and caudal portions.

The\np\nvalues are indicated in bar graphs.\nThe protein concentration of each sample was determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific \u2013 23225). After reduction and denaturation of proteins, samples (25\u2009\u03bcg of total protein) were run in 4\u201320% precast polyacrylamide gel (Bio-rad \u2013 4561096) at 130\u2009V for \u223c1\u2009h. Proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-rad \u2013 10484060) at 100V for 1\u2009h. Membranes were stained with specific antibodies for semi-quantification of GFAP (1:500, Abcam), tau (1:1500, Millipore), p-Tau (S202) (1:100, CP13 provided by Dr. Peter Davis from Albert Einstein Institute), and p-Tau (S396/S404) (1:200, PHF-1 provided by Dr. Peter Davis from Albert Einstein Institute).\nImmunoblots bands were revealed via chemiluminescent reaction between horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and either ECL Western blotting detection reagents (GE healthcare) or Western Lightning Plus-ECL reagents (PerkinElmer). Quantification of bands was performed after exposure in the linear range using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). For normalization, the results of every protein of interest were divided by the results of the housekeeping protein \u03b2-actin (1:20,000, Sigma) or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (1:25,000, Abcam). The results are presented as group averages and standard error of the mean (SEM) and are standardized to sham averages.\n\nSpleen to body weight ratio and cytokine measurements\nSpleens were dissected immediately after transcardial perfusion with PBS and weighed. Spleen to body weight ratio (relative weight) was calculated based on wet spleen weight and animal's average body weight. For cytokine assessment, a separate cohort of mice was used. Spleens were frozen in dry ice and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. The day of the experiment, frozen tissues were thawed briefly, homogenized, centrifuged (14,000\u2009rpm, 4\u00b0C, 5\u2009min), and 5\u2009\u03bcg of total protein (25\u2009\u03bcL per each well) was loaded into a 96 well PCR plate for analysis. Cytokines (IL1\u03b1, IL1\u03b2, IL4, IL6, IL10, IP10) were determined using the Luminex bead-based Multiplex immunoassay (EMD Millipore) following the manufacturer's directions (Mouse Cytokine/Chemokine Magnetic Bead Panel 96-Well Plate Assay, Cat. # MCYTOMAG-70K).\n\nStatistical analysis\nFor statistical analysis, IBM SPSS software (version 23.0) was used. Data were checked for normal distribution by Q-Q plot analysis and Shapiro-Wilk normality test. For most samples, differences between blast versus sham were determined using unpaired, two-tailed, Student\nt\ntest. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare significant differences in Western blots (\nFigs. 2\nand\n\u200b\nand3)\n3\n) comparing rostral, medial, and caudal tissues.

    "Methods": "Study design\nThe background, hypotheses, method, and primary analytic procedures of the EPO Severe TBI trial along with results and their interpretation can be found in the article by Robertson and colleagues.\n36\nIn summary, individuals with a CHI admitted to two Level 1 trauma centers were enrolled if they did not follow commands post-resuscitation and also could be enrolled within 6\u2009h of injury. Those with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3 and fixed dilated pupils, penetrating head injury, life-threatening systemic injuries defined as an Abbreviated Injury Score >4 in any organ system other than head, and pregnancy were excluded. Enrolled patients were randomized to one of two hemoglobin levels for triggering a transfusion (7\u2009g/dL or 10\u2009g/dL). Detailed demographic and injury characteristics of the 200 patients in the study are given in\nTable 1\nin the article by Robertson and colleagues.\n36\nIndividuals with severe polytrauma and with spinal cord injury were excluded from the study. Of the 181individuals with acquired 6-month outcomes, 142 (78%) were assessed within the window of 184\u2009\u00b1\u200914 days.\n\nMaterials\nA form for the uGOS\n8\nranked patients on a scale of 1 (D) to 5 (GR). The structured interview forms for the GOS and the GOS-E were taken from Wilson and associates\n11\nand translated into Spanish. All descriptions and questions in the GOS and GOS-E were translated by several Spanish-speaking individuals (including a physician and technicians) from several Hispanic cultures. The translations were then reviewed by the team until team members were satisfied. No formal validation was conducted for the Spanish translations, although the assessments were done by people who were fluent in both Spanish and English. The effects of systemic injuries on disability were not considered separately from the effects of the brain injury in assigning the uGOS, GOS, and GOS-E scores.\n\nTraining and quality control\nA clinical neuropsychologist (HJH) and trained staff conducted the outcome assessments blinded to study randomization groups. All the neuropsychology personnel with the exception of the clinical neuropsychologist (HJH) were fully bilingual in English and Spanish in terms of reading, writing, and speaking because of the high proportion of Spanish speakers in the TBI population in Houston, Texas, where the trial was conducted (50% in this trial). If Spanish was used for the interactions with any person involved in the research, answers were recorded as they were given in Spanish so that any regional or national variations in the meaning of a word or phrase could be established afterward and appropriate translations made. All examiners had BA or BS degrees from a university and were trained over several months by HJH and other personnel experienced in interviewing individuals with TBI, family members, and significant others. Training included going over the interview materials and related articles, observation of interviews by other examiners and HJH, and then supervision of their interviews initially.\nInformation for these measures was determined either in-person in a variety of settings (e.g., intensive care, step-down, and other floor units of various facilities as well as neuropsychology offices and places of residence) or over the telephone. Two individuals usually made visits to other facilities and any residences. Information was obtained from the patient, next of kin, significant others and/or caretakers, and medical personnel as needed or possible. Also, information was occasionally obtained from records of facilities and practices once appropriate signed release of confidential information had been obtained. Neuropsychology personnel collected additional information based on discussion and also regular quality control meetings that always included HJH. The same trained individual collected data for all GOS measures on a particular participant. The same ordering was used for all subjects: uGOS, then GOS, then GOS-E. This ordering initially focused on allocation to a uGOS and then GOS category, and then involved limited GOS-E-specific questioning to further determine the GOS-E category.\n\nData analysis\nRelationships among category assignments on the uGOS, GOS, and the GOS-E\nCross-tabulations between the uGOS versus GOS, the uGOS versus GOSE, and the GOS versus GOS-E assignments 6 months post-injury were calculated to determine the percentage of discrepancies between assignments. Pairwise cross-tabulations also allowed us to discover whether there was a pattern of one outcome measure systematically giving a better or worse outcome score compared with another outcome measure. Possible symptoms related to the modifications in the GOS and GOS-E that might have led to some of these discrepancies are described. Cohen's kappa statistic\n37\nand weighted kappa\n38\nwere used to assess agreement between outcomes. The weighted kappa gives less penalty to categories that were close to each other.\n\nStatistical analysis\nTo assess any differences in the transfusion threshold effect on outcomes, we used an overall statistical approach similar to that reported in the primary article,\n36\nwhich included an intent-to-treat principle with multiple imputation of missing values and a complete case analysis. The following specific analysis methods were used for each outcome: unadjusted and adjusted binary and ordinal logistic regression, and a sliding dichotomy. Multiple imputation of missing 6-month uGOS, GOS, and GOS-E data was completed as outlined in the article by Robertson and colleagues.\n36\nBinary logistic regression was conducted to analyze efficacy of transfusion threshold on 6-month recovery status with pre-specified outcome dichotomization into poor (1, 2, 3) and good outcome (4, 5) for the uGOS and GOS scores, whereas GOS-E scores were dichotomized between upper SD (1\u20134) and lower MD (5\u20138). Ordinal logistic regression was also conducted with no dichotomization of the uGOS, GOS, or GOS-E scores. Adjustments were made for pre-specified covariates of injury severity including the Injury Severity Score (ISS) and the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials (IMPACT) score\n39\ngiven for the core + CT + laboratory probability model. An additional covariate, presence of epidural hematoma, was also included in the adjusted model because this variable was found to be imbalanced between the transfusion threshold groups at baseline.\nThe sliding dichotomy method was used to take the baseline prognostic score into account to increase the statistical power as to whether a participant improved or not. We chose to use the IMPACT score as the baseline prognostic score.\n39\nThe data were split into baseline prognostic risk using tertile thresholds of the IMPACT score for all subjects in the study. The distribution of uGOS, GOS,or GOS-E scores within each tertile was tabulated for the two TT groups in separate analyses. For each prognostic band, the dichotomy was chosen so that, for the pooled data, the split was as close as possible to having half of the subjects below and half above the split. Pearson's \u03c7\n2\ntest with Yates' continuity correction was conducted for the difference in the proportion with good recovery between the groups, where each subject's good recovery category was dependent on the sliding dichotomy.\nStatistical significance was determined by a two-sided\np\n-value of <0.05. Due to the exploratory nature of these analyses, no adjustment was done for multiplicity. Significant\np\n-values should be interpreted with caution. All analyses were conducted using R version 2.13.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nWe purchased 12-week-old C57BL/6 male mice from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and housed them in standard cages under a 12-h light/12-h dark schedule at ambient temperature. All procedures were performed in accordance with Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare guidelines under a protocol approved by the Roskamp Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were randomly assigned to four groups: control, stress, r-mTBI, or stress+r-mTBI (\nn\n=\u200915 per group).\n\nThe 21-day repeated unpredictable stress and repetitive mild traumatic brain injury paradigm\nOur RUS paradigm was implemented as described previously\n13\nand as depicted in\nFigure 1\n. In brief, 12-week-old mice received 21 days of RUS involving the following: 1) unstable social housing with a different mouse every day; 2) 30\u2009min of unpredictable exposure to a predator odor (TMT) under restraint on 10 different days; and 3) five inescapable footshocks. Animals assigned to the stress+r-mTBI group received a mild traumatic brain injury 1\u2009h after exposure to each footshock in addition to the RUS paradigm, while animals in the r-mTBI group received the five mTBIs only without any footshocks. The 1-h delay was introduced to allow for consolidation of fear memory.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nStudy timeline and experimental procedures for the stress paradigm. Twelve week old mice were exposed to the repeated unpredictable stress (RUS) paradigm at 3 months and at 6 months of age. The stress paradigm involved 21 days of daily unstable social housing (i), unpredictable repetitive exposures to predator odor (Fox urine component, TMT), while under restraint for 30 mins (ii), and five repeated inescapable footshocks (iii). Animals receiving repeated mild traumatic brain injury (r-mTBI) in addition to stress (Stress+r-mTBI group) were exposed to (iv) five closed-head injuries 1\u2009h after exposure to inescapable footshock, for a total of five mTBIs. Closed-head injuries were conducted using our previously established model involving a 1-mm depth impact to the closed skull using a 5-mm flat tip electromagnetic impactor at a velocity of 5\u2009m/sec with a dwell time of 200\u2009msec. All animals in the stress groups were socially isolated (single housing) after RUS until the end of the study (v). A battery of behavioral testing was conducted at an acute time-point (Days 133\u2013151) and again at 3 months after the second RUS (Days 224\u2013241). Brain tissue and plasma were collected at the acute time-point (Day 142) and at the 3-month time-point (Day 247). Color image is available online.\nClosed-head injuries were conducted using our previously established model involving a 1-mm depth impact delivered to the closed skull using a 5-mm flat tip electromagnetic stereotaxic impactor (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) at a velocity of 5\u2009m/sec with a dwell time of 200\u2009msec.\n12\nMice were anesthetized using 1.5\u2009L/min of oxygen and 3% isoflurane and maintained under anesthesia through a nose cone throughout the injury procedure. Footshocks and head injuries were administered at 48- to 72-h intervals to replicate our previous characterization of the r-mTBI model. Control and r-mTBI\u2013only animals were exposed to the fear-conditioning chamber for the same frequency and duration as the stressed mice, without administration of footshocks or auditory cues, and were never restrained or exposed to TMT. Stress-only and control animals received sham anesthesia (3\u2009min) 1\u2009h after the footshock or contextual habituation, respectively. The same procedures were repeated 3 months after the first RUS (i.e., when animals were 27 weeks old). Animals in the stress and stress+r-mTBI groups were housed individually after the RUS procedure, whereas animals in the control and r-mTBI groups were housed in groups of 2\u20133 mice throughout the study.\nA subset of animals from each group (\nn\n=\u20094\u20135 per group) were euthanized at the acute time-point (Day 142 of the study timeline) for molecular studies. To increase the number of animals in the anxiety tests, these animals received the Open Field test and the Elevated Plus Maze only once at the acute time-points with no additional testing. The remaining animals (\nn\n=\u20099\u201311 per group) received a behavioral testing battery beginning at Day 1 after the second RUS (Day 132 of the study timeline) and then were retested using a similar battery at 3 months after the second RUS. The exact timeline of the behavioral test batteries is shown in\nSupplementary Figure S1\n. All animals undergoing the full behavioral testing battery (\nn\n=\u20099\u201311 per group) were euthanized 1 week after the last behavioral experiment for molecular studies (around 3 months after the second RUS).\n\nBody weight\nMice were weighed in the light cycle before receiving any stress or r-TBI manipulations in that particular day. Baseline body weights (at least the average of two independent measurements) were measured before the start of each RUS exposure. The percentage change in body weight was then calculated relative to each animal's baseline. One animal from the stress-only group and one animal from the stress+r-mTBI group died during the restraint procedures of the second RUS and were excluded from the analysis.\n\nTMT\nTMT was purchased from SRQBio (Sarasota, FL) and diluted 1:10 (v/v) in double distilled water before use. A total of 50\u2009\u03bcL of 10% TMT was dispensed on a tissue paper next to the head of the restrained animal.\n\nFear conditioning and contextual and cued fear testing\nFear conditioning was performed with five total footshocks, administered on Days 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 of the RUS paradigm. Animals were placed in a shuttle box chamber for 3\u2009min with a pure tone (70 dB, 2.9\u2009kHz) introduced during the last 30\u2009sec. At the end of the auditory cue, animals received a single uncontrollable/inescapable footshock at 1\u2009mA for 4\u2009sec and were left for 1 additional min in the same context before returning to their home cages. Mice in the control group were placed in the same fear-conditioning context for 3\u2009min without introducing a tone or delivering an electric shock. To determine retention of contextual/cued fear memory, animals were tested at the acute time-point, and at 3 months after the second RUS. This involved placing animals in the fear-conditioning spatial context for 3\u2009min and measuring the freezing response using an automated video tracking system (Ethovision; Noldus, the Netherlands). A cued fear memory test was conducted approximately 1\u2009h after the contextual fear memory test. Animals were placed in a novel context for 3\u2009min in the absence of any cues followed by 3\u2009min with the tone turned on. Freezing response was measured throughout the entire 6\u2009min period by Ethovision Software using the optimized immobility parameter (5% immobility threshold, 20 frames per sec) as previously described.\n14\n\nOpen Field test\nAll animals were acclimated to the testing room for at least 1\u2009h before the test procedures. Animals were placed in the center of a circular maze (120\u2009cm diameter) and left to explore it for 15\u2009min. The time spent in a predefined center zone and the number of entries into the center zone were used to examine anxiety. The testing room was lit at 80 lux (dim light).\n\nElevated Plus Maze (EPM)\nThe maze is comprised of two open and two closed arms (elevated 70\u2009cm from the floor) forming a plus shape. Each mouse was placed in the middle of the maze facing an open arm and allowed to freely explore it for 5\u2009min in a darkly lit room (\u223c1 lux). The number of entries into the open arms and the total time spent in the open arms were calculated using Ethovision video tracking system to evaluate anxiety. Animals were retested in the same room at 3 months after the second RUS.\n\nForced Swim Test (FST)\nThe test was performed in a cylindrical container (20\u2009cm height\u2009\u00d7\u200920\u2009cm diameter) filled with water at room temperature. Animals were gently placed in the middle of the container and allowed to swim for 6\u2009min. The time spent floating (not swimming nor climbing) was calculated using the Ethovision immobility parameter (7.5% immobility threshold, 20 frames per sec) as a measure of passive stress coping behavior.\n\nRadial Arm Water Maze (RAWM)\nSpatial learning and memory were assessed using the RAWM test as described previously.\n15\nIn brief, the maze consists of a circular water pool (120\u2009cm diameter and 30\u201340\u2009cm height), containing six swim tracks (arms) extending from an open central arena. Each arm was marked with a unique visual cue, with only one target arm containing a hidden escape platform at the end of it. Animals were trained for 12 trials per day over 5 days to locate the hidden goal arm. Each trial lasted for 60\u2009sec. Memory errors were recorded for each entry to a wrong arm. An Ethovision video-tracking system was used to record the number of errors per trial. All animals were subjected to the test for 5 days at the acute time-point as depicted in\nSupplementary Figure S1\n. The test was repeated for 5 more training days using the same maze and visual cues at 3 months after initial training.\n\nSocial interaction and novelty recognition tests (three-chamber test)\nThe testing apparatus consists of a rectangular box with three chambers separated by two doors. Each of the outer chambers contains a cage enclosure. The mice were habituated to the testing box for 5\u2009min prior to testing. Testing occurred in two sessions. In the first session, an intruder mouse (Stranger1) was placed in one cage, while the cage in the other chamber was left empty. The tested mouse was placed in the middle chamber and was allowed to explore the three chambers for 10\u2009min. The time spent in the chamber containing Stranger1 versus the chamber with the empty cage was calculated to evaluate social interaction of the test subject. In the second session, a novel intruder mouse (Stranger2) was placed in the second cage while the more familiar intruder mouse (Stranger1) remained in the first cage, and the test subject was allowed to freely explore all three chambers for 10\u2009min. The time spent in the chamber with Stranger2 versus the chamber with Stranger1 was used to evaluate the social memory of the tested animal.\n\nBlood collection and\nex vivo\nlipopolysaccharide stimulation of whole blood\nTo obtain blood samples, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane, and approximately 500\u2009\u03bcL of blood were collected into heparin tubes by cardiac puncture immediately prior to euthanasia. A total of 400\u2009\u03bcL of blood from each animal were kept aside for the\nex vivo\nlipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation studies. The remaining blood was centrifuged at 3000\u2009g for 3\u2009min, and plasma samples (clear supernatant fraction) were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. For the\nex vivo\nLPS challenge, 400\u2009\u03bcL blood samples from each animal were divided into two 200\u2009\u03bcL samples and incubated with either Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI; 1% glutamine, 1% pyruvate, 1% garamycin) or RPMI containing 1\u2009\u03bcg/mL LPS at 37\u00b0C for 6\u2009h. All blood samples were then centrifuged for 3\u2009min at 3000\u2009g for plasma collection.\n\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and multiplex ELISA\nCommercially available ELISA kits were used to measure the concentration of several plasma markers: the neuropeptide Y (NPY) and cortisol ELISA kits were purchased from Life-Span Biosciences (Seattle, WA), the norepinephrine ELISA kit was purchased from Eagle Biosciences (Amherst, NH), and the corticosterone ELISA kit was purchased from Arbor Assays (Ann Arbor, MI). Tissue brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were measured using an ELISA from Boster Bio (Pleasanton, CA). All ELISA kits were used as per manufacturers' instructions. Brain and plasma cytokine levels were measured using the MSD proinflammatory Panel I for the following cytokines: interferon \u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1; MesoScale Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD). A single plasma sample (12.5\u2009\u03bcL) from each mouse was used for the detection of plasma cytokines, while 25\u2009\u03bcL of hippocampal homogenate in M-PER protein extraction reagent (\u223c8\u2009mg/mL total protein) was used for the measurements of hippocampal cytokine levels.\n\nBrain tissue preparation and Western blotting\nBrains from 4\u20136 animals per group were used for biochemical analysis while the brains from the remaining animals were used for immunohistochemical experiments. Western blot experiments were conducted as described previously.\n16\nIn brief, following transcardial perfusion by gravity drip with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), brain tissue was collected, and the hippocampus and hypothalamus were dissected and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and kept at \u221280\u00b0C. For Western blotting analyses, the hypothalamus or hippocampi from both hemispheres were homogenized in 200\u2009\u03bcL of M-PER protein extraction reagent containing proteinase and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermofisher) using a probe sonicator. Samples were sonicated with a 2-sec pulse followed by incubation on ice for 10\u2009sec, and this process was repeated three times. Homogenized samples were centrifuged at 15,000\u2009g for 10\u2009min followed by collection of the supernatants. Diluted supernatant fractions (2\u2009mg/mL total protein) were then mixed with Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad) containing DDT and denatured by boiling at 99\u00b0C. Samples were subsequently resolved on 4% to 15% gradient polyacrylamide criterion gels (Bio-Rad). After electrotransferring to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, membranes were blocked in 5% milk made in Tris-buffered saline (TBST) and subsequently incubated with different primary antibodies overnight (\nSupplementary Table S1\n). After three washing steps using TBST, membranes were probed with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (\nSupplementary Table S1\n). Signal intensity ratios were quantified by chemiluminescence imaging with the ChemiDocTM XRS (Bio-Rad) with Anti-GAPDH antibody used as a housekeeping protein.\n\nGolgi-Cox staining and immunohistochemistry\nA total of 5\u20136 animals per group were used in Golgi-Cox staining and immunohistochemistry experiments. At 3 months after the second RUS exposure, mice were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane and transcardially perfused with PBS solution. Right brain hemispheres were extracted and immediately processed according to FD Rapid Golgi stain Kit instructions (FD NeuroTechnologies, Baltimore, MD), while the other hemispheres (left side) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24\u201348\u2009h followed by embedding in paraffin for subsequent immunohistochemistry (IHC) experiments.\nFor the Golgi experiments, 100\u2009\u03bcm sections of impregnated tissue were cut using a cryostat at \u221220\u00b0C, mounted onto positively charged glass slides (Fisher, Superfrost Plus, Pittsburgh, PA) and analyzed using an Olympus BX63 upright microscope at 100\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification. The following three criteria were met by a dendrite to be chosen for spine density analysis: 1) it had to be emerging either from an apical neuron in the hippocampal CA1 region or layer II/III in the frontal cortex; 2) the neuron had to be fully stained, including the cell body with no cuts in the axons; and 3) the origin of the dendrite should not be obscured by any nearby overlapping neurons.\nFor IHC experiments, a series of 6-\u03bcm thick sagittal sections were cut throughout the extent of the cortex and hippocampus guided by known bregma coordinates using a microtome (2030 Biocut; Reichert/Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL). Cut sections were mounted onto positively charged glass slides (Superfrost Plus; Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA). Before the IHC procedure, all sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in a gradient of ethanol solutions of decreasing concentrations. Sections were then rinsed in distilled water and subsequently incubated at room temperature in a solution of hydrogen peroxide (3% in water) for 15\u2009min to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Antigen retrieval was necessary for ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) staining and included treatment with boiling citrate buffer solution (pH 6) for 8\u2009min in the microwave. Following antigen retrieval, sections were blocked for 30\u2009min to 1\u2009h in normal blocking serum, using the same serum in which the secondary antibody was raised. Next, sections were immunostained in batches with primary antibodies diluted in supersensitive wash buffer (BioGenex, Fremont, CA). The primary antibodies used are listed in\nSupplementary Table S2\n.\nAfter overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C, sections were washed in PBS, then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (Vectastain Elite ABC Kit; Vector Laboratories) at room temperature for 30\u2009min to 1\u2009h, depending on the specific requirement of the antibody protocol. After rinsing in water, sections were incubated with avidin-biotin horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase enzyme solution (Vector Laboratories) for 30\u2009min at room temperature. Immunoreactivity was visualized with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB) peroxidase solution (0.05% DAB - 0.015% H\n2\nO\n2\nin 0.01\u2009M PBS, pH 7.2; Vector Laboratories). Development with the chromogen was timed and applied consistently across batches to limit technical variability before progressing to quantitative image analysis. Reactions were terminated by rinsing sections in distilled water. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated through a gradient of ethanol of increasing concentrations, cleared in xylene, and cover-slipped with permanent mounting medium. Immunoreacted sections were viewed using a motorized Olympus BX63 upright microscope and photographs were taken using the high-resolution DP72 color digital camera.\n\nImage analysis\nImmunoreactivity for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Iba1 was measured by quantitative image analysis (optical segmentation) by an observer blinded to experimental grouping. Multiple regions of interest were analyzed in a standardized fashion for each cell marker/antibody. A survey of immunostained tissue sections was first performed independently to verify specific immunoreactivity that was subsequently progressed to quantitative image analysis. Briefly, non-overlapping red, green, blue (RGB) images were digitally captured randomly within the defined areas from each section (comprising an average of five sections per animal for each marker), providing a systematic survey of each region of interest for each animal within a group. A minimum of 10 microscopic fields (60\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification) were analyzed per region per animal. Immunoreactive profiles that were optically segmented were analyzed using CellSens morphometric image analysis software (Olympus, Center Valley, Pennsylvania). A semiautomated RGB histogram-based protocol (specified in the image analysis program) was used to determine the optimal segmentation (threshold setting) for immunoreactivity for each antibody. Immunoreactive profiles discriminated in this manner were used to determine the specific immunoreactive percentage area. Data were separately plotted as the mean percentage area of immunoreactivity per field (% area)\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of mean for each region and grouping.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data passed normality testing using Spiro-Wilk normality test and therefore were examined using appropriate parametric tests. The three-chamber test was analyzed using one-sample t-tests. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Stress and r-mTBI as between-subjects independent variables was used to analyze total immobility time in the Forced Swim Test, RAWM last-day trials, immunohistochemical data for GFAP and Iba1 per brain region, and profiles of plasma and brain markers using ELISA and Western blotting. Body weight measurements, contextual fear memory, time-bin analysis of the cued fear memory tests and RAWM training trials were analyzed using three-way repeated measures ANOVA (RM ANOVA) with Stress and r-mTBI as two independent between-subjects variables and Time as within-subject independent variable. EPM and Open Field tests were analyzed using three-way ANOVA with Stress, r-mTBI, and Time as three independent variables because of the unequal number of animals at each time-point. Recall of cued fear memory at each time-point and the levels of plasma cytokines in the\nex vivo\nLPS challenge were both analyzed using three-way-RM ANOVA with Stress and r-mTBI as between-subjects variables and Cue or LPS as a within-subject variable. Group differences at each time-point were analyzed using three-way ANOVA, followed by a two-way ANOVA at each repeated measure if any of the interaction terms were significant.\nAll ANOVA experiments were followed by pairwise comparisons with correction for multiple comparisons using the two-stage linear step-up procedure of Benjamini, Krieger, and Yekutieli (BKY) to control the false discovery rate.\n17\nThree-way-RM ANOVA was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics software (Armonk, NY), while all other analyses were performed with Graph Pad prism version 7.0 statistical software (La Jolla, CA). Mauchley test was used to examine the assumption of sphericity before three-way-RM ANOVA analyses. If the sphericity assumption was violated, the Geisser-Greenhouse correction to the degrees of freedom and\np\nvalues was reported.\nStatistical outliers were identified using Grubbs' test. In the EPM, statistical outliers were removed from the stress-only and r-mTBI groups at the acute time-point and from the stress-only and stress+r-mTBI groups at the chronic time-point (one animal per group). Four animals (one per group) did not receive the RAWM training and were excluded from the analysis. The same animals were excluded from the FST analysis due to the absence of previous exposure to swim stress. In the RAWM 3-month recall trial (\nFig. 4D\n), one statistical outlier was removed from the stress-only group. One statistical outlier (stress-only group) was removed from the plasma cytokines measurements (\nTable1\n) and another outlier (control group) was removed from the Western blot quantification of the hippocampal GluN1 levels at 3 months after the second RUS (\nFig. 7E\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 4.\nEffect of stress and repeated mild traumatic brain injury (r-mTBI) on spatial learning and memory. The performance of each group during two separate 5-day training sessions in a Radial Arm Water Maze (RAWM) is depicted in\n(A)\nand\n(B)\n. In the last trial at the acute time-point (Day 5), only animals in the r-mTBI group showed spatial memory deficits as evidenced by a significant increase in the mean memory errors relative to controls\n(C)\n. All treatment groups showed increased mean memory errors relative to controls in the 3-month recall of learned memories (Day 6;\nD\n). A main r-mTBI effect was observed in the last trial at the 3-month time-point (Day 10) as animals in the r-mTBI and stress+r-mTBI groups showed increased mean memory errors relative to controls\n(E)\n. Data in (A) and (B) were analyzed using repeated measures three-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), while data in (C-E) were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA followed by two-stage linear step-up procedure of Benjamini, Krieger, and Yekutieli to correct for multiple comparisons (\nn\n=\u20099-11).

    "Methods": "All research procedures described here were approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board at Uppsala University, and informed consent was obtained from the closest relatives of the patients.\n\nPatient population and neurocritical care management\nThe Department of Neurosurgery at the University Hospital in Uppsala, Sweden, provides neurosurgical care for those in the central part of Sweden; the population is approximately two million persons. Most patients are treated initially at local hospitals according to advanced trauma life support (ATLS) principles and then referred to Uppsala (the most distant local hospital is 382\u2009km away).\nFor this study we conveniently recruited 10 patients (9 male, 1 female) with severe TBI, defined as a post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8 or below on admission to our NIC unit, with a history of cranial trauma, and a computed tomography (CT) scan consistent with TBI. All patients required NIC treatment including intubation, mechanical ventilation, and monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP) and MD. The patients were treated according to a standardized brain injury protocol aiming to keep ICP below 20\u2009mm Hg and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) above 60\u2009mm Hg.\n11\nIn brief, patients were sedated using continuous intravenous propofol infusion (1\u20134\u2009mg/kg/h Propofol-Lipuro; B. Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany) combined with intermittent intravenous morphine (1\u20133\u2009mg Morfin Media; Media, Sollentuna, Sweden). Normovolemic circulation and sufficient colloid osmotic pressure were aimed for. Infusion of 20% albumin was used commonly to manage hypovolemia/hypotension. Fever was managed with paracetamol, cooling blanket, or chlorpromazine. Lesions (contusions and extracerebral hematomas) with significant mass effect were evacuated.\nIn situations of increased ICP despite basic NIC treatment and when no mass lesion was present, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was drained. If CSF drainage was not sufficient to reduce ICP, a thiopental infusion was started. Finally, if ICP was still refractory, a decompressive craniectomy was performed. Inotropic agents (dobutamine or norepinephrine) were administered when needed. Plasma glucose was measured frequently and maintained at 5\u201310\u2009mmol/L. Additional injuries were scored according to the New Injury Severity Score (NISS), ranging from 1 to 75.\n12\nAt approximately six months post-injury, patient outcome was assessed using the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE).\n13\nPatient gender, age, mechanism of injury, presence of coagulopathy, GCS motor score on admission and discharge, length of stay in the NIC unit, MD start time (h

One protein was excluded because of antibody cross-reactivity in the assay (BDNF). Another 22 proteins, according to\nFigure 2\n, did not meet our inclusion criterion of being above the limit of detection (LOD) in \u22654 samples in \u22654 patients and were also excluded, leaving 69 proteins for biomarker evaluation.\n\nRadiological analysis and neurosurgical interventions\nThe CT scans were performed frequently as needed. The placement of the MD catheter in relation to the injury was recorded. The Rotterdam CT score\n14\nwas used for TBI classification in addition to a crude sorting of the patients according to the most dominant cerebral injury visible on CT (\nTable 2\n). In cases where several types of injuries were equally present (e.g., traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, contusions, subdural hematomas), the term \u201cmixed\u201d brain injury was used.\nTable 2.\nPatient Characteristics\nCase no.

The age span reaches from 15 years to 73 years. Mechanism of injury was either motor vehicle accident (MVA) or fall. Presence of coagulopathy was noted preoperatively, either known anticoagulative medication (warfarin) or APTT/INR abnormality. The GCS-M (Glasgow Coma Scale-Motor score) was noted at admission and discharge. The length of stay at the neurointensive care (NIC) unit and start of microdialysis (MD) monitoring were recorded as well. The GOSE (Extended Glasgow Outcome Score) was recorded at a follow-up approximately six months after time of injury.\nThe basal cisterns and the midline shift were measured and calculated on the last CT scan before the surgical procedure. Compression of the basal cisterns was determined by the following scoring system: 0\u2009=\u2009normal, 1\u2009=\u2009compressed yet visible, 2\u2009=\u2009compressed. The midline shift was calculated at the level of the thalami (\nTable 2\n).\nTable 2\nalso lists data on neurosurgical monitoring and interventions.\n\nMicrodialysis procedure\nThe MD procedure has been described previously in detail.\n15\nBriefly, the MD catheter was inserted in conjunction with implantation of the ICP monitoring device in the nondominant frontal lobe, 1\u20132\u2009cm anterior to the coronal suture. The 71 High Cut-Off (100\u2009kDa) Brain MD catheter was used with a membrane length of 10\u2009mm (M Dialysis AB, Stockholm, Sweden). Artificial CSF was used as perfusion fluid, containing NaCl 147\u2009mM, KCl 2.7\u2009mM, CaCl\n2\n1.2\u2009mM, and MgCl\n2\n0.85\u2009mM with the addition of 1.5% human serum albumin, at a perfusion rate of 0.3\u2009\u03bcL/min delivered by a 106 Microdialysis pump (M Dialysis).\nSampling was started at least 2\u2009h after insertion of the MD catheter to allow for normalization of changes caused by catheter implantation. The MD vials were changed on an hourly basis according to our routine MD protocol. Samples (\u223c18\u2009\u03bcL) were analyzed at the bedside using an ISCUSflex Microdialysis Analyzer (M Dialysis) for routine low molecular weight biomarkers of energy metabolism (glucose, lactate, pyruvate) and cellular distress (glutamate and glycerol). The Lactate/Pyruvate Ratio (LPR) was calculated. Urea was monitored to control the MD catheter performance.\n16\nThe remaining samples (\u223c10\u2009\u03bcL) were stored at \u221270\u00b0C until protein biomarker analysis.\nThe ISCUSflex Microdialysis Analyzer was automatically calibrated when started, as well as every 6\u2009h using standard calibration solutions from the manufacturer (M Dialysis). Quality controls at two different concentrations for each substance were performed every weekday. Total imprecision coefficient of variation was <10% for all analytes.\nThe following cutoff values for the MD routine biomarkers were considered critical based on published data\n17\u201319\n: glucose <0.8\u2009mmol/L; lactate >4\u2009mmol/L; pyruvate <120\u2009\u03bcmol/L; LPR >25; glutamate >15\u2009\u03bcmol/L; glycerol >100\u2009\u03bcmol/L. The MD biomarker concentrations were not corrected for\nin vivo\nrelative recovery, which is expected to be close to 70%.\n20\n\nProtein biomarker analysis\nLevels of 92 potential protein biomarkers in brain MD samples were measured simultaneously by multiplex PEA (Olink\n\u00ae\nInflammation panel, Olink Proteomics AB, Uppsala, Sweden) as described previously.\n21\nIn brief, 1\u2009\u03bcL of liquid sample was incubated with a set of paired antibodies where two oligonucleotide-conjugated antibodies binds to the same protein. The affinity bindings of the antibodies bring the two attached oligonucleotides in proximity, allowing them to be extended using enzymatic DNA polymerization. The resulting double-strand DNAs were subsequently amplified and quantified by real-time qPCR by microfluidic PCR system (Fluidigm, San Francisco, CA).\nThe raw Ct values were normalized against negative- and spiked-in controls to achieve relative quantification values as NPX (Normalized Protein eXpression). This a unit in log2 scale, which is correlated positively with the protein concentration. An increase of 1 NPX represents a two-fold increase of protein concentration in the sample. Each protein has its own value of lower limit of detection (LOD). Any NPX values below LOD were replaced as LOD.\nFor all 92 assays included in the PEA inflammation panel, the mean intraassay variation assessed on linearized values was found to have a CV of 7% (range 5\u201314%) according to the manufacturer. For additional information on the panel performance, see Olink Inflammation\u2013Validation Data (\nwww.olink.com\n).\n\nCharacteristics of panel proteins\nTable 1\nlists the proteins included in the PEA inflammation panel. Additional information including protein function, source, and main current observation is provided in\nSupplementary Table 1\n.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAmong the 92 proteins measured, one protein (BDNF) was excluded because of cross-reactivity in the antibody assay. Another 22 proteins did not meet our inclusion criteria of being above the LOD in \u22654 samples in \u22654 patients and therefore were also excluded, leaving 69 proteins for further statistical evaluation (\nsee Results\n).\nTo study temporal dependence between the proteins, the protein expressions were standardized to mean 0 and standard deviation 1 after which cross-correlations were computed.\n22\nCross-correlations show the dependence not only between protein measurements taken at the same time, but also between measurements taken at different time points, allowing study of the temporal protein dynamics. The cross-correlations were computed using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient to allow for non-linear monotone relationships.\n23\nProtein dependencies were visualized as a network.\nThe statistical analyses were performed using R 3.3.2.\n24\nNetworks for protein cross-correlations were plotted using the igraph package.\n25"

    "Methods": "Study population\nThe ARIC Study is an ongoing, community-based cohort of 15,792 participants age 45\u201365 at study baseline in 1987\u20131989 who were recruited from four U.S. communities (suburbs of Minneapolis, Minnesota; Washington County, Maryland; Forsyth County, North Carolina; and Jackson, Mississippi).\n25\nParticipants have attended six in-person visits\u2014with the fifth in-person visit (ARIC-Neurocognitive Study [ARIC-NCS]), which was attended by 6538 surviving participants, occurring in 2011\u20132013 (\nSupplementary Fig. S1\n). A subset of Visit 5 participants (\nn\n=\u20091978) underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Selection criteria for brain MRI\n26\nincluded no contraindications and at least one of the following: 1) prior brain MRI as part of the ARIC study\n27\n; 2) low cognitive scores or cognitive decline at Visit 5; and 3) a random age-stratified sample of cognitively normal participants (\nSupplementary Fig. S1\n). From those with a Visit 5 brain MRI, participants from three of the four ARIC sites (all except Minnesota) were recruited to the ARIC-PET ancillary study,\n28\nwith the additional exclusion criteria of heavy current alcohol use, renal dysfunction (creatinine >2\u2009mg/dL), prolonged (> 450\u2009msec) QTc interval, or expert committee diagnosis of dementia\n29\n(\nSupplementary Fig. S1\n).\nIn total, 346 participants underwent PET amyloid imaging at Visit 5 in 2012\u20132014. Of the 346 ARIC-PET ancillary study participants, we excluded two participants who were of non-white or non-black race, one participant who was later classified as having dementia, and 14 participants missing data on covariates of interest (\nSupplementary Fig. S1\n), leaving a total of 329 participants included in the present analyses.\nThe ARIC study is approved by the Institutional Review Boards of all participating institutions. All participants gave written informed consent at each study visit.\n\nHead injury definition\nHistory of head injury occurring prior to the date of Visit 5 was defined using a combination of self-report questions and data from emergency department visits and hospitalizations (\nSupplementary Fig. S2\n). Self-report questions were asked to all participants at ARIC Visit 3 (1993\u20131995) and Visit 4 (1996\u20131998) and to a subset of participants selected for further cognitive testing and brain MRI at the ARIC brain MRI visit (2004\u20132006) and at ARIC Visit 5 (2011\u20132013). Self-report questions inquired about prior head injury requiring physician/hospital care, number of prior head injuries, and year of head injury. Hospitalization records were available from ARIC Study surveillance of hospitals (1987\u20132013), and linked Centers for Medicare/Medicaid claims for hospitalizations and emergency department visits were available for participants age \u226565 years enrolled in Medicare fee-for-service part B (1991\u20132013). We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition\n30\n,\n31\nto identify hospitalizations with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code for head injury: 800.xx (fracture of vault of skull), 801.xx (fracture of base of skull), 803.xx (other and unqualified skull fractures), 804.xx (multiple fractures involving skull or face with other bones), 850.xx (concussion), 851.xx (cerebral laceration and contusion), 852.xx (subarachnoid subdural and extradural hemorrhage following injury), 853.xx (other and unspecified intracranial hemorrhage following injury), 854.xx (intracranial injury of other and unspecified nature), and 959.01 (head injury, unspecified).\n\nBrain MRI and PET amyloid imaging\nParticipants underwent 3 Tesla brain MRI scans between 2011 and 2013, and images were read centrally at the Mayo Clinic.\n26\nParticipants underwent\n18-\nflorbetapir PET imaging between 2012 and 2014 within 1 year of brain MRI scans (ideally within 6 months). PET images were co-registered using magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) sequences; PET images were processed at the Johns Hopkins University reading center. A detailed description of PET image processing and co-registration with brain MRI scans was described previously.\n28\nA global cortex measure of florbetapir uptake was calculated as the weighted average of the following regions of interest: the orbitofrontal, prefrontal, and super frontal cortices, the lateral temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes, the precuneus, the anterior cingulate, and the posterior cingulate. Cerebellum gray region of interest was used as reference to calculate region of interest standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR).\n28\nElevated florbetapir uptake was defined as a SUVR greater than the global cortex median value of 1.2.\n15\n,\n28\nOur primary outcome was elevated global cortex SUVR >1.2, with secondary outcomes being elevated regional cortices SUVR >1.2. In sensitivity analyses, other SUVR cut-points previously reported in the literature were used, including 1.10\n32\nand 1.11,\n33\nas well as a cut-point of 1.4 (75th percentile SUVR in our population).\n\nStatistical analysis\nParticipant characteristics were described overall and stratified by history of head injury using means and standard deviations for continuous variables and using proportions for categorical variables. Characteristics were compared between those with and without a history of head injury using\nt\n-tests for continuous variables and chi-squared tests for categorical variables.\nPrevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for associations of prior head injury with elevated global (primary outcome) and regional (secondary outcomes) SUVRs were estimated using generalized linear regression with a log link, Gaussian distribution, and robust variance estimator.\n34\nIn secondary analyses, formal testing for interaction by race, apolipoprotein E \u025b4 allele status, and mild cognitive impairment status were performed.\nAll covariates included in models were ascertained at ARIC Visit 5 (2011\u20132013) unless otherwise specified. The following covariates were included in our statistical models: age (continuous; years), sex (male; female), race (white; black), field center (Washington County, Maryland; Forsyth County, North Carolina; Jackson, Mississippi), education (assessed at Visit 1, 1987\u20131989: < high school; high school, General Education Development [GED], or vocational school; college, graduate, or professional school), smoking status (never; former; current; not reported), alcohol consumption (never; former; current; not reported), hypertension (yes; no, defined as systolic blood pressure \u2265140\u2009mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure \u226590\u2009mm Hg, or use of blood pressure medications), diabetes (yes; no, defined as fasting glucose \u2265126\u2009mg/dL, non-fasting glucose \u2265200\u2009mg/dL, HbA\n1c\n\u2265 6.5%, or use of diabetes medications), coronary heart disease (yes; no, defined using adjudicated events as previously described\n18\n), stroke (yes; no, defined using adjudicated events as previously described\n35\n), depression (defined using a score of \u22659 on the 11-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression questionnaire\n36\n), apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u025b4 alleles (0 alleles; 1 or 2 alleles), and mild cognitive impairment (yes; no, defined using an algorithm as previously described\n29\n).\nA subset of participants with a history of head injury also had information on the number of prior injuries (72 out of the 81 total with head injury). A secondary analysis was performed stratifying by frequency of prior head injuries (n\u2009=\u2009320): no history of head injury versus a history of one head injury versus a history of >1 head injuries. Similarly, a subset of participants with a history of head injury also had information on the date of their first head injury (68 out of the 81 total with head injury). A secondary exploratory analysis was performed stratifying those with prior head injury by time from first head injury (\nn\n=\u2009316): no history of head injury versus a history of first head injury within 10 years of the PET scan versus a history of first head injury greater \u226510 years prior to the PET scan. Another secondary exploratory analysis used these data to stratify those with prior head injury by age at the time of first head injury (\nn\n=\u2009316): no history of head injury versus history of first head injury occurring at age <35 years versus history of first head injury occurring at age \u226535 years (mean age at the time of PET scan was similar between these three groups;\np\n=\u20090.55). We additionally performed a sensitivity analysis stratifying participants by both frequency of prior head injuries and by time from first head injury (\nn\n=\u2009316): no history of head injury versus one head injury and first head injury <10 years prior to PET scan versus one head injury and first head injury \u226510 years prior to PET scan versus >1 head injury and first head injury <10 years prior to PET scan versus >1 head injury and first head injury \u226510 years prior to PET scan.\nAll reported\np\nvalues were based on two-sided tests, and\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed using Stata SE Version 15 for Macintosh (StataCorp, College Station, TX)."

    "Methods": "Study population\nFor this study, we pooled the data of SCI patients from the North American Clinical Trials Network (NACTN) prospective longitudinal registry\n14\nand the Surgical Timing in Acute SCI Study (STASCIS).\n15\nThe patients were admitted into acute spinal units at university-affiliated North American hospitals. The NACTN cohort was enrolled at 11 hospitals between 2005 and 2017. The STASCIS cohort was enrolled at 6 hospitals between 2002 and 2009. Eligible subjects included those from whom informed consent was obtained, who were 18 years of age or older, and who had baseline American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grade assessment according to the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury ([ISNCSCI], Revised 2011) within 7 days of injury.\n16\nEthics clearance and informed consent were duly obtained.\n\nIndependent variables\nInformation was recorded in the NACTN and STASCIS data sets on acute complications including PWS. The diagnosis was made by the patient's clinical team on the basis of clinical features and confirmatory microbiological or radiological findings, as applicable. Pneumonia was diagnosed if there was evidence of lung tissue inflammation from infectious microorganisms and associated parenchymal disease from radiological findings. A diagnosis of post-operative wound infection was made at the discretion of the attending surgeon based on clinical features with confirmatory microbiology at any point during 1-year follow-up. Sepsis was defined according to the criteria presented at a consensus conference by the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine.\n17\nFor the analysis, the pooled cohort was classified into two categories based on whether a subject had at least one of these events or did not have PWS during the acute care.\n\nCovariates\nThe following demographic, clinical, and treatment-related characteristics were collected in both NACTN and STASCIS and analyzed in the present study as potential confounders: age (continuous variable), sex, pre-morbid medical status (presence or absence of a history of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic pulmonary conditions, malignancy, or drug abuse), presence of penetrating injury (Yes or No), baseline AIS grade assessed within 7 days of injury (analyzed as ordinal variable), injury neurological level (cervical, thoracic, or lumbosacral), acute 24-h administration of high-dose intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS; Yes or No), time from injury to decompressive surgery (dichotomized as \u226424\u2009h or >24\u2009h), and length of hospital stay (continuous variable).\n\nOutcomes\nThe primary outcome was functional status including respiratory function and ability to walk indoors at 6-month follow-up. The functional outcomes were assessed with the respective subscales of the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM II)\n18\n(see\nSupplementary Table S1\nfor a description). For the purposes of the analysis, the SCIM subscales were dichotomized. As shown in\nSupplementary Table S1\n, respiratory function was dichotomized as assisted breathing versus independent breathing. Ability to walk indoors (Indoor mobility) was dichotomized as dependent ambulation versus independent ambulation. Data on SCIM were available for the NACTN cohort but not for the STASCIS cohort. The secondary end-point was neurological outcome assessed as AIS grade improvement \u22651 point at 6 months. The AIS grade is a five-category ordinal scale of the clinical severity of SCI (see\nSupplementary Table S2\nfor definition).\n\nStatistical analysis\nGroup comparisons were made with respect to demographic, clinical, and treatment variables using the Fisher's exact test for categorical and Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables, with examination of distributional assumptions. Predictors of PWS were assessed in a logistic regression model and ranked using dominance analysis. Candidate predictors included the seven covariate variables described above, which were included in the model based on consensus of their potential importance relative to the outcome. Dominance analysis was used to estimate the proportionate contribution each predictor makes to the explained variance of the dependent variable after considering the direct effect of the predictor and its effect when combined with the other variables in the regression model.\n19\n,\n20\nFor the present analysis, the McFadden R\n2\nwas used as the estimator of explained variance.\nPenalized logistic regression models were fitted with PWS (Yes/No) as the independent variable to assess the association with AIS improvement \u22651 grade, breathing or ambulation outcomes at 6-month follow-up. The analysis for neurological improvement was adjusted for baseline AIS grade, age, and sex, and stratified for the study. The estimates in the NACTN and STASCIS data sets were pooled using a random effects meta-analysis model to account for differences in study design and between-study heterogeneity. Because SCIM data were available for the NACTN cohort only, the functional outcomes analysis was limited to NACTN. The functional outcome analysis was adjusted for baseline AIS, injury level, patient age, sex, and time to surgery. A sensitivity analysis focused on the cohort with cervical SCI who had non-penetrating injuries (blunt or crush) to further reduce heterogeneity and to reflect the patient group more likely to be included in clinical trials of SCI. Effect size is reported as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Significance level was set at 5%. The analysis was performed with Stata software, version 13.1 (Statacorp, TX)."

    "Methods": "Participants\nThis cross-sectional study investigated adults with non-penetrating TBI. As this was an exploratory analysis, our sample was extracted from a large natural history study, which is still ongoing, at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Recruitment for the natural history study was done through the NIH Patient Recruitment and Public Liaison Office, the Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine Recruitment Core, and advertisements displayed in the community. Selection criteria for the larger study included a diagnosis of non-penetrating TBI within 5 years of onset, and the ability to walk independently without assistance and to provide informed consent. Exclusion criteria were contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging scanning, inability to read or speak English, and any significant medical or psychological symptoms that would preclude subjects from being able to complete the study requirements.\nAll subjects selected to participate in the natural history study received imaging, neuropsychology, vocational work, and gait and balance evaluations; however, not all subjects qualified for this cross-sectional analysis. Additional exclusion criteria for this sub-study were those with known confounders to balance performance, such as presence of non-TBI-related neurological disorders, lower-extremity orthopedic surgery within 6 months, symptomatic and/or untreated lower extremity or trunk musculoskeletal conditions, uncorrected visual disturbances, history of postural hypotension, history of or current alcohol abuse (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test >8), recreational drug use within 24\u2009h prior to testing, severe depression (Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) >29), history of psychosis or untreated psychopathology, and invalid neuropsychological testing (attributed to practice effects, lack of effort, or questionable validity). Of the 131 participants enrolled in the natural history study between August, 2011 and August, 2015, 48 met the specific criteria for this analysis.\n\nProcedures\nHistory, including trauma data, and physical examination findings, were collected by our study physician. TBI severity was determined as per the Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense.\n28\nParticipants were classified as medication users if they were taking any of the following psychotropic drugs regularly: pain relievers, benzodiazepines, sleep medications, antiepilepsy medications, antidepressants, or neurostimulants. In addition, depression severity was reported using the BDI. Participants were also asked to report the total number of brain injuries that they had sustained in the past, as well as any falls since their most recent TBI.\nBalance testing with the NeuroCom SMART Balance Master (Natus Medical Inc., Seattle, WA) included the SOT and LOS assessments.\n13\n,\n29\nBriefly, the SOT measures how well one uses sensory information for postural control. Subjects are required to stand quietly and still on a dynamically responsive force plate while equilibrium scores are generated reflecting the extent of each individual's sway. Higher scores reflect less body sway (i.e., better balance), with a maximum score of 100 indicating perfect balance and a score of 0 representing a fall. Data on a total of 6 conditions were collected, each with three 20\u2009sec trials. All trials and conditions were included in the calculation of the following measurements reported in this study: Somatosensory Score (SOM), Visual Score (VIS), Vestibular Score (VEST), Preference Score (PREF), which reflects the extent to which an individual over-compensates through visual integration, and Equilibrium Composite Score (Comp).\n14\n,\n30\n,\n31\nScores were visually inspected for aphysiological responses, and no related data were excluded. Other measures also collected as part of the SOT were strategy analysis and center of gravity alignment, but these were not of interest in this study; therefore, they were not reported.\nThe LOS measures how far people can voluntarily lean their body in any direction keeping a straight posture before they lose their balance or take a step. Subjects are required to stand facing a computer screen that displays a stick figure, providing live-time visual feedback representative of the subject's dynamic center of pressure (COP); upon COP displacement, the on-screen figure moves accordingly. The on-screen figure is encircled by eight target boxes, each of which represents the subject's theoretical maximal cone of stability. Upon an audible cue, subjects are asked to lean as quickly and directly as possible toward the target highlighted on screen, and to hold this lean at the \u201climit\u201d of his/her balance stability until another audible cue indicates the end of the trial. This task is intended to emulate the movements of an inverse pendulum; with feet planted maintaining an entirely straight posture, and flexion only at the ankles. One practice trial was performed before the test was conducted. All trials were included in the calculation of the following measurements, which are composite (eight directions/trials averaged) scores:\n1.\nReaction time (RT): time (seconds) between the start of trial (audible cue) and patient's first movement toward the target\n2.\nMovement velocity (MVL): velocity of lean from initial stance to end-point excursion (EPE) (degrees of ankle flexion per second)\n3.\nEPE: greatest center of pressure displacement upon initial lean toward target (% of maximal LOS)\n4.\nMaximum excursion (MXE): greatest center of pressure displacement throughout entire 8\u2009sec trial (% of maximal LOS)\n5.\nDirectional control (DCL): extent to which direct target lean/COP displacement is executed, measured in % of straightness of COP displacement trajectory.\nSOT and LOS measurements were statistically compared with an age-referenced normative data set provided by the manufacturer (personal communication with Daniel Dubiel at NeuroCom Balance Systems Customer Support, Natus Medical Inc., Seattle, WA) and thereby categorized as normal (NL) or abnormal (ABNL); >1.645 standard deviations of the normative mean. SOT normative data included 112 individuals in the age range of 20\u201359 years. LOS normative data included 47 individuals in the age range of 40\u201359 years. All subjects in the normative data set were reported to have no current or past diagnosis or injury affecting balance, be taking no medications affecting the central nervous system or known to affect balance or coordination, and have no symptoms of dizziness or lightheadedness, no symptoms suggestive of vestibular or neurological disorders, no psychological disorders including depression, no history of two or more unexplained falls within the past 6 months, and normal vision with or without glasses.\n\nSubjective assessment\nThe DHI is a 25-item questionnaire that quantifies self-perceived deficits on everyday balance activities.\n27\nIt was originally designed for subjects with a vestibular abnormality;\n27\n,\n32\nhowever, it has also been studied in TBI.\n5\n,\n29\n,\n33\nThree domains are assessed: physical, emotional, and functional. The majority of questions inquire whether or not specified actions enhance \u201cyour problem [of dizziness],\u201d warranting a response of \u201cno,\u201d \u201csometimes,\u201d or \u201cyes\u201d; graded 0, 2, and 4, respectively. Because subjects with TBI may report balance symptoms other than dizziness alone,\n34\nwe adapted this tool for our cohort and oriented participants to answer each question in relation to any balance-related symptoms they might be experiencing (e.g., unsteadiness, light-headedness, imbalance), not necessarily those solely restricted to dizziness. Scores range from 0 to 100, which indicates maximum perceived disability.\n\nStatistical analysis\nOne sample\nt\ntests were performed comparing the TBI cohort with normative data provided by the manufacturer (NeuroCom) on each balance variable. This analysis was conducted with IBM SPSS software version 19 (IBM, Somers, NY). A least-angle regression (LARS) analysis was used to identify SOT and LOS variables that could serve as predictors for DHI total score. In this analysis, three models were estimated. Each model was initially fit using all possible covariates (age, total number of brain injuries, counts on use of psychotropic medications, number of days since injury, and depression severity). In addition to the covariates, the first model included both SOT and LOS variables, whereas the second used only SOT and the third only used LOS variables. The LARS algorithm sequentially builds models by identifying the variable with the greatest correlation with the residuals, and increasing its coefficient in absolute value until another variable is more highly correlated to the adjusted residuals. Mallows' Cp was used to determine the best-fitting subset of variables for each of the three LARS models.\n35\nThe best-fit subset was defined as the model step in LARS that minimized Cp, subject to Cp \u2265 P, where P is the number of predictor variables in the model in that step. After the best fit model was determined, bootstrap 95% confidence intervals for its model parameters were determined by taking 3000 bootstrap replications. Analyses were conducted in Stata 14 and R version 3.4.3. Significance was established at\np\n<\u20090.05."

Blood was centrifuged at 1500\u2009g for 10\u2009min and plasma was recovered, followed by a second spin at 3000\u2009g for 10\u2009min to minimize cellular contamination.\n\nHuman sample collection\nTBI subjects and healthy control subjects were enrolled in a prospective biorepository study at the University of Pennsylvania. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Pennsylvania (IRB Protocol # 825783; initial approval 10/16/2016; most recent approval 10/7/2018). All TBI subjects required admission to Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, the Level 1 trauma center of the University of Pennsylvania, for their traumatic injuries. All TBI subjects included in this analysis had: 1) high clinical suspicion of non-penetrating acute TBI, determined by the treating physicians for which a head CT scan was performed; 2) age \u226518 years; 3) interval between time of injury and enrollment <24\u2009h; and 4) ability to obtain informed consent from the subject or a legally authorized representative. The majority of the TBI subjects sustained mild TBIs, as defined by a post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13\u201315. For this study, we analyzed plasma samples that were collected <24\u2009h from injury and were immediately aliquoted and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until further analyses.\n\nCCI\nCCI experiment was performed on adult male (12\u201314 weeks old) C57BL/6J mice (Charles River, MA). All CCI injuries were performed as previously described.\n71\nAnesthetized mice (isoflurane 3.0% induction, 1.5\u20132.0% maintenance in medical grade air: 21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen) were placed in a stereotaxic frame. A manual craniotomy was performed on the right parietotemporal region of the skull midway between bregma and lambda using a 4\u2009mm diameter trephine (CMA7431058, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). The skull flap was removed and the animal was loaded into the CCI machine. Isoflurane was stopped 30\u2009sec before CCI. A moderate injury was produced at an average impact velocity of 2.4\u2009m/sec with an impact depth of 1.0\u2009mm, centering the impact at approximately \u22122.5\u2009mm bregma. Sham control animals underwent craniotomy, placed in the stereotaxic holder, but no CCI was delivered. Following the CCI, the exposed area was sutured and mice were allowed to emerge from anesthesia in a heated cage.\n\nBlast injury\nAdult male (12\u201314 weeks old) C57BL/6J mice (Charles River, MA) were exposed to a Blast overpressure insult that mimicked Blast-induced traumatic brain injury.\n23\nAnesthetized mice (isoflurane 3.0% induction, 1.5\u20132.0% maintenance) were used as sham controls. Anesthetized mice were prepared for injury by placing sound insulating foam into each ear canal. Mice were loaded into a holder positioned 1\u2009cm away from the end of the shock tube, positioned with their snouts facing the shock tube. Head motion was limited with a metal rod encircling the snout and placing a cervical collar between the occiput and shoulders. A single overpressure of either 215\u2009\u00b1\u200918kPa or 415\u2009\u00b1\u200941\u2009kPa was delivered and the animal was immediately removed from the holder assembly. We strictly followed the guidelines from the University of Pennsylvania office of University Laboratory Animal Resources using approved protocols, and animal care and use was in accordance with the guidelines specified by the IACUC of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nTENPO device\nUsing thermal evaporation, 200\u2009nm layer of permalloy (Ni80Fe20) and 30\u2009nm layer of gold were sequentially deposited (Kurt Lesker PVD-75; Singh Nanofabrication Facility, University of Pennsylvania) on a track-etched polycarbonate membrane with 600\u2009nm pores (Whatman). Moisture-resistant polyester film (McMaster-Carr, 0.004\u2033 thick) and solvent-resistant tape (McMaster-Carr) were cut using laser micromachining (Universal Laser VLS 3.50) and used to make layers of TENPO device. A reservoir was made using an optically clear cast acrylic sheet (McMaster-Carr) and an output was made using a polydimethylsiloxane piece. A tygon tubing was connected to the output and a negative pressure supply (Programmable Syringe Pump; Braintree Scientific).\n\nEV capture using TENPO device\nBiotin anti-human, mouse GluR1/GluR2 antibody (Bioss) was incubated with the sample for 20\u2009min at room temperature with shaking and anti-biotin ultrapure microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) was incubated with the sample for 20\u2009min for room temperature subsequently. The sample was loaded to the reservoir of the TENPO device and a programmable syringe pump (Braintree) was used to apply negative pressure.\n\nRNA isolation\nSecond part of the ExoRNeasy serum/plasma kit (Qiagen) was used for RNA extraction. We first added 700\u2009\u03bcL of QIAzol lysis reagent (Qiagen) on chip and then collected the lysate using a negative pressure and used the second part of the ExoRNeasy serum/plasma kit. The exosomal RNA was stored at \u221280C or processed immediately for further analysis.\n\nRNA sequencing\nQIAseq miRNA library kit (Qiagen) was used to make a library of exosomal RNA. BioAnalyzer was used to quantify RNA. The library was sequenced using a HiSeq 2500 kit (Illumina, Next-Generation Sequencing Core; University of Pennsylvania).\n\nSequencing data and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis\nExpression was quantified using a modified version of the UPenn SCAP-T RNA-Seq expression pipeline (Fisher, S A., \u201cSafisher/Ngs.\u201d GitHub, 2017), aligning to the hg38 and mm10 genomes for human and mouse, respectively. The minimum fragment length allowed past the TRIM module was reduced to 16 bases. STAR72 version STAR_2.4.0h1 was used, and was allowed to map as few as 16 bases in a read by setting \u201c\u2014outFilterMatchNmin 16\u201d and \u201c\u2014outFilterMatchNminOverLread 0.\u201d The number of allowed mismatches was capped at one using \u201c\u2014outFilterMismatchNmax 1,\u201d and \u201c\u2014alignIntronMax 1\u201d was set to prohibit calling unannotated splices. Expression counts were normalized by DESeq273 and quantified using VERSE74, using Gencode 25 and UCSD mm10 gene annotations, combined with MirBase v21 annotations for 3p and 5p microRNA. For Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, DIANA mirPath v. 3.0 was used to identify the pathways of target genes regulated by exosomal miRNAs.\n\nMachine learning data analysis\nUsing Matlab (R2016b), we performed an averaging of scores generated by five different built-in statistical learning algorithms (KNN, SVM, LDA, Logistic regression, Naive Bayes). To prevent overfitting, we performed 5-fold cross-validation and averaged the performance from 500 repeated runs for the classification with small sample sizes. For the classification with enough sample sizes, we created a separate training set and an independent blinded test set to better prevent overfitting."

    "Methods": "Diffuse TBI in piglets\nAll experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania. Piglets were housed separately in cages and kept on a 12\u2009h light\u2013dark cycle. We studied seven 4-week-old, female Yorkshire piglets (neurodevelopmentally equivalent to a human toddler).\n20\nThe pathophysiology of TBI in piglets compares well with that of human children\n21\n,\n22\nbecause of the similarities in gyral pattern, overall brain shape, and distribution of gray and white matter.\n23\u201325\nThree piglets were randomly assigned to the injured group and four were assigned to the sham group. Each piglet in the injured group sustained a single, rapid, closed-head, non-impact rotation in the sagittal plane with mean peak angular velocity of 131\u2009rad/sec. The well-characterized diffuse white matter injury was induced via a HYGE\n\u2122\npneumatic actuator,\n26\u201328\nand the angular velocity was recorded using an angular rate sensor (ATA Engineering Inc., Model#: ars-06, Herndon, VA) and a data acquisition system implemented in LabView (National Instruments, Austin, TX). Sham piglets received all of the procedures except the injury, including the anesthetic regimen. Anesthesia and analgesia were administered only on the day of injury. Buprenorphine (0.02\u2009mg/kg) was delivered intramuscularly for analgesia prior to injury. Then, the following protocol was performed: pre-medication with intramuscular injection of ketamine (20\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (2\u2009mg/kg), induction with 4% inhaled isoflurane in 1.0 fraction of inspired oxygen via snout mask until lack of reflexive pinch response, and maintenance at 1% inhaled isoflurane via endotracheal tube with fraction of inspired oxygen to 0.21 on the day of injury (day 0). Body temperature, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, heart rate, respiratory rate, and end-tidal CO\n2\nwere continuously monitored. A circulating water blanket was kept to maintain core body temperature between 36 and 38\u00b0C. For each animal, EEG data was acquired 1 day prior to injury and 1, 4, and 7 days post-injury.\n\nEEG data acquisition\nBefore beginning EEG data acquisition, piglets were acclimated to wearing a nylon sleeve in their cages for a minimum of two 30\u2009min sessions over 2 days. Acquisition of resting-state EEG only occurred in non-agitated, silent, awake piglets using the 32 channel net (Electrical Geodesics, Inc. HydroCel\nTM\nGeodesic Sensor Net, Electrical Geodesics, Inc. Net Amps 400 EEG amplifier). The net was placed in potassium chloride electrolyte solution (11\u2009g dry potassium chloride, 1\u2009L water and 5\u2009mL baby shampoo) before it was placed on the head. The International 10\u201320 EEG system\n29\nwas utilized to ensure consistent positioning of the scalp electrodes (in the net) for each animal across days. We also used the nasion and inion as anatomical landmarks to ensure consistent sensor net placement across all animals. In order to maintain contact between electrode and scalp, we placed two thin nylon sleeves over the net. Before acquisition, the impedances of all electrodes were verified to be below 50\u2009k\u2126; placement of the electrodes took \u223c7\u2009min per piglet. We then recorded 1.5\u2009min of continuous resting state EEG data from immobile piglets in a silent room without any movement of nearby objects or investigators. EEG data were acquired at a rate of 1\u2009kHz and referenced to channel 33 (located at the midline in the center of the head). Recordings were discarded and repeated if background noise or head movement was observed in the same pig.\nAlpha band filtering was performed on the EEG signal using the Net Station Tools 4.6 software by applying a finite impulse response bandpass filter at 8\u201312\u2009Hz (passband gain: \u22120.01\u2009dB, stopband gain: \u221240\u2009dB, roll-off: 0.99\u2009Hz). Frequency band limits for the beta (16.5\u201325\u2009Hz), broad (1\u201335\u2009Hz), delta (1\u20133.5\u2009Hz), gamma (30\u201335\u2009Hz), sigma (13\u201316\u2009Hz), and theta (4\u20137.5\u2009Hz) bands were chosen based on the study by Modarres and colleagues.\n30\nEEG recordings are influenced by electrical and physiological artifacts, electrode placement, skull defects, anesthesia drugs, and subject alertness.\n31\u201333\nCellular devices were not permitted in the study room during EEG recording and the 60\u2009Hz (electrical noise) frequency was eliminated using a notch filter. After frequency filtering, artifact detection in and removal from EEG signals was performed using a user-defined algorithm in MATLAB\n\u00ae\n.\nOur artifact detection algorithm removed variations in EEG voltage caused by bad channels (eye blinks and minor movements) and replaced these short segments with the mean EEG voltage without artifacts. We excluded the first and last second of each recording to remove any artifacts arising at the start and end of the data acquisition process. We then calculated the moving average (with span 80\u2009ms) of the EEG signal. Within sequential 500\u2009ms segments, the minimum (min) and maximum (max) moving average EEG values were computed. A segment of EEG signal was deemed to contain an artifact if its max-min value exceeded the threshold value of 20\u2009\u03bcV, which was determined by manual inspection to robustly flag artifacts across all channels and animals. Artifacts accounted for 20.5% of the EEG recordings. We calculated the number of artifacts for injured and sham piglets across days and found that shams (20.4%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.79%) had mean/standard error percent of EEG signal with artifact similar to those of the injured piglets (20.6%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.93%). There was no difference in the level of artifacts in the EEG for injured and sham piglets.\n\nAverage spectral power and mean frequency analysis\nWe then calculated average spectral power and mean frequency to illustrate changes in EEG features that were the result of injury. Spectral power was calculated using the Fulop & Fitz method,\n34\nin MATLAB,\n35\nafter applying a Hanning window to the 1.5\u2009min pre-processed EEG signal from all 32 electrodes. The average power of the post-processed (frequency-filtered and artifact removed) EEG signals was taken over the 1\u201335\u2009Hz range of interest. We also calculated the mean frequency power-weighted average over the 1\u201335Hz range for every frequency band. Mean frequency was calculated as:\n, where\nf\ni\ndenotes the\ni\nth frequency value in the 1\u201335Hz domain and\nPower\nnorm,i\nis the normalized power (power at\nf\ni\ndivided by the sum of power values across all frequencies). One scalar value of average power and the mean frequency were determined for each electrode at every frequency band; every animal contributed 32 average power and mean frequency measures. We used short-term fast Fourier transform analysis over the 1.5\u2009min epoch and pre-defined narrowband ranges to identify mean frequency and power changes via methods that are consistent with previously published studies.\n36\u201340\n\nConstruction of EEG functional networks\nNetworks are collections of nodes and edges. The 32 electrodes can be regarded as representing the nodes, and the synchrony between them can be regarded as representing the edges. The resulting functional networks can provide insight into the interactions among the various brain regions over which electrodes are placed. Functional networks were constructed by calculating network edges as the maximum absolute cross-correlation of the amplitudes of the EEG signals between all pairs of electrodes (\nFig. 1\n). One edge between two nodes represents the similarity between EEG signals from both nodes. Every 1.5-min-long EEG recording was segmented into short (1000\u2009ms) segments, and one network was built for each segment, yielding \u223c88 undirected, weighted EEG functional networks per animal per study day (\nFig. 1\n). This analysis approach used is similar to that used by Chu and colleagues.\n36\nAll of the networks calculated were fully connected; that is, had 496 edges among 32 nodes and were not thresholded for analysis in order to include the information from all edges. The broadband networks for all post-injury days were compared to the pre-injury day for sham and injury groups by constructing 32\u2009\u00d7\u200932 matrices. Networks were calculated for the alpha (8\u201312\u2009Hz), beta (16.5\u201325\u2009Hz), broad (1\u201335\u2009Hz), delta (1\u20133.5\u2009Hz), gamma (30\u201335\u2009Hz), sigma (13\u201316\u2009Hz), and theta (4\u20137.5\u2009Hz) bands.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nDiagram showing\n(A)\nresting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) acquisition from sham and injured piglets and\n(B)\nnetwork construction from all pairwise cross-correlations, which form\n(C)\nan adjacency matrix that indicates the strength of inter-electrode connections across the brain that may also be represented as\n(D)\na weighted EEG functional network.\n\nEEG functional network metrics\nNetwork metrics were then calculated in order to quantify the integration (global communication and cooperation among brain regions) and segregation (formation of local and functionally specialized modules among brain regions) properties as well as the influence of key nodes and edges on the network. The four metrics calculated were: nodal strength, clustering coefficient, global efficiency, and modularity. Nodal strength was calculated as the sum of edges that each electrode has to all other electrodes. Clustering coefficient was calculated as the geometric mean of edges that formed triangles around each node. Nodal strength and clustering coefficient are node-based metrics, meaning that there is a single value of nodal strength and clustering coefficient for each electrode; median values of nodal strength and clustering coefficient from all 32 electrodes were taken to yield a single, representative measure of nodal strength and clustering coefficient for each EEG network. The median values provide a network-wide measure of connectivity; that is, not specific to node location. Global efficiency was calculated as the average inverse of the shortest path length between all possible pairs of nodes in the network, where a path is the sequence of distinct edges taken to traverse nodes throughout the network. Modularity is the degree to which a network's nodes and edges may be separated or combined. Modularity was calculated using the MATLAB Brain Connectivity Toolbox\n37\nwith the Louvain\u2013greedy algorithm, with the modularity resolution parameter set as 1 (the classic value).\n\nAnalysis of core EEG functional network topology\nChanges in the weighted EEG functional network metrics may be the result of changes in the strength of edges, the number of connections, or both. In order to determine the source of changes in networks, we examined whether network topology or the arrangement of the core edges changes after injury. The method used was based on that performed by Chu and colleagues.\n36\nEach weighted, cross-correlation network (captured from 1000\u2009ms of EEG data) was converted to a binary network by statistical thresholding of its edges. One sided empirical\np\nvalues were determined for each edge in the weighted network by counting the number of edges that were greater than the edge considered and dividing the count by the total number of edges in the network.\n41\nEdges with significant\np\nvalues (\np\n<\u20090.05) formed a binary network representation of the strongest neural connections throughout the network over the 1000\u2009ms epoch. In a single animal, all binary networks were summed across time to obtain a weighted, consensus network over the 88\u2009sec duration of resting state EEG recording. We extracted the most persistent edges present over the total EEG recording duration by finding edges in the consensus network with weights above the 95th percentile. The strongest 5% of edges were calculated for all animals and frequency bands.\n\nStatistical analysis\nWe utilized a non-parametric Dunnett's test\n42\nto compare all metrics from post-injury (POST 1, 4, and 7) days with those from the pre-injury (PRE) day, with a significance level of 0.05. The logarithm was taken of all network metrics (except modularity) before statistical tests were performed. Statistical tests were applied to all spectral power and network metrics for all frequency bands. All statistical analyses were performed in R 3.4.1\n43\nusing the nparcomp package.\n44\nFor all boxplots, the box plot height is defined by the 25th and 75th percentiles (1st and 3rd quartiles). The upper whisker is the largest observation \u2264 the 75th percentile +1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009 IQR (where IQR is the interquartile range, or distance between the first and third quartiles). The lower whisker extends to smallest observation \u2265 the 25th percentile - 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009IQR. Data beyond the end of the whiskers are called \u201coutlying\u201d points and are plotted individually."

Before the measurement, digitized (Polhemus 3Space\n\u00ae\nFastrak\u2122; Polhemus, Colchester, VT) nasion and two periauricular points determined the head coordinate system, and five head position indicator coils monitored the exact head position inside the helmet throughout the measurement session. Horizontal and vertical electro-oculogram and electrocardiogram provided data for artefact management. Collection of MEG signals occurred with a sampling rate of 1000\u2009Hz and a band-pass filter of 0.03\u2013330\u2009Hz.\nThe recordings comprised spontaneous resting-state activity measured with eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC), 10\u2009min each, and during two cognitive tasks: the PASAT,\n16\n,\n17\nand a vigilance test (VT). Measurements were performed in identical order (EO, EC, PASAT, and VT) in all patients and controls. After spontaneous activity recordings, subjects were allowed a short break, during which instructions for cognitive tests were repeated. For PASAT, we used 2.4-, 2.0-, and 1.6-sec presentation rates, and for those subjects (11 patients) who exhibited distress or made multiple mistakes during rehearsal at the 2.4-sec interval, we repeated the slower rate to exclude relinquishing effects during the test. The measurement during PASAT lasted for 6.5\u2009min. Subjects performed the test quietly without reporting the results aloud to avoid mouth movement artefacts. In VT, subjects listened to a story for 10\u2009min and tried to count randomly scattered 13 words that were not part of the story. We used the first 5\u2009min of EO, PASAT, and VT tasks for the analysis irrespective of the PASAT rate to obtain equal amount of averaged signal, with the task difficulty accommodated to gain maximal effort in both controls and patients.\nDuring the tasks, subjects were asked to fixate on a fixation cross, sit relaxed, and avoid moving. During the EC condition, two, and during the EO condition one, short pauses confirmed that subjects remained alert.\nAll subjects underwent 1.5 Tesla anatomical MRI scans (GE Signa HDX 1.5\u2009T; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI), patients within 3 weeks to 16 months after the injury. Imaging consisted of sagittal T\n2\ncube, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, axial fast spin echo, axial three-dimensional (3D) susceptibility-weighted imaging, and axial 3D fast spoiled gradient-recalled echo T\n1\nsequences.\n\nData analysis\nPre-processing\nThe temporal extension of the signal space separation method\n53\nwith movement compensation was utilized for artifact rejection. For residual eye-movement or cardiac artefacts, one component related to eye blinks or cardiac QRS-complex was projected out using independent component analysis.\n54\nFor sensor-level analysis, we transferred all measurements to an average head position calculated over all patients and control subjects.\nSensor-level analysis\nFor data analysis, we applied relatively straightforward sensor-level peak power and frequency analyses, to facilitate later utilization of the methods in clinical settings and, possibly also, in EEG environment. Therefore, we focused on the alpha frequency range and sensor-level analysis of continuous MEG data.\nWe estimated sensor-level individual power spectra from the first 5\u2009min of MEG data in each condition (EO, EC, PASAT, and VT). The power spectra were calculated using Welch's method with a 2048-point fast Fourier transform, 50% overlap, and Hann windowing, resulting in a frequency resolution of \u223c0.5\u2009Hz. We calculated areal averages for left and right frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital sensor areas, to obtain areal peak frequencies and power at the alpha (8\u201314\u2009Hz) frequency band. We concentrated on these frequencies and areas based on previous results on alpha band changes in healthy controls during cognitive tasks\n30\n,\n31\n,\n33\nand during rest EEG recordings in mTBI patients after the injury.\n43\n,\n44\nAlpha peak power and frequency were extracted for each participant as the peak values in the 8- to 14-Hz frequency band over each sensor area and tested for within-group differences between conditions (PASAT vs. EO as well as VT vs. EO). Between-group comparisons of possible changes in alpha peak frequencies were performed at the sensor level, whereas between-group differences in power were estimated at the source level (\nsee source modeling\nsection).\nStatistical analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS Statistics (version 24; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) non-parametric tests, because of skewed distributions of the data. Frequency values were logarithmically transformed to enable comparisons. Mann-Whitney U tests served for between-groups analysis and Wilcoxon tests for within-groups analysis. Mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA; subject group as a between-groups factor, and task, area, and hemisphere as within-group factors) assessed between-groups interactions. Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was applied to Wilks' lambda results. When an interaction was observed, we used Student's two-tailed\nt\n-tests to further evaluate the values, ln-transformed to compensate for the unequal variances between groups. Correlations with the neuropsychological tests were calculated using Spearman's two-tailed rank-order correlation because of small sample size and skewed distributions of the data, and not corrected for multiple comparisons.\nSource modeling\nSource modeling of measured oscillatory brain activity was used to identify the cortical regions that contribute to the measured signals. Source modeling of MEG responses requires solving the so-called inverse problem, that is, estimating the origins of the oscillatory activity from the measurement data with the help of additional constraints.\n55\nFor MEG, origins of oscillatory activity can be estimated with up to 3-mm accuracy and sources located within a few centimeters from each other can be resolved.\n56\n,\n57\nBecause the source-modeling approach provides superior localization of the oscillatory power, we decided to perform between-groups power analysis at source space.\nSource-level cortical activity was estimated using a spatial filter (or beamformer) in the frequency domain (dynamic imaging of coherent sources; DICS).\n57\n,\n58\nDICS is a linearly constrained minimum variance beamformer that, given a cross-spectral density (CSD) matrix and a forward model of the neural currents, is designed to pass the activity in a specific location, while suppressing activity from other locations using a weighted sum of the sensor signals.\n59\nThe frequency-domain beamformer is well suited for identifying oscillatory activity in a continuous task.\n57\n,\n58\nData analysis was performed using MNE Python (v0.16; available at:\nhttps://martinos.org/mne/stable/auto_tutorials/plot_dics.html\n)\n60\n,\n61\nand the ConPy python package (available at:\nhttps://github.com/AaltoImagingLanguage/conpy\n)\n62\nwith parameter choices as outlined in Van Vliet and colleagues.\n62\nWithin this approach, the pre-processed continuous planar gradiometer data, using the first 5\u2009min of each condition to enable comparison between them, was first divided into 2.048-sec epochs. The CSD matrix was calculated to represent the covariance in the frequency domain between the signals at each sensor. To yield CSD matrices between all sensor combinations, time-frequency representations of epochs were calculated using Morlet wavelets with seven cycles.\n63\nThe obtained CSD matrices were subsequently averaged over all epochs and the entire time interval and the chosen 8- to 14-Hz frequency range.\nA forward model, that is, a model that predicts the measured electromagnetic field generated by neural currents, is needed for computing the spatial filters. A single-layer boundary-element model, constructed from the inner skull surface of the MR images using FreeSurfer,\n64\nwas used as a head conductor model in the forward model. The possible neural sources were restricted to a surface-based cortical grid with 5124 nodes, established for each subject, thus allowing cortex-wide estimates of neural activity. T\n1\nsequences of MR images, segmented using FreeSurfer,\n64\ndetermined the individual cortical mantles. The neural currents at each grid point were modeled as equivalent current dipoles that represent the current as a vector with a magnitude and orientation. Spatial filters, constructed using the calculated CSD matrices and the forward model, selected the orientation with maximal power at each grid point.\n62\nThe resulting MEG power maps were morphed to an atlas brain (FS-average-5.1.0) to enable spatial comparison of the power maps across subjects and group-level statistical analysis.\nCluster-based permutation tests in MNE Python (corrected\np\n<\u20090.05), with a cluster-forming threshold of\np\n=\u20090.00001 for between-groups analysis and\np\n=\u20090.01 for within-group analysis, a maximal geodesic distance of 0.010 between adjacent vertices during clustering, and 10,000 permutations, assessed the potential statistical significance of differences in power between conditions and groups. Because of the individual variability of the brain oscillatory power, we normalized the data with each subject's maximum power in the resting-state EO condition for between-group comparisons. The Desikan-Killiany cortical parcellation atlas from FreeSurfer served for labeling the cortical areas.\n65"

Because of our interest in the performance of the GOSE as a measure of TBI-related disability and because the proposed analyses require item-level data about daily functioning, participants who were dead or living in a vegetative state were excluded. Further, as described under\nStatistical analysis\n, we excluded individuals who were not working pre-injury from the analyses. Overall, 432 participants met inclusion criteria, 384 with 3-month and 348 with 6-month outcome data.

The GOSE is scored such that any report of injury-related functional limitations is associated with a level of disability (i.e., potential GOSE score), and the lowest score across the item responses is used as the overall GOSE score. The relative effects of TBI versus peripheral injuries on changes in functioning were not discerned in this study. The GOSE has been found to have excellent test-retest reliability (\nK\nW\n=\u20090.92) across structured interview formats (in-person vs. telephone) and good inter-rater reliability when ratings are made by psychologists and nurses (\nK\nW\n=\u20090.84).\n21\n\nProcedures\nTRACK-TBI pilot study patient recruitment and eligibility\nPatients with TBI were recruited acutely from three U.S. acute care centers: San Francisco General Hospital, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and University Medical Center Brackenridge in Austin, Texas, as well as a single rehabilitation center located at the Mount Sinai Rehabilitation Center (MSRC) in New York City (this latter cohort is not reported on here).\n1*\nPatient eligibility included English-speaking, presentation at a participating site with an external force head trauma, and a clinically ordered CT scan completed within 24\u2009h of injury. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, incarceration, comorbid life-threatening disease, and active psychiatric hold. Representative institutional review boards for each site approved the study, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants or their legally authorized representatives. For details about the TRACK-TBI Pilot Study population and recruitment conditions, see McMahon and colleagues\n45\nand Yue and colleagues.\n46\nOutcome assessment schedule and study sample selection criteria\nThe structured interview form of the GOSE was administered by telephone at the 3-month time and in-person at the 6-month time point.\n\nOverview of item response theory modeling\nUsing IRT, one posits that a cohesive dimension or construct (e.g., TBI-related disability) exists that is reflected by responses to a set of items. In modeling that latent dimension, one can then estimate parameters that quantify the type and strength of relationship between item responses and individuals' levels on the dimension. In the two-parameter IRT model discussed here, item performance is quantified through two metrics (depicted in\nFig. 1\n).\nItem difficulty\n(a.k.a.,\nseverity\n, denoted\nb\n) refers to the level of severity (i.e., disability, denoted theta,\n\u03b8\n) at which a patient has a 50% chance of endorsing an item (in the case of binary items).\nIn measuring TBI-related disability, for example, one would expect that items about limitations in self-care and social functioning would have different difficulty/severity levels, where a relatively high level of disability is needed to show impairment in basic self-care abilities, whereas impairments in complex activities, such as social functioning, might occur with lower levels of disability. The second item parameter,\ndiscrimination\n(denoted\na\n), reflects how strongly an item is related to the latent dimension (akin to and sometimes equivalent to a loading in factor analysis). Items with higher discrimination provide more information about where individuals fall around their level of disability, which corresponds to being able to estimate individuals' levels on the latent dimension more precisely (i.e., with smaller standard errors).\nFor any pattern of item responses, severity and discrimination parameters can then be used to compute an IRT score that represents an individual's estimated location on the continuum of the latent trait that have, in some contexts, been shown to yield more efficient and sensitive measurement of group differences and change over time than classic approaches to scoring a measure based on classical test theory (CTT).\n38\n,\n47\n,\n48\nIRT-based scores have a number of potential advantages over CTT-based scoring approaches, which have been described elsewhere.\n38\nResearchers conducting IRT analyses are typically interested in using graphical methods to interpret item and test properties. Such graphics include the\nitem response function\n, which traces the probability of endorsing an item across the latent variable continuum, and the\nitem information function\n, which shows the precision with which the item captures someone's location on latent variable continuum. Item information is often used as an index of an item's ability to differentiate between individuals with different latent trait scores. When graphed as an\nitem information curve\n(IIC), the point along the\nx\n-axis (\n\u03b8\n) at which information is highest reflects item severity (\nb\n), and the height of the IIC is a function of item discrimination (\na\n). In addition to evaluating item-level characteristics, one can evaluate the ability of a test as a whole to yield precise estimates of\n\u03b8\nacross the continuum of disability by summing all item information functions at each value of\n\u03b8\nto yield the test's\ntotal information\n(\nI\n) function. The inverse of test information in IRT is somewhat analogous to the standard error of measurement (SEM) in CTT; however, unlike the SEM in CTT, IRT test information exhibits a different value depending on the respondent's location on the latent variable continuum (see p. 3 of an earlier work by Weiss).\n49\n\nGlasgow Outcome Scale\u2013Extended item reorganization and modifications\nTable 1\nsummarizes how we coded item responses to the structured interview\n16\nfor IRT analysis (highly similar to the approach taken by Hong and colleagues\n41\n). First, item 1 (ability to obey commands) was not included in the analyses given that it was a constant in this sample. Second, items concerning pre-injury status (not depicted in\nTable 1\n) were excluded, because these items were intended to facilitate ratings that reflect post-injury function\nrelative\nto pre-injury function, but should not otherwise inform current function (see p. 576 of Wilson and colleagues).\n16\nThird, the rating scales of all items were scaled such that endorsement or higher scores reflected greater functional limitations (i.e., less independence, reduced work capacity, etc.). Fourth, for domains in which endorsement of the first item (2a, 5a, 6a, and 7a) requires response to a subsequent item concerning the\nextent\nof impairment (2b, 5b, 6b, and 7b), \u201ca\u201d items were merged with \u201cb\u201d items to form combined 3-point (0, 1, and 2) or 4-point (0, 1, 2, and 3) ordinal items. The three new items retained the \u201cb\u201d designation whereas the \u201ca\u201d items were dropped from the models. However, the effect of low endorsement rates (<10%) on the Independence in the Home item (2b) and high correlations (\nr\n=\u20090.86 at 3 months;\nr\n=\u20090.92 at 6 months) between the two Independence Outside the Home items (3a, 4a) produced perfectly discriminating (Guttman-type) items with slopes >5, requiring further item modification.\n50\nWe then combined items 3a and 4a into a single dichotomous item where only cases endorsing both items in the pair were coded 1 (impairment) and cases endorsing neither or one of the items in the pair were coded 0 (none or some impairment). However, item 2 and item 3/4 remained highly correlated and, when introduced within the same IRT model, continued to yield discrimination values >5. Because combining these items did not remedy this issue, we primarily report the findings excluding item 2 from the model, but describe how item 2 performed in supplemental analyses in the prose.\n\nStatistical analysis\nItem response theory assumptions and model appropriateness\nMost IRT analyses assume unidimensionality (i.e., that items measure a single underlying latent trait), monotonicity (that items either are all positively or all negatively related to the total score), and local independence (that only the latent trait influence item endorsement).\n51\nThese assumptions were tested using the 3- and 6-month samples. There is not a universally accepted approach to determining that data are sufficiently unidimensional to perform IRT analyses. Following common recommendations, we primarily tested this by evaluating the fit of a one-factor confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model.\nWe report the findings using robust unweighted least squares (ULSMV) estimation because of the high degree of skew (and therefore likely multi-variate non-normality of the data) and based on a published simulation study finding ULSMV to perform better than maximum likelihood estimation with data similar in form to the GOSE.\n52\nA disadvantage of estimation methods for categorical data is that, unlike full information maximum likelihood estimation procedures, they are not robust to data that are missing at random (MAR). To avoid knowingly submitting data to the model that were MAR, we opted to only analyze data for individuals who were working pre-injury (i.e., we excluded cases that had missingness on item 5 because of the question being irrelevant). This necessarily limits the applicability of the reported results to such individuals.\nCommon recommendations to consider a CFA model to fit well are root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) <0.05 or <0.06 (although <0.08 has been described as fair) and comparative fit index (CFI)/Tucker Lewis index (TLI) >0.95 (but acceptable if >0.90).\n53\n,\n54\nHowever, these cutoffs are based on work done with interval-level data and maximum likelihood estimation, and there are no well-established cutoffs at this time for categorical data and associated estimation approaches. Because it was our goal to use IRT analyses to provide diagnostic clues about areas for improvement of the GOSE and because of uncertainty in the appropriateness of these cutoffs for our data, we deemed it acceptable to apply these decision rules rather loosely so long as the data appeared reasonably unidimensional. Second, we also evaluated internal consistency reliability of the item set at both 3 and 6 months. Total omega (with bias-corrected and accelerated confidence intervals) was selected over coefficient alpha because of its less-restrictive assumptions (as recommended by Dunn and colleagues\n55\n). We considered 0.70 as an accepted minimum level of internal consistency reliability.\n56\nPoint-biserial correlations between GOSE total scores and dichotomized (endorsed/not endorsed) items\n57\n,\n58\n(range\nr\n=\u2009\u22120.31 to \u22120.77) indicated that, at both time points, the six items were reasonably monotonic. IRT models were then fit at both time points to assess local dependence. All local dependence \u03c7\n2\nvalues at 3 months were below the lower (optimal) threshold of |5|.\n59\nFor the IRT analyses, we selected a two-parameter/graded response (2PL/GR) hybrid model over a one-parameter (1PL) equivalent of this model (1PL/partial credit hybrid model). Whereas \u201ctwo parameters\u201d reflects the separate estimation of difficulty and discrimination parameters for each item, the term \u201c2PL\u201d is typically reserved for two-parameter models fit with dichotomous items, whereas the GR model represents an extension of the two-parameter model that uses polytomous items. An advantage of IRT is its flexibility in placing items with different numbers of response options onto the same (theta) scale. Our selection of the 2PL/GR model was based on an\na priori\npreference to allow items to vary in discrimination, a decision that was supported statistically by our finding that the 2PL/GR model fit better (by likelihood ratio test) than a model where discrimination parameters were fixed across items.\n2\u2020\nIn particular, significant likelihood ratio tests performed at 3 months (\n\u03c7\n2\n[4]\n=\u2009125.11;\np\n<\u20090.001) and 6 months (\n\u03c7\n2\n[4]\n=\u2009101.05;\np\n<\u20090.001) indicated that one or more items differed in discrimination from each other at each time point.\n59\nFinally, patient-level IRT scores (response pattern-based\nexpected a priori\nscores)\n60\nwere computed from the final 3- and 6-month IRT models for correlation with GOSE overall scores. For a handful of cases (11 at 3 months, 4 at 6 months), our strategy for recoding items 3 and 4 (i.e., coding endorsement of only one of these two items to reflect lack of impairment in Independence Outside the Home), while necessary to fit an acceptable IRT model, carried the potential to underestimate the relationship between traditional and IRT-based GOSE scores for non-substantive reasons. These cases are denoted with separate markers (squares) in\nFigure 3A\nand were not used to compute correlations.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nScatterplot of GOSE total scores crossed by IRT theta (\u03b8)\nz\n-scores at 3 and 6 months post-injury. Circles denote individual cases. Squares denote cases in which item recoding procedures necessary for IRT analyses introduced the potential to artificially deflate the association between traditional and IRT-based GOSE scores. These cases were not included in correlational analyses. Higher theta scores (rightward on\nx\n-axis) reflect greater latent impairment whereas lower GOSE total scores (downward on the\ny\n-axis) reflect poorer global outcome. Although the overall distribution of cases at both time points support the expected negative association between latent impairment and GOSE total scores (greater impairment \u223c lower GOSE total score), there was substantial variability of latent impairment occurring within the GOSE outcome categories 3 through 7.

We did not include those who died or were lost to follow-up before the first COBRIT outcome assessment at 1 month (\nn\n=\u2009167).\n\nClassification of TBI\nCOBRIT classified TBI using a combination of GCS score and specified computed tomographic (CT) findings. CT criteria were: \u226510\u2009mm total diameter of all intraparenchwoymal hemorrhages, acute extra-axial hematoma \u22655\u2009mm thick, subarachnoid hemorrhage visible on at least contiguous 5mm slices or at least three contiguous 3\u2009mm slices, intraventricular hemorrhage present on two slices, or \u22655\u2009mm midline shift.\n4\nComplicated mild TBI was defined as GCS 13\u201315 meeting the abovementioned CT criteria. Moderate to severe TBI were defined as pre-paralytic GCS 3\u201312 with motor score \u22645 or GCS 3\u201312 with motor score 6 (and meeting any of the CT criteria), or post-paralytic GCS 3T\u201311T (and meeting any of the CT criteria). Patients with mild, uncomplicated TBI (e.g., GCS 13\u201315 not meeting any CT criteria) were excluded from COBRIT and, therefore, this analysis does not apply to those with these milder forms of TBI.\n\nOutcome\nAlthough COBRIT's primary outcome was a 3 month binary composite metric of function and cognition, the primary outcome in this analysis is functional recovery as measured at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after TBI according to the GOSE, the most widely used functional outcome assessment in TBI research.\n32\n,\n33\nThe GOSE is an ordinal scale ranging from 1 to 8 as follows: 1-dead, 2-in a vegetative state, 3-lower severe disability, 4-upper severe disability, 5-lower moderate disability, 6-upper moderate disability, 7-lower good recovery and 8-upper good recovery. A total of 76.3% of patients had complete GOSE data at all three time points; 15.8% of patients had one missing time point and 7.9% of patients had two missing time points.\n\nBaseline predictors\nDetails of baseline data collection in COBRIT have been previously reported.\n4\n,\n34\nFor the present analysis, given our dual goals of describing the baseline phenotype of patients with different distinct recovery trajectories and demonstrating face validity and key baseline predictors of LCMM-based trajectories, we studied demographics, all coded comorbidities with at least a 5% overall prevalence in the study cohort, and all coded baseline TBI and injury variables that have been previously shown to be predictive of cross-sectional functional outcome after TBI.\n35\u201338\nThese included the following baseline demographics and pre-existing medical conditions: age, sex, race, ethnicity, living situation, educational attainment, employment status, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, psychiatric condition, and diabetes; the following TBI and acute medical characteristics upon presentation: GCS score (< 9, 9\u201312, 13\u201315), post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), TBI mechanism, international normalized ratio (INR), hypotension (lowest systolic blood pressure <90\u2009mm Hg), hypoxia (lowest oxygen saturation <90), highest glucose, hemoglobin, and presence of major extra cranial trauma (non-head Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS] score \u22653); and the following pathoanatomical features on initial head CT: midline shift, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH), subdural hemorrhage (SDH), epidural hemorrhage (EDH), and compression of mesencephalic cisterns. We additionally assessed for an effect of study site and treatment arm (citicoline vs. placebo). It is of note that less than 1% of the study population was coded as having a history of prior TBI, indicating substantial under-reporting,\n39\nand, therefore, this baseline predictor was not included in the analysis.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll analyses were conducted using Stata 15,\n40\nSAS 9.4,\n41\nR 3.4,\n42\nor RStudio 1.0 statistical software.\nData-driven discovery of trajectory classes and approach to model selection\nUsing the LCMM 1.7.8 package in R (\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.00890.pdf\n),\n19\nwe used unconditional LCMM\n19\nfor ordinal data to model GOSE functional recovery trajectories over time and to classify patients into distinct latent trajectory classes. The only variables used to infer latent class were subject, GOSE, and time. We chose to use unconditional LCMM (instead of conditional LCMM), because our primary aim was to describe the \u201craw\u201d latent GOSE trajectories in the population without imposing any conditions/predictors on the model, whereas our secondary aim was to then explore predictors of these unconditional trajectories. LCMM assumes that the population is heterogeneous and is divided into distinct groups, with each group having its own trajectory of GOSE versus time. LCMM, like other likelihood-based methods, can analyze data with missing observations. As long as missing observations are missing in a way that depends only on observed values, then the estimates will be unbiased.\n43\nStarting with a one-class model, we fitted models with increasing numbers of classes until we reached the inflection point of the Akaike information criterion (AIC). The AIC is a way to identify the point at which the benefits of improved model fit are outweighed by the cost of model complexity. We additionally examined the log likelihood, a measure of goodness of model fit regardless of model complexity, and the Bayesian information criteria (BIC). The BIC is similar to the AIC but has a slightly different threshold such that increased model complexity is penalized more heavily than it is in the AIC, generally resulting in an inflection point at a less complex model. Next, we estimated the posterior probabilities of membership for each patient in each trajectory class using the maximum probability assignment rule of Strauss and coworkers,\n44\nand then assigned each individual patient to the class with their highest predicted probability of membership. We plotted the mean GOSE trajectory of all patients assigned to each class for each of the models. We visualized the flow of patients between classes in each successive model using a river plot.\n45\nThe final model was then selected based on both statistical (log likelihood, AIC, BIC) and clinical (class size, distinctness of class-specific trajectories, likelihood of class membership based on posterior probabilities, impact of missing GOSE time points) considerations.\nModel-based validation and identification of predictors of trajectory classes\nAfter selecting the final model and classifying each patient into a specific latent class, we used \u03c7\n2\ntests for categorical variables and Kruskal\u2013Wallis tests for continuous variables to examine baseline characteristics by trajectory class including treatment effects and the interaction of treatment with TBI severity (GCS <13 vs. 13\u201315). Next, multinomial logistic models were used to investigate the role of different baseline predictors in predicting the heterogeneous trajectories (i.e., latent class membership). Because there is no clear consensus regarding the optimal approach or stopping rule for variable selection, we used three different variable selection methods and three different stopping rules to achieve our exploratory aim of identifying significant independent baseline predictors of recovery trajectories, as follows:\n1.\nBackward elimination:\n46\nwe started with the maximum model with all available baseline predictors and performed backward elimination, omitting predictors with the largest\np\nvalue first. We ran the model three times with the following stopping rules: (1)\np\n<\u20090.05 and then best model selected using AIC, (2)\np\n<\u20090.05 only, and (3)\np\n<\u20090.1 only. The advantage of backward selection is that all variables are initially allowed to compete or work all together in the model, thus estimating their joint predictive capability.\n2.\nForward selection: we started with an intercept-only model and performed forward selection, adding predictors with the smallest\np\nvalue (based on the score test\n47\n,\n48\n) first, and stopping using the same three stopping rules described previously. The advantage of forward selection is that it does not depend on possibly ill-conditioned models with many variables, and adding one variable at a time does not reduce the sample size because of missing values of variables not ultimately included in the model (which is not the case for backward elimination).\n3.\nForward stepwise selection: This approach is similar to forward selection except that variables may be dropped as others are added. This model was run three times with the same three stopping rules described previously.\nEach variable selection model was run to select predictors of membership across all trajectory classes and again to specifically select predictors of a pairwise comparison between the largest trajectory class and one other (determined based on clinical considerations), so as to more granularly investigate the specific magnitude and direction of the effect of the selected variables. Lastly, variables selected via any of the selection models or stopping rules were then included in a single final multivariable logistic regression model, and odds ratios were estimated to illustrate the clinical impact of each selected predictor on recovery trajectory."

    "Methods": "Study design\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of data that were prospectively collected at the Vancouver General Hospital as part of the Rick Hansen Spinal Cord Injury Registry (RHSCIR) in Canada. RHSCIR is an ongoing multi-center prospective observational study of patients with acute traumatic spinal cord injuries, and the Vancouver General Hospital is a major academic quaternary care referral center that is part of the RHSCIR network. We obtained local Research Ethics Board approval prior to enrolling patients, collecting data, and performing this study. Further descriptions of the RHSCIR data elements, procedures, governance structure, and privacy and confidentiality framework have been previously reported.\n13\n\nPatient sample\nWe included all patients enrolled from May 2004 to February 2018 that met the eligibility criteria reported by Tanadini and colleagues of presenting with complete American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS) A acute traumatic cervical spinal cord injuries with baseline motor levels at C4 to C6 on the right side of their bodies.\n8\nWe excluded patients with incomplete baseline or follow-up neurological examinations. We also excluded patients whose baseline neurological examinations were recorded more than two weeks after their injuries, or whose discharge neurological examinations occurred at less than 5 months post-injury.\n\nData sources\nAll data were collected by trained research personnel and entered into the standardized local RHSCIR database before being exported to the RHSCIR national office for centralized quality checks. We extracted age, motor level (right body side), bilateral sensory and motor scores, and zones of partial preservation for analysis as baseline predictors.\n8\nWe also extracted patients' age at injury, mechanism of injury, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, Injury Severity Score (ISS), and data on whether they were treated with surgery as descriptors of our cohort. Missing or ambiguous data were reconciled with local research coordinators, hospital health records, and medical chart abstraction whenever possible.\nNeurological examinations were performed according to the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) by trained physicians, nurse practitioners, or physiotherapists.\n14\nISNCSCI total motor scores (TMS) can range from 0 (absent motor function) to 100 (intact motor function) and comprise UEMS (range 0\u201350) and lower extremity motor scores (range 0\u201350). Zones of partial preservation (ZPP) refer to segments caudal to the ISNCSCI neurological levels where there is partial preservation motor or sensory function. ISNCSCI records were processed through a validated computerized algorithm that maintained consistency and high quality.\n15\nWe considered baseline motor scores to be those obtained on admission to acute care and final motor scores to be those obtained at the time of discharge to the community from acute care or inpatient rehabilitation.\n\nStatistical analysis\nURP-CTREE recursively partitions samples into binary tree configurations that maximize goodness of fit according to two-sample linear statistics.\n12\nIt produces models with branch points that occur sequentially at predictors whose univariate associations to the outcome of interest are greatest, and whose splits at each predictor are most efficient in comparison to all other potential splits. Branching continues until the remaining predictors do not have statistically significant univariate associations. In this study, we applied the existing URP-CTREE model reported by Tanadini and colleagues and partitioned our sample according to the predictors and splits derived from EMSCI as if they were being used to stratify enrollment in a clinical trial.\n8\nWe report discrete variables as counts or proportions, normally distributed continuous variables as means with standard deviations (SDs), and skewed continuous variables as medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs). We used parametric tests for data with normal distributions and non-parametric tests for data without normal distributions. We tested univariate associations with the Pearson correlation coefficient and differences between medians with the Mann-Whitney U test. We considered recovery to be correctly predicted when final UEMS scores were within a pre-specified threshold of 9 points from the median in each group, because that threshold was recently used in the sample size calculation of a current definitive randomized controlled trial of a neuroprotective agent in patients with acute traumatic complete and incomplete cervical SCI.\n16\nWe also performed a sensitivity analysis with a threshold of 5 points because studies of complete SCI might implement a narrower change. Patients with missing data were excluded from each analysis and imputations were not performed. All tests of significance were two-tailed and\np\nvalues of less than 0.05 were considered significant except when Bonferroni corrections were applied to adjust for multiple testing. Boxplots depict medians, the first and third quartiles (Q1 and Q3, respectively), and outliers more than 1.5 IQRs beyond Q1 and Q3. Probability density plots present the probability of an enrolled patients being partitioned into each node. We performed our analyses with Excel 2011 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA), and IBM SPSS Version 21, 2012 (SPSS Inc., Chicago IL)."

    "Methods": "Study population\nSubjects with severe TBI were enrolled in one of several observational or clinical trial studies and admitted to the neurosurgical ICU of the Ben Taub General Hospital (BTGH) located in Houston, Texas, in two different time periods: between 1989 and 2000 (training set), or between 2006 and 2012 (test set). On hospital admission, demographic and clinical data were collected. In the ICU, physiological data such as ICP, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and oxygen saturation of arterial blood (SaO\n2\n) were recorded by a monitor every 36\u2009sec. In addition to automated recording of patient physiology, vital sign data were collected by ICU nurse practitioners hourly. Among other functional outcome measures, the GOS was measured at 6 months post-injury.\nIn this study, we were interested in building prognostic models for 6-month GOS,\n14\ndichotomized in unfavorable (severe disability, vegetative, or dead) versus favorable (good recovery, moderate disability). The BTGH hospital admission and first day ICU data were used to build our models. Although in the original data the cohorts combined comprised 1239 patients, our population consisted of 630 TBI patients after excluding subjects who met the following exclusion criteria, in the order described: died within the first 24\u2009h after injury or date of death could not be determined (\nn\n=\u20095); had gunshot wounds or unknown mechanism of injury (\nn\n=\u2009157); had GOS missing 6 months after injury (\nn\n=\u2009238); and had missing automated physiological data throughout the 24-h period or physiological data could not be recovered (\nn\n=\u2009209).\nPatients considered for this analysis were enrolled under informed consent from a legally authorized representative or an exception from informed consent mechanism, depending on each study Institutional Review Board protocol. The use of these data was approved by the Institutional Review Board of University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (protocol HSC-SPH-16-0591).\n\nParticipating studies in the BTGH database\nThe observational studies conducted throughout the years 1989\u20132000 included studies of jugular venous oxygen saturation, brain tissue pO\n2\n, cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood flow autoregulation, and microdialysis monitoring.\n15\u201320\nThe inclusion criteria for these studies was motor GCS <6 on admission or within 48\u2009h after injury, and age >14. The exclusion criteria were GCS 3 with fixed and dilated pupils and severe associated systemic injury.\nA randomized trial of ICU management comparing a cerebral blood flow targeted management strategy to an intracranial pressure targeted management strategy was conducted between 1994 and 1997.\n21\nThe inclusion criteria for the trial was motor GCS <6 or deteriorated to motor GCS <6 within 48\u2009h after injury, age >14, and admission within 12\u2009h of injury. The exclusion criteria were GCS 3 with fixed and dilated pupils, contraindication to placement of jugular bulb catheter, severe associated systemic injury, and severe pre-existing disease.\nA clinical trial conducted between 2006 and 2012 enrolled patients with motor GCS <6 after resuscitation within 6\u2009h of injury. Exclusion criteria were GCS 3 with fixed and dilated pupils, penetrating trauma, pregnancy, life-threatening systemic injury, and severe pre-existing disease.\n22\nExcept for the clinical trial conducted between 2006 and 2012 (the test set of our study), the rest of the studies did not exclude penetrating injuries.\n\nPredictors of 6-month GOS\nSeveral non-dynamic (baseline or static) and dynamic (longitudinal) predictors were considered during model building. Baseline predictors consisted of hospital admission variables and scores derived from these ones. Physiological, injury severity, and treatment variables recorded during the first 24\u2009h after ICU admission were defined as dynamic predictors. A full list of dynamic covariates included in our models, the pre-processing and imputation of the physiological variables, and additional details can be found in the\nSupplementary Appendix 1\nand\nSupplementary Appendix 2\n.\n\nModel building, testing, and calibration\nTo build the 6-month GOS prognostic models, the data collected in the period 1989\u20132000 were used for model training (\nn\n=\u2009472), and the data gathered between 2006 and 2012 for model testing (\nn\n=\u2009158). In the training and test sets, 63% and 66% of the patients had unfavorable 6-month GOS, respectively. First, we computed the non-dynamic and dynamic predictors previously described for each subject and applied the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to select a subset of most predictive variables. The LASSO penalizes the absolute magnitude of the coefficients in the logistic regression model and drops variables that do not contribute to making the model's prediction closer to the true response.\n23\nAdditionally, LASSO helps to prevent overfitting of models and is often used for datasets where the number of predictive variables is much larger than the number of observations.\nSecond, the subset of features chosen by LASSO was used as input variables for different machine learning algorithms. Because in general there is not a single method that dominates all others in terms of classification performance, we applied various supervised learning algorithms on the training data and chose the one that gave the highest classification accuracy in the test set. The supervised learning algorithms considered were decision trees, random forests (RF), support vector machines, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis, and logistic regression (LR).\n24\nWe also used the shrunk LASSO coefficients from the selected model in the first step to make predictions. Some details about these algorithms can be found in the\nSupplementary Appendix 3\n. The AUC in the test set was used to determine model discrimination.\n\nStatistical analysis\nFor the chosen model, we evaluated overall model performance using the scaled Brier score (the scaled Brier score of a perfect model is 0%). We also computed sensitivity, for specificities of 80%, 85%, and 90%. The rationale for setting high values of specificity is that a false diagnosis of a poor neurological outcome has more serious implications than erroneously predicting a favorable outcome.\nThe scale of continuous variables in the chosen model was assessed by testing the significance of spline terms in a restrictive cubic spline model.\n25\nModel calibration was assessed with the Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) statistic, calibration slope, and calibration-in-the-large. A good calibrated model should have a HL associated\np\nvalue above 0.05, calibration-in-the-large close to 0, and a calibration slope close to 1.\n26\nSensitivity analyses\nBecause the LASSO may not pick the most predictive covariates among highly correlated predictors, we also tried random forests for selection of the most important covariates from the full set of features. In addition, we modified the imputation method, pooling 1\u2009h instead of 2\u2009h of self-patient data to complete missing physiology. To assess temporal confounding (e.g., differences in populations heterogeneity), we mixed the two study cohorts, including different patients from the same period in training and test sets."

    "Methods": "Animals\nTwenty-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). All animals used in the study (total\nn\n=\u200915; 5/group) received a laminectomy, before which mice were anaesthetized with continuous inhalation of 2\u20135% isofluorane and administered 1\u2009mL of lactated Ringer's solution and 5\u2009mg/kg of carprofen. The area around T10 was shaved, cleaned with 70% ethanol, and sterilized with betaiodine solution. A 2-cm incision was then made along the spine, and the tenth thoracic vertebra was carefully exposed by blunt dissection and the vertebral arch was removed by a laminectomy. Sham animals had the dura of the spinal cord exposed, and the incision was promptly sutured. Animals selected for SCI received a complete transection of the spinal cord with sharp surgical scissors between T9 and T10, and an inert gel material was placed in the space to prohibit the refusion of the spinal cord. The incision site was then sutured.\nPost-operatively, animals were immediately placed in clean cages on a 38\u00b0C warming pad and continuously monitored for 3\u2009h. Cages remained on warming pads for an additional 21\u2009h. Mice were treated with Baytril and carprofen for 3 days after surgery, then as needed, and bladders were manually expressed two to three times daily. Animals were sacrificed at 7 days post-surgery (sham and 7-day SCI) or 28 days post-SCI. The gastrocnemius was collected by excision after separation from surrounding tissues and muscles by blunt dissection under isofluorane anesthesia, weighed, and then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane for subsequent biochemical analyses. The gastrocnemius was chosen for analysis because it has sufficient mass after paralysis for all biochemical assays as described below. All procedures performed on animals were reviewed and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at the James J. Peters VA Medical Center (Bronx, NY).\n\nMetabolomics analysis\nThe left gastrocnemius was sent on dry ice to West Coast Metabolomics, a regional NIH Resource Core, at the University of California\u2013Davis (Davis, CA) for untargeted primary metabolomics analyses using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectroscopy. Data acquisition and processing were completed as reported in detail\n25\n; similar techniques have been used for mouse skeletal muscle.\n26\nData are reported as peak spectral heights and matched to known metabolites by the BinBase algorithm. Unknown spectra were given numeric IDs and analyzed when noted.\n\nSodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western immunoblotting\nOne half of the right gastrocnemius was homogenized by an automated bead homogenizer (FastPrep24; MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) with a cocktail of 1:10 (w/v) of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors (Halt Protease and Phosphatase Cocktail; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Homogenates were placed on ice for 10\u2009min and centrifuged at 14,000\ng\nfor 15\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until analysis. Protein content was determined by micro bicinchoninic acid using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the reference standard (Pierce Scientific, Rockford, IL).\nProtein homogenate (60\u2009\u03bcg) was mixed 1:1 with 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009Laemmli sample buffer, supplemented with 5% \u03b2-mercaptoenthanol. Samples were boiled for 5\u2009min and run through 4\u201320% pre-cast gradient polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) for 60\u201390\u2009min at 180\u2009V and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were stained with Ponceau S and photographed with a charge-coupled device (CCD) digital camera (Amersham Imager 600; GE Amersham, Amersham, UK), destained with a 10-min rinse in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST), and blocked with 5% BSA-TBST (w/v) for 60\u2009min. Membranes were then incubated with 1% BSA-TBST buffer containing appropriate primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C. All primary antibodies were used at a 1:1000 ratio. The list of antibodies and catalog numbers can be found in\nSupplementary Table S1\n. Membranes were then placed in TBST for three 10-min washes and incubated in 1% skim milk/TBST with an horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000 ratio) for 60\u2009min at room temperature. Membranes were rinsed as before in TBST, placed into an HRP-based chemilumenscent detection solution (ECL Prime; GE Amersham) for 5\u2009min, and then imaged using a CCD digital imager. Densitometry was determined using Image Lab software (Bio-Rad). Lysate from the gastrocnemius of a healthy mouse was used on every gel as an internal control, and protein expression was normalized using whole-lane densitometry values after a Ponceau stain.\n27\n\nRNA Isolation and real-time polymerase chain reaction\nTotal RNA from the remaining portion of the right gastrocnemius was isolated after bead homogenization and RNA separation using Trizol/chloroform extraction and column centrifugation using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer's guidelines. RNA concentration and purity were measured using a Nanodrop 1000, and all samples had 260/280 ratios over 1.8. A complementary DNA (cDNA) library was generated from 1\u2009\u03bcg of the isolated RNA using a High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit and following the manufacturer's guidelines (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). cDNA was diluted 1:10 in nuclease-free water and loaded into 384-well plates with Taqman primers and probes and 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009Taqman Universal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Mastermix, both obtained from Applied Biosystems. The list of Taqman gene expression assays and catalog numbers can be found in\nSupplementary Table S2\n. Real-time PCR was performed using a Quantstudio 12k Flex system, and data were compared as relative differences in fold-change versus the geometric mean of 18S ribosomal RNA and \u03b2-2 microglobulin.\n28\n\nStatistical analyses\nFor metabolomics analysis, MetaboAnalyst 4.0\n29\nand Metabox\n30\nwere used to process data and generate figures. Heatmaps were generated using a Euclidean distance measurement with a Ward clustering algorithm. One-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) following normalization to the median with Pareto scaling\n31\nwere used to determine\np\nvalues with further exclusions using a false discovery rate (FDR) exclusion of\nq\nvalues when\np\n>\u20090.05. Follow-up pair-wise comparisons were done using Tukey's post hoc. Group means for muscle weights, messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and protein expression were compared using one-way ANOVAs with Tukey's post hoc, when applicable, using Prism software (version 7; GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA), and the results are presented as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM)."

We will seek to publish regular updates.\n\nSearch methods for identification of studies\nIn May 2014, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and CINAHL (all via National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Healthcare Databases) and Google Scholar were searched for published studies, and conference abstracts published in peer reviewed journals indexed in the above databases. Developed with search experts at Monash University's National Trauma Research Institute, the search strategies used a combination of keywords and MeSH terms (\nSupplementary Appendix 2\n: Search Strategies). Study reference lists were manually reviewed to identify relevant publications not identified by the search strategy. Conference abstracts prompted further PubMed searches to discover whether the data had subsequently been published in full. Searches were re-run in August 2015, November 2016 and December 2017 using the identical protocol.\n\nSelection criteria\nCitations were downloaded into Endnote (Thomson Reuters), duplicates removed, and were then screened by one author (CAM) on title/abstract using the following selection criteria:\n1.\nAdult TBI patients (aged over 16 years).\n2.\nA functional outcome measure of any type, reported by patient genotype\u2014this included the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E), modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Disability Rating Scale (DRS), Neurobehavioral Rating Scale (NRS), as well as neuropsychological measures.\n3.\nEnglish language.\nStudies were excluded if they dealt with\nin vitro\n/animal work, or included non-TBI/pediatric patients and did not report separate outcome data for the adult TBI cohort. Studies reporting nonfunctional outcome measures, such as histological findings at post mortem, were also excluded.\nAfter screening, the remaining citations were reviewed in full text independently by two authors (CAM and VFJN/FAZ) to assess them for eligibility. Disagreements regarding eligibility were resolved by consensus, and referral to a third reviewer (DKM) was not required.\n\nQuality assessment\nRisk of bias was assessed using the Quality In Prognostic Studies (QuIPS) criteria, a validated domain-based tool for quality assessment of prognostic studies.\n14\nTwo authors (CAM and VFJN/FAZ) independently completed the QuIPS for each study, and then reached a final judgement on each of the six domains by consensus. In line with the guidance given by the team who developed QuIPS, no overall rating of quality is assigned to each study.\n\nData extraction\nCitations and full text files were uploaded to Covidence (\nwww.covidence.org\n). Two authors (CAM, and either VFJN or FAZ) worked independently, resolving disagreements through consensus. The following characteristics were extracted:\n1.\nInclusion/exclusion criteria.\n2.\nBaseline characteristics, where possible for each genotype within the cohort:\na.\u2002Cohort gender composition.\nb.\u2002Age (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation [SD] if available).\nc.\u2002TBI severity according to the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) which was quantified, wherever possible, as mean GCS\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, or GCS grouped according to existing guidelines for classification.\n15\n3.\nOutcome data (see below).\n4.\nFunding source(s).\nIn the case of studies covering global functional outcomes (e.g., GOS/GOS-E, mRS, NRS, DRS, mortality), scores were extracted at all available time-points for each genotype. The total numbers of patients assigned a given score at each time-point were extracted and used to calculate the number of patients with a \u201cfavorable\u201d outcome. Categorical scales were dichotomized in line with previously recognized methods for defining \u201cfavorable\u201d outcomes (i.e., GOS 4 to 5, GOS-E 5 to 8.)\n16\nWhen authors reported self-defined favorable or unfavorable outcomes without a breakdown of the underlying raw categorical data, this was extracted instead. If ordinal data were not available, the mean scores and standard deviations (or standard errors/95% confidence intervals) were extracted. In studies dealing with neuropsychological scales or other outcomes (e.g., measures of fatigue), reports of statistically significantly differences between genotype results (at the alpha level selected by the study's authors) were extracted, with a narrative note made of nonsignificant results. In the case of no significant results being reported, a narrative note of negative findings was made.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStudies were subdivided for analysis by outcome measures. Where studies were sufficiently homogenous (in terms of gene studied, patient characteristics, and outcome measured), they were pooled statistically using RevMan 5.3 (Nordic Cochrane Centre 2014).\n17\nOnly studies reporting global functional outcome scores in relation to APOE genotype were entered into meta-analysis.\nThe quality of evidence contributing to each pooled outcome was assessed according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework, modified for prognostic studies.\n18\nThis examines eight factors; six that can downgrade the evidence (phase of investigation, study limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, publication bias) and two that can increase it (moderate or large effect size, exposure\u2013response gradient).\nFor the meta-analysis, outcome was extracted for dichotomized genotypes (APOE4 carriers vs. non-carriers), with outcome scores dichotomized as GOS 4-5/GOS-E 5-8 representing a \u201cfavorable outcome.\u201d The primary meta-analysis was of outcome data at 6 months; one study (Ponsford and colleagues)\n19\ndid not report 6-month data, and so the next available time-point (12 months) was used instead. Throughout the review, where not otherwise specified, \u201cunfavorable outcome\u201d or \u201cpoor outcome\u201d is in reference to a GOS score of 1\u20133, or a GOS-E of 1\u20134, with \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cfavorable\u201d outcome referring to GOS 4\u20135 or GOS-E 5\u20138.\nWe employed the random effects model implemented in RevMan (Nordic Cochrane Centre 2014).\n17\nBetween-study heterogeneity was explored with the chi-squared test, and quantified using the I\n2\nstatistic. Significant heterogeneity was defined as I\n2\n> 50%. A pooled effect estimate for the total study population was calculated as Mantel-Haenzel odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (see\nhttp://handbook.cochrane.org/chapter_9/9_4_4_3_random_effects_method.htm\nfor details). We defined the clinical importance of the observed associations as small (odds ratio [OR] <2.5), moderate (2.5\u20134.25), or large (> 4.25), in line with the definition proposed in a recent Cochrane prognostic review.\n18\nSensitivity analysis\nDuring the data extraction process, it became clear that there was variation in the manner in which outcome data were reported and interpreted by authors. Willmott and colleagues\n20\nfor example use a GOS-E score of 7 to 8 (living independently/return to work) as a marker of \u201cgood recovery\u201d for their analyses. We recognize that identical odds ratios might be assumed if the GOS-E is considered as an ordinal scale, as is done with proportional odds regression analysis.\n21\nIn addition, some studies reported outcome data over significantly longer time scales, ranging from 36 months to 25 years. The time-point chosen for meta-analysis and outcome dichotomization employed was not based on\na priori\nscientific evidence, but reflected the most common practice of authors in the field.\nPost hoc\nsensitivity analyses were therefore constructed as follows:\n1.\nSix-month outcome data (or next available time-point) with GOS-E dichotomized in line with Willmott and colleagues.\n2.\nLast available time-point, with GOS 4/5 or GOS-E 5\u20138 representing \u201cfavorable outcome.\u201d\n3.\nLast available time-point, with the Wilmott dichotomization of GOS-E.\n4.\nSix-month outcome data (or next available time-point) but omitting studies rated as high risk of bias in one or more QuIPS domains.\nAssessment of publication bias\nFor studies included in the meta-analysis, we examined funnel plot asymmetry (which may indicate the presence of publication bias), using RevMan 5.3 software (the Nordic Cochrane Centre). Where data were unable to be pooled, we assessed the likelihood of publication bias qualitatively, based on included study characteristics and the advice of experts within and beyond the author team about the possibility of relevant unpublished studies."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nThe data for this research were collected at the Clinical Research Center at The Eye Institute of the Pennsylvania College of Optometry at Salus University (Elkins Park, PA) by an optometrist, one of the co-authors (L.G.). Healthy control subjects and test subjects with PCS were recruited from the local area. Average time since concussion was 6.5 months with a standard deviation of 3.1 months and a range of 3.0\u201312.5 months. Nine concussed (2 males) and 9 neurologically normal controls (6 males) participated. Average age was 30.8\u2009\u00b1\u200911 years for concussed subjects and 25.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4 years for controls. All subjects provided written informed consent before the experiments, which was approved by the Salus University's Institutional Review Board in accord with the Declaration of Helsinki. A history of past brain injury or concussion(s) was an exclusion criterion for the control group. Using standard subjective refraction methods, all subjects were refracted to best visual acuity with maximum plus. One concussed subject was a mild hyperope (1D OS, 0.75D OD), and 6 myopes were in the control group. No subject had refractive error more than \u22126D.\n\nSubject symptoms and clinical visual measurements\nSymptoms were measured using the PCSS and BIVSS for both controls and concussed subjects. The PCSS contains 22 questions to assess symptoms such as headache, fogginess, and dizziness.\n35\nThe PCSS uses a 0- (no symptom) to 6-point (severe symptom) Likert scale. Hence, the PCSS maximum possible score is 132. Normative data report that 89% of healthy control subjects report a 12 or lower on the PCSS while the average PCSS score for those with a concussion is 24.\n34\nFor this study, symptomatic is defined as reporting a PCSS score of \u226512. The BIVSS is a 28 self-administered query that assesses vision-related behaviors, including reading, light sensitivity, peripheral vision, dry eye, depth perception, diplopia, and eyesight clarity.\n29\nThe BIVSS uses a 5-point Likert scale of never, seldom, occasionally, frequently, and always which are recorded from 0 to 4, respectively. The highest possible score of the BIVSS is 112. Subjects who did not have survey scores are listed as not available (N/A).\n\nExperimental setup\nEye movements were quantified with ISCAN infrared (\u03bb\u2009=\u2009940\u2009nm) video-based cameras placed 38\u2009cm away from the subject's midline per the manufacturer's recommendation. Each camera sampled at 240 frames per second. Left and right eye movements were collected independently.\n36\u201339\nVisual stimuli were presented on a traditional haploscope (\nFig. 1A\n). Subjects were centered in front of two partially reflective mirrors where each mirror displayed the respective image from the monitor. Visual stimuli (\nFig. 1B\n) to the left and right eye were presented centered along the midsagittal plane.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\n(\nA\n) Haploscope experimental setup showing how the subject was positioned. All visual stimuli are presented on the midsagittal plane. (\nB\n) Visual stimuli presented to the left and right eye. The X is the instructed target to follow, and the O is the distractor that may or may not be presented during an experimental trial.\nThis experimental setup and instrumentation was identical to other studies.\n40\u201345\nThe subject was seated in an enclosed space with commercial blackout curtains to reduce proximal vergence cues. The entire system was controlled by a custom LabVIEW\u2122 2013 SP 1 Virtual Instrument (National Instruments, Austin, TX) program VisualEyes2020 (VE2020), which digitizes the eye movement signals using 16 bits.\n46\n\nExperimental design\nTwo 1-min calibrations were recorded. The calibration sequences consisted of six observations of monocular targets at 1, 3, and 5 degrees lateral to midline for each eye. This 6-point monocular calibration minimizes errors, which could potentially be introduced because of fixation disparity.\n47\nBinocular convergence and divergence demands which abruptly shift between 6 and 10 degrees were chosen for this experiment because 4-degree vergence steps elicit fewer saccadic responses compared to larger vergence movements of 6-degree vergence steps or more.\n48\u201353\nVisually demanding stimuli were presented in the presence of other distracting visual stimuli. Stimuli were chosen based upon a previous detailed study from our laboratory.\n54\nIn this study, we utilized six vergence stimuli with distractors and two distractor-free vergence stimuli for a total of eight types of vergence eye movement stimuli. The subject was instructed to fixate on the green \u201cX\u201d (called the \u201cinstructed target\u201d). The subject was also instructed not to fixate on the green \u201cO\u201d (called the \u201cdistractor stimulus\u201d). Both the X and O visual stimuli subtended an angle of 1.5 degrees in width and height against a homogenous black background (\nFig. 1B\n). The distractor-free testing sequence is demonstrated in\nFigure 2A\n. The stimulus begins at a binocular 6-degree angle of convergence demand\u2014and abruptly changes to a 10-degree angle of convergence demand. In other words, this stimulus is analogous to a clinician holding two targets along a patient's midsagittal plane and asking them to quickly alternate fixation between the closer and further target. The subject then perceives a net 4-degree symmetrical convergence disparity stimulus along the midsagittal plane. Similarly, we define divergence stimuli as those that begin at 10-degree convergence angular demand and end at 6-degree convergence angular demand, which is a net 4-degree change of relative divergence disparity.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nVergence stimuli showing the instructed target (red line) and the distracting target (blue line) presentation. (\nA\n) Distractor-free stimulus. (\nB\n) Visual stimulus when the distractor was the furthest away from the instructed vergence stimulus. (\nC\n) Visual stimulus when the distractor was the closest to the instructed vergence stimulus. (\nD\n) Visual stimulus when the distractor was in between the convergence and divergence stimulus. Presentation locations are denoted in binocular angular convergence demand (degrees) as a function of time (seconds). (\nE\n) Overall experimental sequence.\nThe same 4-degree convergence and 4-degree divergence step used within the distractor-free stimuli were presented for the stimuli that contained distractors. Note how the red line in\nFigure 2\n(the instructed target) is the same in\nFigure 2A\u2013D\n. However, in addition to a green X, a green O was also presented in\nFigure 2B\u2013D\n. The O appeared at an angular convergence demand of either 4, 8, or 12 degrees. Convergence and divergence 4-degree steps (where the instructed X targets were presented) also had the distracting O stimuli presented at a maximum or minimum distance from the instructed target (\nFig. 2B,C\n, respectively). The last visual stimulus paradigm had the visual distractor placed consistently at 8 degrees, which is midway between the 6- and 10-degree convergence angular demands of instructed targets (\nFig. 2D\n). We define this as the in-between response.\nStimuli were presented in 24-sec blocks; the distractor O was only presented to the subject for 1.5\u2009sec after each convergent or divergent step of the instructed target X (see\nFig. 2\n). The 24-sec block was presented six times each see (\nFig. 2E\n). There were 24 presentations of each stimulus within the experiment or 192 eye movement responses per subject. The four target/distractor group combinations (\nFig. 2A\u2013D\n) were presented randomly three times each to form one bin (\nFig. 2E\n). There were two bins in total (24\u2009sec for each visual paradigm for a total of 576\u2009sec per bin). The total experiment was around 18\u2009min in duration. The duration of 18\u2009min was selected to model other endurance stress tests, which last between 15 and 20\u2009min.\n55\nCalibration was around 2\u2009min in duration for a total of 20\u2009min of testing. After calibration was explained and performed, all subjects were instructed to keep the letter X single and ignore the distracting letter O when it appeared.\n\nEye movement data analysis\nThe data analyst was masked to the subject type (i.e., asymptomatic control or symptomatic concussed subject) during basic analysis to avoid any bias or skewing of results. Only when specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy were calculated was the data analyst aware of the subject type.\nVergence eye movements were calibrated using the monocular calibration values. Vergence position was calculated by subtracting the right- and left-eye positional data (in degrees), where convergent eye movements were plotted as positive. Individual vergence eye movement data were filtered using a second-order low-pass Butterworth filter with a cut-off frequency of 40\u2009Hz. The following metrics were obtained from each individual vergence eye movement response: 1) latency, 2) settling time, 3) peak velocity, and 4) response amplitude. Response latency was obtained by measuring the time when the vergence eye position increased from the initial vergence angle by an increment of 10% of the total stimulus movement. Hence, for this study that meant 0.4 degrees (see\nFig. 3\n). Settling time was obtained by finding the time at which the vergence eye position fluctuated by <5% of the responses steady state. Final response amplitude of the vergence eye movement was measured as the difference between the final and initial vergence angular demands (see\nFig. 3\n). A two-point central difference algorithm was used to compute the vergence velocity response.\n56\nThe maximum of the velocity was measured.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nVergence eye movement response (black line) showing how latency, settling time, and response amplitude were measured from the eye movement response.\nPercentage of trials of the total of 192 movements that contained blinks was tabulated. Past research on perceptual and cognitive tasks report that the number of blinks increases as a function of the duration of task time and suggest that blinks are associated with general fatigue.\n57\nA blink is easily identified because the eye movement signal saturates (measured as a maximum value possible within our system). A blink is counted in an eye movement response between the latency and settling time of the movement.\n\nBinocular Accuracy Index and Binocular Precision Index\nThe following two new metrics were developed to evaluate visual endurance: the Binocular Accuracy Index (BAI) and the Binocular Precision Index (BPI). Gain is a standard engineering term defined as the output divided by the input. For our application, it is the response amplitude (output) divided by the visual stimulus (input) for this application. Error is the difference between the final eye movement response and the instructed visual stimulus. Precision is a quantification of the variability between observations and is also known as the repeatability. For this study, precision is the ability to fixate on the same location repeatedly. Accuracy is an assessment of where the average eye movement response is compared to the desired response. The subjects are shown a 4-degree eye movement stimulus. Hence, good accuracy for this study means that, on average, the subject will produce a 4-degree response. However, the subject could make eye movements that are overconverged (say, 5 degrees) or underconverged (say, 3 degrees) and still be accurate if, on average, the response is 4 degrees. Ideally, it is desired that eye movements be accurate (on average, reaching the intended target of 4 degrees) and precise (repeatability of making the same movement).\nWe hypothesize that healthy control subjects may exhibit motor learning causing the precision and accuracy of the movements to improve as the VET progresses. Control subjects, based upon their symptom surveys, do not report that they fatigue easily. Hence, we hypothesize that their vergence responses may not substantially change during the VET or potentially improve because of motor learning. Conversely, we hypothesize that concussed subjects may exhibit a decrease in vergence precision and accuracy because of the common complaints of being easily distracted and fatigued in their survey symptoms. Both the BPI and the BAI utilize the response amplitude measured from the two distractor-free vergence responses and the six types of vergence responses with visual distractors present.\nThe BPI is calculated as follows. Variability of the response amplitude of the last four eye movements of each type of movement (distractor-free response, response with a maximum distractor, minimum distractor, and in-between distractor; denoted as \u03a9 in Eq. 1) is calculated for convergence as well as divergence. Variability of the response amplitude is then calculated using the first four eye movements of each movement type (denoted as \u03b1 in Eq. 1). The ratio of the variability of the response amplitude for the last four responses for each of the four movement types (denoted as C1, C2, C3, and C4 for convergence in Eq. 1 or D1, D2, D3, and D4 for divergence identical to Eq. 1) divided by the variability of the initial four responses for each of the four movement types are computed. There are two ratios calculated: one for the convergence responses and one for the divergence responses. The formula is shown in Equation 1 as the following.\nA ratio exactly equal to 1 means there was no variability between the last four and the initial four vergence eye movements. In other words, the vergence responses were stable or consistent throughout the VET. A ratio <1 means the movements showed increased variability toward the end of the vergence endurance test compared to the beginning of the test. A ratio of >1 means an improvement in the precision occurred as the experiment progressed which may occur as the subject becomes better or more familiar with performing the eye movement task. None of the subjects in this study have participated in a previous eye movement experiment; hence, motor learning is possible. The BPI investigates the variability within each movement type from the end of the experiment compared to the beginning of the experiment. The two ratios (one for convergence and then one for divergence) are then summed. A value of 2 means the subject consistently initiated the same response amplitudes throughout the experiment for both convergence and divergence. A value closer to 0 means there was a substantial change in response amplitude at the end of the VET compared to the beginning for both convergence and divergence. A value >2 means that the subject improved in performance.\nThe BAI is calculated as follows. First, error is defined as the absolute value of the difference between the 4-degree vergence stimulus and the actual response amplitude shown in Equation 2.\nIn this study, gain is the response amplitude divided by the stimulus amplitude (or 4 degrees) shown in Equation 3.\nThe BAI is assessed by calculating the error and gain of the first four responses at the beginning and the last four movements at the end of the VET. It is computed for convergence and then again for divergence using the distractor-free responses and the three types of vergence responses with distractors. For a subject who is consistent through the experiment, the change in error will be minimal. However, for a subject who may initially be able to initiate the vergence responses but then cannot initiate the responses toward the end of the VET, the error will increase (performance is degrading over time). For a subject who is consistent, the gain will remain constant throughout the experiment. However, for subjects who show a decrease in performance, then the gain will decrease as the experiment progresses. Vergence responses from normal controls are typically within 10% of the intended target.\n58\nThis 10% threshold was also identified with the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves.\nThe normal range for this study was defined to be 10% of the 4-degree vergence stimulus or 0.4 degrees. Hence, changes in errors or changes in gains below 10% where considered normal. Conversely, changes in errors or gains more than 10% where considered abnormal. The change in error and the change in gain were evaluated for each movement type. Hence, there were 16 measurements in total. Each response was quantified as normal (noted as a numerical 0) or abnormal (noted as a numerical 1). The range for the BAI was from 0 to 16. A BAI equal to 0 means the error for the eight movement types and the gains for the eight movement types did not substantially change or were stable as the VET progressed (performance was sustained). A BAI equal to 16 means all the errors for the eight movement types and the gains for the eight movement types substantially changed or showed, on average, a decrease in accuracy as the VET progressed (performance was degraded).\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe SPSS statistical package was utilized for all statistical calculations (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). Independent-samples\nt\n-tests were used to compare the control and concussed subjects' group data (\u03b1 \u2264 0.05). Normality was assessed before the statistical analysis using Levene's test, which measures equality of variance. The data were normally distributed. An outlier was defined as a measurement greater than 2 standard deviations from the average.\n59\nAt the conclusion of data analysis, subjects were divided into their respective groups of controls and concussed subjects. The following parameters were compared with the independent-samples\nt\n-tests: peak velocity, response amplitude, latency, and settling time for each of the eight types of movements (two distractor-free responses and six responses with distractors). The BPI, BAI, and percentage of movements of the 192 trials that contained blinks during the transient portion of the response were also compared with an independent-samples\nt\n-test between the control and concussed groups. Electrophysiology studies support that convergence and divergence are different cells.\n60\nFurther, burst and tonic cells which are assessed by the vergence peak velocity and vergence amplitude, respectively, are also different cells.\n61\nStatistically, the convergence and divergence peak velocity and final amplitude were treated as independent measures. For the parameters that showed statistically significant differences between groups, an ROC curve was calculated.\nROC curves were calculated for peak velocity and response amplitudes for convergence and divergence distractor-free responses. ROC curves were also computed for the BPI, BAI, and percentage of movements during the experiment with blinks between the latency and settling time. The ideal threshold is identified from the ROC curve by optimizing the best combined true positive rate (TPR) and true negative rate (TNR). The best sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were calculated for the parameters that were significantly different between the concussed and control groups. The following equations were used to assess sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy where TP is true positive, TN is true negative, FP is false positive, and FN is false negative (Eqs. 4\u20136):"

    "Methods": "Participants\nParticipants were 197 U.S. military service members enrolled prospectively in a larger study designed to examine the natural history of recovery from TBI in service members and veterans (i.e., 15-Year Longitudinal TBI Study, Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center [DVBIC]). Patients were targeted for recruitment and consent to the larger study if they presented to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC; Bethesda, MD) after an uncomplicated mild, complicated mild, moderate, severe, or penetrating TBI or if they did not sustain a TBI.\nParticipants were recruited from three primary sources at WRNMMC: (a) hospital inpatient wards (2010\u20132018), (b) DVBIC outpatient TBI clinic (2010\u20132016), (c) National Intrepid Center of Excellence (NICoE) intensive outpatient TBI program and outpatient TBI clinic (2017\u20132018). Patients were identified for potential inclusion via daily reviews of consecutive hospital admissions and/or attendance at outpatient clinics.\nParticipants were enrolled in the larger study if they were an active-duty service member or other Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS)-eligible (i.e., eligible to receive military benefits) veteran; and 18 years of age or older who could read and understand English. General exclusion criteria included: a lack of proficiency in conversational English or a history of significant neurological or psychiatric condition(s) unrelated to the injury event or deployment (e.g., meningioma, bipolar disorder).\nFor the purposes of this study, participants were selected from a larger sample of 209 patients who had (\nn\n=\u2009164) or had not (\nn\n=\u200945) sustained TBI and had completed a blood draw. Patients were selected for inclusion in the final sample if they had tau and A\u03b242 levels with a coefficient of variation less than 0.20. This resulted in a final sample of 155 participants with a history of TBI and 42 controls. For many of the analyses, participants were separated into four groups: (1) controls (no lifetime history of TBI), (2) uncomplicated mild TBI, (3) complicated mild TBI, (4) moderate+ TBI (moderate, moderate-severe, severe, or penetrating TBI).\nFor the analyses investigating the relationship between tau/A\u03b242 and cognition in TBI patients, patients were excluded if they failed performance validity tests or symptom validity tests (specific criteria described below), did not complete the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist\u2014civilian version (PCL-C), or did not complete each of the 20 measures included in the cognitive domain scores, resulting in a final sample size of 114. For analyses investigating the relationship between tau/A\u03b242 and white matter integrity in patients with TBI, patients were excluded if they did not undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning or if the scan was of insufficient quality to compute all targeted diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics, resulting in a final sample size of 88.\n\nTBI evaluation and classification\nDiagnosis and classification of TBI were based on information gathered via medical record review and a comprehensive lifetime TBI history interview undertaken by clinical research personnel. The comprehensive lifetime TBI history interview was completed by Masters-level clinical research personnel who were trained specifically (by RTL and SML) to evaluate the presence and severity of TBI.\nThe TBI history interview consisted of the Ohio State University TBI identification method and an extended semi-structured clinical interview designed to (a) extract more detailed information to estimate the presence/duration of loss of consciousness (LOC), post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), alteration of consciousness (AOC), and retrograde amnesia, and (b) gather military-specific information regarding injury circumstances (e.g., type of blast, protection worn, etc.). Note that a simple self-report of being \u201cdazed and confused\u201d was not considered sufficient evidence to establish the presence of AOC.\nDuring the interview, every effort was made to distinguish between \u201cconfirmed\u201d AOC (i.e., confusion from brain injury as evidenced by reports of the person acting unusually, talking unusually, unable to follow simple commands, etc.) versus \u201cquestionable\u201d AOC (i.e., confusion from simply being startled or surprised, or from pain or psychological factors).\nFinal determination and classification of TBI severity was undertaken by consensus, giving consideration to all information, during case conferencing with the interviewer and a PhD-level clinician/scientist trained in neuropsychology and TBI (RTL and SML). The TBI severity was classified as follows:\n(a) uncomplicated mild TBI (\nn\n=\u200983): (i) Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)\u2009=\u200913\u201315, PTA <24\u2009h, LOC <30\u2009min, and/or AOC present, and (ii) no trauma-related intracranial abnormality (ICA) on computed tomography (CT) or structural MRI.\n(b) complicated mild TBI (\nn\n=\u200926): (i) GCS\u2009=\u200913\u201315, PTA <24\u2009h, LOC <30\u2009min, and/or AOC present, and (ii) trauma-related intracranial abnormality on CT or MRI (including epidural hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and susceptibility weighted imaging microhemorrhage that the radiologist attributed to TBI).\n(c) moderate TBI (\nn\n=\u200910): LOC 1\u201324\u2009h, PTA 1\u20137 days, and ICA present or absent.\n(d) severe TBI (\nn\n=\u200914): LOC >24\u2009h, PTA >7 days, and ICA present or absent.\n(e) penetrating TBI (\nn\n=\u200917): a breach of the cranial vault and/or dura mater by an external object (e.g., bullet, shrapnel) and/or skull fragment (i.e., skull fracture).\nIn addition, five patients were classified as having a \u201cmoderate-severe TBI,\u201d given unclear information regarding duration of LOC and PTA and unreliable/unavailable GCS.\n\nMeasures and procedure\nParticipants completed a 5\u2009h neuropsychological battery, a 1.5\u2009h MRI brain scan, and a blood draw. All individuals completed these measures as part of a two-day evaluation that also included clinical interviews and a variety of neurobehavioral and neurocognitive measures.\nLaboratory analyses\nNon-fasting blood samples were collected with plastic lithium heparin tubes, processed within an hour of the sampling using standard protocols,\n13\nand stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Batch assays were conducted after all samples had been collected. Simoa\u2122 (Quanterix, Lexington, MA), a high-definition-1 analyzer, was used to measure tau and A\u03b242 concentrations. These methods have been published previously (Rissin and associates., 2011). All assays were randomized over plates and run in duplicate with laboratory scientists blinded to participant groups. Blood samples were not used if the reported coefficients of variation (CV) were over 20%. The average CVs were 4.7% for tau and 3.0% for A\u03b242. The limit of detection for the assay is 0.012\u2009pg/mL for tau and 0.044\u2009pg/mL for A\u03b242.\nBodily injury severity\nBodily injury severity was measured using the Injury Severity Score (ISS) derived from the Abbreviated Injury Scale.\n31\nOn the ISS, higher scores are associated with increased injury severity. For the current study, a modified ISS that excluded intracranial injuries was calculated.\nNeuropsychological assessment\nTwenty neurocognitive measures were selected from the larger test battery. Four neurocognitive scores contributed to each of five cognitive domains:\n(1) Attention: Connor Continuous Performance Test-2 (CPT-II)\n32\nOmissions and Hit Reaction Time Standard Error T-Scores, and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-4 (WAIS-4)\n33\nDigit Span and Letter-Number Sequencing Scaled Scores.\n(2) Processing Speed: WAIS-4 Coding and Symbol Search Scaled Scores, Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS)\n34\nWord Reading Scaled Score, and Trail Making Test\n35\nTrial A T-Score.\n36\n(3) Immediate Memory: California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II)\n37\nTotal Learning T-Score, Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB)\n38\nDaily Living Memory Immediate Recall T-Score, and Wechsler Memory Scale-4 (WMS-4)\n39\nLogical Memory 1 and Visual Reproduction 1 Scaled Scores.\n(4) Delayed Memory: CVLT-II Long Delay Free Recall z score, NAB Daily Living Memory Delayed Recall T-Score, and WMS-4 Logical Memory 2 and Visual Reproduction 2 Scaled Scores.\n(5) Executive Functioning: D-KEFS Verbal Fluency Category Switching and Color Word Interference Test Inhibition Scaled Scores, NAB Categories Test T-Score, and WAIS-4 Similarities Scaled Score.\nAll scores were converted to scaled scores, and a cognitive domain summary score was calculated that represents the average of the four measures contributing to each domain. In addition to the five cognitive domain scores, an overall test battery mean (OTBM) was computed by averaging the five index scores.\nPatients were also administered at least one stand-alone performance validity test (PVT; Medical Symptom Validity Test (MSVT),\n40\nTest of Memory Malingering (TOMM),\n41\nor Advanced Clinical Solutions Word Choice Test (WCT)\n42\nand multiple embedded measures of performance validity (WAIS-IV Reliable Digit Span, Logical Memory, and Visual Reproduction). Failure of either the stand-alone PVT and/or of at least two embedded measures resulted in exclusion from the neuropsychological analyses. For the MSVT, failure was defined by cutoffs in the manual. For the WCT and all embedded measures, failure was defined as performance below the 10%ile.\n42\nFor the TOMM, failure on Trial 2 was defined by the cutoff in the manual and failure on Trial 1 was defined using the cutoff recommended by Denning.\n43\nParticipants also completed the PCL-C,\n44\nand the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2nd Edition-Restructured Format (MMPI-2-RF).\n45\nWhen PCL-C data were used in the analyses, participants were not included in the study if they were considered to have exaggerated symptoms on the MMPI-2-RF (i.e., F-r \u2265100T or Fp-r \u226590T or Fs \u2265100T or FBS-r \u2265100T or RBS \u2265100T) or if their scores were not considered interpretable (i.e., Cannot Say scores >14, or VRIN-r/TRIN-r scores >79T).\nMRI/DTI acquisition, processing and analysis\nThe MRI was performed on a 3T 750 MRI scanner (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI) with a 32-channel head coil. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was acquired by using a single shot echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with slice-selection gradient reversal and peripheral cardiac-gating (repetition time/echo time [TR/TE] \u223c10000/90\u2009msec, field of view [FOV]\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256\u2009mm\n2\n, matrix\u2009=\u2009128\u2009\u00d7\u2009128, voxel size 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009mm\n3\n, b\u2009=\u20091000\u2009s/mm\n2\n, 48 noncollinear diffusion gradient directions plus seven volumes of non-diffusion weighted [b0] evenly distributed among diffusion-weighted volumes).\nPre-processing of DTI data included correction of EPI geometric distortion using B0 fieldmap\n46\ncorrection of motion and eddy current artifacts and digital brain extraction (skull stripping) using software from the FSL toolkits (\nhttp://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl\n).\n47\nA mean non-diffusion (b0) image was created by selecting the temporally central b0 image volume, and aligning the other six b0 images to it using rigid body transformation. The diffusion-weighted images were then aligned to the mean b0 image using the FLIRT affine transformation\n48\nwith 12 degrees of freedom (DOF) to correct for subject head motion and the effects of eddy currents.\nDiffusion gradient directions were modified and adjusted simultaneously according to the transformation. The brain was then extracted from the mean b0 image using BET\n49\nto define the brain, and then removing or masking out non-brain tissue in each of the DWI three-dimensional volumes. The DTI scalar image, fractional anisotropy (FA), was created using a simple least squares fit for single tensor reconstruction method.\nAn automated method reconstructing probabilistic distributions of major white matter tracts from each participant's native diffusion images based on the Bayesian framework for global probabilistic tractography\n50\nwas used to segment major white matter tracts. This method, performed through the TRActs Constrained by UnderLying Anatomy (TRACULA),\n51\nuses a tract atlas of manually labeled tracts and FreeSurfer anatomical segmentations from a set of training subjects to obtain the probability of each tract traversing or neighboring the anatomical segmentations along its trajectory.\nFor manual labeling of white matter pathways from a training data set, the locations of regions of interest (ROIs) that the pathways traverse were identified based on the well-established protocols.\n52\nThe knowledge on white matter pathways, which were labeled manually from a training set consisting of healthy subjects, was extracted and then used to initialize global tractography by constraining its search space and pathway based on the prior anatomical knowledge. In other words, these anatomical priors are incorporated in a probabilistic framework to guide tractography in each novel subject. Specifically, at least two anatomical locations that the pathway is known to traverse were drawn with additional ROIs to eliminate streamlines that were not belonging to the pathway of interest.\nFor automated segmentation of white matter tracts, a Bayesian framework for global tractography based on ball-and-stick model\n50\nparameters was applied to estimate the posterior distribution of each pathway connecting two regions\u2014i.e., start seed ROI and end ROI. Therefore, this method allows for individual variation while reconstructing tracts that are anatomically consistent across individuals and has been shown to reconstruct tracts accurately in individual subjects (compared with manual labeling) using anatomical priors.\nSegmented and labeled fiber tracts included 18 ROIs that consisted of (a) corpus callosum-forceps major, (b) corpus callosum-forceps minor, and (c) two unilateral symmetrical ROIs (left/right) each for the anterior thalamic radiation, cingulum-angular (infracallosal) bundle, cingulum-cingulate gyrus (supracallosal) bundle, corticospinal tract, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus-parietal bundle, superior longitudinal fasciculus-temporal bundle, and uncinate fasciculus.\nMeasures of FA, mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were generated for the 18 ROIs. In addition, a \u201cwhole brain\u201d measure was calculated by averaging the mean scores across all 18 ROIs for each of the four DTI metrics. All ROIs were included because no studies have examined the relationship between plasma tau/A\u03b242 and white matter integrity, and we therefore did not have any\na priori\nhypotheses regarding which specific ROIs would be related to the plasma biomarkers.\nData analyses\nAnalysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Fisher Least Squared Difference (LSD) test were used to examine the differences between controls and the three TBI groups across demographics, injury characteristics, PCL-C total score, and the plasma biomarkers. Chi square tests were used to examine differences in sex and race between the four groups. The relationship between potential confounds and the biomarkers was evaluated via Pearson correlations and ANOVAs. Given the large number of DTI measures (i.e., FA, MD, RD, and AD across the 18 ROIs and whole brain), and that Type 1 error increases when multiple statistical comparisons are made, the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure\n53\nwas used to keep the false discovery rate at 0.05. All other analyses were interpreted using a criterion of\np\n<\u20090.01.\nTo examine the relationship between the biomarkers and neuropsychological performance, a series of hierarchical regressions were completed in the 114 participants with a history of TBI and valid, complete neuropsychological data. Because of the known influence TBI severity can have on neurocognitive performance,\n54\nthese analyses were conducted in the uncomplicated mild TBI group (\nn\n=\u200958), complicated mild TBI group (\nn\n=\u200923), and moderate+ TBI group (\nn\n=\u200933) separately. The dependent variables included the five cognitive domains and the overall test battery mean.\nThe first step in the models included any covariates that were independently correlated with the dependent variable (all models included PCL-C total score; the models for attention also included age; the models for immediate memory also included race and bodily injury severity). The second step in the models included either plasma tau level or plasma A\u03b242 level.\nTo examine the relationship between plasma tau and A\u03b242 and white matter integrity, a series of hierarchical regression analyses were undertaken in the 88 participants with a history of TBI with neuroimaging data. Because TBI severity influences DTI results,\n55\nthese analyses were run separately in the uncomplicated mild TBI group (\nn\n=\u200947), complicated mild TBI group (\nn\n=\u200919), and moderate+ TBI group (\nn\n=\u200922). Plasma tau and A\u03b242 levels were the independent variables, and DTI measures (i.e., FA, MD, RD, and AD across the 18 ROIs and whole brain) were the dependent variables. Given the known influence of age on DTI measures,\n56\nage was included in the first step in each regression model as a covariate. Tau and amyloid were each entered separately in the second step of the model."

    "Methods": "Terminology\nSex\nincludes the biological attributes that distinguish males and females based on reproductive organs and chromosome complement, whereas\ngender\nreflects non-biological traits, behaviors, and expectations that society ascribes to men and women.\n23\nHowever, across the scientific literature the terms\nsex\nand\ngender\nare often used interchangeably. Although it is recognized that some behavioral outcomes in clinical studies might be influenced by social constructs, this review largely examines biological differences and as such we will use \u201csex differences\u201d in our discussion of both human and animal studies. We refer to men and women in human studies and males and females in animal studies.\n\nSearch strategy for literature review\nTo identify published medical literature regarding sex differences and TBI, PubMed was searched without limitations as to publication date or language. Because sex and gender have been used interchangeably we included both terms in our search strategy. The following search strategy was devised: (sex factors[mesh] OR sex characteristics[mesh] OR \u201cgender dependent\u201d OR \u201csex dependent\u201d OR \u201cgender differences\u201d OR \u201csex differences\u201d OR \u201csexual dimorphism\u201d OR \u201csex related\u201d OR \u201cgender related\u201d) AND (\u201cBrain Injuries, Traumatic\u201d[Mesh:noexp] OR \u201cBrain Concussion\u201d[Majr] OR \u201cBrain Contusion\u201d[Majr] OR \u201ctraumatic brain injury\u201d[All Fields] OR \u201ctraumatic brain injuries\u201d[All Fields]) NOT (Review[publication type] OR \u201cSystematic review\u201d[All Fields] OR Meta-analysis[publication type] OR \u201cliterature review\u201d). This search generated 601 results in July 2018. An additional 15 items were identified through manual cross-reference searching (\nFig. 1\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nFlowchart for search strategy and study inclusion criteria.\n\nStudy inclusion and exclusion criteria\nOnly original research articles were included in the final analysis\u2014reviews and meta-analyses were excluded. Human studies that included adolescents and/or adults of reproductive age were included. Clinical studies that included adults of reproductive age but also spanned younger and older ages were also included. Clinical and pre-clinical studies that focused solely on pediatric TBI (patients ages \u226412 years only and rodents post-natal day 0\u201321 or pigs 0\u20134 weeks old) or solely on geriatric TBI (patients ages \u226565 years only and rodents \u226520 months old) were excluded. Articles that only studied epidemiology of human TBI, but not mechanisms or outcomes of injury were excluded. Studies on injuries other than TBI (e.g., general trauma, stroke, spinal cord injury, etc.) and journal articles in a language other than English were also excluded.\n\nClassification of studies\nHuman and animal studies were classified into four categories based on functional, physiological, or neuropathological outcome measures: 1) worse outcomes in women/females, 2) better outcomes in women/females, 3) no difference between sexes, or 4) mixed results between sexes. Studies that reported better or worse performance in women/females on at least one outcome measure and no significant difference between sexes on other outcome measures were grouped under \u201cbetter outcomes in women/females\u201d or \u201cworse outcomes in women/females\u201d categories, respectively. When no differences were reported between men/males and women/females on any of the outcome measures tested, studies were grouped under \u201cno difference.\u201d Studies that showed women/females performing better on one or more measure(s) and men/males on others, or those reporting different post-TBI symptoms by sex were categorized under \u201cmixed results.\u201d Such a system of classification is unbiased because it avoids judgments on the relative importance of each outcome/symptom.\nStudies of patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 9\u201315 were classified into the \u201cMild\u2013moderate\u201d category. Studies with GCS <12 were grouped into the \u201cModerate\u2013severe\u201d category. Studies that included all injury severities (GCS 3\u201315) or where data on injury severity were not available were grouped under \u201cNon-stratified.\u201d Measures that reflected injury mechanisms such as edema, cerebral blood flow, oxidative stress, tissue integrity, neural activity, brain region connectivity, and heart rate variability were classified under \u201cNeuropathology and physiology\u201d (\nTable 1\n). Mortality, Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS), duration of hospital stay, work capacity, and behavioral, motor, or neurocognitive assessments were classified as \u201cFunctional outcomes.\u201d\nTable 1.\nHuman Studies of TBI Comparing Outcomes by Sex\nReference\nSeverity (GCS)\nTotal # (F)\nAge (years)\nComorbidities and systemic injury\nResults: neuropathology and physiology (in women vs. men)\nResults: functional outcomes (in women vs. men)\nWorse outcomes in women (\nn\n=\u200973)\n(Rutherford et al., 1979)\n151\nMild\n131 (48)\nNo data\nNo data\n-\nMore women reported symptoms 1 year post-concussion; SB\n(Edna and Cappelen, 1987)\n152\nMild\u2013severe (3\u201315)\n200 (91)\n15\u201364\nNo data\n-\nMore post-concussive symptoms in women 3\u20135 years after TBI; SB\n(Bazarian et al., 1999)\n52\nMild (\u226513)\n71 (35)\nAvg: 29.04\nPrior head/neck trauma excluded\n-\nHigher incidence of post-concussive symptoms in women 3 months post-TBI; SB\n(Kraus et al., 2000)\n153\nModerate\u2013severe (3\u201312)\n795 (143)\n\u226516\nChronic comorbidities and lower spinal cord injuries excluded\n-\nHigher mortality post-admission and poorer GOS indicative of higher rates of persistent vegetative state and severe disability in women 3 years post-TBI; S, CI\n(Glenn et al., 2001)\n154\nMild\u2013severe (<9 to 15)\n41 (14)\n18\u201375\nPrior neurological diseases excluded\n-\nHigher risk of depression in women 3 months post-TBI; SB\n(Levin et al., 2001)\n155\nMild\u2013moderate (9\u201315)\n69 (20)\n35.06\u2009\u00b1\u200914.69\nPrior TBI and neurological disorders excluded\n-\nHigher risk of depression in women 3\u20136 months post-TBI; SB\n(Seibert et al., 2002)\n156\nModerate\u2013severe (<12)\n33 (14)\n13\u201361\nNo data\n-\nMore women reported poorer quality of life 6 months to 1 year post-injury; CI\n(Balestreri et al., 2003)\n24\nNo data\n392 (82)\nNo data\nNo data\nLower CPP and higher ICP in women\nHigher mortality in women >50 years of age; S\n#\n(Farin et al., 2003)\n13\nSevere (3\u20138)\n957 (220)\n15\u201379\nSystemic and nervous system comorbidities excluded\nGreater frequency of brain swelling and intracranial hypertension in women early after injury, especially in those <51 years\nNon-significant trend toward higher incidence of unfavorable GOS outcomes in women 1 month post-TBI; CI\n(Kirkness et al., 2004)\n57\nModerate\u2013severe\n157 (33)\n\u226516\nNo data\nNo significant differences in intracerebral hemorrhage, MAP, CPP, ICP\nLower GCS in women at admission; women \u226530 years had poorer GOS-E and functional status at 6 months post-TBI; similar in-hospital mortality between women and men; CI\n(Morrison et al., 2004)\n157\nMild\u2013severe\n16,437 (6016)\n0\u201319\nExtracranial injuries included\n-\nGirls had longer duration of ICU stay, worse functional impairment (vision, speech, hearing, feeding, bathing, etc.), and trend toward higher mortality; S, CI\n(Broshek et al., 2005)\n158\nMild\n131 (37)\n14\u201324\nNo data\n-\nGreater decline in neurocognitive performance and more post-concussive symptoms in women athletes; SB\n(Greenspan et al., 2006)\n159\nMild\u2013severe\n198 (67)\n\u226516\nNo data\n-\nMore symptoms of post-traumatic stress in women at 6 and 12 months post-TBI; SB\n(Ng et al., 2006)\n160\nSevere (\u22648)\n672 (147)\nNo data\nMultiple injuries included\n-\nHigher mortality and poorer GOS outcomes at 6 months post-injury in Asian women; CI, S\n(Corrigan et al., 2007)\n161\nMild\u2013severe\n3444 (957)\n18\u201364\nNo data\n-\nLower return to employment 1 year post-TBI in women; CI\n(Czosnyka et al., 2008)\n25\nMild\u2013severe\n469 (98)\n34\u2009\u00b1\u200917\nNo data\nWorse cerebrovascular pressure reactivity in women <50 years of age.

Inclusion criteria included Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3\u201312 on presentation in the emergency department (ED) or intracranial surgery (e.g., craniotomy, or elevation of a depressed skull fracture with dural repair) within 8\u2009h of injury. Subjects were excluded if they were age <14 years (see Temkin and associates\n9\nfor full inclusions/exclusions). Demographic characteristics are presented in\nTable 2\n.

Inclusion criteria consisted of adult patients arriving to the ED less than 24\u2009h of injury with a history of TBI and clinical indication for obtaining computed tomography (CT). Exclusions included being in custody, pregnant, non-survivable physical trauma, debilitating mental health disorders, neurological disease, or non-English speaking. For further details of inclusion/exclusion criteria, see TRACK-TBI Study Protocol:\nhttps://tracktbi.ucsf.edu/researchers\n. Twenty-eight percent of subjects were discharged home from the ED, and 72% were admitted to the hospital. Demographic and injury characteristics are presented in\nTable 2\n. Outcome evaluations occurred at two weeks, three months, six months, and 12 months post-injury.\n\nMeasures\nSeverity of brain injury\nBrain injury severity was evaluated by the initial post-resuscitation GCS\n10\nscore collected in the ED and by the presence or absence of acute intracranial CT abnormalities. The GCS is a measure of coma depth. The CT abnormalities were obtained from the radiology report for participants in the Magnesium Study. For the TRACK study, they were coded by a central reader (EY) according to the NINDS Common Data Elements for TBI (\nhttps://commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov/TBI.aspx#tab=Data_Standards\n). The CTs were considered positive if there was an acute intracranial abnormality.\n\nFunctional status measures\nThe FSE\n7\nmeasures change in functional status specifically from TBI. The measure can be administered in relation to changes from TBI only or both the changes associated with TBI and peripheral injuries. The Magnesium Sulfate study collected changes related to the entire traumatic injury. The FSE covers seven areas of functioning: personal care, ambulation, mobility, major activity (work or school), homemaking, leisure and recreation, and social integration, and takes about 10\u2009min to administer. The original FSE had three other areas of functioning (cognitive competency, standard of living, and financial independence) that were removed because of weak fit with the rest of the measure.\nFunctional areas are evaluated using the concept of dependency to operationally define outcome at four levels for each area: 0\u2009=\u2009no change from pre-injury; 1\u2009=\u2009difficulty in performing the activity, although the person is still independent; 2\u2009=\u2009dependence on others some of the time; and 3\u2009=\u2009non-performance, inability to perform the activity, or total dependence on others.\nTable 1\ngives an example of the structured interview used to rate major activity (work). Contact the primary author (\ndikmen@uw.edu\n) about obtaining the measure.\nTable 1.\nFunctional Status Examination Work Category\nOpen in a separate window\nA total score is generated by summing scores from the seven categories, yielding a range from 0 (return to pre-injury baseline in all areas) to 21 (total dependence on others or can no longer perform any activities across functional areas). Persons who have died are assigned a total score of 22. The most informed person (patient or proxy) completed the FSE and the GOSE at three months and six months post-injury in the Magnesium Sulfate study.\nFor the TRACK-TBI study, patients enrolled at the University of Washington were administered the FSE at two weeks, three months, six months, and 12 months post-injury. Participants were asked about all injury-related effects, similar to the procedure used in the Magnesium Sulfate study. They were also asked about function, considering the effect of TBI alone. Total scores summing all injury-related effects were used in this project for consistency with the Magnesium Sulfate study.\nThe GOSE\n2\nis the extended version of the GOS, a widely used measure of outcome after TBI. The revised version increased the number of outcome categories from five to eight to attempt to improve its sensitivity to outcome and reliability. Domains covered include independence within the home, independence outside the home (shopping and travel), work/school, social and leisure activities, family and friendships, and other current problems that affect daily functioning.\nThe patient is classified on an eight-category scale from death (1), vegetative state (2), lower and upper severe disability (3,4), lower or upper moderate disability (5,6), or lower or upper good recovery (7,8). The scale classification is based on the worst outcome obtained across the domains assessed. As with the FSE, for this project, outcome was evaluated in relationship to all injury-related effects including any effects of peripheral injuries sustained in the same event. The measure can be viewed in the Wilson and colleagues\n2\narticle.\n\nData analysis\nThe relationship of the FSE and GOSE to brain injury severity was assessed at three and six months post-injury. Brain injury severity indices included the total GCS score (ungrouped) as well as the presence or absence of CT abnormalities. The relationships between the brain injury severity and outcome measures were examined by Spearman rank correlation. There were 100 participants who died before the first evaluation, and because no functional measure can detect change in death, analyses were run without the inclusion of those who died.\nThe Choi test of equality of two correlations\n11\nwhen both involve a common variable assessed whether one measure is more closely related to severity than the other. Because the presence of CT abnormality is dichotomous, the Mann-Whitney\nU\ntest\n12\nwas used to assess significance of correlations involving that severity index.\nChange from three to six months post-injury on the FSE and GOSE was also examined. To account for scale differences between the FSE and GOSE, change scores were standardized by dividing the difference between the individual's scores at the two times by the standard deviation of the difference on that measure. This puts the change on both measures on the same scale\u2014with a standard deviation of 1. The average of these values is the effect size for the change.\nWilcoxon signed rank tests compare the standardized FSE change with standardized GOSE change. The average of the standardized change scores for a measure is the effect size (Cohen d for correlated measures) for the change. Additional analyses of change were conducted using TRACK-TBI data only to explore change on the FSE and GOSE over a broader range of time. Standardized change from two weeks to three months, two weeks to six months, two weeks to 12 months, three months to six months, three months to 12 months, and six months to 12 months were compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank tests."

    "Methods": "So far we have discussed the importance of PK optimization in animal species for both efficacy and safety evaluation. Ultimately, the goal is to advance the new drug candidate to humans for safety and efficacy evaluation. How does one project human PK based on animals? Allometrical scaling is a commonly used method for prediction of human PK.49The PK profile is governed by two primary parameters\u2014clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (Vd). Clearance measures how efficiently the drug is eliminated from the body while Vd determines the distribution of the drug molecule throughout the body.\n\nMany physiological processes (e.g., blood flow) scale based on body weight. The CL, which has the units of flow, can also be scaled by body weight (Fig. 5). As discussed earlier, if the PK parameter that drives efficacy is the plasma AUC, CL becomes the most important parameter that drives AUC (AUC\u2009=\u2009Dose/CL).\n\nIt is now well established that simple allometry (simply based on body weight) is not adequate for prediction of CL because it requires correction factors to improve the prediction.50The role of exponents was developed from real observations and behavior of the allometrical exponents. Simple allometry works best when the exponent is <0.71. Between 0.71 and 1.0, CL is multiplied by the maximum lifespan potential of each species; whereas for exponent >1.0, the best prediction is obtained by multiplication with brain weight. A case of vertical allometry is observed when the exponent exceeds 1.3 and adjustment by correction of free fraction between the rat and human is applied for allometrical scaling.51\n\nAllometrical scaling is also used to predict Vd in humans; however, unlike CL, the typical exponent for Vd is 1.0. Significant deviation of the Vd exponent from unity is indicative of interspecies disconnect, and it creates uncertainty in the prediction of human Vd. Sometimes, the Vd exponent comes closer to 1.0 when a correction factor of plasma protein binding in each species is applied. While CL alone is sufficient to predict AUC, prediction of Vd is necessary to project plasma concentration versus time profile, thereby estimating the duration of target coverage at a given dose.\n\nThere are numerous examples of successful PK prediction by allometry, yet it is important to recognize that this method is strictly empirical in nature. It does not consider species differences in metabolism or any other disposition pathways (e.g., active transport across the liver or kidney) that may affect CL and Vd. A more mechanistical method to predict CL is to establishin vitro-in vivocorrelation in CL.52\n\nMany liver-basedin vitrosystems are available (e.g., microsomes, S9, cytosol, hepatocytes) for measuring metabolic turnover. Choice of the system depends on the metabolic characterization of the new drug candidate. For example, if the new drug candidate is metabolized largely by CYP enzymes, human liver microsomes is an idealin vitrosystem.In vitroturnover is then scaled toin vitroCL and then toin vivoCL by incorporation of liver blood flow and protein binding. To increase the confidence in scalingin vitroCL in human liver microsomes to predict humanin vivoCL; it is desirable to establish a correlation betweenin vitroandin vivo(IVIC) CL in one or more animal species. This method assumes that systemic CL is largely governed by the liver, however.\n\nBeyond allometrical scaling and IVIVC, physiologically based methods (e.g., incorporation of active transport across the liver) are now being used for prediction of CL and Vd.53Use of multiple approaches leading to convergence of CL and Vd predictions will provide additional confidence in human PK prediction. While regulatory guidance recommends first-in-human dose selection based on BSA-based dose conversion and observed toxicities, it also allows for an alternative approach that places primary emphasis on animal PK, biomarker assessment, and modeling rather than the dose.\n\nThere is a clear distinction between prediction of human PK and efficacious dose. While reliable PK prediction requires in depth understanding of disposition properties of the new drug candidate (e.g., metabolic pathways, renal elimination, protein binding, active transport), efficacious dose prediction requires in depth understanding of the animal models of disease and their translation to human disease. Specific evaluation of alterations in systemic and brain tissue concentrations in various TBI animal models will better determine the effects of BBB disruption and inflammatory alterations in CYP expression, which occur after injury.54,55\n\nIdeally, the use of brain injury models that best represent the specific human type of brain injury for which the therapy is targeted, along with the corresponding biomarkers of that injury type, should be used to guide subsequent clinical translation. Approaches to model PK drug concentrations assessments with PD biomarkers of injury in pre-clinical studies will aid in the estimation of efficacious doses in humans compared with methods that rely primarily on dose response or dose body weight/BSA estimations."

A total of 30 animals (4\u20135 per cage) were placed into a controlled temperature room (22\u00b0C\u2009\u00b1\u20091) under a 12\u2009h light/12\u2009h dark cycle (lights on at 7\na.m\n.) and had free access to food and water. The treatment consisted of a daily injection of an equal volume (50\u2009\u03bcL) of corn oil (vehicle groups, VEH-SHAM, and VEH-controlled cortical impact (CCI); 10 animals per each group) or testosterone cypionate (15\u2009mg/kg, based on previously published work\n23\n; Sigma-pharma, TS-CCI group; 10 animals per group), between 2\np.m\n. to 3\np.m\nfor 10 days after the head trauma. Subsequently, animals were euthanized and the ipsilateral cortex surrounding the impact injury was dissected for neurochemical analysis. After CCI, animals were randomly assigned to both TS or VEH groups by two trained researchers. The treatment started 24\u2009h after the CCI injury. The experimental design is outlined in\nFigure 1\n. All experiments were in agreement with the Committee on the Care and Use of Experimental Animal Resources, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, number 22436.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nExperimental design. Anesthetized mice were submitted to a single parasagittal severe controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury. Twenty-four hours later, they were submitted to modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS) evaluation, and soon afterwards animals were injected with testosterone (TS) or vehicle (oil) for 10 days (\nn\n=\u200910, per group).\n\nControlled cortical impact (CCI) protocol\nTo cause TBI, mice were placed in the stereotaxic (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA) with a heating bed (37\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C) and maintained with anesthesia inhalation (2.5% isoflurane) in a mixture of N\n2\nand O\n2\n(2:1) during the entire surgical procedure. A 4-mm diameter craniotomy was made in the central part of the left parietal bone to perform the CCI injury using an equipment Benchmark stereotaxic impactor (myNeuroLab; Leica, St. Louis, MO). The injury was induced by a piston of 3.0\u2009mm diameter on the exposed surface of the intact dura mater. Other lesion parameters were fully adjusted in the equipment as follows: impact velocity of 5.7\u2009m/sec; impact duration was 100\u2009msec, and 2\u2009mm of depth penetration. Soon after injury, the area of the craniotomy was isolated with a concave lamella bonded with dental cement, and the scalp was sutured. After the surgical procedure, anesthesia was discontinued and the animals were placed in a heated box to maintain normal body temperature and were monitored for 2\u2009h post-injury.\n24\n\nModified Neurological Severity Score\nThe evaluation of CCI-induced neurological impairment was performed by two independent single-blinded trained researchers, 24\u2009h after CCI injury using a modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS). TS and vehicle administration were initiated after the mNSS test. The previously described 10-point scale\n25\nwas modified to a 6-point scale, assessing functional neurological status of mice based on the presence of reflexes and the ability to perform motor and behavioral tasks, evaluated with the following behavioral composite: a) exit square; b) seeking behavior; c) straight walk; d) startle reflex; e) beam balancing; and f) round stick balancing. One point is awarded for failing to perform a task; thus, a normal, uninjured mouse scores 0.\n\nPreparation of ipsilateral cortex homogenates\nThe whole ipsilateral cortex of mice were collected 10 days after CCI, and then homogenized in a specific buffer (320\u2009mM sucrose, 1\u2009mM EDTA, pH 7.4)\n26\nusing a pre-cooled glass potter with 10 to 15 strokes. Following a centrifugation step of 1350\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 3\u2009min at 4\u00b0C, the resulting mitochondria-enriched homogenates in the supernatant were aliquoted and used for respirometry, calcium handling, mitochondrial membrane potential, and hydrogen peroxide analysis. These assays were performed all simultaneously by the researchers according to their methodological skills in a time-frame of 10\u2009min from euthanasia and start of the analysis, or sample processing for MTT assay. The samples were frozen at \u221280\u00b0C for protein quantification and further oxidative stress parameters and western blotting assays. The Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Catalog #: 23225) was used for quantification of protein contents of the homogenized samples. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Measurements were performed in triplicates (coefficient of variation between duplicates was <3%) and corrected for the absorbance measured in the homogenization buffer only.\n\nMitochondrial calcium handling\nTo assess mitochondrial calcium buffering capacity, namely calcium influx and efflux, we measured the absorbance spectrophotometrically at 540\u2009nm (Spectra Max M5; Molecular Devices). Mitochondria maintain the fluxes of ions across the inner membrane tightly controlled. This is particularly important because the dual physiological and detrimental roles of Ca\n2+\nin the mitochondrial matrix.\n11\nIpsilateral cortex homogenates (50\u2009\u03bcL) obtained from 10-day-old treated mice were added to standard swelling incubation medium (100\u2009mM KCl, 50\u2009mM sucrose, 10\u2009mM HEPES and 5\u2009mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n) and the basal mitochondrial absorbance was monitored during 3\u2009min in microplates. Mitochondrial substrates PMGSA (3.5\u2009mM pyruvate, 4.5\u2009mM malate, 4.5\u2009mM glutamate, 1.2\u2009mM succinate and 100\u2009\u03bcM of adenosine diphosphate [ADP]) were added to energize mitochondria and support ATP synthesis. Thus, the absorbance coupled with oxidative phosphorylation was monitored during 5\u2009min. Afterward, calcium (Ca\n2+\n, 20\u2009mM) was added to induce large-amplitude swelling driven by the colloid osmotic force of Ca\n2+\ninflux at proteins localized in the mitochondrial matrix. The decrease in the absorbance caused by the Ca\n2+\ninflux was monitored for 10\u2009min. After calcium-induced mitochondrial swelling, we accessed mitochondrial Ca\n2+\nefflux as an indicator of shrinkage. Then, Na\n+\n(30\u2009mM) was added to the medium and the increase in the absorbance was monitored for additional 10\u2009min. For a mitochondrial-enriched suspension, the swelling and shrinkage causes a decrease and increase in the absorbance respectively, which are both discernible even to the naked eye.\n27\nFinally, we normalized all results for protein content. Also, we used the baseline Ca\n2+\nfrom each group to standardize their own data, and calculated the percentage of variation in the absorbance (540\u2009nm) after the addition of substrates (PMGSA) relative to basal; after addition of Ca\n2+\nrelative to PMGSA; and after addition of Na\n+\nrelative to Ca\n2+\n.\n\nMitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8\nm\n)\nThe \u0394\u03a8\nm\nwas measured 10 days after CCI through the fluorescence signal emitted by the cationic dye safranin-O. Ipsilateral cortex homogenates were incubated in the respiration buffer used for the respirometry protocol, additionally supplemented with 10\u2009\u03bcM safranin-O. The fluorescence was detected with an excitation wavelength of 495\u2009nm and an emission wavelength of 586\u2009nm (Spectra Max M5; Molecular Devices). An increased the fluorescence units mirror decreased \u0394\u03a8\nm\nwhereas decreased fluorescence units indicate increased \u0394\u03a8\nm\n. Baseline \u0394\u03a8\nm\nwas measured without addition of substrates and inhibitors in the incubation medium.\nFurther, pyruvate, malate, glutamate, succinate (PMGS) and ADP (2.5\u2009mM) were incubated to modulate the activity of mitochondrial respiratory complex I, II, and V, and consequently \u0394\u03a8\nm\n. Increased ADP utilization after the addition of PMGS mirrors increased oxygen consumption coupled with ATP synthesis by the F0F1\u2013ATP synthase (respiratory Complex V) along with decreased \u0394\u03a8\nm\n. Addition of the proton ionophore carbonyl cyanide 4-trifluoromethoxy-phenylhydrazone (FCCP 1\u2009\u03bcM), a chemical uncoupler, triggers decrease in the \u0394\u03a8\nm\nand oxidative phosphorylation while stimulating the maximal mitochondrial oxygen consumption. The addition of sodium azide (AZ; 20\u2009mM), an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiratory complex IV (cytochrome oxidase), was used to decrease ATP synthesis and disrupt mitochondrial membrane potential. Moreover, we used the data achieved through the manipulation of mitochondrial respiratory rates with the components PMGS, ADP, FCCP, and AZ to calculate the percentage of change in the \u0394\u03a8\nm\n. Each component has a percentage of variation relative to the previous one. For instance, PMGS is relative to the baseline, and ADP is relative to the PMGS. Data are reported as arbitrary fluorescence units and were normalized to protein content.\n28\n\nMitochondrial respiratory protocol\nThe ipsilateral cortex of mice was dissected 10 days after CCI, then homogenized in a specific buffer (320\u2009mM sucrose, 1\u2009mM EDTA, 0.25\u2009mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.4). Oxygen consumption measurements were performed using a standard respiration buffer (100\u2009mM KCI, 75\u2009mM mannitol, 25\u2009mM sucrose, 5\u2009mM phosphate, 0.05\u2009mM EDTA, and 10\u2009mM Tris-HC1; pH 7.4). Oxygen consumption per tissue mass was measured using the high-resolution Oxygraph-2k system and recorded real-time using DatLab software (Oroboros, Innsbruck, Austria). The results were normalized to the protein content. The experiments were performed at 37\u00b0C in a 2-mL chamber, with a modified multi-substrate titration protocol as previously described in detail elsewhere.\n26\nFollowing 5\u2009min for establishing routine respiration values, the multi-substrate titration protocol started. The protocol consisted of sequential addition of pyruvate, malate, and glutamate (PMG; 10, 10, and 20\u2009mM, respectively) to obtain State IV (L) respiration; Subsequently, adenosine diphosphate (ADP, 2.5\u2009mM) was titrated to obtain oxidative phosphorylation (OxPHOS) capacity of Complex I-Linked substrates (State III); maximal oxidative phosphorilation (OxPHOS) capacity (State III [P]) was obtained with the addition of succinate (S; 10\u2009mM) in saturating ADP concentrations and non-mitochondrial respiration (ROX) after cyanide (KCN; 5\u2009mM).\nRespiratory fluxes were corrected automatically for instrumental background by DatLab taking into account oxygen consumption of the oxygen sensor and oxygen diffusion out of or into the oxygraph chamber measured at experimental conditions in incubation medium without biological sample. ROX was extracted from all of the above-mentioned states and tissue-mass specific oxygen fluxes were compared in different substrate and coupling states.\nWe calculated flux control factors (FCF), which express the change of flux in a single step of the SUIT protocol, normalized for the high flux as a specific reference state. The respiratory control ratio (RCR\u2009=\u2009State III [P]/State IV [L]) was obtained in the CI-linked substrate state. For statistical analysis RCR was transformed to its respective FCF, which is the OxPHOS coupling efficiency calculated as (P-L)/P\u2009=\u20091-L/P. The FCF for the CII-linked substrate stimulating STATE III respiration (succinate effect) was calculated as 1 \u2013 CI/CI&II, determined in the OxPHOS state in the protocol.\n26\u201329\nThis analysis informs the influence of Complex II on the respirometry of other oxidative complexes. Since RCR ranges from 1.0 to infinity, we calculated the oxidative phosphorylation coupling efficiency, which has boundaries from 0.0 to 1.0 and is directly related to classic RCR (State III/State IV).\n\nMitochondrial H\n2\nO\n2\nproduction and oxidative stress markers\nThe pattern of mitochondrial production of hydrogen peroxide (H\n2\nO\n2\n) under the modulation of TS was assessed in the ipsilateral cortex homogenates 10 days after CCI through the Amplex Red oxidation method. The same substrates, uncoupler, and inhibitors used in the respirometry protocol were incubated sequentially in the respiration buffer supplemented with 10\u2009\u03bcM Amplex Red and 2 units/mL horseradish peroxidase to assess H\n2\nO\n2\ngeneration. The baseline H\n2\nO\n2\nlevel was measured without the presence of substrate in the incubation medium. Also, PMGS was used as the substrate to stimulate mitochondrial respiration, ADP to analyze the functional capacity of mitochondria to produce ATP, and the proton ionophore FCCP (Carbonyl cyanide 4-trifluoromethoxy-phenylhydrazone, a reversible inhibitor of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation) to estimate the maximal mitochondrial electron transport system capacity. Sodium azide was used to assess non-mitochondrial H\n2\nO\n2\nproduction (ROX). Fluorescence was monitored at excitation (563\u2009nm) and emission (587\u2009nm) wavelengths with a Spectra Max M5 microplate reader (Molecular Devices).\n28\nMoreover, at 10 days following CCI, we measured the activity of enzymes involved in the H\n2\nO\n2\nproduction (superoxide dismutase [SOD]) and degradation (glutathione peroxidase [GPx]); the expression levels of the mitochondrial enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and total reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, altogether here designated as oxidative stress biomarkers. The measurements were performed, as described below.\n\n2\u20327\u2032-Dihydro-dichlorofluorescein (DCFH) oxidation assay\nThe measure of global ROS production in the ipsilateral cortex homogenates was performed using reduced 2\u20327\u2032-dihydro-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA). Samples were incubated for 30\u2009min at 37\u00b0C in the dark with 20\u2009mM sodium phosphate, 140\u2009mM KCl buffer pH 7.4 and 100\u2009\u03bcM reduced 2\u20327\u2032-Dichlorofluorescein diacetate (H\n2\nDCF-DA) solution in a 96 wells plate. The H\n2\nDCF-DA is enzymatically hydrolyzed by intracellular esterases and H\n2\nDCF formed is oxidized by ROS being the DCF fluorescence (480 and 535\u2009nm) proportional to the amount of ROS formed. The calibration curve was performed with standard DCF (0.25\u201310.0\u2009\u03bcM), and the levels of reactive species were expressed as nmol of DCF formed per mg of protein.\n30\n\nSOD activity assay\nSOD activity in the ipsilateral cortex homogenates was determined based on the capacity of pyrogallol to autoxidize, a process highly dependent on superoxide radical.\n31\nThe inhibition of autoxidation of this compound occurs in the presence of SOD, whose activity can be indirectly assayed spectrophotometrically at 420\u2009nm. A calibration curve was performed with purified SOD as standard. A 50% inhibition of pyrogallol autoxidation is defined as one unit of SOD, and the specific activity was expressed as SOD units per mg of protein. The expression level of MnSOD was analyzed through Western blotting (see below).\n\nGPx assay\nGPx activity in the ipsilateral cortex homogenates was measured using tert-butylhydroperoxide as substrate.\n32\nThe enzyme activity was determined by monitoring the nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) disappearance at 340\u2009nm. The medium contains 100\u2009mM potassium phosphate, 1\u2009mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid buffer pH 7.7, 0.4\u2009mM azide, 2\u2009mM glutathione reduced, 0.15\u2009U/mL glutathione reductase, 0.1\u2009mM NADPH, 0.5\u2009mM tert-butyl-hydroperoxide, and supernatant sample. One GPx unit is defined as 1\u2009\u03bcmol of NADPH consumed per minute. The specific activity was expressed as micromole of NADPH consumed per minute per mg of protein.\n\nWestern blotting\nThe ipsilateral cortex of mice was dissected 10 days after CCI and then homogenized in a buffer solution (EDTA 2\u2009mM, protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails I and II; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) 0.001%, Tris HCl 50\u2009mM, (pH 7,4), glycerol 10% and Triton X-100 1%) and centrifuged (1300\u2009g/3\u2009min). Supernatant was collected and diluted in an appropriated sample buffer. Samples of 20\u2009\u03bcg of protein (\nn\n=\u20096\u20138 per group) were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% or 12% polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred to PVDF (Amersham; GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK) as previously reported.\n33\nPrimary antibodies against Alpha-Spectrin (Millipore, GER; 1:1000; ref. MAB1622), calpain-2 (Cell Signalling; 1:1000; ref. 2539), anti-Bax (ABCAM; 1:1000; ref. ab7977), anti-BCL-2 (ABCAM; 1:1000; ref. ab7973); anti-MnSOD (ABCAM; 1:1000; ref. ab13533); anti-Tau phospho-S396 (ABCAM; 1:1000; ref. ab109390); anti-Tau antibody (ABCAM; 1:1000; ref. ab32057); caspase-3 (8G10; Cell Signalling; 1:1000; ref. 9665) cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signalling; 1:1000; ref. 9664). All procedures were conducted according to specific antibody manufacturer's instruction. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight followed by 2\u2009h incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (1:5000; GE Healthcare Life Sciences) secondary antibodies. Membranes were incubated with Amersham ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) for 5\u2009min and the immunodetection was made by chemoluminescence using Image Quant LAS 4000 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The protein expression was quantified using Image J software (Rockville, MD). The values of optic density were expressed as % of control.\n\nCell viability assay\nCell viability assay was performed 10 days after CCI through the colorimetric [3(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2- yl)- 2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] (MTT, Sigma) method.\n34\nCell homogenates were incubated with 0.5\u2009mg/mL of MTT, at 37\u00b0C during 45\u2009min. The formazan product generated during the incubation was solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide and measured at 560 and 630\u2009nm. The results were expressed as the percentage of control.\n\nProtein\u2013protein interaction network and differential expression analysis\nFunctional interplay between proteins can often be inferred from genomic associations between the genes that encode them. The Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) is a relational biological database and web source (\nhttps://string-db.org\n) used to store known and predicted protein\u2013protein interactions. The database utilizes an interaction scoring system computed by combining the probabilities from different evidence channels and corrected for the probability of randomly observing and interaction. Input queries are associated using this scoring system and a graphical network representation can be generated to demonstrate their pairwise interactions. Network representations may provide insights of functional protein interactions (direct and indirect), which facilitate the analysis of modularity in biological processes.\n35\nThe Protein\u2013Protein Interaction (PPI) Network between the genes, Sdha and Sdhb (subunits of mitochondrial complex II-succinate dehydrogenase); Atp5d, Atp5a1 and Atp5c1 (subunits of mitochondrial complex V-ATP synthase), and SOD2; Bcl2 (B-Cell Lynphoma 2) and Bax (Bcl-2-like protein 4); Casp3 (caspase-3) and Capn2 (calpain-2); Mapt (microtubules associated protein Tau), was constructed using STRINGdb package (STRING version 10).\n36\nThe network association topology obtained then was used to map transcriptomic analyses results with RedeR package.\n37\nBased on the experimental molecular and functional results obtained, we searched gene expression data in TBI studies similar to ours (i.e., adult male mice strain C57BL/6) submitted to a single severe CCI injury in the dura matter, ipsilateral brain cortex samples analysis, and the end-point for the neurochemical analysis close to 10 days after the CCI. We found one study, which partially matched these criteria using adult male mice C57BL/6, submitted to severe CCI, and brain ipsilateral cortex gene expression profiling at Day 3 after CCI.\n38\nExpression data was obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) using GEOquery package\n39\nunder the identification GSE58485.\n38\nUsing this dataset, differentially expressed genes of TBI versus control were obtained using the limma package.\n40\n\nStatistical analysis\nResults were calculated and expressed as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean. To analyze the differences between groups, we used one-way analysis of variance followed by a\npost hoc\nTukey test or Kruskal-Wallis test when necessary. All procedures were performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 software. The differences were considered statistically significant at\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll procedures were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). Male and female C57Bl/6J wild-type mice were obtained from Jackson Labs, and heterozygotic\nPOMC-GFP\nmice\n42\nwere obtained by crossing homozygotic mice (maintained on a C57 background) with wild-type mice.\n\nControlled cortical impact injury and diazepam administration\nWe used a CCI model of TBI in 2-month-old mice as previously described.\n23\n,\n43\nBriefly, mice were placed under isoflurane anesthesia (2% spontaneously inhaled) and mounted on a stereotaxic frame. After sterile skin preparation and a midline scalp incision, a 4-mm craniotomy was made unilaterally bordering right of the midline between lambda and bregma, keeping dura intact. TBI was induced with a 0.9-mm deformation (4.4\u2009m/sec; 800\u2009msec dwell) delivered directly onto the exposed dura using an electromagnetic impactor with a 3-mm cylindrical tip (ImpactOne, Leica Microsystems). Sham mice underwent the same surgery and anesthesia minus the craniotomy and impact.\nAfter CCI or sham treatment, the scalp was closed using sutures and Vetbond adhesive. While still anesthetized, each mouse was subcutaneously implanted with a mini-osmotic pump (AlzetAP2001; Cupertino, CA) containing either vehicle (1:1 dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]:propylene glycol) or DZP (added to vehicle for a dose of 15\u2009mg/kg/day), and which had been pre-equilibrated in saline per the manufacturer's instructions. Mice were given ear punches for identification and allowed to recover in a warm padded chamber for 1\u2009h. Osmotic pumps delivered solutions at a rate of 1\u2009\u03bcL/h for 1 week and were then surgically removed under isoflurane anesthesia. Residual volumes in the pump were all \u00b110% of predicted volumes based on the implantation/equilibration time.\nPOMC-GFP\nmice were sacrificed 2 weeks after sham/CCI for histological analysis. For any group, littermates were divided between sham and CCI treatment and between vehicle and DZP pump implantation.\nThe number of\nPOMC-GFP\nmice for each group was: 10 sham-vehicle (7 females, 3 males), 9 CCI-vehicle (5 females, 4 males), 7 sham-DZP (3 females, 4 males), and 11 CCI-DZP (5 females, 6 males). The number of wild-type mice assessed 3 weeks after CCI (for BrdU labeling, DCX expression) was 6 sham-vehicle (3 females, 3 males), 7 CCI-vehicle (3 females, 4 males), 7 sham-DZP (4 females, 3 males), and 6 CCI-DZP (3 females, 3 males). The number of wild-type mice assessed 3 days after CCI included a total of 12 sham-vehicle (7 females, 5 males), 13 CCI-vehicle (8 females, 5 males), 14 sham-DZP (10 females; 4 males), and 13 CCI-vehicle (9 females, 4 males). A third cohort of 16 wild-type male mice was sacrificed 3\u2009h after sham or CCI treatment with pump implantation, and used to determine the acute effects of DZP on neuronal activity and cell death. The number of mice per group is reported in the legend of the figure for each outcome.\n\nBrdU protocol\nWild-type mice received two intraperitoneal injections (4\u2009h apart) of the mitotic marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 300\u2009mg/kg dissolved in saline) daily for 2 days, beginning 2 days after CCI or sham. This saturating BrdU dose provides long-term labeling of dividing cells and their progeny.\n44\nThese mice were sacrificed at 3 weeks to assess the density of BrdU\n+\ncells. Neuronal fate specification of BrdU\n+\ncells was assessed using co-labeling with the neuronal marker doublecortin (DCX). To determine the effects of DZP on cell proliferation within the dentate gyrus, a separate cohort of wild-type mice was injected with BrdU (50\u2009mg/kg) every 2\u2009h for 6\u2009h on the second day after surgery, and then sacrificed the following day to minimize the effects of differential early survival on the BrdU\n+\ncell count.\n45\nThis lower dose was chosen to provide a continuous level of BrdU for an extended period during the labeling day, without the need to label multiple rounds of cell division given the shorter experimental time frame. We did not observe any sex differences in regard to post-traumatic neurogenesis or cell proliferation in any of our assays, and thus results for both sexes were combined.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nImmunohistochemistry was performed as previously described\n23\nwith some modifications. Following a terminal dose of avertin (1.2%, 1\u2009mL, intraperitoneal [i.p.]), mice were transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains were harvested and post-fixed overnight. Free-floating coronal sections (150\u2009\u03bcm thick) were then prepared using a vibratome. Four sections containing the hippocampus (two dorsal: approximately\n_\n1.46 and\n_\n2.18\u2009mm from bregma; and two ventral: approximately\n_\n2.54 and\n_\n2.80\u2009mm from bregma) from each mouse were permeabilized in 0.4% Triton in PBS (PBST) for 45\u2009min and then blocked for 30\u2009min with 10% horse serum (HS) in PBST. The sections were then incubated overnight (4\u00b0C) with primary antibodies diluted in PBST with 1.5% HS. These included rabbit anti-GFP (Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated; 1:400, Invitrogen), goat anti-doublecortin (1:400, Santa Cruz), rat anti-BrdU (1:400, Abcam), rabbit anti-c-Fos (1:400, Santa Cruz), rat anti-Ki67 (1:400, eBioscience), and rabbit anti-GFAP (1:1000, DAKO). Sections stained with anti-BrdU were first denatured in 2N hydrochloric acid in potassium-PBS for 30\u2009min (37\u00b0C) followed by a neutralization step (potassium-PBS pH 8.5) prior to staining.\nAfter primary antibody incubation, sections were washed in PBST and exposed to fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) dissolved in PBST +1.5% HS for 4\u2009h at room temperature. The sections were then washed in PBST containing DAPI (1:20,000) and mounted on slides with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech).\nCell death was assessed 3 days after surgery using Fluoro-Jade C (Histo-chem) staining following the manufacturer's protocol. Slices were mounted on gelatinized slides and allowed to air dry at room temperature before immersion in 100% ethanol (3\u2009min), 70% ethanol (1\u2009min), and deionized water (1\u2009min). The slides were then immersed and gently shaken in 0.06% potassium permanganate for 15\u2009min followed by 0.001% Fluoro-Jade C for 30\u2009min. The slides were washed in water for 1\u2009min 3 times before they were allowed to dry overnight. The next day, the slides were dipped in xylene 3 times (2\u2009min each time) and cover-slipped with DPX (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Inc.). In a separate cohort of animals, cell death in the granule cell layer (GCL) and surrounding tissue was assessed in mice sacrificed 3\u2009h after injury (using the same staining protocol), to determine whether DZP exerted an immediate effect on cell death after CCI.\n\nConfocal microscopy and image analysis\nSlides were coded, and the hippocampus of each mouse was imaged with a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope using a 10\u2009\u00d7\u20090.45 NA or 20\u2009\u00d7\u20090.8 NA lens, by an experimenter blinded to experimental condition. All subsequent analyses were performed on coded images with ImageJ software.\nIn BrdU-stained slices from wild-type mice taken either 3 days or 3 weeks after CCI, all DCX/BrdU double positive cells were counted throughout a 50-\u03bcm image stack of the dentate GCL and the subgranular zone (SGZ), and normalized to the GCL volume. GCL volume was obtained by multiplying the cross-sectional area of the GCL in the first optical section by the depth of image stack. Quantification of Ki-67 staining from mice 3 days after CCI was performed similar to the BrdU quantification, but sections were imaged and counted using a 25-\u03bcm image stack of dentate GCL and SGZ. To determine the effects of DZP and CCI on neuronal activity, slices were stained for the activity-dependent gene c-Fos at early and late time-points during treatment. In the mice assessed 3 days after CCI, cells within the dentate gyrus positive for c-Fos were counted in a 30-\u03bcm thick z-stack of the GCL. In a separate cohort of mice assessed 3\u2009h after CCI, due to the high density of c-Fos\n+\ncells within the dentate gyrus GCL, the mean intensity of all pixels corresponding to the GCL (determined via DAPI signal) within a single confocal section was used to compare group differences. Intensity values were normalized by dividing the mean pixel intensity for each image by the mean c-Fos pixel intensity from the sham/vehicle stained slices (which was set to 100%).\nTo compare glial fibrilary acidic protein (GFAP) staining between groups, the mean pixel intensity in images of the dentate hilus and the molecular layer was obtained with ImageJ, and all values were normalized to the mean GFAP pixel intensity from the sham/vehicle stained slices. To count Fluoro-Jade C\n+\ncells, single confocal sections of the dentate gyrus from multiple slices (minimum of 3) bracketing the injury cavity were used for each mouse. The somatosensory cortex was also analyzed separately to assess Fluoro-Jade C\n+\ncell counts and staining quality at the 3\u2009h time-point. For all imaging experiments, samples were identically processed (side-by-side), imaging parameters were kept constant between slides, and blinded investigators performed imaging and image analysis.\nTo quantify post-traumatic neurogenesis in\nPOMC-GFP\nmice, the ipsilateral hippocampus was imaged from tissue harvested 2 weeks after sham or CCI. This time-point was chosen to allow analysis of the same population of cells labeled by BrdU in wild-type mice, as GFP is expressed by immature, adult-born neurons between 10 and 14 days post-mitosis.\n42\nGFP\n+\ncells were counted on single confocal sections from 2 to 4 slices per mouse that included the molecular layer, the GCL, and theSGZ of the dentate gyrus. The cell count was normalized to the imaged GCL area of each slice to estimate GFP\n+\ncell density.\nThe cortical cavity in mice that underwent CCI treatment was assessed 3 days after surgery by subtracting the area of the ipsilateral cortex immediately beneath the impact site (using a tiled image acquired with overlapping 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009images) from the area of the contralateral cortex from the same slice. All anatomical measurements were collected and analyzed by an investigator blinded to the group assignment of each animal.\n\nCell migration and morphology\nAs adult-born neurons mature, they slowly migrate from the SGZ of the dentate gyrus outward into the GCL. To determine whether DZP influences cell migration, the linear distance from the center of each cell body to the SGZ/hilar border was measured in the confocal image plane traversing mid-nucleus, using ImageJ as previously described.\n23\nCells that migrated backward into the hilus or out into the molecular layer (defined as migration >10\u2009\u03bcm away from the inner border of the SGZ or the outer border of the GCL, respectively) were counted separately to quantify ectopically migrated cells. Ectopically migrated cells were quantified using single confocal sections of the dentate gyrus.\nTo quantify dendritic morphology, we traced the morphology of GFP\n+\ncells from confocal stack images using ImageJ as previously described.\n23\nGFP\n+\ncell dendritic trees were imaged in their entirety (three dimensions) using a confocal stack, and traced in ImageJ. An average of 5 to 8 cells were traced for 3 to 4 mice/group, and these cell tracings were analyzed using the ImageJ Sholl analysis plug-in (Ghosh Lab,\nhttp://labs.biology.ucsd.edu/ghosh/software/\n). All analyses were performed by an experimenter blinded to experimental condition.\n\nOpen field analysis following CCI and during diazepam administration\nThe open field test was used to assess locomotor and exploratory behavior to determine whether the dose of DZP administered had any gross effects on mouse activity levels. Three days following sham or CCI treatment (during DZP or vehicle delivery), mice were acclimated to single housing for 1\u2009h in a holding room during the morning hours. After acclimatization, they were individually introduced to an open field (40-cm\u2009\u00d7\u200940-cm white chamber; 200 lux luminescence) for 10\u2009min each. The distance traveled, rearing events (postured upright on rear legs), and velocity were assessed using video recording and tracking software (Noldus, Ethovision).\n\nExperimental design and statistical analysis\nSample sizes were determined for each group through power analyses using estimates of effect magnitude and variability to detect significance at\np\n<\u20090.05 with a power of 80%. For all statistical analyses, data normality was first assessed to determine use of parametric or non-parametric tests as indicated in the\nResults\nsection. For parametric statistics, a two-way ANCOVA (analysis of co-variance) was used to compare group differences and potential interactions. The between-subjects variables consisted of CCI treatment, DZP exposure, and sex, and litter was used as a covariate to account for potential variability in cell labeling densities between litters. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare group differences in the Sholl analysis with the distance from the soma as the within-subject factor and CCI and DZP treatment as the between-subject factors. A Bonferroni post hoc test was used to compare specific distance points when there was a significant interaction between the variables. For non-parametric statistics, a Mann-Whitney test was used to compare CCI-treated groups with their respective vehicle or DZP controls. All figures and statistical analyses were conducted using Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) and SPSS (IBM SPSS, Armonk, NY) software. Data are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM) and comparisons were considered significant at\np\n<\u20090.05. The number of mice for each time-point and analysis are noted in the\nMethods\nsection and figure legends."

    "Methods": "Design and population\nThe Progesterone for Traumatic Brain Injury, Experimental Clinical Treatment (ProTECT) III trial was a Phase III, randomized, multi-center trial designed to determine the efficacy of intravenous progesterone administration started within 4\u2009h of TBI, compared with placebo, and was conducted at 49 trauma centers in the United States.\n19\nEligible subjects had a moderate-to-severe TBI, defined by a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score ranging from 4 to 12 (on a scale of 3\u201315, with lower scores indicating a lower level of consciousness). Patients with hypoxia (oxygen saturation <90%), hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90\u2009mm Hg), spinal cord injury, status epilepticus, or bilaterally unreactive pupils were not eligible. The ProTECT III protocol was reviewed and approved by each site's institutional review board (IRB), including an amendment allowing blood sample collection, analysis, and storage. The ProTECT III trial began in July 2010 and was stopped early for futility in November 2013, after 882 subjects had been randomized.\n19\nPatients included in this trial received protocol-driven care consistent with the Guidelines for the Management of Severe TBI.\n20\nBiomarkers of Injury and Outcome in ProTECT III (BIO-ProTECT) was designed as an ancillary study to evaluate the association between prospectively collected serum biomarkers of structural injury and recovery in patients enrolled in the ProTECT III trial and was fully embedded into the aforementioned trial design. The first BIO-ProTECT sample was collected in August 2011.\n\nBiomarker sample handling and measurement\nStandard operating procedures were used to collect different blood samples, and serum was used for the biomarker analysis. Blood samples were collected within 4\u2009h of injury. Immediately after collection, blood samples were allowed to clot for 15\u2009min on slush ice and then were separated by centrifugation at 2\u00b0C within 60\u2009min of phlebotomy. The samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until shipped on dry ice to Banyan Biomarkers, Inc. for storage and sample analysis.\nAll biomarkers' assay performance followed published methods\n21\u201323\nand samples were batched and run in duplicate at Banyan Laboratories at Banyan Biomarkers, Inc. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) and the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) for GFAP and UCH-L1 assays (defined as limits of 20% precision) are as follows: GFAP: 0.03\u201350 (ng/mL) and UCH-L1: 0.1\u20139 (ng/mL). Assay limits for S100B and SBDP-150 represent lower and upper calibrator values as follows: S100B: 0.015\u20132 (ng/mL) and SBDP-150: 0.02\u20136.4 (ng/mL). Results of the biomarker analysis were delivered to the Statistical Coordinating Center at the Medical University of South Carolina, where the study database was managed and analyzed by the ProTECT III statistical team (SDY, LF, QP). Clinical investigators and personnel at Banyan Biomarkers, Inc. remained blinded to clinical data and subject allocation.\n\nOutcome measurements\nThe primary outcome for the ProTECT III study was global neurological recovery at 6 months post-injury, as determined by Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E).\n24\nScores on the GOS-E range from 1 (death) and 2 (vegetative state) to 7 and 8 (lower and upper good recovery, respectively), such that higher scores are associated with better outcomes. Unfavorable outcome was defined as a GOS-E score of 1\u20134 and a favorable outcome, a GOS-E score of 5\u20138.\n\nDemographic and clinical injury variables\nBaseline patient variables/characteristics used to characterize the population and for covariate adjustment included: age, sex, index Glasgow Coma Scale (iGCS) score (highest GCS score recorded prior to enrollment in the ProTECT clinical trial). CNS injury type, based on the Rotterdam CT scoring of the admission head CT,\n25\nwas also considered. Polytrauma was identified using the Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) derived from the Injury Severity Score (ISS).\n26\nSubjects with an AIS value \u22653 on any body region other than head were considered to have polytrauma; subjects who did not meet the criteria for polytrauma were designated as having isolated head injury.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAlthough the ProTECT III trial failed to demonstrate an effect of progesterone,\n19\nthe biomarker analyses were first carried out for the progesterone and placebo groups separately. Because the estimated biomarker effects were similar in both groups with no statistically significant interactions between treatment groups and individual biomarkers (\nSupplementary Fig. S1\n), data from both treatment groups were pooled together to provide greater power for analyzing the relationship between biomarkers and the primary outcome. Results presented are based on subjects for whom the biomarker levels were within the specified limits of quantification to obtain consistent estimates of their association with outcome.\n27\n,\n28\nAs a sensitivity analysis, prior to the predictive model building, a single imputation using the ULOQ or the LLOQ was applied to subjects with biomarker levels above or below the specified limits, respectively. Subjects with missing 6-month GOS-E scores were excluded from the analysis, given the small percentage (6%) of missing scores.\nAssociations between each biomarker and the primary outcome were evaluated with logistic regression models. Biomarker levels were log-transformed in the analytic models to meet the linearity in the logit assumption. Effect estimates for a percentage change in the raw biomarker value (say, e.g., X%) can be obtained by raising the reported odds ratio (OR) to the power ln(1 + [X/100]); that is, the OR for a 10% change in the raw biomarker value can be computed by raising the reported OR to the power ln(1.1). A multi-variable model was then constructed adjusting for covariates age, sex, CT findings according to the Rotterdam CT score and injury severity strata defined according to the index GCS known at randomization into ProTECT III. These variables were included regardless of statistical significance. The multi-variable model was then extended to include all biomarkers, and a backward selection approach was adopted to eliminate biomarkers that failed to significantly improve model fit. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed, and the area under the curve (AUC) was estimated to assess the ability of each model to discriminate between favorable and unfavorable outcome. These analyses were conducted under a level of significance of 0.05 and performed using statistical analysis software SAS version 9.4.\nFor the predictive model to be generalizable to future patients with biomarkers outside of quantification limits, model generation was based on all subjects with all four biomarkers available, with the imputation specified above applied. Predictive models were first developed using a split-sample approach based on bootstrapping samples. A training sample with the same size of the original sample was first drawn with replacement from the original data set. Subjects who were not included in the training sample were treated as a test set. For each training sample, predictive models were built using logistic regression and classification-tree based methods, and the AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive error were estimated from the test set. The classification-tree based approaches include Classification and Regression Trees (CARTs)\n29\nand ensemble trees (Boosting, Bagging, and Random Forest).\n30\u201332\nThe CART model recursively partitions a response variable according to the characteristics of predictors until a certain level of homogeneity is achieved within a subgroup, resulting in a single tree. Each of the ensemble methods builds multiple trees, with each tree voting for the final prediction. This process was repeated for 100 iterations.\n33\n,\n34\nThe approach with the largest average AUC over the 100 repetitions was selected and adopted to construct final predictive models based on all subjects in the data set. An online format that includes key variables for determining outcome is available at\nhttps://liqiong.shinyapps.io/BioProTECT\n.\nThe internal validity of the final predictive models was evaluated via bootstrapping as described above. This analysis was carried out using software R version 3.0.2 with packages\nrpart\n,\nadabag\n,\nrandomForest\n, and\nshiny\n.\nUsing simple logistic regression, a range of cutoff points for biomarker values were established for each individual biomarker among 100 bootstrapping samples of the original data. The cutoffs are calculated by setting the predicted probability of the outcome equal to 0.5, which is the default setup to define a predicted outcome based on logistic regression models.\nFor each biomarker, a positive exposure was defined as a value greater than or equal to the mean of the cutoff points derived from the above 100 bootstrapping samples. The biomarker score was then calculated as the total number of positive exposures for each subject. The score ranged from 0 (no positive biomarker exposures) to 4 (all four biomarker exposures were positive). This score was used to estimate the likelihood of a poor outcome based solely on biomarker values."

    "Methods": "Study population\nThis prospective study was part of the EU-funded TBIcare (Evidence-based Diagnostic and Treatment Planning Solution for Traumatic Brain Injuries) project, where we recruited patients with TBIs of all severities at Turku University Hospital, Finland, during November 2011 to October 2013 as described elsewhere.\n15\nAll patients were treated according to local guidelines based on existing international guidelines and recommendations.\n33\nAll patients were examined and classified for the presence of extracranial injuries using the Injury Severity Score (ISS).\n\nBiomarker analyses\nBlood samples for A\u03b240, A\u03b242, GFAP, H-FABP, IL-10, NF-L, S100B, and tau were obtained within 24\u2009h of admission. Plasma H-FABP and IL-10 were analyzed using the K151HTD and K151QUD kits, respectively, from Meso Scale (Meso Scale Diagnostics, Rockville, MD) and S100B was measured using EZHS100B-33K kit from Millipore (Millipore, Billerica, MA) according to the manufacturers' recommendations. For H-FABP, the lower limit of detection (LLoD) was 0.103\u2009ng/mL and the calibration range was 0.137-100\u2009ng/mL. The test has not yet been fully validated by Meso Scale and therefore there is no established lower limit of quantification (LLoQ). For IL-10, the LLoD was 0.04\u2009pg/mL, with the LLoQ at 0.298\u2009pg/mL with a calibration range between 0.0774 and 317.0\u2009pg/mL. For the S100B, the LLoD was 2.7\u2009pg/mL and the calibration range went from 2.7 to 2000.0\u2009pg/mL. One patient was below detection range of the S100B and therefore the concentration of 1\u2009pg/mL was attributed to this patient permitting statistical analysis. This applied concentration does not impact the statistics obtained.\nPlasma GFAP, NF-L, and tau concentrations were measured using the Human Neurology 4-Plex A assay (N4PA) on an HD-1 Single molecule array (Simoa) instrument according to instructions from the manufacturer (Quanterix, Lexington, MA). For GFAP, the LLoD was 0.221\u2009pg/mL, while the LLoQ was 0.467\u2009pg/mL and the calibration range was 0.987\u2009pg/mL to 725.0\u2009pg/mL. The corresponding figures for NF-L were 0.104\u2009pg/mL (LLoD), 0.241\u2009pg/mL (LLoQ), and a calibration range between 0.533\u2009pg/mL and 453.0\u2009pg/mL. The corresponding figures for tau were 0.024\u2009pg/mL (LLoD), with a calibration range between 0.053\u2009pg/mL (LLoQ) and 0.136\u2009pg/mL to 112.0\u2009pg/mL. Plasma A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 concentrations were measured using a duplex Simoa immunoassay (Quanterix). For A\u03b240, the LLoD was 0.045\u2009pg/mL and the LLoQ was 0.142\u2009pg/mL, with a calibration range between 0\u2009pg/mL and 90.0\u2009pg/mL. For A\u03b242, the LLoD was 0.142\u2009pg/mL and the LLoQ was 0.69\u2009pg/mL, with a calibration range between 0\u2009pg/mL and 11.0\u2009pg/mL.\nExcluding the single patient with S100B level below the detection range, there were no samples below the LLoDs and LLoQs. The measurements were performed by board-certified laboratory technicians who were blinded to clinical data.\n\nTBI severity and CT scan grading\nTBI severity assessment was solely based on the lowest Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score before intubation, either at the scene of accident or emergency department. A GCS value of 13\u201315 was considered mild, 9\u201312 moderate, and 3\u20138 severe TBI. For the analysis and taking into account clinical relevance, we analyzed the results in both the whole patient group and in the mTBI group separately. In addition, the groups were further divided into non-isolated (i.e., concomitant extracranial injuries) and isolated TBI subgroups.\nInclusion criteria were as follows: age \u226518 years, clinical diagnosis of TBI, and indications for acute head CT according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) criteria (\nhttp://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg176\n). Exclusion criteria were blast-induced or penetrating injury, chronic subdural hematoma, inability to live independently as a result of pre-existing brain disease, TBI or suspected TBI not needing head CT, >2 weeks from the injury, not speaking the local language, and no consent obtained. CT scans were classified according to the Marshall grading system.\n34\nDiffuse injury/grade I (no visual pathology) was considered CT-, whereas the other grades (II-VI) were regarded as CT+. Neuroradiologists at the Turku University Hospital and a senior neurosurgeon (JPP) double-read the CT scans.\n\nStatistical analysis\nDemographics of the subjects and time elapse from injury to blood sampling are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation. Normality of distribution of biomarkers levels was assessed with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and by visually inspecting data histograms. The levels of biomarkers were not normally distributed, and data are presented as medians and 25th and 75th percentiles. The GCS scores were not normally distributed. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the biomarker levels between the groups and to compare GCS score between patient groups. The ability of biomarkers in discriminating CT+ and CT\u2212 patients is presented with area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Youden's Index (J). J captures the maximum performance of a dichotomous diagnostic test when equal importance is given to sensitivity and specificity (J\u2009=\u2009sensitivity+specificity-1).\n35\nPartial AUC (pAUC) was used to compare only a portion of the biomarkers AUC curves, which here was set to the clinically relevant range 90\u2013100% sensitivity. Panels were developed by the iterative combination of biomarkers and thresholds method using the toolbox Panelomix.\n36\nFor each biomarker, several cut-offs are selected and the best combination of markers and threshold is selected to give the best panel performance. The size of panels was set to maximum three biomarkers and was evaluated when sensitivity was set at 90\u2013100% and at 100%. The biomarker levels in different patient groups have been presented as medians and interquartile ranges. The correlations between the biomarker levels were analyzed with Pearson correlation coefficient.\nData availability statement\nDe-identified clinical, imaging, and biochemical data not published within the article can be shared with a qualified investigator by request."

    "Methods": "Animals\nFemale Sprague\u2013Dawley (SD) rats \u223c3 months of age, weighing 200\u2013250\u2009g, were used (Charles River, Indianapolis, IN), without identification of their estrous cycle. Female rats are used because of the need for manual post-injury bladder expression, which is facilitated in females because of their shorter urethra. In a recent study, male and female rats exhibited similar patterns of recovery following experimental SCI.\n17\nIn a separate study, the phase of the estrous cycle at the time of contusion injury did not affect outcome.\n18\nGiven the neuroprotective effects of estrogen and progesterone and sex differences in many acute injury paradigms it is essential to confirm efficacy in male rats in future study. Rats were kept under standard housing conditions for at least 1 week following arrival in an enclosed, pathogen-free animal facility. All experimental procedures were approved and conducted in accordance with the Guidelines of the United States National Institutes of Health and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Kentucky.\n\nContusional SCI\nSCI was modeled in rats using a moderately severe contusion injury (180\u2009kdyn, T10, Infinite Horizon SCI Impactor).\n19\nThe contusive rat thoracic SCI is widely used and produces similar morphological, biochemical, and functional outcomes to those of humans following SCI.\n20\n,\n21\nThe moderately severe contusion injury (force setting 180\u2009kdyn) results in partial deficits in hindlimb function in rats.\n19\n\nFlubendazole intraperitoneal (IP) administration\nFlubendazole was prepared by dissolving the drug in 0.9% saline plus 0.01% Tween 80.\n15\nRats were randomly assigned to the following groups (\nn\n=\u200910 per group): (1) contusion-injured rats that received daily IP injections of 5\u2009mg/kg/day of flubendazole for 2 weeks, beginning 3\u2009h post-injury; (2) contusion-injured rats that received daily IP injections of 10\u2009mg/kg/day of flubendazole for 2 weeks, beginning 3\u2009h post-injury; (3) contusion-injured rats that received daily IP injections of 10\u2009mg/kg/day of flubendazole for 4 weeks, beginning 3\u2009h post-injury; (4) contusion-injured rats that received daily IP injections of vehicle (0.9% saline plus 0.01% Tween 80) for 2 weeks, beginning 3\u2009h post-injury; and (5) rats that received sham operation without injury.\nThe flubendazole dose (5\u201310\u2009mg/kg/day) for rats used in this study is comparable to the human dose of 100\u2009mg/day commonly prescribed for treating pinwoms (\nhttps://drugs.ncats.io/substance/R8M46911LR\n),\n15\nafter factoring in a dose conversion factor from human to rat of 6.2.\n22\n,\n23\nFlubendazole has also been shown to provide clinical improvement in patents with neurocysticercosis at a dose of 20\u2009mg/kg, twice a day for 10 days.\n13\nThe starting time of intervention, beginning at 3\u2009h post-injury, was chosen as an intermediate time point between acute administration immediately following injury\n24\nand delayed administration of several hours to days post-injury.\n20\n,\n25\nThe therapeutic window will be further evaluated in future studies. IP administration was chosen because flubendazole is poorly soluble in aqueous systems and has low bioavailability after oral treatment in animals and humans.\n26\u201328\nThe majority of an oral dose (> 80%) is excreted in feces and only very small amounts of unchanged drug (< 0.1%) are found in the urine. The half-life of flubendazole in tissues is 1\u20132 days. The 2 and 4 week flubendazole treatment durations were chosen to target the time course of proliferation of astrocytes and B cells after contusive SCI in rats.\n29\u201334\nIn mice, B cell proliferation peaks at 14 days and remains elevated at 28 days following contusive SCI.\n35\nHowever, this is influenced by the site of injury.\n30\n,\n36\n,\n37\n\nAntibodies and chemicals\nFlubendazole was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Anti-IgG and anti-cyclin B1 antibody were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Anti-GFAP antibody and anti-total BTK antibody were from Novus Biologicals USA (Littleton, CO). Anti-phospho-BTK-Y223 antibody was purchased from ABclonal (Woburn, MA). Anti-CD45RA-PE antibody was purchased from Invitrogen (Waltham, MA). Anti-GAPDH antibody was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).\n\nAssessment of locomotor function\nOpen field locomotor function was evaluated pre-injury, immediately and 3 and 7 days post-injury, and then weekly from until 7 weeks post-injury using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) rating scale\n38\nas in our previous studies.\n24\n,\n39\nTwo evaluators, trained and certified by the Ohio State program, participated in the assessment in a blinded manner.\n\nKinematic analysis\nKinematic analysis provides a detailed analysis of limb, joint movement, and locomotor function. The kinematic analysis is an objective method to assess plantar stepping and coordination based on the Regularity Index (RI%), Coordinated Plantar Stepping Index% (CPI%), and Plantar Stepping Index% (PSI%). Kinematic software (Max Traq, Innovision Systemic, Columbiaville, MI) was utilized to analyze sagittal and ventral view digital video recordings of each rat walking on a platform,\n40\nwith a minimum of three passes of each rat per session. Coordinated Plantar Stepping Index, Regularity Index, and Plantar Stepping Index scores were obtained. The rats were trained to walk on the platform pre-operatively, and were evaluated at 7 weeks post-injury.\n\nSpinal cord tissue processing\nFor Western blot analysis, animals were euthanatized at 4 weeks post-injury by Fatal Plus containing pentobarbital (100\u2009mg/kg for rat, IP injection,\nn\n=\u20093 per group). A 5\u2009mm spinal cord centered on lesion site was removed and snap-frozen on dry ice, then stored at -80\u00b0C. For histological staining analysis, at the conclusion of the locomotor assessment, animals were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with cold 0.1\u2009M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (\nn\n=\u20096 per group). Fixed spinal cord blocks (2\u2009cm in length) centered at the lesion epicenter were immediately dissected, post-fixed in the same fixative solution for 4\u2009h at 4\u00b0C, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in phosphate buffered saline at 4\no\nC, and further processed for frozen/cryostat sections.\n\nHistological staining and analysis\nHistological staining and analysis of fixed spinal cord sections was performed as previously described.\n1\n,\n24\n,\n39\n,\n41\nSpinal cords were serially cryosectioned at a thickness of 20\u2009\u03bcm. Every fifth section (interval between 100\u2009\u03bcm) was mounted onto each Fisherbrand Superfrost Plus slide. The interval between two sections on each slide was 1\u2009mm. Ten sets of slides were collected and stored at -20\u00b0C. A modified eriochrome cyanine (EC) staining plus cresyl violet staining protocol for myelin that differentiates both white matter and cell bodies were performed to visualize spared spinal tissue on one set of slides.\n41\nBriefly, the frozen spinal cord sections were thawed, cleared (Hemo-De, Fisher), hydrated, and stained with EC solution (Sigma; 0.2% EC, 0.5% aqueous H2SO4, and 10% FeCl3) at room temperature for 10\u2009min. This was followed by washes in water and differentiation for 1\u2009min in 0.5% aqueous NH\n4\nOH. The slides were then counterstained with cresyl violet staining solution.\nThe reaction was terminated with rinses in water before sections were dehydrated and cover-slipped. Image analysis was performed on each EC-stained section and histological outcomes were evaluated by measuring total spinal section area, gray matter sparing, and lesion area on individual sections using Scion Image System. White matter sparing was calculated by subtracting the lesion area and gray matter area from the total section area. Volume of spared tissue (total tissue sparing, total white matter sparing, or total gray matter sparing) was calculated by summing individual section tissue sparing areas and multiplying the distance between sections as previously described.\n1\n,\n24\n,\n39\n,\n41\nThe percentage of total tissue sparing was calculated from 11 evenly spaced sections based on the lesion area divided by the total spinal section area, converted to a percentage, and subtracted from 100%. The lesion volume was calculated by summing individual section lesion area and multiplying the distance between sections.\n\nWestern blotting\nSpinal cord samples were processed for Western blotting analysis as described in our previous studies.\n1\n,\n39\n,\n42\nBriefly, the protein samples were obtained by homogenization, sonication, and microcentrifugation of the spinal cord samples in a radio-immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer at 14,000\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min. Protein quantities were determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method. Samples (30\u2009\u03bcg of protein extract each sample) were then loaded on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels and electrotransfered to nitrocellulose membranes. After transfer, membranes were incubated in 20\u2009mL of blocking buffer (5% powdered milk in 1 x tris buffered saline (TBS), 0.1% Tween 20) for 1\u2009h at room temperature and washed three times for 10\u2009min with 25\u2009mL of wash buffer (1 x TBS, 0.1% Tween 20). Membranes were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with one of the primary antibodies (\nTable 1\n). Blots were probed with a primary polyclonal antibody against specific targets and re-probed with a monoclonal antibody against glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH) as a loading control. Blots were then incubated with IRDye\n\u00ae\nanti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:5000). Blots were visualized and analyzed on the Li-Cor Odyssey infrared imaging system (Lincoln, NE).\nTable 1.\nPrimary and Secondary Antibodies\nAntibodies\nMolecule Wt. kDa\nSource\nDilution\nIncubation Time/ Temperature\nCompany\nPrimary Antibodies\nCyclin B1 (Polyclonal)\n58\nRabbit\n1:1000\n18\u2009h/4\u00b0C\nAbcam\nGFAP (Monoclonal)\n43\u201345\nMouse\n1:200\n18\u2009h/4\u00b0C\nSanta Cruz Biotech\npBTK (Tyr233, Polyclonal)\n77\nRabbit\n1:1000\n18\u2009h/4\u00b0C\nCell Signaling Tech\nTotal BTK (Monoclonal)\n77\nRabbit\n1:1000\n18\u2009h/4\u00b0C\nCell Signaling Tech\nIgG (Monoclonal)\n50\nRabbit\n1:500\n18\u2009h/4\u00b0C\nAbcam\nGAPDH\n36\nRabbit\n1:1000\n18\u2009h/4\u00b0C\nSigma\nGAPDH\n36\nMouse\n1:1000\n18\u2009h/4\u00b0C\nSigma\nSecondary Antibodies\nIR Dye 800\nAnti-rabbit\n1:5000\n1h/RT\nLI-COR Biosciences\nIR Dye 680\nAnti-mouse\n1:5000\n1h/RT\nLI-COR Biosciences\nOpen in a separate window\nRT, room temperature.\n\nFlow cytometry analysis\nSham-operated and injured rats with treatment of flubendazole or vehicle were euthanized at 4 weeks post-injury or sham operation.

Immediately after deep anesthesia, the spleen samples were collected. The spleen samples were removed and minced in a 3.5\u2009cm dish with Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, Invitrogen), then transferred to a 50\u2009mL tube with HBSS.

    "Methods": "Data source\nVanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) is a tertiary care hospital in Nashville, Tennessee, with affiliated clinics throughout the region. EHRs have been used at VUMC since the early 1990s, and data are compiled in a de-identified IBM Netezza database known as the Synthetic Derivative (SD).\n27\nThe SD contains more than 2.8 million patient EHRs, and these are linked to DNA biosamples in >275,000 patients, who could eventually be used in genetic studies of PCS. Available data in the SD include basic demographics, billing codes, procedure codes, clinical documents, medications, laboratory values, and dates of inpatient stays and outpatient visits. The majority of billing codes are\nInternational Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision\n(ICD-9), with VUMC transitioning to Tenth Revision (ICD-10) in 2015. The resource is continuously updating, and data extracted for this project were current to January 13, 2017. The Vanderbilt University Institutional Review Board approved this project (IRB #151116).\n\nGold standard PCS definition\nPCS was defined as one or more post-concussion symptoms (\nSupplementary Table S1\n) that persisted beyond 14 days of an mTBI. The TBI was considered moderate/severe and subsequently excluded if it was: 1) penetrating; 2) accompanied by a neurosurgical procedure including hemorrhage evacuation, decompression, or invasive intracranial pressure monitoring within 7 days; 3) associated with a GCS score <13; or 4) accompanied by a hospitalization >5 days. A strict concussion definition also was considered, in which the TBI was ineligible in the presence of positive brain imaging.\n5\nAdditional exclusion criteria were <5 years of age, or any confounding neurological disease diagnosed before the mTBI (brain tumor, stroke, seizures, meningitis, intracranial abscess, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, or other cerebral degeneration).\n\nSample selection\nNLP algorithm\nWe developed a multi-step NLP algorithm that leveraged contextual information in clinical documents to diagnose PCS cases and controls. The algorithm identified keywords for \u201cpost-concussion syndrome\u201d and PCS symptoms (\nSupplementary Table S1\n) from the narrative text of clinical notes and problem lists using regular expression logic built into Netezza Structured Query Language. Keyword misspellings were defined\na priori\n(e.g., \u201cpostconcussion syndrome\u201d), and mentions were excluded if a negation phrase occurred within 15 characters before a keyword (e.g., \u201cno evidence of post-concussion syndrome\u201d). Negation phrases were not expanded to characters after the keyword, as this was more likely to capture a negation phrase not associated with the original keyword. Text was not vectorized, and there were no filters on problem lists since at VUMC these are completed anew by providers at each clinical encounter.\nThe NLP algorithm was augmented by filters on coded data, and proceeded in five steps (\nFig. 1\n). In step 1, patients with mTBI were identified using a list of ICD-9 and ICD-10 mTBI codes (\nSupplementary Table S2\n). In step 2, we excluded patients with evidence of severe TBI, defined as any TBI code (\nSupplementary Table S3\n) followed by a neurosurgical procedure code (ICD-9 01* and 02*; ICD-10 00*, 0N*, R40.242, R40.243; Current Procedural Terminology 61000\u201362258) within 7 days. These neurosurgical procedure codes were previously found to be 97% sensitive and 94% specific for severe TBI.\n28\nIn step 3, we identified the most recent eligible mTBI using discharge windows as a proxy for TBI severity, and excluded mTBI codes that fell within a discharge window of >5 days. If a patient had multiple mTBI codes and the most recent code fell within a discharge window >5 days, the algorithm iterated over the second most recent mTBI code in the chart, checked whether it fell within a discharge window >5 days, and so on until an eligible mTBI code was found or no previous mTBI codes remained. If a patient had no eligible mTBI codes, they were excluded. In step 4, patients meeting the following criteria were excluded: <5 years of age at the mTBI; a moderate or severe TBI (defined as any TBI code occurring in a discharge window >5 days) within 365 days of the mTBI; or a history of confounding neurological disease diagnosed before the mTBI (\nSupplementary Table S4\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria used by the natural language processing algorithm to select mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) patients from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Synthetic Derivative (VUMC SD), with and without subsequent post-concussion syndrome (PCS).\nIn step 5, patients were classified as cases and controls based on the occurrence of PCS billing codes (ICD-9 310.2, ICD-10 F07.81) or keywords. Controls had no evidence of PCS anywhere in their record, and additionally had to have visited VUMC as an outpatient at least once in the 365 days before and once in the 365 days after the mTBI (i.e., using VUMC as their \u201cmedical home\u201d). Cases had to have a PCS billing code or keyword on the same day as at least one PCS symptom billing code or keyword (\nSupplementary Table S1\n), and the PCS code or keyword needed to occur at least 14 days and up to 365 days after the mTBI. Patients identified by this algorithm are hereafter called NLP cases and NLP controls.\nCoded algorithm\nWe selected a second case group entirely independent of the NLP algorithm based on only filters applied to coded data. The algorithm filters were deliberately minimal, to evaluate the performance of a simple case ascertainment scheme that maximized the number of included patients. Cases were required to have two or more instances of the PCS billing code (ICD-9 310.2, ICD-10 F07.81) on different days, a widely adopted standard for defining cases in EHR research,\n25\n,\n29\nand we excluded patients with any neurosurgical procedure code in their record (ICD-9 01* and 02*; ICD-10 00*, 0N*, R40.242, R40.243; Current Procedural Terminology 61000\u201362258), patients who were <5 years of age at their first PCS code, and those with confounding neurological histories diagnosed before their first PCS billing code. Patients identified by this algorithm are hereafter called coded cases.\n\nVariable definitions\nStructured data were used to describe the injury and symptom characteristics of patients identified by the NLP and coded algorithms. Variable definitions were based only on structured data, for ease of comparability across the NLP and coded algorithm patient groups. TBI morbidity group was derived by mapping ICD codes to categories of skull fracture, contusion, hemorrhage, concussion, and other/unspecified (\nSupplementary Table S3\n). Brain imaging was captured by ICD billing and procedure codes (\nSupplementary Table S5\n). TBI cause was assigned by mapping ICD external cause codes to categories of motor vehicle collision, fall, struck by and against, and assault (\nSupplementary Table S6\n). Finally, data on PCS symptoms were extracted from ICD codes (\nSupplementary Table S1\n).\n\nManual review\nThe validity of both algorithms was evaluated by manually reviewing the clinical documents of 50 NLP cases, 50 NLP controls, and 50 coded cases. Records were randomly selected by JD, ensuring that the NLP and coded case groups were non-overlapping. We extracted data on TBI severity, care sought, cause of injury, and subsequent PCS symptoms. A REDCap data collection instrument was piloted on 20 records, 10 of which were reviewed in triplicate (JD, PK, and AYK or SLZ), with high inter-rater agreement (Cohen's kappa\u2009=\u20090.80). The remaining 140 records were reviewed by PK, with all disagreements resolved by consensus. Reviewers were not blinded to case status.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe NPV of the NLP algorithm was the proportion of manually-reviewed controls with no PCS symptoms persisting beyond 14 days of an eligible mTBI or concussion. The PPV of the NLP and coded algorithms were the proportion of manually-reviewed cases that met the broad mTBI and strict concussion definitions of PCS. In evaluating records, we excluded first on the presence or absence of PCS symptoms, and second on TBI severity. We chose this order because PCS is ultimately defined by the persistence of symptoms, and we wanted to count the number of potential cases who were excluded based on TBI severity.\nIn addition to predictive values, EHR diagnostic algorithms can be validated by replicating known epidemiological associations.\n25\n,\n26\nWe therefore compared each case group to controls on age, sex, and pre-morbid diagnoses that have previously been associated with PCS risk: ADHD, anxiety, depression, learning disability, migraine, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Diagnoses were captured by billing codes (\nSupplementary Table S7\n), and we only considered those that occurred before the eligible mTBI in NLP patients, and before the first PCS code in coded patients. An age difference was detected by a t-test while categorical variables were evaluated by chi-squared tests. Statistical tests were two-sided, and all analyses were conducted in R version 3.3.\n30"

    "Methods": "Animals\nC57/BL6 male mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Sacramento, CA) at the age of 4 months. Animals were housed at the vivaria of the University of Southern California, a vivaria approved by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. All protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were habituated to the vivaria environment for 1 week before initiation of the experiments, with experimental design as outlined in\nFigure 1\n. CCI animals were divided into four groups receiving daily administration of BQCA at one of three doses (20\u2009mg/kg, CCI-20; 10\u2009mg/kg, CCI-10; 5\u2009mg/kg, CCI-5) or vehicle (CCI-Veh). Sham animals received daily administration of vehicle only (SHAM-Veh).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nResearch design. Mice received right cortex contusion injury (CCI) over motorsensory cortex or sham injury (SHAM). Two days thereafter, they were administered benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid (BQCA; 5, 10, and 20\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneally), an M1 muscarinic-positive allosteric modulator, or vehicle. One week after CCI, mice were evaluated weekly for 3 weeks with a battery of motor tests, as well as with daily evaluation of spatial learning and memory using the Morris water maze. Thereafter, cerebral glucose uptake was investigated during walking in an exercise wheel with [\n14\nC]-2-deoxygIucose autoradiography, comparing CCI mice treated with BQCA (20\u2009mg/kg) or vehicle.\n\nCortex contusion injury\nMice were anesthetized with isoflurane (2.5% induction, 1.3% maintenance in 30% oxygen, and 70% nitrous oxide). The head was mounted in a stereotaxic frame (Stereotactic Alignment System; David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA), the skin was incised and reflected, and a 3.6-mm craniotomy fashioned over the right sensorimotor cortex. Body temperature was maintained at 37.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u00b0C. CCI injury was induced using a Leica Impact One Stereotaxic Impactor device (impact velocity of 5.25\u2009m/sec, 3.0-mm-diameter impounder tip, dwell time 0.1\u2009sec, depth 2.0\u2009mm; Leica Biosystems Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL). Stereotaxic coordinates for the center of impact were anterior-posterior \u22121.0\u2009mm, +2.5\u2009mm lateral to bregma. After trauma, the galea and skin was sutured to cover the craniotomy. In sham CCI, there was a skin incision, but no craniotomy. Mice were housed individually for 1\u2009h in a warming/induction chamber at 37.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u00b0C (VWR, Radnor, PA) in a temperature-controlled cage to prevent hypothermia until they regained the righting reflex and spontaneous movements. Flunixin (2.5\u2009mg/kg, subcutaneously\u2009\u00d7\u20092/day\u2009\u00d7\u20093 days) was administered for analgesia.\n\nAdministration of benzylquinolone carboxylic acid\nTwo days after CCI, mice were administered BQCA (98.6% purity by chromatography; Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI), an M1 muscarinic positive allosteric modulator or vehicle. After CCI, animals received i.p. dosing at 5, 10, and 20\u2009mg/kg (CCI-5, CCI-10, and CCI-20) in 0.1\u2009mL of 10% Tween, with dosing twice per day over 31 days, and the first daily dose given 30\u2009min before behavioral testing. Doses were prepared freshly before each injection. After i.p. injection, BQCA reaches a peak in brain 30\u2009min to 1\u2009h and remains stable for \u223c4\u2009h, decaying thereafter with an elimination half-life of 2\u2009h.\n24\nDoses of BQCA are based on previous reports in non-TBI models.\n23\u201325\n,\n27\n\nCholinergic side effects\nMotor, secretory, respiratory, and general symptoms were graded in a separate group of nonlesioned mice (\nn\n=\u20094), before and at half hour intervals over 90\u2009min after administration of BQCA (20\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) as per the scale of Jovic.\n28\nSedative effects were also evaluated by continuous monitoring of locomotor activity in the open field as described below. Locomotor activity was assessed by video tracking over a half hour, 30\u2009min after acute dosing with BQCA (20\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle.\n\nMotor assessment\nBefore experimentation, mice were familiarized with the rotarod (5\u2009min/day\u2009\u00d7\u20095 days) and gait analysis (2 exposures/day\u2009\u00d7\u20092 days) paradigms (\nFig. 1\n). All mice were tested before CCI and then once per week thereafter for 3 weeks. Before testing, mice were placed into the testing room for 1\u2009h (ambient sound 57\u2009dB). Motor testing occurred in the following sequence: Postural reflex\u2192Open field\u2192Footslip\u2192Grip Strength\u2192Gait analysis\u2192Rotarod. Comparison was made between SHAM-Veh (\nn\n=\u20098), CCI-Veh (\nn\n=\u20099), CCI-5 (\nn\n=\u20098), CCI-10 (\nn\n=\u200910), and CCI-20 (n\u2009=\u20098) groups.\nPostural reflex.\n29\nThis was assessed in a blinded fashion. Mice were lifted by their tails and recorded using a 3-point scale: 0\u2009=\u2009hindlimb abduction, forelimb symmetric splayed apart, arched back (normal response); 1\u2009=\u2009failure to extend the contralesional forepaw fully, with or without wrist flexion; and 2\u2009=\u2009full adduction of forepaw, with shoulder rotation toward contralateral thorax.\nOpen field behavior\nLocomotor activity was measured in a circular arena (diameter, 38.0\u2009cm). Pathlength was recorded with a video tracking system (Ethovision XT; Noldus, Leesburg, VA) under attenuated yellow lighting using a ceiling-mounted camera. Trajectories during 20-min trials were recorded, as an indication of their locomotor behavior.\nFootslip\nMice were individually placed in the test chamber, which consisted of a Plexiglas/stainless steel box (30\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u2009cm) with a floor of stainless steel rods of 2-mm diameter and 1-cm separation. The chamber was illuminated with indirect ambient fluorescent light from a ceiling panel. A mouse was filmed for 5\u2009min from below, while it walked on the grid. Footslips were counted offline from the video recording in a blinded fashion as a measure of fine motor coordination.\nGait analysis\nMice were trained to traverse a white, Plexiglas walkway (4\u2009cm width, 15\u2009cm height, and 46\u2009cm height) to reach a black enclosed target box (25\u2009\u00d7\u200925\u2009\u00d7\u200915\u2009cm). Feet were painted with different color nontoxic paint. Thereafter, the mouse was released to traverse the runway whose floor was covered with white paper (3 trials/day, 5-min intertrial interval) and which was illuminated with indirect ambient fluorescent light from a ceiling panel. Stride length, hind-paw stance width, and overlap of hind paws were assessed by ruler, excluding footprints at the beginning and end of the trials where mice initiated and finished their run, respectively. The average of three runs was taken as the animal's values for stride length, stance width (front-base width, hind-base width), and gait pattern (overlap between forepaw and hindpaw placement) using the methods of Carter and colleagues.\n30\nGrip strength\nLatency was measured to fall off of an inverted cage top into bedding below. The average of 3 trials was assessed (10-min intertrial interval).\nRotarod treadmill test\nStrength and coordination were evaluated on a rotarod treadmill (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). Mice were placed on a scored, cylindrical spindle of 7.3\u2009cm diameter with lateral motion impeded by opaque plastic panels. Latency to fall was tested in an acceleration paradigm (5\u219235\u2009rpm over 300\u2009sec in 1-rpm intervals, 3 trials/mouse, 5-min intertrial intervals), with the average of three runs representing the animal's performance.\n31\n,\n32\n\nSpatial learning and memory\nThis was evaluated with a water maze paradigm,\n33\n,\n34\ncomparing SHAM-Veh (\nn\n=\u200912), CCI-Veh (\nn\n=\u200914), CCI-5 (\nn\n=\u20098), CCI-10 (\nn\n=\u200910), and CCI-20 (\nn\n=\u20099) groups. Mice swam in a circular pool surrounded by a white curtain to find a circular platform, submerged 1\u2009cm beneath the water (20\u00b0C), opacified by the addition of white non-toxic paint. Visual cues mounted on the inside of the arena were in a constant position. Data were acquired under indirect ambient fluorescent lighting using a ceiling-mounted camera and video tracking system (Ethovision XT; Noldus). Mice were introduced into the maze alternating between starting positions orthogonal to the platform. A trial was stopped when the mouse reached the platform or if 60\u2009sec elapsed, after which the mouse was placed on the platform. After remaining on the platform for 15\u2009sec, the mouse was removed from the maze, gently towel-dried, and returned to its cage. At baseline preceding CCI, mice received 6 trials per day (intertrial interval 20\u2009min) for 7 consecutive days, and then weekly (6 trials/day\u2009\u00d7\u20094 days/week) for 3 weeks after CCI or sham CCI. The target platform was moved to a new quadrant in the maze at the start of each week (reversal phase). In the final trial of the final week, recall was evaluated with a probe trial. Here, the escape platform was removed and the duration over 60\u2009sec spent searching in the quadrant of the maze that previously held the platform was examined.\n\nBehavioral data analysis\nFor grip strength, rotarod, foot slip, and gait analyses, we applied two-way, repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs; mixed-model ANOVA, SPSS, version 14.0) at weekly post-operative time points, using GROUP as the between-subjects variable and WEEKS as the within-subjects repeated measure.\nt\n-tests (two-tailed,\np\n<\u20090.05) were used for post-hoc comparisons. Postural asymmetry scores were compared between groups by the Kruskal-Wallis test at each time point.\nFor the water maze, latency and pathlength to reach the target were averaged across the 6 trials/day and expressed as a daily mean. Baseline data included all animals in the study. Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA was separately used to analyze the acquisition phase (baseline, days 1\u20137), as well as each of the weekly reversal phases (weeks 1\u20133, days 1\u20134). GROUP was defined as the between-subject variable and DAYS as the repeated measure. In addition, we examined in CCI animals the effects of different BQCA doses (vehicle, 5\u2009mg/kg, 10\u2009mg/kg, and 20\u2009mg/kg). Repeated-measures one-way ANOVA was separately used to analyze each of the reversal phases (weeks 1\u20133, days 1\u20134), using DOSE as the between-subjects factor and DAYS as the within-subjects repeated measure. For the probe trial that followed the final reversal phase, the time spent in each of the maze's quadrants was assessed. Percent of time spent swimming by each animal in each quadrant was analyzed using a two-way ANOVA with GROUP as between-subjects variables and QUADRANT as the within-subjects repeated measure.\nt\n-tests (two-tailed,\np\n<\u20090.05) were used for post-hoc comparisons.\n\nMeasurement of cerebral glucose uptake during a wheel walking motor challenge\nFive days after the final evaluation in the water maze, CCI-Veh (\nn\n=\u20099), CCI-20 (\nn\n=\u20098), and SHAM-Veh (\nn\n=\u200910) mice were familiarized to slow walking in a closed motorized wheel for 5\u2009min/day twice per day over 2 days (wheel diameter, 15.2\u2009cm; interspoke distance, 6.6\u2009mm; Lafayette Instruments, Lafayette, IN). Mice were fasted overnight on the day of the study, with the final dose of BQCA administered to the CCI-20 group 18\u2009h before brain mapping. One hour after being brought to the experimental suite, mice were administered [\n14\nC]-2-deoxy-\nd\n-glucose (catalog no. MC355, radiochemical purity >97%, specific activity 45\u201360\u2009mCi/mmol, 0.3\u2009\u03bcCi/g in 0.5\u2009mL of normal saline, i.p.; Moravek Inc., Brea, CA). Animals were placed into the motorized wheel and walked at a speed of 2\u2009m/min over 45\u2009min. Thereafter, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (4%) and decapitated.\nBrains were flash frozen and serially sectioned (75 coronal 20-\u03bcm slices, 140-\u03bcm interslice distance). Autoradiographic images of brain slices along with 12 [\n14\nC] standards (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA) were digitized. Relative regional cerebral glucose uptake (rCGU) was measured according to the method of Sokoloff and colleagues,\n35\nwith modification.\n36\u201338\n\nLesion volume\nAfter completion of the assessment rCGU and euthanasia, lesion volume was determined from digitized autoradiographs of serial coronal brain cryosections in a manner blinded to drug dosing. Contours of the area of tissue loss and of the ipsi- and contralateral hemispheres were drawn, and their respective areas were computed on slices with Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD). Total volume of the lesion for each animal was computed by multiplying the average areas (\u03bcm\n2\n) of every two consecutive slices by the interslice distance (140\u2009\u03bcm).\n\nAnalysis of regional brain activation\nEach three-dimensional (3D) brain was reconstructed from 75 digitized autoradiograms (voxel size: 40\u2009\u00d7\u2009140\u2009\u00d7\u200940\u2009\u03bcm\n3\n) using TurboReg\n39\nand a non-warping geometric model that includes rotations and translations and nearest-neighbor interpolation. A brain template was created using our previously published methods,\n40\nin which the background and ventricular spaces were thresholded based on their optical density. We utilized cost-function masking for spatial normalization of lesioned brain.\n41\n,\n42\nBinary masks were created of the lesioned areas in each CCI animal by manually depicting the precise boundaries of any gross lesions directly on the autoradiographic images using MRIcron software. Signal under the masked area in each animal was removed from the calculation of the transformations needed to normalize the image in order to avoid distortion. Spatial normalization consisted of a 12-parameter affine transformation followed by a non-linear spatial normalization using 3D discrete cosine transforms. Normalized brains were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel (full width at half maximum\u2009=\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u2009voxel dimension). Absolute amount of radiotracer of each brain was scaled to a single mean.\nUnbiased, voxel-by-voxel statistical analyses were performed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM, version 5)\n43\nto identify significant group differences in relative changes in local glucose uptake (rCGU) during wheel walking for the CCI-Veh versus SHAM-Veh and the CCI-20 versus CCI-Veh comparisons. Significance was set at\np <\n0.05 at the voxel level and an extent threshold of greater than 100 significant, contiguous voxels to control type 1 and 2 errors. Regions were identified by a mouse brain atlas.\n44\nDirectionality of rCGU changes was analyzed with Student's\nt\n-tests (2-tailed,\np\n<\u20090.05, >100 voxels cluster size). In addition, using SPM, we performed a correlation between latency to find the platform on day 4 of the third week and rCGU across the brain (\np\n<\u20090.05 for >100 contiguous voxels) for the combined Sham-Veh, CCI-Veh, and CCI-20 groups. In addition, correlations of latency with rCGU from an ipsilesional and contralesional posterior CA1 region of interest are depicted graphically."

    "Methods": "Participants\nParticipants in the study were active duty U.S. military personnel, 18\u201355 years of age, recruited at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) in Bethesda, Maryland. All provided written informed consent before their participation and all study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board at WRNMMC.\nSMs in the healthy control group were screened to ensure they had no history of significant blast exposure. This was determined by administering the 3-Question Defense and Brain Injury Center (DVBIC) TBI Screening Tool\n13\nat the time of study enrollment. Members of the healthy control group were also screened to ensure they had normal visual, auditory, and vestibular function. Normal visual function was determined from self-report of normal vision with correction. A Snellen chart was available for participants who were unsure of their status. Normal auditory function was determined by administering a pure-tone audiogram and excluding individuals who did not qualify as an H1 profile under current U.S. Army Regulations (i.e., average threshold level at 500, 1000, and 2000\u2009Hz not greater than 25 dB in the better ear, with no individual level greater than 30 dB at these frequencies, and a threshold not greater than 45 dB at 4000\u2009Hz) or who had asymmetrical hearing with more than a 20-dB difference between ears at 500, 1000, or 2000\u2009Hz. Vestibular function was evaluated by administering the Sensory Organization Test (SOT)\n14\nand excluding SMs with a composite score <70.\nParticipants in the b/TBI group were recruited from the National Intrepid Center of Excellence (NICoE), which is a facility on the campus of WRNMMC that provides a 4-week intensive outpatient program for SMs experiencing chronic post-concussive symptoms as a result of blast exposure and/or TBI. All of the participants in the b/TBI group reported at least one deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan and a significant history of blast exposure as indicated by Questions 1 and 2 of the DVBIC TBI Screening Tool. The b/TBI participants had audiometric thresholds that met the same H1 criteria used for the control participants, and again participation was limited to individuals who had an SOT composite score of at least 70.\nTable 1\nshows mean values and standard deviations for the demographic variables associated with each of the two groups, including United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) status and the Audiometric Pure Tone Average, which was defined as the mean audiometric threshold at 500\u2009Hz, 1\u2009kHz, and 2\u2009kHz, averaged across both ears. The table also shows the percentage of participants in the b/TBI group who experienced acute post-concussive symptoms at the time of the blast injury and/or chronic post-concussive symptoms at the time of testing. These responses were taken from Questions 2 and 3 of the DVBIC TBI Screening Tool. Also, for the b/TBI participants, mean scores are given for the military version of the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-M),\n15\nwhich measures the degree to which SMs were bothered by symptoms related to a traumatic event in the past month.\n16\nThirty-one percent of the b/TBI participants had PCL-M scores >50, which is often used as the cutoff for diagnosing patients with probable post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nTable 1.\nDemographics of Control and b/TBI Subject Groups\nDemographics\nControl\nb/TBI\nNo. of subjects\n29\n29\nAge, years\n30.24 (6.81)\n37.00 (5.11)\n**\nProportion of males\n86%\n100%\n*\nUSSOCOM\n0%\n76%\n**\nPSTD PCL-M\n\u2014\n44.21 (18.00)\nPure tone average (dB HL)\n6.18 (4.10)\n11.01 (5.47)\n**\nSOT composite score\n82.76 (4.75)\n84.93 (4.37)\nSpeed (mi/h)\n2.42 (0.40)\n2.26 (0.53)\nAcute symptoms at time of blast\nConfusion/seeing stars\n0%\n93%\n**\nLoss of memory of injury\n0%\n10%\nLoss of consciousness\n<\n1\u2009min\n0%\n38%\n**\nLoss of consciousness 1\u201320\u2009min\n0%\n10%\nLoss of consciousness\n>\n20\u2009min\n0%\n0%\nConcussion symptoms\n0%\n72%\n**\nTBI\n0%\n31%\n**\nChronic symptoms at time of test\nHeadaches\n0%\n69%\n**\nDizziness\n0%\n28%\n**\nMemory problems\n0%\n86%\n**\nBalance problems\n0%\n28%\n**\nRinging in ears\n0%\n62%\n**\nIrritability\n0%\n79%\n**\nSleep problems\n0%\n79%\n**\nOpen in a separate window\nSymptoms are taken from the DVIBC TBI Screening Tool.\n*\nVariables significantly different between the control and b/TBI groups at the\np\n<\u20090.05 level;\n**\nvariables significantly different at the\np\n<\u20090.01 level.\nTBI, blast-related traumatic brain injury; b/TBI, blast-related TBI; USSOCOM, United States Special Operations Command; PSTD PCL-M, military version of the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist; SOT, Sensory Organization Test.\n\nFacility\nThe study was conducted in the Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment (CAREN;\nFig. 1\n) Laboratory at the NICoE. The CAREN (Motek Medical BV, Amsterdam, Netherlands) is a multi-modal system that can project immersive VEs in front of SMs as they walk. The CAREN has a six-degree-of-freedom motion platform, 3\u2009m in diameter, mounted on electric actuators that allow it to translate\n\u2248\n1\u2009m and rotate\n\u2248\n20 degrees in all directions. This platform contains an embedded, instrumented dual-belt treadmill that is 2\u2009m long, 1\u2009m wide, and has a maximum velocity of 5\u2009m/s. The system's software allows this platform to be synchronized with virtual environments (VEs) that are projected onto the 180-degree horizontal field of view of a cylindrical screen, 2.5\u2009m high by 4.5\u2009m wide, by four projectors (Projection Design, Fredrikstad, Norway). The CAREN was also equipped with an infrared camera-based motion capture system (Vicon Motion Systems Ltd., Oxford, UK) that allows the position and orientation of each participant's head to be tracked by reflective markers in real time. For the purposes of this experiment, the NICoE CAREN was modified to mount a 64-speaker array (Meyer Sound MX-4 Speakers, Berkeley, CA) in a quasi-random spatial pattern behind the screen. The sound presented by these speakers passed through the fabric screen with minimal distortion or loss of signal intensity, allowing auditory targets to be presented in up to 64 distinct locations within the VE.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nThe CAREN (Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment) system at the National Intrepid Center of Excellence (NICoE; left panel) is utilized to implement the experimental tasks. The CAREN system consists of a six-degree-of-freedom motion platform with an embedded treadmill surrounded by a 180-degree field-of-view screen. The NICoE system was modified for this study to include an array of 64-speaker array mounted on a scaffold, behind the fabric screen. The center panel shows the speakers positioned on a truss. The blue dots in the right panel provide a visual representation of each speaker location in the virtual environment, corresponding to the physical location of each loudspeaker. Color image is available online.\nIn order to reduce the potential confounding effect that treadmill noise might have on auditory localization, all of the trials in the experiment were conducted with simulated treadmill noise emanating from three of the loudspeakers in the array (one to the lower left, one in the center, and one to the lower right). This masking noise was generated by measuring the spectrum of the system's treadmill noise at the location of the listener at three different walking speeds (0.89, 1.12, and 1.32\u2009m/s), inverse filtering these noises to account for the frequency responses of the masking filters, and continuously playing the resulting filtered noises through the three speakers during the course of each trial. This resulted in a background noise level of 62\u201363 dBA SPL in each trial.\n\nExperimental procedures\nAfter reviewing and signing the informed consent document, each of the healthy control participants completed a 2-h audiometric and vestibular screening session before participating in the CAREN portion of the study. During this session, they completed the six test conditions of the SOT and had their left- and right-ear pure-tone audiometric thresholds measured at eight frequencies by an audiologist using a clinical audiometer in a double-walled, sound-treated booth.\nBecause b/TBI participants were recruited into the study during the first week of their 4-week tenure at the NICoE, the SOT and the audiometric thresholds were typically completed as part of their routine clinical examination during their second week. Those who consented and also met the inclusion criteria were then scheduled for CAREN testing during either their third or fourth week.\nEach testing session in the CAREN lasted approximately 2\u2009h. At the start of the session, participants were familiarized with the system, given a safety brief, and fitted with a safety harness. Once they were secured to the platform's safety stand, they were taken through a series of preliminary VEs, starting with balance tasks called the Balance Balls and Balance Cubes\n17\nto familiarize them with weight and step shifting on the CAREN platform. Then they completed the Continuous Road VE (flat walking task) to acclimate to walking on the system's treadmill. The speed of the treadmill was synced to a visualization of a road on the screen and was adjusted until it reached what they considered to be a \u201ccomfortable walking pace.\u201d This speed, which averaged approximately 2.5 miles per hour (see\nTable 1\n), was then recorded and used as the fixed walking pace in all subsequent walking conditions of the experiment. Each participant then completed five training trials of each of the four major tasks in the experiment (AL, VD, AAVS, VOVS) while standing on the platform. Once they were fully acclimated, two blocks of each experimental task were completed, once standing and once walking, in a randomized testing order. The four tasks are described in detail below.\n\nAuditory localization task\nThe AL task measured how quickly and accurately participants were able to find the location of a pulsed noise presented from a single, random speaker location behind the CAREN screen. In this task, head tracking information from the motion capture system was used to project a white cross-hair on the screen directly in front of the participant. Each trial started with the participant facing a fixation point in the center of the screen, and then an auditory stimulus was presented randomly from one of the 64 speaker locations. The auditory stimulus consisted of pink noise, which was pulsed on and off at a 1-Hz rate with a 50% duty cycle. The noise was adjusted to a level of 70 dBA SPL at the location of the listener's head, and it was band-pass filtered to have a bandwidth from 400\u2009Hz to 12.5\u2009kHz and inverse filtered with 128-point finite impulse response (FIR) filters that were designed to reduce the spectral variability of the stimuli across the different speaker locations.\nThe participant was asked to move the head-slaved cross-hair to the perceived location of the sound (as shown in\nFig. 2\n) and then press a button on a hand-held controller (Microsoft XBox Wireless) to indicate their response. They were instructed to do this task as quickly and accurately as possible; localization accuracy and response time were measured in each trial.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nVisual display shown to the participants in the auditory localization task. Color image is available online.\nEach participant completed two 50-trial blocks of the AL task, one block while standing on the platform with the treadmill stationary and one while walking at a comfortable pace. In order to eliminate spurious responses, trials where the reaction time was faster than 0.5\u2009sec or where the angular error was more than 3 standard deviations (SDs) greater than the mean value for that participant in that condition were eliminated from the analysis (this eliminated roughly 0.75% of the total trials).\n\nVisual discrimination task\nThe VD task was a choice reaction time task that measured how quickly and accurately participants were able to identify a visual target presented at a known location on the screen. Participants were instructed that all trials would originate at a fixation point that was directly in the center of the screen, at a distance of approximately 280\u2009cm. Then, at the start of each trial, a visual target with one or three white dots was presented at the fixation point. The screen always had a light blue background, and the orientation of the three-dot cluster was selected randomly for each trial. Each dot was 1.5\u2009cm in diameter, with a 2-cm separation between dots along the edge of the three-dot target stimulus.\nParticipants were instructed to wait until the one- or three-dot target appeared and then to use one of two buttons on a wireless response controller to identify the number of dots in the target stimulus (\nFig. 3\n). They were instructed to do this task as quickly and accurately as possible; response accuracy and reaction time were measured in each trial. Each participant completed two 50-trial blocks in the VD task, one while standing on the platform with the treadmill stationary and one while walking at a comfortable pace. Trials where the reaction time was more than 3 SDs greater than the mean value for that participant in that condition were eliminated from the analysis (this eliminated roughly 1.2% of the total trials).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nVisual discrimination task in the experiment. The left panel shows the visual display shown to the participants. The right panel shows examples of target stimuli, containing an odd number of dots. Color image is available online.\nThe participants generally achieved very high scores on the VD task, with the percent of correct responses ranging from 97.5% to 98.6% across the two participant groups in the two conditions. The incorrect trials were discarded, and only the reaction times of the correct responses were analyzed in the results.\n\nAurally aided visual search task\nThe AAVS task combined the AL and VD tasks, requiring the listener to use an auditory cue to locate a visual target and then respond by indicating whether it contained one or three dots. Each trial of the AAVS task started with the participant facing a fixation point in the center of the screen. Then, a visual target with one or three dots (from the VD task) would be randomly presented with a coincident audio cue (the pulsed noise from the AL task) from one of the 64 possible loudspeaker locations, among a field of 263 other visual distractors. These visual distractors were identical to the target, but contained two or four dots (\nFig. 4\n). As in the VD task, the participant's task was to find the visual target as quickly as possible and use the wireless controller to indicate whether the target contained one or three dots.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 4.\nAurally aided visual search and visual-only visual search tasks in the experiment. The left panel shows the visual display shown to the participants. The right panel shows a zoomed-in view of the target location. Color image is available online.\nEach participant completed two 50-trial blocks in the AAVS task, one with the participant standing and one with the participant walking. Trials with reaction times <0.5\u2009sec or those with reaction times >3 SDs worse than the mean score for an individual participant in an individual condition were eliminated from the analysis (these accounted for 1.1% of all the trials in the experiment).\nResponse accuracy was very high in all conditions, ranging from 98.5% to 99.2% across all the conditions. As in the VD task, trials with incorrect responses were eliminated from further analyses.\n\nVisual-only visual search task\nThe VOVS task was identical to the AAVS task, except that no coincident audio cue was presented at the location of the visual target. Participants were asked to locate the visual target, among a field of visual distractors, and then respond by indicating whether it contained one or three dots. Each participant completed two 20-trial blocks of the VOVS task, one while standing and one while walking.\nThe VOVS task was more challenging than the AAVS task, with mean response times that were roughly an order of magnitude slower. These much slower response times necessitated the implementation of a 120-sec timeout period to prevent trials from becoming too long. Trials where the participants spent more than 120\u2009sec searching for the visual target were terminated without a response and were conservatively assumed to have a 120-second response time in the analysis (these timeouts occurred in around 1.3% of trials in the control group and 5.1% of trials in the b/TBI group).\n\nStatistical analysis\nIn the AL task, accuracy and reaction time were the primary dependent variables. In the VD, AAVS, and VOVS tasks, accuracy was near 100% and reaction time was the primary dependent variable (incorrect responses were eliminated from the response time analysis). In both cases, the within-subject independent variable was treadmill condition (walking vs. standing) and the between-subjects independent variable was participant group (b/TBI vs. healthy control). In all cases, a two-factor mixed-design analysis of variance was used for the statistical analysis.\nIn order to account for possible order effects, the average scores in the first and second blocks in each task were compared to determine whether presentation order had a significant impact on performance. This analysis revealed that order effects had no significant impact on the AL or VD tasks, but that the participants, on average, responded 15% faster in the second block of trials on the AAVS task and 20% faster in the second block of trials on the VOVS task. Data were corrected for these order effects before conducting the mixed-model ANOVA by increasing the reaction time by half the difference in all of the initial blocks and decreasing the reaction time by half the difference in all the final blocks.\nIn cases where significant differences were found between the b/TBI and control groups, step-wise regression was used to determine whether these differences could be explained by the demographic differences observed in the two participant groups."

    "Methods": "Participants\nA total of 56 collegiate athletes, both male and female, participating in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I and recreational contact-collision sports (football, soccer, basketball, rugby, and cheerleading), were enrolled in the study. Concussion was diagnosed in accord with the NCAA criteria.\n22\nTwenty-eight athletes were assessed on day 3 (T1) post-concussion. Twenty-four from that group returned for a second visit on day 21 (T2) post-concussion, with 18 athletes completing the final follow-up visit for day 90 (T3) post-concussion. Twenty-eight age- and sports-matched non-injured controls were included. Controls were required to be at least 1 year out from their most recent concussion. All the athletes were actively engaged in their sport at the time of participation and were healthy and free of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases or any self-reported learning disabilities.\n\nStudy protocol\nAll screening and experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Southern Methodist University (SMU), Dallas, Texas (Protocol #2015-001-PURS) and were in accord with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects were informed of the study objectives and protocol verbally before obtaining their written consent for participation. The study is registered in\nclinicaltrial.gov\nas NCT02754206.\nAll experiments were performed in the Cerebrovascular Research Laboratory in the Department of Applied Physiology & Wellness at SMU. Subjects were asked to abstain from alcohol or caffeinated beverages 24\u2009h before the laboratory visit. Subjects completed a health history questionnaire. Symptoms were evaluated with the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 3rd Edition (SCAT3). Cognition was assessed with the Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC), a component of the SCAT3. Mood was assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and sleep quality was monitored utilizing the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI).\nHeart rate was acquired with a standard three-lead electrocardiogram (ECG; Solar 8000i patient monitor; GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL). Beat-to-beat mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was recorded continuously using finger photoplethysmography (Finometer Pro; Finapres Medical Systems, Amsterdam, Netherlands). Arterial blood pressure was also measured using an automated ambulatory arm cuff (Tango; SunTech Medical, Morrisville, NC). Beat-to-beat mean middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (MCAV) was obtained with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (Doppler BoxX; DWL USA, San Juan Capistrano, CA). A 2-MHz probe was placed bilaterally over the temporal bone to insonate the middle cerebral artery\n16\nAn adjustable silicon headband was used to stabilize the Doppler probe for the duration of the study. End-tidal CO\n2\n(PetCO\n2\n) was continuously obtained from an infrared CO\n2\nanalyzer (Capnocheck Plus; Smith Medical PM Inc, Waukesha, WI) connected to a nasal cannula. Subjects were instructed to breathe in and out only through the nose for the entire duration of the study.\n\nData analysis\nMCAV was measured continuously while subjects were seated upright breathing room air (normocapnia) for 2\u2009min. Through a non-rebreather mask, subjects then inspired a gas mixture of 8% CO\n2\n, 21% O\n2\n, with balanced nitrogen (hypercapnia) for 2\u2009min. Subjects then mildly hyperventilated in order to obtain an end-tidal CO\n2\nof approximately 22\u2009mmHg (hypocapnia) for 2\u2009min. Percent change in MCAV from normocapnia was plotted against PetCO\n2\n, and CVR was estimated from the slope of this relationship and expressed as percent change in MCAV per mmHg change in PetCO\n2\n. Analog signals for ECG, MAP, MCAV, and PetCO\n2\nwere sampled at 500\u2009Hz and subsequently stored on a personal computer using the Windaq data acquisition system (Windaq DI720; DATAQ Instruments, Akron, OH) for offline analyses.\n\nStatistical analysis\nMedians and interquartile ranges were obtained for all continuous measures of clinical and behavioral symptoms and hemodynamic variables. Controls were compared to concussed athletes at three different time points (T1, T2, and, T3) using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. A non-parametric Friedman's test was performed to examine longitudinal changes over time among the concussed athletes. A post-hoc Wilcoxon signed-ranks test was used to compare pairs of time points (T1, T2, and, T3). Significance for the post-hoc Wilcoxon tests was evaluated at\np\n<\u20090.0167 to correct for multiple testing.\nIn a separate post-hoc analysis, subjects were divided into two groups based on median CVR at T1 (low CVR, <1.7024U; high CVR, >1.7024U). A non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test was performed to examine whether low CVR at T1 was correlated with higher headache score (from SCAT3) at T3. IBM SPSS software (Version 25; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) was used for all analyses, and, except where noted, statistical significance was evaluated using\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Synthesis of and characterization of PEG-HCCs\nThe PEG-HCCs were prepared using methods described in the literature.\n8\n,\n15\nAs the study progressed, the need for thorough characterization of each batch was recognized as variation was observed, mostly related to the degree of PEGylation. We have previously reported\n13\nthe characterization details, including infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), UV/vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and zeta potential measurements, but were not employing the complete set for each batch as is now done. Trace metal contaminants as determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were not present. We estimated the number of PEG chains per HCC particle to be 50 so that the PEG made up \u223c80% of the entire mass of the particle including both the particle core and the covalently bound PEG.\n14\n\nTreatment groups\nIn this study, a total of 38 Long Evans rats, weighing 300\u2013350\u2009g, were used. The TBI model used was a cortical impact injury (3\u2009m/sec, 2.5\u2009mm deformation) followed by 50\u2009min of hemorrhagic hypotension. The rats were randomly assigned to receive either PEG-HCC (2\u2009mg/kg,\nn\n=\u200921) or saline as placebo (\nn\n=\u200917). The assigned study drug was given intravenously at the beginning of resuscitation and again 2\u2009h after the first dose. We chose the treatment dose, 2\u2009mg/kg, as an extrapolation for dilution using the average rat blood volume based on the effective concentration\nin vitro\nthat is protective against a variety of toxins, 2\u20138\u2009mg/L.\n12\n,\n18\nThe second administration of particles was given because of the 2\u20133\u2009h half-life of PEG-HCCs in the blood.\n5\nIt is important to note that these are the identical doses used in our prior work that demonstrated sustained restoration of cerebral blood flow and restoration of oxidative balance.\n5\n\nAnesthesia\nGeneral anesthesia was induced using 5% isoflurane in 100% oxygen, by placing the rats in a vented anesthesia chamber for \u223c3\u20135\u2009min. After anesthesia induction, the animals were intubated with a 14 gauge angiocatheter and mechanically ventilated using a volume-controlled ventilator. A surgical plane of anesthesia was maintained throughout the impact injury and period of hypotension with 2% isoflurane.\n\nSurgical preparation\nUsing aseptic techniques, intravascular catheters were placed in the tail artery and femoral vein. The tail artery was dissected through a 2\u20134\u2009mm incision in the proximal segment of the tail and cannulated using a 22 gauge Angiocath\u2122 Teflon catheter to monitor blood pressure. Through a 5\u20138\u2009mm incision in the left groin, the femoral vein was dissected free and cannulated using a 22 gauge Angiocath Teflon catheter to allow for the controlled hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation using Lactated Ringer's solution or the shed blood. The catheters were secured to the skin with nylon sutures. After catheterization, the animals were mounted in a stereotactic frame in the prone position with the head secured by ear bars and an incisor bar. Body temperature was monitored and kept between 36 and 37\u00b0C with a heating pad controlled by a rectal probe. Arterial blood gas values, including pH, pCO\n2\n, and pO\n2\nwere obtained on blood drawn from the tail artery catheter with an IRMA TruPoint blood gas analysis system.\n\nCraniectomy and controlled cortical impact injury\nThe scalp was shaved and cleaned using an iodine-based solution. The surgical field was draped with sterile linens. A medial sagittal skin incision was performed and the scalp (including the periosteum) and the temporalis muscle were reflected. To expose the brain for the impact injury, a 10\u2009mm diameter craniectomy was performed over the right parietal cortex between bregma and lambda using a dental drill. Care was taken to not injure the dural surface. A small amount of saline solution was directed at the site of drilling to prevent thermal injury to the brain tissue. With the impactor rod locked in the extended position, the impactor tip was centered in the craniectomy site perpendicular to the exposed surface of the brain at an angle of \u223c45 degrees to the vertical, and then the tip was lowered until it just touched the dural surface. The impactor rod was then retracted, and the tip advanced an additional distance in order to produce a brain deformation of 2.5\u2009mm at the time of the impact. To induce a non-cavitary level of traumatic injury, the controlled cortical impact device was adjusted to 30\u2009psi giving an impact velocity of \u223c3\u2009m/sec. With the help of a heating lamp aiming at the head of the animal, the brain temperature was kept between 36 and 37\u00b0C using a temperature probe placed into the temporalis muscle. After cortical injury, the skull defect was closed by using an artificial bone flap, composed of dental acrylic, to avoid extrusion of brain tissue.\n\nHemorrhagic shock and phases of resuscitation\nUsing a mechanical standard infusion/withdrawal pump (Harvard Pump Dual RS-232), blood was withdrawn to reduce the mean arterial pressure (MAP) to \u223c40\u2009mm Hg for a period of 50\u2009min. The blood volume required to decrease MAP to such a level was \u223c2\u2009mL/100\u2009g of weight. Half of this volume was withdrawn in the first 5\u2009min, another 25% over the next 5\u2009min, and the final 25% over the next 5\u2009min. This decelerating rate of blood loss mimics the clinical situation of traumatic blood loss. Animals were kept hypotensive for the remaining hypotensive period if necessary by continued intermittent hemorrhage. The shed blood was collected into citrate phosphate dextrose and kept at 4\u00b0C for the duration of the hypotensive and fluid resuscitation period. The shed blood was rewarmed to body temperature (36\u201337\u00b0C) just prior to reinfusion. Following the assigned hypotensive period (50\u2009min), animals were first resuscitated with Lactated Ringer's solution using the infusion pump to maintain a constant infusion rate of 1\u2009mL/min until a MAP of at least 50\u2009mm Hg was obtained. The final resuscitation was accomplished by reinfusion of the shed blood and providing 100% oxygen ventilation after 80\u2009min.\n\nPost-operative management and assessment\nAfter the final resuscitation, anesthesia was discontinued to allow animals to recover. When fully awake, the animals were returned to their cages and allowed free access to food and water. For the first 3 days post-injury, the animals were given buprenorphine 0.1\u2009mg/kg IM q 12\u2009h for analgesia, and enrofloxacin 5\u2009mg/kg IM q d to prevent post-operative infections. Buprenorphine's effects on respiratory depression are relatively minor at this dose and the analgesia regimen was the same in both the treated and placebo groups.\n19\nEach rat was weighed on the day of beam walking pre-training, the day of surgery, days 1\u20135 post-surgery, and days 11\u201315 post-surgery using a digital scale. On days 1\u20135 post-injury, the animals were tested on the beam-walking and beam-balancing tasks. On days 11\u201315 post-injury, the animals were tested on the Morris water maze task. Following the last behavioral assessment, the animals were euthanized and the brains removed for histological examination.\n\nMotor tasks\nBeam walking task\nEach rat was pre-trained 2 days before surgery to walk down a beam 1\u2009m long, 2.5\u2009cm wide, and 1\u2009m above the ground into a darkened goal box to escape white noise of 90\u2009db. At the beginning of each training and test trial, the rat sat in the goal box for 30\u2009sec. During training trials, the rat was placed at successively longer distances from the goal box until it learned to walk down the entire beam. Any distance from which the rat did not walk down the beam into the goal box was repeated until it did. The rat was given a 30\u2009sec rest period in the goal box between trials. After it had traversed the beam in \u22645\u2009sec on three successive trials, four plastic pegs (7.5\u2009cm high) were placed in holes in the beam at \u223c20\u2009cm intervals alternating from side to side, 5\u2009mm in from the edge of the beam. The rat was then trained to another criterion of three consecutive trials completed in \u226410\u2009sec. If both of these criteria were not met by 30 trials, the rat was disqualified. The final criterion for inclusion in the study was beam-walking times on the day of surgery with the pegs present that were \u22645\u2009sec on three consecutive trials within 15 trials. Beam walking with the pegs present was assessed on days 1\u20135 post-injury.\nBeam balancing task\nEach animal was placed lengthwise along the center of a beam 1.5\u2009cm wide, 1\u2009m long, and 1\u2009m above the ground. The rat attempted to balance on the beam for up to 60\u2009sec on each of three trials on the day of surgery and on days 1\u20135 post surgery. The rat was taken off the beam and placed in the goal box for 30\u2009sec between trials.\n\nMorris water maze test\nThe Morris water maze consisted of a 1.5\u2009m diameter galvanized steel pool which contained a 10\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009cm Plexiglas platform 26\u2009cm high and hidden 2\u2009cm below the water. There were four starting positions (north, south, east, west) with a fixed platform. The design of the Morris Water Maze is shown in\nFigure 3B\n. Each rat in each group was given a specific sequence to follow throughout the water maze trials. The maze was filled with water until it was 2\u2009cm above the Plexiglas platform. In each trial, the rat was placed in the water facing the wall in the indicated position. If the rat did not find the platform within 120\u2009sec in any trial, it was placed on the platform for 30\u2009sec. If the rat found the platform within 120\u2009sec, it was allowed to remain on the platform for 30\u2009sec. Four trials were performed with 4\u2009min for rest between trials; the rat was kept warm with a heating lamp between trials. The rat was tracked in the water maze with the Water maze 2020 Video Tracking System. Pre-injury performance was not tested. Instead, maze performance was assessed on each of days 11\u201315 post-injury.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nMorris water maze performance.\n(A)\nMorris water maze results between poly(ethylene)glycol conjugated hydrophilic carbon clusters (PEG-HCC)- and saline- treated subjects. Time to finding the platform is on the Y axis and number of days after injury is on the X axis. Each rat in each group was given a specific sequence to follow throughout the water maze trials. At each trial, the rat was placed in the water and expected to find the platform within 120\u2009sec. Four trials were performed with 4\u2009min of rest between trials. Pre-injury performance was not tested. Maze performance was assessed on each of days 11\u201315 post-injury. Performance on the Morris water maze task was significantly better in the PEG-HCC-treated group in the early testing time period (treatment effect,\np\n=\u20090.010; treatment x day interaction,\np\n<\u20090.001). On average, the rats that received PEG-HCC treatment were able to find the hidden platform 7\u2009sec faster than the saline-treated rats. The time to find the platform was significantly faster on day 1 in the PEG-HCC-treated group.\n(B)\nSchematic of the Morris water maze used in this study.\n\nHistology\nAt 2 weeks after the impact, the animals were deeply anesthetized, and perfused transcardially with 0.9% saline, followed by 10% phosphate-buffered formaldehyde. The entire brain was removed and fixed in 4% formalin. The fixed brains were examined grossly for the presence of contusion, hematoma, and herniation. The brains were photographed, sectioned at 2\u2009mm intervals, and embedded in paraffin, and hematoxylin and eosin stained slides were prepared cut at 5\u2009\u03bcm. Hematoxylin and eosin stained sections were washed with 0.9% saline, followed by 10% phosphate-buffered formaldehyde. The brain sections were photographed using a section scanner (Polaroid Corporation, Waltham, MA) equipped with a PathScan Enabler (Meyer Instruments, Houston, TX). The injury volume was measured by determining the cross-sectional area of injury in each coronal image and multiplying by the thickness of the tissue between the slices. This slab volume technique was implemented on the image-processing program Optimas 5.2 (Optimas Corporation, Seattle, WA). Neurons in the middle 1\u2009mm segments of the cornu ammonis (CA)1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus were counted at a magnification of 200\u2009\u00d7\u2009. Neurons were identified by nuclear and cytoplasmic morphology, and individual cells were counted as either normal or damaged. Neurons with cytoplasmic shrinkage, basophilia, or eosinophilia, or with loss of nuclear detail were regarded as damaged. The regions measured were 1\u2009mm long and 1\u2009mm wide (0.5\u2009mm on either side of the long axis of the segment). The total number of neurons and the number of neurons that seemed normal were expressed as neurons per square millimeter.\n\nStatistical analysis\nPhysiological variables were compared between treatment groups before, during, and after TBI surgery using a\nt\ntest. The behavioral data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance. When there was a significant time by treatment group interaction, a Holm\u2013Sidak test was used to determine which times were different. Histological indices were analyzed using a\nt\ntest. Mortality was compared with a Fisher exact test."

Patients performed up to 20 training sessions (3\u20135\u2009\u00d7\u2009a week) over 4\u20136 weeks. Each training session consisted of 40\u2009min of stepping activities, with focus on maintaining a target cardiovascular training zone that approximated HR ranges observed during conventional physical therapy\n19\n,\n38\n; the high-LT group maintained an HR within 70\u201385% of predicted maximum HR, whereas the low-LT group maintained a target HR 50\u201365% of predicted maximum (maximum determined by the following:\nHR\n=\u2009208\u2013(0.7\u2009\u00d7\u2009Age)).\n39\nMaximum achievable HRs were reduced by a modest 10 beats/min for those who were taking beta-blockade medications,\n19\nand HRs were monitored continuously using pulse-oximetry with forehead sensors. Not all study participants could tolerate 40-min exercise at 70\u201385% of their max-predicted heart rate at the beginning of the training period. In these participants, the total amount of training in each session was increased over the training period and the amount of exercise was documented using accelerometers. In these participants, the tolerance improved substantially throughout the training period and all participants tolerated 40\u2009min before the end of the training period. As a secondary measure of intensity, we used the Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale (6\u201320),\n40\nif participants could not achieve the target HR zone during training. The target rating for the high-LT group was 15\u201317 (\u201chard to \u201cvery hard\u201d) and was 11\u201313 (below \u201csomewhat hard\u201d) for the low-LT group. Measures of HR and RPE were evaluated every 5\u2009min of training. During training sessions, both groups performed four different stepping tasks: speed-dependent treadmill training, skill-dependent treadmill training, over-ground training, and stair climbing.\nBefore and after the training sessions, we assessed sympathetic function (HR and blood pressure) and somatomotor function (stretch reflexes from patellar tendon taps; voluntary strength from maximum voluntary contractions) before, during, and after stimuli that trigger sympathetic reflexes. Specific stressors included a cold stimulus (foot in ice bath for 3\u2009min), noxious electrical stimulation at the stomach (10 stimuli/s for 10\u2009sec over 3\u2009min), and a cognitive mathematical task (counting backward from a random number by 13). Subjects completed this SS experimental session \u223c1 week before the start of training and then again \u223c1 week after the end of training (\nFig. 1A\n).\nFigure 1B\nillustrates the experimental timeline during the SS tests. The sympathetic stimulus (stressor) for each trial was applied during the first 3\u2009min of the trial. After 3\u2009min, the stimulus was removed, and we continued measurements for an additional 3\u2009min (recovery). The procedures for the trials are described below.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\n(\nA\n) Experimental timeline. Subjects underwent a pre-training sympathetic-somatomotor (SS) testing session before training and then repeated the post-training SS testing session. The prescribed training comprised 20 sessions, with frequency (3\u20135\u2009\u00d7\u2009per week) and duration (4\u20136 weeks) dependent on scheduling. (\nB\n) SS tests experimental timeline. Measurements were recorded during a baseline condition when subjects were relaxed, during 3\u2009min while we applied a known sympathetic stressor, and during a recovery period when the sympathetic stressor was removed. (\nC\n) Experimental setup for SS tests. The approximate knee joint center was aligned to a load cell. A motorized reflex hammer was aligned with the patellar tendon.\n\nTest procedures and outcomes\nBaseline measurements\nAt the start of the SS session, we recorded baseline measurements for blood pressure, HR, and patellar tendon reflex responses (torque and electromyogram [EMG]) while subjects were relaxed. We then measured baseline strength from maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) of the right knee extensors. Participants repeated the MVCs up to five trials during the baseline portion of the test.\nExperimental Measurements\nWe performed six trials to test the coupling between sympathetic reflexes and somatomotor function. For three trials, we elicited patellar tendon reflexes during the sympathetic stressors. We applied five consecutive patellar tendon perturbations (20-ms pulse duration, 1 pulse per second) 20\u2009sec after the application of the stressor, and we repeated these at 1-min intervals (six bouts of five consecutive tendon perturbations). For the other three trials, we repeated each sympathetic stressor while subjects performed MVCs of the right knee extensors. Participants performed one MVC per minute over the 6-min trial. Subjects held the contraction for 5\u2009sec and were verbally encouraged during the contraction.\nSympathetic stressors\nWe used two methods to elicit spinal sympathetic responses below the level of injury: 1) cold stimulation and 2) noxious electrical stimulation. The cold stimulation was used because it has limited direct impact on motor systems. Electrical stimulation was used over other nociceptive testing methods (e.g., pinprick) in order to accurately control the amplitude with repeated applications. A cognitive stressor was also used because it invokes descending sympathetic drive with little direct impact on motor systems. For each stressor, the stimuli were applied for 3\u2009min, followed by 3\u2009min of recovery. This provided a reliable sympathetic stimulus and produced no autonomic dysreflexia. Detailed methods for each stressor are provided below.\nCold stressor\nThe left foot was submerged up to the malleolus in a bucket of ice water (\u223c2\u20133\u00b0C) for 3\u2009min. After 3\u2009min, the foot was removed and we briefly measured the foot's skin temperature using an infrared thermometer to ensure each subject's foot was cooled to the same temperature. The foot was then submerged into a warm (\u223c27\u00b0C) water bath for an additional 3\u2009min.\nNoxious pain stressor\nPain was induced using electrical stimulation (100 pulses per second, 20-ms train duration, 1-ms pulse width) to 1\u20132\u2009cm rostral to the navel using two 40-mm diameter electrodes (Blue Sensor; Medicotest Corporation, Rolling Meadows, IL) and a constant current stimulator (Digitimer North America, LLC, Ft. Lauderdale, FL). The stimulus location was placed at midline of the trunk and not at either limb or side of the body to minimize excitation of specific spinal reflex pathways (e.g., flexor withdrawal or crossed extensor reflex) that may directly interfere with motor output. During the first 3\u2009min of the trial, the electrical stimulation was applied each second for 15\u2009sec with 60\u2009sec between bouts of stimulation. The stimulation output was based on each subject's pain rating using a numerical rating scale (0 is no pain, 10 is worst pain imaginable). When determining the stimulation voltage, we incrementally adjusted the voltage until the subject consistently responded to a 6 on the scale. We did this to ensure that subjects received a similar sensation of pain, which may be different between subjects due to differences in injury severity.\nCognitive stressor\nParticipants counted aloud backward by 13 beginning from a random three-digit number provided by the experimenter. Participants were encouraged to do their best to subtract as accurately as possible. Backward counting lasted 3\u2009min, followed by 3\u2009min of relaxation.\n\nExperimental arrangement\nFigure 1C\nillustrates the experimental setup used during the SS tests. Participants were seated in a slightly reclined position in a Biodex System 4 Pro chair (Biodex, Shirley, NY) with their knees \u223c90 degrees flexed and a strap to secure the right thigh to the seat. The right shank was secured to the Biodex System's dynamometer using an attachment and padded strap and the left leg rested freely on the chair. Participants rested their arms on armrests approximately mid-chest level.\nWe used a custom-built motorized reflex hammer to deliver controlled patellar tendon perturbations (\nFig. 1C\n). The motorized reflex hammer consisted of a LinMot linear motor powered by a LinMot amplifier and was controlled using LinMot Talk software (LinMot Inc., Delavan, WI). A small force transducer (Kistler, Amherst, NY) was screwed onto the end of the motor shaft. We measured the tendon perturbation force to ensure that consistent perturbations were applied to the tendon. A rubber tip (\u223c10\u2009cm diameter), attached at the end of the force transducer, was placed 5.0\u2009cm away from the tendon and aligned perpendicular (\u223c90 degrees) to the tibia to deliver patellar tendon taps with consistent force.\nMuscle activity was measured from the rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL), medial gastrocnemius, and the tibialis anterior of the right leg (Delsys Inc., Boston, MA). The electrode was placed on the belly of the respective muscle. Before placing the electrodes, the skin was slightly abraded and cleaned with an alcohol swab. EMG signals were pre-amplified (\u2009\u00d7\u20091000\u201310,000), band-pass filtered (10\u2013500\u2009Hz), and sampled at 1\u2009kHz using a data acquisition card (National Instruments Corp., Austin, TX) and PC.\nKnee torque was measured from a load cell (ATI Industrial Automation, Apex, NC) attached to the Biodex motor (\nFig. 1C\n). The approximate knee joint center was aligned with the center of a load cell. Torque signals were sampled at 1\u2009kHz using a data acquisition card (National Instruments) and low-pass filtered (500-Hz analog filter) before acquisition.\nTo monitor changes in sympathetic activity, we continuously measured blood pressure and HR using the Finometer PRO (Finapres Medical Systems, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Finger arterial pressure waveforms were continuously recorded from the middle finger of the left hand. The blood pressure recordings were corrected to account for the height difference between the hand and the heart. HR was monitored using a three-lead ECG. Blood pressure and HR signals were recorded with the same data acquisition card used to record EMG, and torque signals and were measured continuously throughout each trial.\n\nData analysis\nAll data were analyzed using custom-written Matlab programs (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA). The data were first normalized to the value recorded at baseline and then divided into 1-min bins for each trial (i.e., cold, pain, and cognitive). For each of the dependent variables described below, we calculated as the percent change from pre-training to post-training (%\u0394\u2009=\u2009100\u2009\u00d7\u2009(post-training \u2013 pre-training) / pre-training). In the Results, a positive %\u0394 indicates the dependent variable increased from pre-training to post-training and vice versa for a negative %\u0394.\nWe used the peak-to-peak (P-P) reflex amplitude to quantify the reflex response from each patellar tendon tap. The P-P reflex amplitude is the difference in volts between the positive and negative peak. We used both the torque and EMG (both VL and RF) signals to calculate the P-P reflex torque and the P-P EMG reflex. Before calculating the P-P reflexes, the torque signal was low-pass filtered at 20\u2009Hz (second-order Butterworth, bidirectionally) to remove noise, and EMG signals were notched filtered (second-order Butterworth, 59\u201361\u2009Hz, bidirectionally) and detrended. An event detection algorithm was then used to identify the reflex response from each tendon tap, and these were visually inspected to verify a reflex was elicited. Reflexes were differentiated from background noise by their triphasic shape and the latency from the tap (\u223c20\u2009ms). The P-P reflex amplitudes were then averaged across the five tendon taps for each 1-min interval.\nThe MVC torque signal was first low-pass filtered (5\u2009Hz, second-order Butterworth filter, bidirectionally). The peak torque was then identified and the MVC was calculated as the median of the torque signal \u2212500 to +500.\nHR signals were low-pass filtered at 30\u2009Hz (second-order Butterworth, bidirectionally) and the blood pressure signal was low-pass filtered at 10\u2009Hz (second-order Butterworth, bidirectionally). An event detection algorithm was used to identify systolic and diastolic deflections. The mean arterial pressure (MAP;\u2009=\u2009\u2154 diastolic + \u2153 systolic blood pressures) and HR were averaged within a 10-sec window during each 1-min interval for each trial. In this study, we are presenting the MAP and HR during the trials with patellar tendon taps.\n\nStatistical analysis\nA mixed, repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine differences between training type (main factor: high-LT vs. low-LT) and time (repeated factor: third minute of the stressor vs. third minute of the recovery) on the primary dependent variables: %\u0394P-P EMG reflex, %\u0394P-P reflex torque, and %\u0394HR and %\u0394MAP. Statistical tests were performed independently for each stressor condition (e.g., cold stressor during patellar tendon taps, cold stressor during MVCs, etc). As secondary measures, we also performed statistical tests to determine whether training type affected RPE, HR, baseline MVCs, and stimulation amplitude (for the pain sympathetic stressor only). For each of these dependent measures, a mixed, repeated-measures ANOVA was used to test differences between training type (main factor: high-LT vs. low-LT) and time (repeated factor: pre- vs. post-training). The Greenhouse-Geisser correction factor was used when Mauchly's test of sphericity was violated. We tested our data for normality using Shapiro-Wilks' test, and we visually inspected normality using Q-Q plots. Each dependent variable approximated a normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilks,\np\n>\u20090.05 for all dependent variables). All statistics were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics software (version 21.0; IBM Corp, New York, NY). The \u03b1 level was set at 0.05. Data are reported as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation in the text and means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error in figures. Only the significant main effects are presented, unless otherwise noted."

    "Methods": "Athletes from the most competitive level of college football (National Collegiate Athletic Association [NCAA] Division I Power 5) were recruited to participate in this study. The Director of Sports Medicine, Head Football Athletic Trainer, or equivalent position at each school within this subdivision was contacted regarding possible participation in the study. Of the 65 teams contacted, four teams agreed to participate.\n\nAfter the team representative agreed to allow athlete participation, a date and time for an on-site research visit was coordinated. During this visit to the participating institution, one author (C.M.B.) provided athletes with a description of the study and invited them to ask questions. This typically occurred in a group setting following a team meeting or off-season training session. Interested athletes then provided informed consent and filled out the questionnaire. Questionnaires were administered to athletes on their home campuses, using paper and pen, and took approximately 15\u2009min to complete. Surveys were administered between February and May 2017. Athletes were provided with a $10 Amazon gift card as a thank you for participating. The research protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The study was funded by the Football Players' Health Study at Harvard.\n\nMeasures\nDemographics\nParticipants indicated their race, ethnicity, year in school, and highest level of maternal and paternal educational attainment.\nAthletic information\nAthletes indicated their primary playing position (e.g., offensive lineman, running back), total years of participation in full-contact football, and whether they received an athletic scholarship from their school (none, partial, or full).\nInjury history and injury reporting\nAthletes were asked to write in their answer to the question: \u201cDuring your entire football career, how many times did you think you had a concussion?\u201d Then they were asked to write in their answer to the following: \u201cOf all the times you thought you had a concussion, how many times did you tell a medical professional (doctor, athletic trainer)?\u201d They were also asked the same questions about non-concussion injuries. Ranges, when given, were converted to their mid-points and then rounded down to the nearest integer for use in the model fitting (e.g., the integer 7 would be used if an athlete provided the range 5\u201310).\nCognitive reflection\nA three-item cognitive reflection test, previously validated in a general college population, was scored 0, 1, 2, or 3, based on the number of questions answered correctly.\n34\nQuestions were relatively simple math-based word problems with an answer that seems intuitive (but is incorrect), thus requiring the participant to engage in reasoned, deliberative decision making to answer correctly.\nSubjective norms\nAbout coaches, teammates, parents, and students at their school, athletes were asked to rate their agreement with the following statement, \u201c[Referent] thinks I should report an injury\u201d on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from Strongly Disagree (1) to Strongly Agree (7).\n\nStatistical analysis\nA coder hand-entered data from pen and paper questionnaires into a database. A second coder checked a random 10% of the questionnaires for data entry errors. Intercoder discrepancy was <0.1%. Athletes were not required to answer all questions; complete case analysis was used to handle missing data (approximately 1%).\nTo test whether an athlete's likelihood of reporting a concussion varies over the sequence of concussions sustained, we compared a binomial model (with a constant reporting probability) to a generalization of the binomial that allows the reporting probability to vary across the sequence of suspected injuries. For an athlete's number of suspected concussions\nn\nand reported concussions\n, the binomial likelihood contribution for an individual is a function of the constant reporting probability\np\n(\nEquation 1\n):\nIn the generalization of the binomial model, the reporting probability depends on the order of the concussion in the sequence. Thus, the likelihood is a function of a set of probabilities\n(\nEquation 2\n):\nwhere\nis the set of permutations of reported and non-reported concussions that produce\nk\ntotal reported concussions.\nFor example, for\ntotal concussions, there are three ways to yield\nreported concussions: The first two are reported (and not the third), the second and third are reported (and not the first), or the first and third are reported (and not the second). Then\nand the likelihood is\n.\nWe estimated the parameters\nby maximizing this likelihood over all the observed counts of reported concussions among suspected concussions. Although we did not observe any individual's sequence of reports of individual concussions, we had data on people with 0 or 1 reported out of 1; 0, 1, or 2 reported out of 2; etc. Thus, we could estimate the reporting probability parameters.\nWe repeated the above analysis for reporting of non-concussion injuries. We limited the analysis to individuals with no more than five suspected concussions or 10 suspected non-concussion injuries to avoid problems with data sparsity at higher injury and concussion counts. We used likelihood ratio tests to assess whether the full model (2) fit the data sufficiently better than the single-parameter model (1) to justify the additional parameters.\nTo evaluate whether cognitive reflection was significantly associated with concussion reporting, we used zero-inflated Poisson regression. Our outcome of interest (number of reported concussions) is a count, but it is more meaningfully thought of as a rate (number of reported concussions divided by the number of suspected concussions); thus, we used number of suspected concussions as an offset. Because we used zero-inflated models to account for the distribution of the data and not because we suspected a separate mechanism to account for the zero values, an intercept-only model was used for the zero-inflation component of the regression.\nWe built seven regression models. The full model included all measured variables that have been found to be associated with concussion reporting in the literature plus the athletes' scores from the cognitive reflection test. Model variables were standardized for ease of interpretation. The variables could be grouped into psychosocial factors, demographic characteristics, and traumatic brain injury exposure modifiers (\nTable 1\n). The remaining models represented all permutations of these three predictor categories. After the models were fit, 5-fold cross validation was performed, and the final model was selected based on having the lowest average cross-validated error. One advantage of cross-validation is that it helps guard against overfitting.\n35\nThe same procedure was followed for non-concussion injuries.\nTable 1.\nConceptual Categories of Model Variables\nCategory\nSpecific variables\nPsychosocial factors\nSubjective reporting norms (coach, teammates, parents, students)\nDemographic characteristics\nHighest level of parental educational attainment (mother, father); race/ethnicity; scholarship status\nExposure modifiers\nPrimary playing position (line vs. skill); year on team; total years of full-contact football; total career concussions (used in injury model only); total career non-concussion injuries (used in concussion model only)\nOpen in a separate window"

    "Methods": "Participants and recruitment\nYouth ages eight to 15 years injured in vehicular accidents and treated in the Emergency Department or Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Center at Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital/University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston for either a TBI or EI were screened for enrollment. Children with EI were included to account for possible pre-injury characteristics, such as risk-taking behavior, that may influence outcomes, to examine the stresses of injury and hospitalization, and to allow comparison of the effects of brain injury above and beyond that of body injury. Children with EI were excluded if they had evidence of blunt head trauma or concussion symptoms. A healthy typically developing comparison group (TDC) was recruited from the community to allow assessment of possible differences on neuroimaging between the injury groups and healthy youth.\nAll participants in the current study met the following inclusion criteria: (1) proficiency in English or Spanish, (2) residence within a 125 mile catchment radius, (3) no previous history of major neuropsychiatric disorder (intellectual deficiency or low functioning autism spectrum disorder) that would complicate assessment of the impact of injury on behavioral outcomes, (4) no metabolic disorders, (5) no previous medically attended TBI, and (6) usable neuroimaging data. Criteria 3\u20135 were assessed during screening using a brief parent interview.\nOf 277 children meeting study inclusion criteria, 150 were enrolled and completed baseline procedures. Of these children, 117 had a usable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and 33 had unusable scans (\nn\n=\u200919 motion artifact,\nn\n=\u20098 scanner equipment failure,\nn\n=\u20093 data did not meet quality control,\nn\n=\u20092 scan artifact;\nn\n=\u20091 withdrew from study). The final sample consisted of 117 participants (TBI,\nn\n=\u200953, EI,\nn\n=\u200926, TDC,\nn\n=\u200938). Informed written consent was obtained from each child's guardian according to Institutional Review Board guidelines; written assent was obtained from all participants.\n\nInjury characteristics\nDemographic characteristics of the TBI, EI, and TDC groups and injury variables for the TBI and EI groups are provided in\nTable 1\n. The external cause of injury in a vehicle accident was selected to meet the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\n7\n(\nDSM-V\n) criterion A for a PTSD diagnosis that specifies exposure to a potentially life-threatening situation. For TBI participants, severity of brain injury was rated using the lowest post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score at admission, which evaluates eye opening, motor, and verbal responses to stimulation.\n46\nMild, moderate, and severe TBI were indicated by total GCS scores of 13\u201315, 9\u201312, and 3\u20138, respectively.\nTable 1.\nDemographic, Injury, and Psychological Health Information for Traumatic Brain Injury, Extracranial Injury, and Healthy Comparison Groups\nGroup\nTraumatic brain injury (\nn\n=\u200953)\nExtracranial injury (\nn\n=\u200926)\nHealthy comparison (\nn\n=\u200938)\nStatistic (df) (\np\n)\nDemographic variables\nAge M (SD)\n12.4 (2.2)\n11.8 (2.4)\n12.3 (2.3)\nF (2, 114)\u2009=\u20090.749 (0.475)\nAge Range (years)\n8.1 \u2013 15.9\n8.6 \u2013 16.2\n8.1 \u2013 16\nSex % Male\n60\n69\n61\nX\n2\n(2, N\u2009=\u2009117)\u2009=\u20090.666 (0.717)\nRace (n)\nX\n2\n(4, N\u2009=\u2009117)\u2009=\u20093.90 (0.419)\nCaucasian\n37\n22\n26\nAfrican American\n14\n4\n9\nOther/Multiracial\n2\n0\n3\nEthnicity (n)\nHispanic\n25\n15\n24\nX\n2\n(2, N\u2009=\u2009117)\u2009=\u20092.40 (0.301)\nMaternal education (n)\nX\n2\n(4, N\u2009=\u2009117)\u2009=\u20098.35 (0.080)\n< High school\n24\n15\n9\n< College\n26\n10\n27\nGraduate degree\n3\n1\n2\nInjury variables\nAge at injury to testing interval (d) \u2013M (SD)\n47.83 (16.36)\n50.62 (10.87)\n\u2014\nt(77)\u2009=\u20090.786 (0.434)\nAge at injury to scan interval (d) \u2013 M (SD)\n51.06 (21.42)\n57.04 (23.23)\n\u2014\nt(77)\u2009=\u20091.134 (0.260)\nInjury Severity Score (ISS) M (SD)\n12.62 (7.99)\n11.12 (6.30)\nt(77)\u2009=\u2009\u2212.842 (0.403)\nModified ISS M (SD)\n3.58 (4.38)\n10.73 (6.39)\nt(77)\u2009=\u20095.83 (0.000)\nTreatment intensity (n)\nX\n2\n(2, N\u2009=\u200979)\u2009=\u200918.74 (0.000)\nReleased from ED\n14\n9\nAdmitted to hospital\n8\n14\nAdmitted to PICU\n31\n3\nLength of stay (d) M (SD)\n4.08 (3.39)\n4.59 (4.45)\nt(54)\u2009=\u20090.471 (0.639)\nSurgery n (%)\n8\n12\nX\n2\n(1, N\u2009=\u200984)\u2009=\u20096.05 (.014)\nGlasgow Coma Score (n)\n3\u20138\n12\n\u2013\n9\u201312\n5\n\u2013\n13\u201315\n36\n\u2013\nPsychological variables\nPre-injury or enrollment\nPreinjury diagnoses (n)\nADHD\n10\n3\n2\nAnxiety\n0\n1\n0\nDepression\n0\n1\n0\nPsychosocial Adversity Index M (SD)\n1.36 (1.09)\n1.31 (1.12)\n1.39 (1.30)\nX\n2\n(2)\u2009=\u20090.067 (0.967)\nChild Behavior Checklist (T score) M (SD)\nInternalizing\n51.06 (12.16)\n52.96 (12.98)\n49.13 (10.60)\nF (2, 114)\u2009=\u20090.818 (0.444)\nExternalzing\n49.53 (11.80)\n54.92 (12.42)\n45.95 (9.86)\nF (2, 114)\u2009=\u20094.823 (0.010)\n7 week follow-Up\nPubertal Development Scale M (SD)\n2.44 (.935)\n2.25 (1.07)\n2.49 (.888)\nF (2, 114)\u2009=\u20090.542 (0.583)\nChild PTSD Symptom Scale M (SD)\n10.04 (9.27)\n10.46 (7.07)\n\u2014\nX\n2\n(1)\u2009=\u20090.537 (0.464)\nOpen in a separate window\nSD. standard deviation; ED, emergency department; PICU, pediatric intensive care unit; ADHD, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; PTSD. Post-traumatic stress disorder.\nThe GCS scores were abstracted from the medical record by trained assistants. Severity of bodily injury was based on the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS), which classifies injury to specified anatomical regions on a scale from 1 to 6 (minor to life-threatening). The AIS scores were obtained from the hospital trauma registry. In children with mild or moderate TBI, skeletal or body AIS scores were limited to \u22642 to minimize any confounding influence of severe extracranial injury on accurate assessment of GCS scores. We calculated the Injury Severity Score (ISS), which incorporates the highest AIS scores from three anatomical regions and ranges from 0 to 75.\n47\nFor TBI participants, the modified ISS score excluding injuries to the head was also used.\n48\n\nStudy procedures\nParents completed questionnaires and interviews at baseline to describe the child's psychosocial and behavioral functioning just prior to enrollment in the study, which is standard procedure in pediatric injury studies.\n49\nEstimates of PTSS and pubertal status, as well as neuroimaging studies, were obtained at the seven-week follow-up.\n\nPre-injury questionnaire and interview\nChild Behavior Checklist (CBCL)\n50\nThe internalizing and externalizing T-scores normed for age and sex were examined to characterize pre-injury behavioral problems.\nPre-injury problems\nParents indicated whether the child had a diagnosis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, or depression before injury or study enrollment.\nPsychosocial adversity\nExposure to adversity was assessed by trained interviewers based on six categories defined by Biederman and colleagues.\n51\nThe following common indicators were assessed: 1() severe marital discord defined as divorce or separation, (2) low social status defined as levels IV or V on the Hollingshead Index; (3) large family size, defined as three or more children living in the child's primary home; (4) history of investigation by protective service agency regarding this child; (5) parental criminal conviction; and (6) treatment of parental mental health problems. Items were scored yes/no and summed to yield a total score.\n\nSeven-week follow-up questionnaires\nPubertal status\nChildren and parent independently rated changes associated with puberty, including growth in height, body hair, and skin changes using the Petersen Pubertal Development Scale (PDS).\n52\nSex-specific changes included breast development and menstruation for females and deepening of voice and facial hair for males. Each item was then coded on a 5-point scale similar to Tanner staging\n53\n; ratings were averaged to yield a score ranging from 1 (pre-pubertal) to 5 (post-pubertal). The scale has favorable internal consistency:\n\u03b1\n=\u20090.77. If ratings of parents and children differed by more than 1 point, they were asked to discuss and come to consensus; the consensus rating was used in analyses.\nPost-traumatic stress symptoms\nConsistent with the National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria framework,\n54\nwe measured PTSS dimensionally using a validated self-report scale. This approach allows a focus on the spectrum of symptoms that impact children who experience trauma and subsequent impairment. We administered the Child PTSD Symptom Scale\n55\n(CPSS), a validated self-report scale yielding a total PTSS score created from summing 17 items rated on a 4-point scale (range 0\u201351). Based on factor analysis and the four factor model of PTSD, we divided items into re-experiencing, active avoidance, emotional numbing, and hyperarousal factors.\n56\nAn impairment rating assessed impact on daily activities. Children with TBI and EI completed the CPSS. A score \u226511 suggests high PTSS. The total score has high internal consistency,\n\u03b1\n=\u20090.89, and test-retest reliability,\nr\n=\u20090.84.\nPsychological health interview:\nParents completed a structured interview regarding their child's current\nDSM-V\nPTSD symptoms.\n\nImage acquisition and processing\nScans were acquired on a Philips 3T MR scanner with a 32-channel head coil at the University of Texas McGovern Medical School. Diffusion-weighted data collection was completed using an echo planar imaging sequence (TR\u2009=\u20098700\u2009ms; TE\u2009=\u200967\u2009ms; 65 slices total; square FOV\u2009=\u2009240\u2009mm\n2\n; slice thickness\u2009=\u20092.5\u2009mm; 32 diffusion-weighted volumes with b\u2009=\u20091,000\u2009s/mm\n2\nand 1 volume with b\u2009=\u20090) lasting 6:11 minutes. High resolution T1-weighted anatomical scans were collected (TR\u2009=\u20098.1, TE\u2009=\u20093.7, flip angle\u2009=\u20096\u00b0, matrix\u2009=\u2009256 X 256, slice thickness\u2009=\u20091mm, and voxel size\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091); the scan duration was 4:47 minutes. The scanning facility replaced the scanner with a Philips 3T Ingenia toward the end of data collection and scans for 48 of our participants were collected after the upgrade; scanner change was accounted for in all analyses. Fidelity analysis was performed to match diffusion-weighted and T1-weighted scanning protocols.\nSeed and target regions for DTI tractography were generated on a single subject basis to reflect the morphology of each individual. An automated image analysis suite, FreeSurfer 5.3.0 (\nhttp://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu\n), was used for parcellation of cortical and subcortical structures.\n57\nFollowing standard processing procedures in Freesurfer, all data were visually inspected and edited to correct pial surfaces, white/gray matter boundaries, and accuracy of subcortical segmentation. Any error in parcellation resulting from lesions was corrected during manual editing.\nFollowing manual correction, data were re-processed in Freesurfer. Quality of parcellation results was then reviewed and registered to the corresponding diffusion-weighted images for each subject using FSL's Linear Image Registration Tool (FSL: FLIRT). This process resulted in the creation of the seed regions for DTI analysis, restricted to each individual's anatomy, corresponding to all of the regions listed in\nTable 2\n. The same process was used to generate exclusion masks used in DTI analysis corresponding to ventricular regions.\nTable 2.\nSpearman Partial Correlation Coefficients of Regional Diffusion Tensor Tractography Microstructure with Injury Severity for Traumatic Brain and Extracranial Injury Groups\nTraumatic brain injury (n\u2009=\u200953)\nDiffusion tensor tractography metrics\nAdmission GCS Score df (49)\nModified Injury Severity Score df (49)\nExtracranial injury (n\u2009=\u200926) Modified Injury Severity Score df (22)\nPathway fractional anisotropy\nr (p)\nr (p)\nr (p)\nOrigin\nTermination\nLeft hemisphere\nAmygdala\noPFC\n0.108 (0.450)\n\u22120.162 (0.257)\n\u22120.006 (0.978)\nrACB\n0.464 (0.001)\n0.001 (0.996)\n0.168 (0.433)\nHippocampus\nAmygdala\n0.155 (0.277)\n\u22120.169 (0.236)\n\u22120.033 (0.113)\noPFC\n0.208 (0.144)\n0.103 (0.470)\n0.263 (0.214)\nRight hemisphere\nAmygdala\noPFC\n0.294 (0.036)\n0.156 (0.275)\n\u22120.041 (0.850)\nrACB\n0.102 (0.477)\n0.012 (0.931)\n0.081 (0.706)\nHippocampus\nAmygdala\n\u22120.113 (.430)\n0.131 (0.358)\n\u22120.018 (0.933)\noPFC\n0.348 (0.012)\n\u22120.141 (0.325)\n0.520 (0.009)\nGray matter mean diffusivity\nLeft hemisphere\nAmygdala\n\u22120.362 (0.009)\n0.038 (0.793)\n0.133 (0.534)\nHippocampus\n\u22120.278 (0.048)\n0.223 (0.116)\n0.156 (0.468)\nhight Hemisphere\nAmygdala\n\u22120.235 (0.097)\n0.227 (0.109)\n\u22120.100 (0.642)\nHippocampus\n\u22120.425 (0.002)\n0.132 (0.357)\n0.181 (0.397)\nOpen in a separate window\nGCS, Glasgow Coma Scale; oPFC, orbital prefrontal cortex; rACB, rostral anterior cingulate bundle.\nNote: Age at scan and scanner upgrade partialled.\nProcessing of DTI data was performed using the standard DTI pipeline in the FMRIB Software Library (FSL) 5.0.1 (\nhttp://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl\n). Eddy Correct was used to reduce eddy current distortions and head movement.\n58\nSkull-stripping of non-brain tissue was performed using BET (Brain Extraction Tool)\n59\nand brain-extracted images were inspected and corrected to ensure their accuracy. DTIFIT was then used to calculate FA and MD at each brain voxel, and in preparation for tractography, Bayesian Estimation of Diffusion Parameters Obtained using Sampling Techniques (BedpostX) was then applied.\nA probabilistic tractography algorithm (FSL: probtrack\u2009\u00d7\u20092) was utilized for seed-to-target fiber tracking in diffusion space from each seed region individually. For each voxel in a seed mask, 5000 samples were drawn from the probability distribution of the principal fiber direction, proceeding every 0.5\u2009mm. Tracking was stopped if the streamline reached a target mask or any of the exclusion masks; in the latter case, the path was discarded. Pathway distribution maps were then normalized to account for the numbers of voxels in the seed masks by dividing the total number of streamline samples initiated from a seed region by the \u201cwaytotal,\u201d the total number of streamlines that reach the target mask.\nTo restrict each tract to only white matter, pathway distribution maps were thresholded to include those voxels with FA >0.2. Seed-to-target combinations were: (1) amygdala to ipsilateral oPFC, (2) amygdala to ipsilateral rostral anterior cingulum bundle (rACB), (3) hippocampus to ipsilateral amygdala, and (4) hippocampus to ipsilateral oPFC. The MD of bilateral amygdalae and hippocampi was also obtained. Amygdala to oPFC pathways largely overlap with white matter tracts of the uncinate fascicles.\n\nStatistical approach\nAfter examination of variable distributions, comparability of demographic and psychosocial variables for the TBI, EI, and healthy groups was examined using analysis of variance or chi square. Psychosocial variables were examined to determine whether the three groups had comparable life adversity as well as internalizing and externalizing behavior problems before study enrollment. Bivariate relations of age, sex, and pubertal development with the tractography metrics were examined to assess whether the demographic variables should be considered as covariates.\nTo account for possible differences related to scanner upgrading, we included scanner upgrade as a covariate in all analyses using tractography data. To assess group differences, general linear models examined effects of group, age (continuous), and their interactions on tractography values. Orthogonal planned comparisons examined the relation of (1) both injury groups versus the healthy group and (2) the TBI versus the EI group with FA from each pathway and MD from the amygdala and hippocampus. Non-significant interactions of age by the group contrasts were trimmed from each model. Effect sizes were calculated using Hedges\ng\nfor group comparisons with\np\n<\u20090.1.\nTo address the exploratory second aim, Spearman partial correlation coefficients controlling for age and scanner upgrade examined the relation of the tractography pathway FA and gray matter MD with injury variables. We then examined whether the relation of pathway with CPSS factor scores was similar across TBI and EI groups. To assess whether hippocampal microstructure differed, generalized linear models with a negative binomial distribution and log link function examined the effects of group (TBI, EI), FA of pathways seeded in the hippocampus or hippocampal MD, and their interaction on CPSS scores controlling for age and scanner upgrade. Non-significant group by pathway interactions were trimmed. Finally, generalized linear models were fitted to examine the relation of region microstructure and age to the CPSS scores for all injured participants irrespective of injury group."

Meninges were carefully removed, the spinal cords were cut into small pieces and dissociated with 0.05% trypsin/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) for 15\u201320\u2009min at 37\u00b0C and gently triturated. After adhering at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min to eliminate glial cells and fibroblasts, neurons were plated on poly-L-lysine pre-coated 48-well plates (Corning, Tewksbury, MA).\nNeurons were incubated in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO\n2\nat 37\u00b0C with Delbecco Modified Eagle Medium +10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum +5% heat-inactivated horse serum +2\u2009mM glutamine. After 16\u2009h, the medium was replaced with Neurobasal medium with 2% B27, 1% N2 and 2\u2009mM glutamine (all from Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY). On day 3\nin vitro,\n5\u2009\u03bcM cytosine-\u03b2-D-arabinofuranoside (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was added for 24\u2009h to inhibit glia cell proliferation.\nCells in 48-well plates were cultured with 200\u2009\u03bcL medium until experimentation. With this culture protocol, a purity of greater than 87% spinal cord neuron population was obtained by seven days\nin vitro\n(DIV). All experiments were performed between seven and 10 DIV.\nIn vitro\ntraumatic neural injury model\nPrimary spinal neurons were cultured as described. At the time of experimentation, cells were given either a fresh medium change (control) or were mechanically damaged by a monolayer scratch injury model modified from previous studies.\n21\nIn summary, an 18-gauge surgical needle was flattened to increase the surface area of damage, and distinct grid patterns of scratches were performed in either 48-well or six-well culture plates containing 7-10 DIV mixed spinal neuron culture (\nFig. S1\n).\nIn 48-well plates, used for supernatant collection for cell death assessment, immunolabeling, and imaging, four vertical and three horizontal scratch lines (space 3\u2009mm apart) were made to the neuron monolayer, causing immediate damage to neuron cell bodies and neurites (\nFig. S1A\n). In 6-well plates, used for cell lysate and protein collection, seven vertical and five horizontal scratch lines (all spaced 5\u2009mm apart) were created (\nFig. S1B\n). The needle and scratch designs were determined experimentally for optimal use in producing graded injury over time, and served as a useful and responsive model for experimental treatment with bpV and other signal pathway inhibitors.\nTo assess graded injury over time, supernatant was collected from 48-well groups at time intervals of 1, 4, 16, and 24\u2009h post-injury, and a cell death assay was performed. Fluorescent nuclear labeling of propidium iodide (PI) was also utilized to confirm changes visually in cell viability, in combination with a cell death assay, in experiments testing neuroprotective effects of bpV after scratch injury. The scratch method induced a primary mechanical injury to neurons/neurites at the injury site and caused a subsequent spread of damage to adjacent neurons distal to the scratch lines over time.\nAssessment of bpV treatment effects on spinal neurons\nIn wells selected for experimental treatment, a 45\u2009min pre-treatment with experimentally determined doses of 100\u2009nM PTEN inhibitor bpV(pic) (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY) in 0.9% saline, 20\u2009\u03bcM PI3K-inhibitor LY294002, 25\u2009nM mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA), or combinations of the above were implemented. After pre-treatment, cells were left uninjured or received scratch injuries and were cultured for designated periods depending on the experiment. After experimental treatment, supernatant was collected for cell death assays, and cells were prepared for either Western blot analysis or immunocytochemistry.\nPI neuron death labeling\nThe PI labeling to indicate neuronal death was performed as described previously.\n22\nIn brief, Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to culture wells, and plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 95% O\n2\n/5% CO\n2\nfor 10\u2009min to label all cell nuclei. Plates were then incubated with PI (Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature for 15\u2009min to label nuclei of dead cells. After PI incubation, medium was extracted, and cells were washed with 0.01\u2009M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by a 10\u2009min treatment with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1\u2009M PBS to fix the cells.\nCells were then washed with PBS and labeled with AlexaFluor 488-conjugated \u03b2-III-tubulin primary antibody (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) for 1\u2009h in PBS-T for neuron labeling +10% normal goat serum to prevent non-specific antibody binding. Cells were then washed 3\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009min with PBS-T and covered with PBS in the well for imaging.\nCell death assay\nTo assess the damage and death of cultured spinal neurons, a lactase dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay was performed on the cell culture supernatant per the manufacturer's instructions (Cytotox 96, Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, 50\u2009\u03bcL medium was removed from each well with cultured neurons in a 48-well plate after 24\u2009h injury experiment and transferred to corresponding wells of an empty flat-bottomed 96-well plate. Supplied LDH substrate mix (50\u2009\u03bcL) was added to each well, and the plates were left in the dark for 30\u2009min. Afterward, reaction Stop Buffer was added to end LDH enzyme activity, and the plates were read on a plate reader at an absorbance 490\u2009nm. A numerical absorbance value for each well was calculated as a measure of the amount of LDH release by the neurons with and without scratch injury.\nWestern blotting\nSpinal neurons used for protein analysis were cultured on six-well plates as described above. Proteins were prepared for Western blot analysis according to previously published methods.\n11\n,\n23\nIn brief, approximately 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n6\ncells/well were lysed in RIPA Lysis Buffer (25\u2009mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6], 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS +0.5\u2009M EDTA, and 1% Halt inhibitor), homogenized, and left on ice for 15\u2009min. Then, the lysates were centrifuged, supernatants extracted, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method.\n24\nSamples were loaded on 8\u201310% SDS polyacrylamide gels, separated via electrophoresis, and proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. Membranes were blocked with Li-Cor Odyssey blocking buffer (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE) for 1\u2009h followed by incubation with the following primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C: polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho Akt (ser 473) (1:1,000), a marker used for assessing PTEN and PI3K activation; monoclonal mouse anti-pan Akt (1:1,500); polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho ribosomal protein S6 (ser 235/236) (1:400); rabbit anti-extracellular signal-related kinase (Erk) (1:1,500); mouse anti-phospho Erk (1:1,000); and mouse anti-\u03b2-tubulin (1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich) as a loading control.\nMembranes were then washed with PBS-T and incubated with secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IR Dye800 or goat anti-rabbit IR Dye680 (Rockland Immunochemicals Inc., Gilbertsville, PA) 1\u2009h at room temperature. Membranes were scanned using a LiCor Odyssey infrared scanner and images captured using Image Studio 2.0 software (Li-Cor). Densitometry of specific bands was performed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health [NIH], Bethesda, MD).\n\nIn vivo\nexperiments\nSurgical procedures\nFor investigating acute signaling mechanism changes and bpV effects\nin vivo\n, adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (SD, 200\u2013250\u2009g, Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) (\nn\n=\u200940) were maintained under controlled conditions with a 12:12 light:dark cycle with\nad libitum\nwater and food access. For time course investigation of signaling mechanism changes, a sham surgery group (\nn\n=\u20098), and animals designated for sacrifice one day (\nn\n=\u20098), three days (\nn\n=\u20098), and seven days (\nn\n=\u20098) post-surgery were established. For animals designated for the acute assessment of bpV treatment effects, two groups were established: control and bpV treatment groups (\nn\n=\u20094, each).\nBefore the surgical procedure, animals were anesthetized intraperitoneally (IP) with a ketamine/xylazine cocktail ([87\u2009mg/kg]/[12\u2009mg/kg]) and received laminectomy only (sham operation) or unilateral cervical contusive SCI performed as published previously.\n11\nIn brief, a customized device was used to stabilize the 5th cervical vertebra,\n25\nand a partial unilateral laminectomy exposed the right side of the cord leaving the dura intact. The MASCIS Impactor\n26\n(10\u2009g weight, 12.5\u2009mm height) produced a moderate unilateral injury.\n27\nSham animals were administered anesthesia and laminectomy surgery, but were excluded from injury.\nAnimals received 5\u2009mL 0.9% saline subcutaneously for hydration and were observed over a 24\u2009h recovery period in temperature-controlled housing. All animal procedures and surgeries were approved under the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council) and the Guidelines of the Indiana University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\nbpV treatment post-SCI\nAfter injury, the control rats received an immediate IP injection of 0.9% saline (Vehicle) and the bpV treatment group received an injection of bpV(pic) (Enzo Life Sciences) 400\u2009\u03bcg/kg. The rats then received a subsequent injection of Vehicle or bpV 2\u2009h post-SCI and were sacrificed 24\u2009h after the surgical procedure for tissue isolation. Tissue collected from sham operation and one day post-SCI rat groups from the time course study were utilized for comparison.\nWestern blotting\nTissue protein analysis from\nin vivo\nexperiments followed procedures described previously\n11\n,\n23\nwith modification. Briefly, a 10\u2009mm spinal cord segment containing the injury epicenter (5\u2009mm rostral and caudal to the epicenter) was removed for protein extraction from sham rats and animals one, three, and seven days after SCI. Equal protein concentrations from each sample were loaded onto 8\u201310% polyacrylamide gels, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a PVDF membrane.\nThe membranes were immunoblotted with the following primary antibodies: monoclonal mouse-anti PTEN (1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA); rabbit anti-phospho-PTEN (ser 380, 1:500), a marker for the inactive form of PTEN; polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho Akt (ser 473) (1:1,000); monoclonal mouse anti-pan Akt (1:1,500); polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho ribosomal protein S6 (ser 235/236) (1:400); rabbit anti-phospho ser9-glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) (1:1000), inhibited form of GSK3\u03b2 induced by Akt; rabbit anti-Erk (1:1,500); mouse anti-phospho Erk (1:1,000); cleaved caspase 3 (1:500) a marker for apoptotic cell death (Cell Signaling, Inc., Danvers, MA); mouse anti-\u03b2-tubulin (1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich) as a loading control.\nMembranes were incubated with a secondary goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse fluorescent IR680 or IR800 secondary antibody (1:10,000; Rockland) and visualized with the Li-Cor Odyssey system and software as described. Quantification of detected bands was performed by densitometry using ImageJ software (NIH).\nHistological preparation\nTissue was collected from sham rats and animals one, three, and seven days post-SCI and processed as previously published.\n11\n,\n23\nIn brief, a 1\u2009cm segment of cervical cord including the injury epicenter was dissected and sectioned transversely at 20\u2009\u03bcm thicknesses on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) using a cryostat (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). Serial sections with an interval of 0.5\u2009mm along the length of the cord were used spanning the entire segment.\nA set of slides was stained with cresyl violet/eosin to identify the lesion epicenter and 2\u2009mm rostral and caudal to the epicenter. Adjacent sections in this penumbral region were selected for immunofluorescence labeling to determine the pattern of p-Akt expression in surviving near-lesion neurons and the number of these neurons during the first week post-SCI.\nImmunofluorescence double labeling\nImmunofluorescence double labeling was performed as described previously.\n11\n,\n12\n,\n23\n,\n28\nBriefly, sham animals and animals one, three, and seven days after SCI were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, and a 1\u2009cm-long spinal segment including the injury epicenter was removed and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in 0.1\u2009M PBS. Cord segments were sectioned transversely at 20\u2009\u03bcm thicknesses, mounted on Superfrost slides, and prepared for immunostaining as described previously.\n11\nTissue sections were incubated with the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-NeuN (1:200, EMD Millipore), a marker for neurons, and rabbit anti-phospho-Akt (ser473) (1:100, Cell Signaling, Inc.). The following day, the sections were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or fluoroisothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse fluorescent secondary antibodies (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab, West Grove, PA). Sections were coverslip-mounted with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). Pre-immune serum was used as a control to confirm antibody specificity. Images were obtained at identical settings with an Olympus BX60 epifluorescent microscope.\nFluorescent intensity of p-Akt in motor neurons 1.5\u2009mm to 2\u2009mm rostral to the epicenter (in the injury penumbra) was performed using ImageJ. This was achieved by converting the images to gray scale, outlining NeuN/p-Akt double labeled neurons of the ventral horn, and measuring the integrated density (ID) of p-Akt labeling of the neurons. Background values were obtained from five identically sized sample areas of tissue adjacent to the quantified neurons, and an average background ID was calculated. The measured neuron ID was divided by the mean background ID to achieve neuron ID signal to background ID ratio values for each neuron.\nApproximately 10\u201320 motor neurons 1.5\u20132\u2009mm rostral to the epicenter were measured per animal, and the signal/background ratio was averaged for all measurements from each animal, and all animals per group. Ventral horn neurons positive for NeuN labeling in these sections were quantified using a previously published method.\n11\n\nStatistical analysis\nA two-sample Student\nt\ntest was used to determine significance between two groups. Statistical significance between multiple groups was determined using a one-way analysis of variance with\npost hoc\nanalysis. All statistical values were calculated with GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad, Inc., La Jolla, CA), with a\np\nvalue\n<\n0.05 considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Study design and participants\nThis study was performed in accordance with local Institutional Review Board approval and Food and Drug Administration Investigational Device Exemption approval. The participants identified in this study have provided informed consent and authorization to present publicly identifiable information for research purposes. The study protocol is registered with\nClinicalTrials.gov\n(NCT03026816). Patients with chronic, traumatic SCI (greater than one year since injury) were recruited if they met the following criteria: greater than 22 years of age, motor complete AIS classification A or B with a neurological level of injury between C6 and T10, full arm and hand strength, and intact segmental reflexes below the level of injury.\nParticipants were excluded if they had medical or psychological comorbidities that would significantly increase the risk of operation, severe dysautonomia with systolic blood pressure fluctuation below 50 or above 200\u2009mmHg on autonomic testing, contractures, pressure ulcers, recurrent urinary tract infection, unhealed spinal fracture, recent botulinum toxin use, or pregnancy. Tilt-table testing performed during screening identified participants with cardiovascular dysautonomia, who were then enrolled into the autonomic arm with the addition of cardiovascular testing. Patients returned for monthly assessments for stimulator programming, surveys, and sEMG Brain Motor Control Assessment (BMCA).\n21\nTwo female participants with chronic thoracic AIS A SCI were enrolled in the study. Participant 1 was 52 years of age, had a T8 AIS A injury after a fall, and was 10 years from injury. Participant 2 was 48 years of age, had a T4 AIS A injury after a motorcycle accident, and was five years from injury. Neither participant had undergone extensive exercise training for the six months before enrolling in the study. Participant 1 did not undergo any home, inpatient, or outpatient rehabilitation in the six months before study participation. Participant 2 reported 60\u2009h of individual outpatient rehabilitation in the six months before study participation including standing and functional electrical stimulation exercises.\n\nSurgery\nParticipants underwent implantation of a three column (5-6-5), 16-contact paddle lead with a primary cell internal pulse generator (IPG) (Tripole\u2122 and Proclaim Elite\u2122, Abbott, Plano, TX) at approximately the vertebral T12 level under general anesthesia (\nSupplementary Fig. 1\n). Low frequency (2\u2009Hz, 450\u2009\u03bcs, 0-10\u2009mA) stimulator-evoked motor responses allowed electrophysiological mapping to ensure coverage of the lumbar and sacral roots (vastus medialis, adductor longus, vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, rectal sphincter). These muscles were selected to represent major innervation from each nerve root between L2 and S2 according to intraoperative monitoring practice convention at the study institution before the publication of a standard muscle list and procedure.\n22\nThe paddle was configured with cathodes inferiorly and anodes superiorly. The paddle was shifted intraoperatively until maximal and symmetric muscle recruitment was observed with the most minimal current. Anchors were placed and sutured to secure the paddle, and the wires from the paddle electrode were tunneled to a subcutaneous pocket where the pulse generator was secured. Surgery was performed on an outpatient basis with participants leaving the hospital the same day.\n\nAssessment of volitional muscle activity\nA Natus Nicolet Electrodiagnostic system with an Endeavor sixteen-channel intraoperative module (Natus Medical Incorporated, Pleasanton, CA) was used for sEMG recordings. Each participant underwent two surface sEMG assessments at enrollment and at each monthly visit: once with stimulation on and once with stimulation off. The SCS stimulator settings were set before beginning assessment and remained unchanged throughout.\nEight total muscle groups (rectus abdominis, T10 intercostal, T12 paraspinal, iliopsoas, rectus femoris, tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, and gastrocnemius) on each side were recorded (five in the lower extremities) while the subject lying supine with enough head elevation so that she could observe her legs. The selected muscles representing each nerve root differed from the ones utilized during intraoperative monitoring because of the differences in anatomical accessibility when comparing needle and surface monitoring. A modified version of the BMCA was used, where volitional tasks included six maneuvers performed three times (bilateral and unilateral hip flexion/extension with knee flexion/extension, as well as bilateral and unilateral dorsiflexion/plantarflexion). A five-minute resting phase was performed during the task to differentiate involuntary and evoked movements from volitional movements.\nRecordings of the 10 lower extremity muscle groups during each of these maneuvers, averaged over three trials, formed the basis for further evaluation. The average root mean square (RMS) surface EMG power was calculated for each task and muscle group (labeled as Raw in\nSupplementary Fig. 2\n). Surface EMG recordings are inherently noisy. Baseline noise present on each channel was calculated as the RMS of the last 5\u2009sec for each trial and channel. Surface EMG power (referred to as power for the remainder of the article) from noise was subtracted from raw power to identify power from muscle activity (Raw - Noise in\nSupplementary Fig. 2\n).\nTo account for movements from stimulation without intention or volition, power was calculated for each channel over 30 windows of 10\u2009sec during a 5\u2009min relaxation period. The median power of each channel was used to calculate an evoked power. This power was subtracted to produce the Raw - Noise Response Magnitude (modified from previous reports),\n23\nlabeled as Nonstimulation or Volitional (Stim) in\nFigure 3\n. Further details are available in the\nSupplementary Text\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nDifferences in surface electromyography (sEMG) power. Pooled sEMG power between non-stimulation (NS) and stimulation (S) for the first five follow-up appointments for Participant 1 (P1) (\nA\n) and Participant 2 (P2) (\nB\n) demonstrating the power generated during volitional movement during Non-stimulation and stimulation (Volitional [stim]). The sEMG power for each maneuver during the first five follow-up appointments during NS and S (at intervals of approximately one month) for P1 (\nC\n) and P2 (\nD\n). Stimulator patterns for P1 are shown on the left, and patterns for P2 are shown on the right. In order of visit, P1 used frequencies (F) of 30, 30, 24, 50, and 30\u2009Hz. Pulse-widths (PW) were 420\u2009\u03bcs, and currents (C) were 13.5, 16.5, 10, 20, and 16\u2009mA. P2 used frequencies of 30, 100, 30, 40, and 24\u2009Hz. Pulse-width was 420\u2009\u03bcs, and currents used were 7.8, 7, 7.5, 7.8, and 9.6\u2009mA. Outliers (>2.7\u25a1) are denoted as red crosses. Asterisks denote statistical significance: *\np\n<\u20090.05, **\np\n<\u20090.01, ***\np\n<\u20090.001.\n\nExperimental stimulation\nThe array of stimulator electrodes was programmed to stimulate broadly and adjusted to provide symmetrical responses. While the frequency (16\u2013400\u2009Hz) and pulse width (200\u2013500\u2009\u03bcs) were varied as part of the optimization component of the study, the current was adjusted to allow a range, where the bottom of the range was found by identifying signs of movement and the midpoint of the range was programmed to be maximal volitional movement while supine. Outside of monthly testing, patients were free to adjust stimulation intensity to compensate for impedance changes in different positions (e.g., supine vs. upright). As a result, amplitude varied from a minimum of 2\u2009mA to 15\u2009mA, depending on position.\nStimulation for autonomic function (CV Stim) used an electrode configuration that maximized the current density above the electrode, rostrally, with the goal of exciting some of the caudal pre-ganglionic neurons, which are distributed between T1 and L2. Because the study was designed to systematically evaluate the effect of various eSCS parameter settings on volitional movement, parameter settings used for the primary outcome varied considerably as a result of using the best of eight settings assigned the previous month to evaluate the large parameter space during the month between visits. Further information is available in the Supplement.\n\nAmbulatory blood pressure (BP) assessments\nParticipants underwent ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM-05, Meditech Ltd., Budapest, Hungary) pre-programmed to obtain BP measurements every 15\u2009min during daytime and every 30\u2009min during sleep hours to identify cardiovascular dysautonomia (orthostatic hypotension or autonomic dysreflexia) off stimulation. The cuff was applied by a physician, and participants were instructed to leave it on for 24\u2009h. All participants were screened for signs of cardiovascular dysautonomia during a 10\u2009min tilt-table test that determined eligibility and enrollment in the autonomic arm of the study.\n\nHemodynamic assessments\nDuring orthostatic challenge testing (70 degrees tilt-table test), BP and heart rate were measured non-invasively every minute (Suresigns VSi, Koninklijke Philips N.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands) on the right brachial artery and a beat-by-beat basis via finger photoplethysmography (Finometer PRO, Finapres Medical Systems, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Electrocardiography (ML 132; ADInstruments) and BP were sampled at 1000\u2009Hz using an analog-to-digital converter (Powerlab/16SP ML 795; ADInstruments, CO Springs, CO) interfaced with data acquisition software on a laptop computer (LabChart 7 ADInstruments). Stroke volume and cardiac contractility (dP/dT) were computed using Modelflow. Further, blood velocity was measured in either the left or right middle cerebral artery, depending on signal quality (Spencer Technology, Redmond, WA), using a 2\u2009MHz probe mounted on the temporal bone and a fitted head strap, according to our described protocol.\n24\nParticipants rested supine for approximately 10\u2009min while baseline hemodynamic data were recorded. Participants were then tilted to 70 degrees and asked about the presence of pre-syncopal symptoms (i.e., dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea) at the beginning, middle, and end of each stage. All cardiovascular parameters were measured continuously during this test. Once hypotensive, caudal stimulation (used for volitional movement) was applied followed by rostral stimulation for comparison. Cognitive assessments (described below) were performed during baseline, symptomatic tilt, and stimulation.\n\nCognitive function measures\nCognitive assessments were performed by an experienced researcher, AP. The following cognitive tests were performed according to standard protocols: Forward and Backward Digit Span Test,\n25\nStroop Test,\n26\nand Controlled Oral Word Association Test.\n27\n\nBowel and bladder assessments\nThe Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction Score (NBDS)\n28\nwas used to assess bowel function. Summary scores are categorized as very minor, minor, moderate, and severe. The Neurogenic Bladder Symptom Score (NBSS)\n29\nwas used to assess bladder function after SCI. Scores were divided into the domains of incontinence, consequences, storage, and quality of life.\n\nStatistical methods\nTwo sample\nt\ntests were performed on baseline (non-stimulation), stimulation power, each BMCA maneuver, as well as for systolic BPs obtained at baseline, during symptomatic hypotension, and during stimulation. Normality was evaluated, and log transform was used where appropriate to improve normality. See Supplement for more information; see online supplementary material at\nwww.liebertpub.com\n. Differences were considered to be statistically significant when\np\n<\u20090.05. Relaxation data during the first appointment of the first patient were imputed from the subsequent four visits because of technical error.\n\nRole of the funding source\nThis is an independent investigator-sponsored study. None of the funding sources were involved in data collection, analysis, manuscript writing, or the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. The corresponding author maintains full access to all study data and has the final responsibility in the decision to submit the manuscript."

    "Methods": "Search criteria\nOur search criteria were established to be specific for mTBI models caused by a closed head injury. Following guidelines established by PRISMA,\n7\ncomprehensive searches (on May 15, 2018) of both PubMed and Web of Science were conducted using the following keyword search: mild TBI, concussion, closed head injury, rodent, mice, mouse, or rat; excluding controlled cortical impact, fluid percussion, or review articles. Using the advanced search tools on PubMed and Web of Science, both title and abstract were searched with the following Boolean search strategy: [(((((((rodent) OR rat) OR mouse) OR mice)) AND (((mild TBI) OR concussion) OR closed head injury))) NOT ((CCI) OR fluid percussion)]. From PubMed, 984 articles were given in the final results, and Web of Science produced 1336 articles. Both of these lists of articles were combined and duplicate references were removed, leaving 1890 articles (\nFig. 1\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nMethods flow chart. Identification through searches on two separate web-based platforms yielded 1,890 articles which were screened by abstract and then eligibility was determined via full text examination to exclude 1,403 articles. Removing mTBI articles in which repeat injuries were sustained, a total of 402 single mTBI articles were included in our review. mTBI, mild traumatic brain injury.\n\nInclusion/exclusion criteria\nAbstracts and titles were screened by C.N.B. to include only peer-reviewed primary research reports specific for mild, closed head TBI only in rodents. All other types of articles were excluded. Blast injuries were excluded because, although military related blast injuries are a major cause of mTBI,\n5\nthe vast complexity of the different injury models used were beyond the scope of this review.\n8\nAll repeat injury models (85) were also considered beyond the scope of this review and were thus excluded (\nFig. 1\n).\n\nRetrieval of information from full-text articles\nFor collection of information on methods of each of these articles, a GoogleForm was used by C.N.B., K.N.R., and E.K.H. The title, first author, last author, publication date, name of model, and references cited for the model were collected as general identifiers. For the method of injury induction, the following information was collected: injury device used, anesthesia use, surgery indicator, injury device type, head fixed with method of fixation, animal stabilization method, impact tip size, impact tip shape, impact tip material, impact surface, impact location, weight for drop, height for drop, tube composition, and the type of impact absorbent materials used (if any). Species, sex, and age of animals were also recorded. Finally, injury outcomes were collected, including mortality rate, righting reflex latency, neuroscore, motor deficits (open field, balance beam, rotarod, etc.), cognitive deficits (novel object, Morris water maze, radial arm water maze, Y/T maze, etc.), affective behavior deficits (elevated plus, social, sucrose preferences, etc.), and histology (cell and tissue changes, axonal injury markers, myelin markers, gliosis markers, etc.). Information on outcome variables was collected only between sham and control animals, not with any treatments done within the publication. If any treatments were done in the publications, the effects observed with treatment were not considered as content for this review."

    "Methods": "C57BL/6 male mice (12\u201316 weeks old) were housed singly on a 12-h light/dark cycle withad libitumaccess to food and water. All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with theGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Healthand approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The rmTBI was performed as described previously with some modifications.13,14Mild closed head injury (mCHI) was delivered by a free-falling weight onto the head of a mouse positioned on a compressible material (a 17.0\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u200912.5\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u20094.0\u2009cm [L\u2009\u00d7\u2009W\u2009\u00d7\u2009H] piece of 1.0 pound per cubic foot [pcf] expanded polystyrene). A total of three hits were delivered, each separated by 72\u2009h. This separation was based on studies that have demonstrated that markers of neuronal health (e.g., N-acetylaspartic acid, NAA) in the brain are depleted maximally three days after concussion in athletes, an effect also observed in rats after mTBI.15,16\n\nMale mice were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane in a 1:1 O2/air mixture, then maintained with a 2.5% isoflurane and 1:1 O2/air mixture. At 40\u2009sec after discontinuation of anesthesia, a single impact was applied to the skull by dropping a 9.8 gram weight through a 4-foot Plexiglas tube. To the tip of the weight, a 1.5\u2009mm thick, 5\u2009mm in diameter piece of butyl rubber (16\u201d bicycle inner tube) was attached (using cyanoacrylic) to reduce the possibility of skull fractures. Sham animals were exposed to identical periods of anesthesia but not injured.\n\nThe CA was purchased from Cayman Chemical (cat# 89820). A stock CA solution (7.5\u2009mg/mL in ethanol) was diluted in sterile saline and administered IP (1\u2009mg/kg; 30\u2009min after each injury) as described previously.12Acute neurological assessments were performed immediately after each injury. Drug administration, motor skills, and cognitive testing were performed as outlined inFigure 1A."

    "Methods": "Data overview\nIn this article, data from the CENTER-TBI study (NCT02210221) is used, which recruited patients across a broad range of hospitals, including trauma centers, university hospitals, and community hospitals, over 5000 patients. The data are collected in three strata, differentiated by care path: 1) patients seen in the emergency room (ER) and discharged (ER stratum); 2) patients admitted to hospital, but not to the intensive care unit (ICU; admission stratum); (3) patients admitted to the ICU (ICU stratum). CT scan was performed according to standard clinical practice on either a GE (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK), Siemens (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany), Philips (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands), or Toshiba (Toshiba Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) clinical scanner having a wide range of imaging (acquisition and reconstruction) parameters. Three distinctive subcohorts of the CENTER-TBI data set are considered for evaluating acute intracranial lesions segmentation: cistern segmentation and midline shift estimation such that every data set ensures a sufficient variability in terms of TBI severity and imaging characteristics of interest.\n\nData set 1: Acute intracranial lesions delineation\nThe training data for acute intracranial lesions segmentation consist of 72 males and 33 females with 42 subdural hematomas, 43 epidural hematomas, and 66 intraparenchymal hemorrhages/contusions (multiple lesion types per patient were possible). The test data consist of 39 images and have similar distribution as the training, and the volumes range from 5.5 to 223\u2009mL. Nine subjects were scanned on GE, 11 on Philips, 16 on Siemens, and three on Toshiba scanners. CT imaging parameters were as follows: computed tomography dose index (CTDIvol; in milliGrays) ranges from 0.03 to 85.66, peak kilovoltage (kVp) ranges from 80 to 140, slice thickness ranges from 0.41 to 5.00\u2009mm, and pixel spacing ranges from 0.30 to 1.00\u2009mm. Manual delineation of acute intracranial lesions is performed using 3D Slicer (version 4.8.1) (3D Slicer (online; accessed September 19, 2018;\nwww.slicer.org)\n) by two neuroscientists (after mutual consensus), trained to interpret and segment TBI pathology. Each segmentation was supervised and validated by an expert neuroradiologist with over 25 years of experience.\n\nData set 2: Cisterns delineation\nCistern data contain 70 cases with suprasellar, quadrigeminal, or prepontine/ambient cisternal compression indicated in the structured radiological reports. Multiple cisterns could be simultaneously compressed. Seven subjects were scanned on GE, 12 on Philips, 37 on Siemens, and 14 on Toshiba scanners. CT imaging parameters were as follows: CTDIvol (in milliGrays) ranges from 0.10 to 223.87, kVp ranges from 100 to 140, slice thickness ranges from 0.43 to 5.00\u2009mm, and pixel spacing ranges from 0.29 to 1.00\u2009mm. A (trained) neuroscientist manually segmented the cisterns using 3D Slicer under supervision of an expert neuroradiologist. Total volume of cisterns ranged from 0 to 19.76\u2009mL.\n\nData set 3: Midline shift measurement\nMLS data contain 38 images for which the structured radiological reports indicated MLS status (<5 or >5\u2009mm). Six subjects are scanned on the GE, 15 on Philips, 13 on Siemens, and 5 on Toshiba scanners. CT imaging parameters were as follows: CTDIvol (in milliGrays) ranges from 15.86 to 71.65, kVp ranges from 100 to 140, slice thickness ranges from 0.43 to 5.00\u2009mm, and pixel spacing ranges from 0.35 to 1.00\u2009mm. Two neuroradiographers (after mutual consensus) measured the MLS following the Common Data Elements,\n16\nunder supervision of an expert neuroradiologist. First, a line (line A) was drawn from the protuberantia occipitalis interna to the crista galli. At the level of the largest MLS, a line (line B) was drawn perpendicular to this line A, across the image, between the left and right internal table of the skull. A third line (line C) was drawn from the internal table of the skull to the septum pellucidum at the level of largest midline shift, in the opposite direction of the shift. This line was at the same level and parallel to line B. The MLS was then calculated with the following formula:\n.\n17\nMeasurements were performed at all levels between the foramen of Monro and the roof of the lateral ventricles, where a possible MLS was visible. The measurement with the largest midline shift was taken as the final MLS. The experts' MLSs ranged from 0.20 to 19\u2009mm.\n\nMethod description\nFigure 1\npresents an overview of the proposed method, which has four steps. In the first step, the pipeline pre-processed the input CT image where the brain was extracted and segmented into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Brain extraction was performed using the 2D U-Net method described in Ronneberger and colleagues.\n18\nThe method contains five layers of contracting and expansive paths. In each layer, there are two convolutions of kernel size 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093 and activated with a rectified linear unit (ReLu), which are normalized afterward with a zero mean and unit standard deviation. The number of filters used in the two convolutional blocks of the first layer were 64, and then in the successive layer, the number of filters was doubled. The network was optimized using Adadelta\n19\nand was implemented in Python language (Python (online; accessed November, 28, 2018;\nhttps://www.python.org)\n) using Keras (Keras (online; accessed November, 28, 2018;\nhttps://keras.io)\n) with Tensorflow (Tensorflow (online; accessed November, 28, 2018;\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org)\n) backend. Brain segmentation was computed by registering the input image to the CT atlas\n20\nin the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinate space\n21\nusing NiftyReg,\n22\n(NiftyReg (online; accessed November, 28, 2018;\nhttp://cmictig.cs.ucl.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/NiftyReg)\n) followed by segmenting the skull-stripped input CT image with the help of the available MNI CT before probability maps of gray matter, white matter, and CSF using a maximum likelihood expectation/maximization algorithm, NiftySeg. (NiftySeg (online; accessed November, 28, 2018;\nhttp://cmictig.cs.ucl.ac.uk/research/software/software-nifty/niftyseg)\n) The CSF segmentation was used to locate the lateral ventricles as well as the cisterns in the input CT image using binary anatomical priors of these structures available from MNI coordinate space.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSchematic representation of icobrain method. CSF, cerebrospinal fluid. Color image is available online.\nIn the second step, cisterns were segmented by performing a set of morphological operations (constrained dilation, smoothing, and imposing nonoverlap at the cistern border) on the located cisterns from the pre-processing step to obtain the final segmentation. In the third step, acute intracranial lesions were segmented using a three-dimensional U-Net\u2013based CNN architecture as described by \u00c7i\u00e7ek and colleagues.\n23\nThe CNN uses intensity-normalized (zero mean and unit standard deviation) extracted brain images from the pre-processing step for training. It extracts the relevant information from the input image and synthesizes the segmentation information at four resolutions (layers). In the extraction path, every layer has two 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093 convolutions blocks, and each convolution is followed by a ReLu activation function. Then, a 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20092 max pooling operation decreases the input resolution by half in each dimension. The number of filters used in the two convolutional blocks of the first layer are 32 and 64, respectively, and then in the successive layer, the number of filters is doubled. During synthesis path, every layer has a 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20092 upsampling operation followed by two convolutions with ReLu, as described in the compression path. Shortcut connections are added from the same resolution of the compression path to provide high-resolution features before performing the convolution operation. In the final layer, a 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091 convolution layer reduces the number of output channels to desired classes, followed by a softmax function to enforce sparse segmentation. The network is trained with an input voxel patch of the image of size 132\u2009\u00d7\u2009132\u2009\u00d7\u2009132 with desired output channels and a batch size of one. The output patch size is 44\u2009\u00d7\u200944\u2009\u00d7\u200944 and with a voxel size of 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm\n3\n; the approximate receptive field is approximately 88\u2009\u00d7\u200988\u2009\u00d7\u200988\u2009mm\n3\nfor each voxel in the output segmentation. The network is trained with an Adam optimizer (learning rate\u2009=\u200910\n\u2013\n5\n; decay factor\u2009=\u20090.0),\n24\nwith categorical cross entropy as a loss function,\n#\nand is trained in two stages. In the first stage, the model is trained to differentiate intracranial lesions from the background using input and output image patches. 2) In the second stage, we computed the false lesions mask using the model segmentation from the first stage and the ground truth, and retrained the network with false lesions mask as an additional class. This forced the network to focus on the hard samples and learn to differentiate between acute intracranial lesions and false lesions. The false lesions mask includes venous sinus, free, and attached edges of the falx cerebri and tentorium cerebelli, etc., that contain blood, which have similar Hounsfield units as intracranial lesions. Because the data size is small, the images are augmented by flipping, translating, rotating, and adding Gaussian noise randomly. This would allow for more variability in the training set, and avoid possible overfitting. In the testing phase, the trained CNN assigns every voxel in an image a probability of being acute intracranial lesions, which is then thresholded to 0.7 (empirically chosen) to obtain the final segmentation. The network was implemented in Python language using Keras with Tensorflow backend. In the fourth step, the MLS was estimated by defining a range of potential slices between the foramen of Monro and the roof of the lateral ventricles in the MNI coordinate space. On each of these slices, the shift was calculated using the formula:\n, where\ncorresponds to the max width in the axial plane and\nis the distance from the middle of the frontal part of the ventricles to the skull such that\nand\nhave the same starting x-coordinate value (\nFig. 2\n). Maximum displacement is given as the MLS encountered for the patient.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nEstimation of the midline shift.\nis the max width in the axial plane and\nis the distance from the middle of the frontal part of the ventricles to the skull such that\nand\nhave the same starting x coordinate value (black bidirectional arrow). The midline shift is then calculated using the expression:\n. Color image is available online.\n\nPerformance metrics\nThe acute intracranial lesions and cisterns volume agreement between icobrain and expert reference segmentation was evaluated through the volume difference (in mL), absolute volume difference, and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Volume difference was computed as the difference between the value derived from the expert reference segmentation and the corresponding total volume reported by the icobrain method. A positive value indicates undersegmentation, and negative value indicates oversegmentation by the automated method. To measure the deviation from the expert reference segmentation (irrespective of under- or oversegmentation), absolute volume difference was computed, which was the absolute value of the volume difference. The ICC assessed the agreement of measurements made by multiple observers measuring the same quantity.\n25\nIn this article, ICC was used in the absolute agreement formulation.\nThe Dice similarity index was used to evaluate the overlap agreement between icobrain and expert reference segmentations for acute intracranial lesions and cistern segmentations. It was defined as the ratio between the number of voxels where both the icobrain and the expert reference segmentation agree (true positives; TP) and the mean number of voxels labeled as acute intracranial lesions/cisterns by the two methods.\n26\nSegmentation quality was evaluated by sensitivity and precision. Sensitivity was defined as the ratio between TP and the total number of acute intracranial lesions/cisterns voxels in the expert reference segmentation (TP and false negatives [FN]). Precision was defined as the ratio between TP and the total number of acute intracranial lesions/cisterns voxels in the automatic segmentation (TP and false positives [FP]). Mathematically, Dice, sensitivity, and precision are defined as follows:\n,\n, and\n. An additional classification accuracy measure is reported, defined as the ratio of number of cases where both reference and automatic measurements agree (i.e., their respective largest lesion volume is either >25 or <25\u2009mL) and total number of subjects.\nFor the MLS, the difference in shift (in mm) was computed between the expert and icobrain method measurements. We also report the absolute shift measurement, which is the absolute value of the difference in shift. Finally, the classification accuracy measure is also reported. In this case, the agreement was defined where both reference and automatic measurements either measured the shift >5 or <5\u2009mm."

    "Methods": "Animals\nMale Wistar rats (175\u2013200\u2009g; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were pair-housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room with a 12-h light/dark cycle and\nad libitum\naccess to food and water. All animal procedures and experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center and were in accordance with the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nOperant self-administration\nRats were allowed to acclimate to housing conditions for one week before operant alcohol self-administration training, conducted as described previously.\n33\nBriefly, rats were placed in operant self-administration chambers 5 days/week in limited access sessions of 30\u2009min that began 6\u2009h into the dark cycle. Rats had access to two levers (water vs. alcohol) on a fixed ratio (FR1) schedule, in which one lever press resulted in delivery of 0.1\u2009mL of either water or 10% w/v ethanol. Once consistent baseline drinking levels were achieved (i.e., three consecutive sessions during which the variance of the number of alcohol lever presses was no more than \u00b120%), animals were counterbalanced into experimental groups based on baseline alcohol drinking levels, calculated as mean alcohol lever presses for the last five 30-min operant sessions.\n\nTraumatic brain injury via lateral fluid percussion\nForty-eight hours after the last operant self-administration training session, animals received a 5\u2009mm in diameter craniotomy above the left SMC (from bregma: AP: \u22122\u2009mm, ML: \u22123\u2009mm) before undergoing TBI via lateral fluid percussion (Fluid Percussion Injury [FPI], Model 01-B, Custom Design and Fabrication, Virginia Commonwealth University) as previously described.\n34\nAnimals in the sham group were anesthetized and received craniotomy but were not subjected to TBI (surgical controls). Only animals with an injury of at least 2 atm of pressure, which produces an mTBI, were included for analysis. Following surgery, topical lidocaine was applied to the incision site, and animals were allowed to recover in their home cages for 48\u2009h with\nad libitum\nfood and water prior to resuming operant drinking post-TBI.\n\nMAGL inhibition\nJZL184 (Item #13158, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) was used to selectively inhibit MAGL, the enzyme that degrades 2-AG. Systemic JZL184 administration results in rapid and potent MAGL inhibition, with maximal inhibition within 30\u2009min resulting in a 7- to 9-fold increase in brain 2-AG levels.\n27\nJZL184 (16\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle (1:1:18 solution of alcohol, emulphor, and saline) was administered 30\u2009min after TBI procedures. Behavioral testing resumed 48\u2009h after injection. To determine whether JZL184 treatment alone improves spatial memory, anxiety-like behavior, or mechanosensitivity, a separate cohort of non-drinking animals received JZL184 (16\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle 30\u2009min after sham procedures and then underwent behavioral testing.\n\nPost-TBI operant drinking\nAnimals resumed 30-min limited access drinking sessions every other day 48\u2009h after TBI or sham procedures (days 2, 4, 6, and 8 post-TBI). To test for motivated alcohol drinking, animals completed a progressive ratio (PR) task 9 days post-TBI. In this task, the work required to receive 0.1\u2009mL of 10% w/v alcohol progressively increases (i.e., initially one press delivers one reward of alcohol, then two presses is required for one reward, then three presses for one reward, etc.). The experimental session ends when the subject fails to achieve an alcohol reward for 15 consecutive min. The dependent measure is the breakpoint, defined as the value of the last completed (reinforced) ratio. The breakpoint under a PR schedule is considered to reflect the motivation of the animal to self-administer a drug.\n35\u201338\n\nPost-TBI behavioral assessments\nAnimals underwent behavioral testing to assess spatial memory, anxiety-like behavior, and mechanosensitivity on non-drinking days post-TBI. These behavioral assessments were conducted at least 24\u2009h after the last alcohol self-administration session to minimize the effects of alcohol on behavioral measures.\nSpatial memory was assessed 3 days post-TBI using the Y-maze as previously described.\n39\nNovelty was guided by distinct spatial cues set up around the testing room. The Y-maze had three arms (61\u2009\u00d7\u200914\u2009\u00d7\u200935\u2009cm) that extended from a central platform at a 120-degree angle. Each rat was placed in the middle of the maze and allowed to move freely in the three arms of the maze during a 10-min testing period. An arm entry was defined as the entry of four paws into one arm. The sequence of the arm entries was recorded using video tracking software (ANY-maze, Stoelting Co.). Alternation was defined as entry into each of the three different arms per overlapping triplet set. The percentage of spontaneous alternation was calculated as the ratio of the actual to possible alternations (defined as the total number of arm entries minus 2) multiplied by 100:\nData were analyzed via one-sample\nt\ntest against chance performance (50% spontaneous alternation) using Prism 5 (GraphPad Software).\nAnxiety-like behavior was assessed 7 days post-TBI using the open field test. Each animal had 5\u2009min to explore a black open field. A video camera mounted on the ceiling directly above the open field box wirelessly transmitted video to a computer in the lab and recorded each test. Behavior was later scored by an observer blind to the treatment. The amount of time each rat spent exploring the center (defined by leaving the peripheral layer of boxes on the checkerboard patterned floor) versus the periphery (the layer of boxes along the wall) was quantified. Data are expressed as percent time in center (seconds in center divided by 300). Decreased time spent in the center of the open field is interpreted as anxiety-like behavior.\nMechanosensitivity testing was conducted once 24\u2009h before TBI (baseline) and again 10 days post-injury. Evaluation of paw withdrawal thresholds was performed according to methods described previously.\n40\nBriefly, rats were acclimated for 15\u2009min in elevated cages with a wire mesh floor. A series of Von Frey filaments were applied perpendicularly to the plantar surface of the hindpaw for 3\u2009sec. A sharp withdrawal of the hindpaw indicated a positive response. The mechanical intensity of the stimulus was incrementally increased until a positive response was obtained, then decreased until a negative result was observed to determine a pattern of responses to apply to the statistical method of Dixon.\n41\nThe 50% paw withdrawal threshold was determined by the formula Xf + k\u03b4, where Xf\u2009=\u2009last Von Frey filament employed, k\u2009=\u2009Dixon value corresponding to response pattern, and \u03b4\u2009=\u2009mean difference between stimuli. Baseline mechanical nociceptive thresholds were similar to those reported for the ages of rats employed in this study.\n42\n\nWestern blot analysis\nAnimals were sacrificed by decapitation under isoflurane anesthesia 2 weeks post-TBI, and brains were excised, flash frozen, and analyzed as previously described.\n43\nVentral striatum and central amygdala punches were obtained from 0.5-mm frozen coronal brain slices and homogenized by sonication in lysis buffer (320\u2009mM sucrose, 5\u2009mM 4(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid [HEPES], 1\u2009mM egtazic acid [EGTA], 1\u2009mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA], and 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate [SDS], with protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails II and III diluted 1:100; Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and 20-\u03bcg protein samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) on 4\u201315% gradient acrylamide gels before transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Membranes were blocked then incubated in primary antibody overnight against phosphorylated glutamate receptor subunit 1 at Ser845 (pGluR1\nS845\n, diluted 1:1000 in 5% non-fat milk; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), or phosphorylated glucocorticoid receptor at Ser211/232 (pGR\nS211\n[human]/pGR\n232\n[rat], diluted 1:1000; Cell Signaling).\nMembranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000; Bio-Rad) for 1\u2009h at room temperature and chemiluminescence was detected (SuperSignal West Pico; Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Blots were stripped for 20\u2009min (Restore; Thermo Scientific) and re-probed for total protein levels of GluR1 (1:2500; Cell Signaling) and GR (1:1000; Thermo Fisher). Immunoreactivity was quantified using ImageJ, and the ratio of phosphoprotein to total protein for each sample was calculated for statistical comparison.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical differences were determined by either Student's\nt\ntest, one-sample\nt\ntest (for Y-maze), one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), or two-way repeated measures ANOVA (for Von Frey) using GraphPad Prism 5.0 statistical software (Graphpad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA), as indicated in each figure legend. Post hoc tests for multiple comparisons were utilized when appropriate, as indicated in the text. Statistical significance was set at\np\n<\u20090.05. Behavioral studies were conducted (using\nn\n=\u20098\u201310 animals per experimental group), and western blot analysis was completed with a subset of those experimental groups (\nn\n=\u20094\u20136 per group)."

Animals were housed in IVC cages with\nad libitum\naccess to food and water. All procedures were performed in accord with the guidelines of the Office of Responsible Research Practices and with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Kentucky.\n\nSpinal cord injury\nA 75-kdyn, T9, mid-thoracic contusion SCI was produced using the Infinite Horizons (IH) injury device (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, Fairfax Station, VA)\n18\nas described in detail previously.\n14\nBriefly, a T9 laminectomy was performed under intraperitoneal (i.p.)-delivered anesthetic (ketamine [100\u2009mg/kg] and xylazine [10\u2009mg/kg]). Animals then received SCI with the IH device. Spinal cord displacement values (T\u2009=\u20091.4;\ndf\n=\u200912;\np\n=\u20090.20; male, 704.7\u2009\u00b1\u200942.7\u2009\u03bcm; female, 635.8\u2009\u00b1\u200928.5\u2009\u03bcm) and impact force values (T\u2009=\u20090.28;\ndf\n=\u200912;\np\n=\u20090.78; male, 77.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.0 kdyn; female, 78.13\u2009\u00b1\u20090.48 kydn) were not significantly different between sexes, ensuring that injury biomechanics did not differ between males and females. After surgery, animals received one subcutaneous injection of buprenorphine-SR (1\u2009mg/kg) for pain and 2\u2009mL of saline + antibiotic (5\u2009mg/kg, enrofloxacin 2.27%; Norbook Inc, Lenexa, KS) and then were housed in warming cages overnight. SCI animals continued to receive 1\u2009mL of saline + prophylactic enrofloxacin subcutaneously daily for 5 days. Bladder expression was performed on injured mice twice-daily until mice reached voluntary evacuation.\n\nHeat hyperalgesia\nHeat hyperalgesia was assessed using a unilateral hindpaw withdrawal test as described previously.\n9\n,\n19\nAnimals were first acclimated to the testing apparatus (glass surface within an acrylic enclosure). The plantar surface of each hindpaw was individually exposed to an infrared intensity of 25 units, and the latency to a unilateral hindpaw withdrawal response (e.g., jumping, licking, and flicking) was automatically recorded. The animal was immediately removed after the withdrawal response or at a cutoff of 30\u2009sec to avoid tissue injury. Average latency of both hindpaws is reported for each time point.\n\nExperimental design\nInvestigators blinded to experimental groups performed all data acquisition and analyses. Data from 15 mice (8 females and 7 males) are reported in the current study. One male was excluded from the study based upon\na priori\nexclusion criteria of an abnormal time versus force curve (indicative of a bone hit at the time of SCI). A second male died at the time of injury (the impact curve indicated spinal cord movement with excessive displacement) and was immediately replaced. Within-subject crossover studies were utilized to evaluate the effect of pioglitazone (initiated at 10 weeks post injury with a 1-week washout) or azithromycin (initiated at 13 weeks post-injury with a 1-week washout). Order of treatment was randomized for each subject within balanced treatment groups. PIO (10\u2009mg/kg, i.p.; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) or vehicle (saline) was administered at a 10-mL/kg volume after development of chronic heat hypersensitivity (10 or 11 weeks post-SCI). Next, at 13 weeks post-injury, we administered AZM (160\u2009mg/kg, oral gavage [o.g.], generated by crushing Zithromax tablets and suspending in 1% methylcellulose) or vehicle (1% methylcellulose) in a 0.1-mL volume. We chose a 10-mg/kg PIO dose based upon its effectiveness in reducing mechanical hypersensitivity in male rats in a spared nerve injury model of pain.\n11\nThe 160-mg/kg AZM dose used in the current study reduces intraspinal inflammation and improves recovery in female mice after SCI.\n14\n,\n15\nFor both studies, thermal hyperalgesia was measured every 30\u2009min until antihyperalgesic effects of PIO or AZM had resolved.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were completed using GraphPad Prism software (version 7.0; GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA).

The present study included patients seen at the emergency department (ED) across 10 of 11 study sites between March 2014 and May 2016. (Participants from one study site were excluded from this report following the TRACK-TBI Data Acquisition and Quality Committee's assessment that the GOSE was not administered according to standard study procedures.) Included subjects for this report were participants with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13\u201315 upon admission to the ED, for whom a clinical head CT scan was obtained, and for whom complete data were collected for all study measures at the scheduled 2-week and 3-month follow-up points.

GCS, Glasgow Coma Scale; GOSE, Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended;\nComparisons between the final sample and those potential participants not selected for inclusion (per the criteria described above) demonstrated no significant group differences between included and excluded subjects in terms of age, sex, racial background, CT findings (i.e., positive or negative), presence or absence of a premorbid psychiatric diagnosis, or average ED-admission GCS score (all\np\ns\u2009>\u20090.088). As such, the subjects included in this study are thought to be largely representative of the overall TRACK-TBI study's participant pool. The great majority (79.4%) of included participants had ED-admission GCS scores of 15, and most (70.4%) evidenced negative CT findings (i.e., results not indicative of intracranial abnormalities). Thus, this report's sample was primarily composed of patients who had sustained mTBIs unaccompanied by intracranial abnormalities on CT. Nearly one quarter (23.2%) of participants reported a psychiatric history (i.e., the presence of at least one pre-injury psychiatric diagnosis); as such, and given this variable's demonstrated role in predicting post-mTBI symptoms, psychiatric history was included as a covariate in our statistical analyses as described below.\n\nMeasures\nDepression and anxiety\nThese domains of psychological dysfunction were assessed by the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) 18-item version (BSI-18),\n21\nan abbreviated adaptation of the original BSI.\n22\nThis measure includes subscales representing depression, anxiety, and somatization, of which the former two (henceforth \u201cBSI-depression\u201d and \u201cBSI-anxiety\u201d) were utilized here. BSI-18 scores included for the present study were standardized T-scores derived from normative data for this measure,\n21\nfacilitating a descriptive evaluation of depression and anxiety symptom levels within this sample of mTBI patients as compared with symptom levels typically observed among the general population.\nFunctional status\nThe GOSE,\n23\na widely used measure of global outcome after TBI, was administered to study participants to assess their functional status at both time points post-injury. This measure provides a classification of an individual's functional status on an 8-point scale ranging from 1 (\u201cdead\u201d) to 8 (\u201cupper good recovery\u201d). The GOSE can be administered so as to assess functional limitations attributed to TBI alone (GOSE-TBI) or attributed to the TBI plus other system injuries sustained in the same event (GOSE-all). In order to isolate the specific context of recovery after mTBI, the GOSE-TBI score was utilized to represent functional status for the present study.\n\nStatistical analysis\nCross-lagged panel analyses were conducted using a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework\n24\nvia the LISREL software package (version 8.80; Scientific Software International, Inc., Chicago, IL).\n25\nSEM was chosen over the alternative approach utilizing a series of standard multiple regressions to allow for statistical comparisons between cross-variable predictive impacts over time. Two separate models were specified, one each to test the reciprocal predictive impacts of 1) depressive symptoms and functional status and 2) symptoms of anxiety and functional status. All parameters were estimated by maximum likelihood estimation.\nThe first of these models (model 1, represented in\nFig. 2\n) was structured such that independent variables included GOSE-TBI and BSI-depression scores at 2 weeks post-injury, dependent variables included the same measures at 3-month follow-up, and the longitudinal predictive effects of both independent variables on both dependent variables were evaluated. Additionally, as is customary in cross-lagged panel analysis,\n10\n,\n24\ncross-sectional associations between variables (i.e., between GOSE-TBI and BSI-depression scores at 2-week follow-up and between the same at 3-month follow-up) were also evaluated. Because SEM approaches do not permit the specification of dependent variables to correlate directly, the error (\u201cdisturbance\u201d) terms for the GOSE-TBI and BSI-depression subscale at 3 months post-injury were specified to correlate instead, as in other cross-lagged panel models tested via SEM.\n12\n,\n13\nCovariates, including age, sex, CT findings (negative or positive), and the presence or absence of a premorbid psychiatric diagnosis, were also included in this model as predictors of GOSE-TBI and BSI-depression scores at 3 months and correlated with these variables at 2-week follow-up. (Of note, the inclusion of pre-injury psychiatric history allowed for the evaluation of the predictive relationships among symptoms of depression and anxiety and functional status above and beyond any impacts of possessing a pre-morbid psychiatric diagnosis. Preliminary runs of these models without pre-injury psychiatric history as a covariate yielded highly similar results.) A second model was tested that was identical to the first, except with BSI-anxiety scores substituted in place of the BSI-depression subscale (model 2; see\nFig. 3\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nCross-lagged panel analysis model for depression and functional status (model 1).

BSI, Brief Symptom Inventory.\nOf particular interest in each model were the cross-variable longitudinal effects\u2014that is, those that reflected the predictive impacts of symptoms of depression or anxiety on functional status over time and those that represented the reverse impacts. A common approach for comparing the strength of distinct predictive effects (\u201cpaths\u201d) in SEM is to estimate a model wherein the paths of interest are specified to be equal in strength, with the overall fit of this equality-constrained model then compared to the fit of the original model in which the relevant paths were permitted to vary freely. This methodology was used in a previous study evaluating the association between psychological symptoms and functional limitations among moderately to severely brain-injured patients, with findings demonstrating that the impact of functional limitations on depression and anxiety over time was significantly stronger than the reverse predictive effect.\n12\nHowever, as statistical methods researchers have pointed out,\n26\nthis approach can be problematic when the variables of interest are measured by differing scales, as is the case for the GOSE and BSI. In short, this presents an issue because it results in comparisons between effects that are represented in disparate units of variance, a form of false comparison that can lead to untrustworthy results.\n26\nTherefore, instead of utilizing overall model fit comparisons that could be subject to this confounding effect, direct comparisons were made between paths of interest using phantom variable nonlinear constraints.\n27\n,\n28\nThis approach allowed for the evaluation of an additional (\u201cphantom\u201d) parameter specified to reflect the difference between\nstandardized\npath coefficients (i.e., effects defined in shared standardized units) corresponding to the cross-variable paths of interest. Tests of these additional parameters were such that a model returning a statistically significant \u201cphantom\u201d parameter would indicate that the two paths of interest differed significantly from one another in strength, whereas a nonsignificant additional parameter would indicate that the two effects were not significantly different from one another. For the two cross-lagged panel models evaluated, this approach was used to compare the reciprocal predictive effects of depressive symptoms and functional status over time (model 1) and those of symptoms of anxiety and functional status over time (model 2).\nTo facilitate the use of SEM in evaluating the models described above, the GOSE-TBI was treated as a continuous variable to parallel the interval-scale BSI-depression and BSI-anxiety scores. This is consistent with previous cross-lagged panel analysis studies of functional status and psychological concerns, which have specified continuous variables so as to evaluate linear predictive effects over time.\n11\n,\n13\nNonetheless, because it was uncertain how specifying GOSE-TBI scores as a continuous indicator might affect results, sensitivity analyses were conducted wherein the models above were tested with GOSE-TBI scores dichotomized at cutpoints of 7 or below and 6 or below representing poor outcome. Results for models specified with each of these dichotomization points were then compared with those of the primary study models described above in order to establish the extent to which evaluating GOSE-TBI scores as a continuous variable might affect findings."

    "Methods": "Animals\nFigure 1A\nsummarizes the number of animals in different treatment groups. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (\nn\n=\u200939, 12 weeks old at the time of TBI, weight 330\u2009\u00b1\u200919\u2009g, median 329\u2009g, range 299\u2013384\u2009g; Envigo Laboratories B.V., Melderslo, the Netherlands) were randomized by lottery to either the sham-operated experimental control (\nn\n=\u20096) or TBI group (\nn\n=\u200933). In addition, 12\u2009na\u00efve rats were included in the analysis to assess the effect of electrode implantation on post-operation EEG. The animals were housed in individual cages in a controlled environment (temperature, 22\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C, humidity 50\u201360%, lights on 07:00\u201319:00) and had free access to food and water. All the experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Provincial Government of Southern Finland and performed in accordance with the guidelines of the European Community Council Directives 2010/63/EU.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nAnimal numbers, electrode montage, and perilesional pathology during the first week after lateral fluid-percussion injury.\n(A)\nA flow-chart of the study that shows the number of animals in each group, at each phase.\n(B)\nElectrode montage used for the present analysis.

No EEG during the first 3 days after sham-operation or fluid-percussion injury. EEG, electroencephalography; TBI, traumatic brain injury. Color image is available online.\n\nLateral FPI-induced TBI\nTBI was induced by lateral FPI.\n8\n,\n13\nBriefly, the rats were placed on a heating pad and body temperature was continuously monitored using a rectal probe (maximum temperature was set to 38\u00b0C). Anesthesia was induced using 5% isoflurane (room air as carrier gas) and maintained with 1.9% isoflurane (Somnosuite # SS6069B; Kent Scientific). Each rat was then mounted into a stereotaxic frame with lambda and bregma at the same horizontal level. To monitor the physiologic parameters (pulse distension, heart rate, arterial O\n2\nsaturation), a foot sensor (MouseOxPlus # 72\u20138019; Starr Life Science Corp.) was clipped to the right hindpaw, and monitoring was started. Lidocaine (200\u2009\u03bcL, 5\u2009mg/mL, subcutaneously [s.c.]; Orion Pharma) was injected over the planned incision, and 3\u20135\u2009min later a midline scalp incision was made. A craniotomy (diameter 5\u2009mm) centered over the left cortex (center coordinate: anteroposterior (AP) \u22124.5\u2009mm from bregma; mediolateral (ML) 2.5\u2009mm) was performed using a hand-held trephine (#18004-50; Fine Science Tools GmbH, Germany). Care was taken to leave the dura intact and remove all bone fragments from the dural surface.\nThen, a plastic female Luer Lock connector made from an 18\u2009G needle hub was inserted into the craniotomy vertical to the skull surface, and its edges were carefully sealed with tissue adhesive (3M Vetbond; 3M Deutschland GmbH, Germany). The Luer Lock connector was anchored to the skull with dental acrylate (Selectaplus powder #10009210; Selectaplus liquid CN #D10009102; DeguDent, Germany) that also surrounded the frontally inserted anchoring dental screw (\u00f8 1\u2009mm, #BN82213; Bossard). TBI was induced with a fluid-percussion device equipped with a straight tip (Model FP 302; AmScience Instruments, Richmond, VA). The pressure level was adjusted to produce severe TBI with an expected post-impact mortality rate of 20\u201330% within the first 48\u2009h.\n19\nThe occurrence of acute behavioral post-impact seizures and duration of apnea were monitored. Immediately after impact, the rat was removed from the device and placed on a heating pad. The dental cement, screw, and Luer Lock were detached from the skull. Time to righting was recorded.\nSham-operated experimental controls underwent all surgical procedures, including craniotomy, but were not exposed to FPI. Na\u00efve animals underwent surgical procedures for electrode implantation only (no craniotomy).\n\nElectrode implantation\nTo monitor the occurrence of electrographic seizures or status epilepticus (SE) during the acute post-TBI phase, the rats were mounted in a stereotaxic frame after the righting reflex returned, and re-anesthetized with isoflurane for electrode implantation as described above. In addition, electrodes were implanted in 12 na\u00efve rats to monitor the effect of surgery and electrode implantation on EEG.\nElectrode locations are summarized in\nFigure 1B\n. Four stainless steel epidural screw electrodes (EM12/20/SPC; PlasticsOne Inc.) were implanted in the skull, two ipsilaterally and two contralaterally. The epidural electrodes were positioned as follows: frontal cortex C3 (AP: \u22121.7;\u2009ML: left 2.5) and C4 (AP: right 1.7;\u2009ML: \u22122.5); parieto-occipital cortex O1 (AP: \u22127. 6;\u2009ML: left 2.5) and O2 (AP: \u22127.6;\u2009ML: right 2.5). In addition, three tungsten bipolar electrodes (EM12/3-2TW/SPC; Plastics One Inc.; tip separation 1.0\u2009mm) were implanted in the ipsilateral perilesional cortex and one was implanted in the ipsilateral septal hippocampus. Positions of the lower tips of the intracerebral electrodes were: anterior perilesional cortex (AP: \u22121.72; ML: \u22124.0;\u2009DV: 1.8), hippocampus (AP: \u22123.0;\u2009ML: \u22121.4;\u2009DV: 3.6), and posterior perilesional cortex (AP: \u22127.56;\u2009ML: \u22124.0;\u2009DV: 1.8). One epidural stainless steel screw electrode placed ipsilaterally posterior to lambda served as a ground and another placed contralaterally served as a reference electrode (\nFig. 1B\n). The electrodes were soldered to a multi-pin connector (MS12P; Plastics One Inc.), according to a monopolar referential montage. The whole assembly was then secured to the skull with dental acrylic.\nSham-operated experimental controls underwent similar electrode implantation procedures as TBI animals. Six of the 12\u2009na\u00efve rats were implanted with epidural electrodes (four recording electrodes, ground, and reference), and the remaining six animals with similar 12-electrode setup to the TBI and sham-operated control rats (\nFig. 1B\n).\n\nPost-impact monitoring and care\nBuprenorphine (0.05\u2009mg/kg, s.c.; Orion Pharma, Finland) was administered for post-operative analgesia after the electrode implantation, at 24\u2009h post-surgery, and thereafter based on assessment of the animal's well-being. Rats received a powdered pellet diet (\nad libitum\n) and 10\u2009mL of 0.9% NaCl (twice a day, s.c.) for the first 3 days after FPI or until able to eat solid pellets and drink on their own. Physiologic parameters related to induction of the impact and electrode implantation were monitored during the surgeries. Arterial oxygen saturation (SpO\n2\n), heart rate and pulse distension were monitored before and after the impact for 5\u2009min. Daily monitoring of animal's well-being included assessing the weight, temperature, signs of any disease or discomfort, general appearance (hair, coat and skin abnormalities), bowel and gastrointestinal function, body condition score, and external bleeding (if any).\n20\n\nVideo-EEG recording\nImmediately after the electrode implantation, each rat was placed in a custom designed Plexiglas EEG recording chamber (29 [wide]\u2009\u00d7\u200944 [length]\u2009\u00d7\u200950 [height] cm; one rat per chamber). The electrode headset in the rat skull was connected to a 12-pin swivel commutator (SL12C; PlasticsOne Inc.) via a flexible shielded cable (M12C-363/2; PlasticsOne Inc.), allowing the rat to move freely during the EEG recordings. The commutator was connected to an amplifier using a flexible shielded cable 363/2-441/12 (PlasticsOne Inc.). High-definition electrical brain activity was monitored using a 320-channel Digital Lynx 16SX amplifier (Neuralynx) with a 10-kHz sampling rate. The amplifier had an analog bandwidth between 0.01\u2009Hz to 80\u2009kHz. It had 80 independent analog references, allowing for a configuration of independent references for each animal. Data from each channel were converted individually into 24 bits.\nEach animal was video-monitored with a single high-resolution camera (Basler acA1300-75gm GigE; Basler, Germany) that was configured to record 30 frames per sec (fps; maximum 75\u2009fps) with a resolution of 1.3 megapixels, and compressed using H.264. At night, cameras recorded under cage-specific infrared illumination (24\u2009V, 150\u2009mA). The EEG and video were synchronized at nanosecond resolution, using the precision time protocol IEEE-1588. The entire system generated approximately 1.5 TB of data every 24\u2009h. For data storage, the video-EEG system was connected to a network attached storage comprising 200 TB of storage configured to RAID6 for data redundancy.\n\nVideo-EEG analysis\nEEG recorded with epidural screw electrodes was used for the analysis. Each video-EEG raw data file was imported to Spike2 and analyzed visually by browsing through 30-sec recording epochs on the computer screen using the Spike2 analysis program (version 9: CED, UK).\nThe association of various behavioral manifestations with different epileptiform EEG patterns was analyzed from time-locked videos. Severity of behavioral seizures was scored according to Racine\n21\n: Score 0\u2014wandering, walking around the cage (e.g., towards food); Score 1\u2014facial movements (eye-blinking, chewing, facial muscle twitches); Score 2\u2014head nodding and clonus of one of the extremities; Score 3\u2014bilateral forelimb clonus; Score 4\u2014forelimb clonus with rearing; Score 5\u2014score 4 and falling.\n\nEEG power spectrum\nFour EEG channels (C3, C4, O1, O2) were selected to generate power spectrograms of representative epileptiform EEG activities in Spike2. Spike2 uses a fast-Fourier transform, a mathematical device that transforms a time series to the frequency base. To generate the heat maps from selected periods of recordings, we used an in-house created script in Spike2 (v9.02).\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe data analysis was performed using Graph Pad Prism (5.0) and R (version 3.4.2)\n22\nwith RStudio (version 1.1.383).\n23\nDistribution normality was tested with the Shapiro-Wilk normality test, and correlations were calculated using Spearman's correlation. The differences in physiologic measures between the animal groups were tested using the independent t-test or Mann-Whitney U Test. Differences between pre-impact and post-impact measures were assessed using the paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Seizure-related differences were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by\npost hoc\nanalysis with Dunn's multiple comparison test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by\npost hoc\nanalysis with Tukey's multiple comparison test. The difference was considered significant at\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "This report is reported according to the STROBE statement for cohort studies.9\n\nStudy design and participants\nThis subsidiary study was based on a multi-center prospective cohort study conducted by the British Neurosurgical Trainee Research Collaborative. Study design has been described in the protocol\n10\nand the primary report.\n11\nIn brief, 26 participating neurosurgical units identified and enrolled eligible participants between May 2013 and January 2014. Inclusion criteria were patients >16 years of age referred to a participating neurosurgical unit (NSU) with a CSDH confirmed on neuroimaging. We defined CSDH radiologically as a predominantly hypodense, isodense, or mixed-density subdural collection. We excluded patients with secondary CSDH attributed to underlying pathologies (e.g., subdural empyema, vascular malformations, and aneurysm). Details of antithrombotic medication and management of coagulation were available only in patients who were transferred to an NSU, so we restricted our analysis to this cohort. All participating NSUs received local clinical governance approval.\n\nBaseline and outcome variables\nData included demographics, medical comorbidities, history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) within 3 months before referral, pre-operative functional status as per the modified Rankin scale (mRS), pre-operative Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), management of pre-operative coagulation (use of platelet transfusion, vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma, and clotting factors), operative characteristics, pre-operative maximal thickness of CSDH, and post-operative bed rest. Decision to offer surgical management of CSDH was at the discretion of each NSU after clinical assessment.\nOutcome variables included recurrence, functional outcome as mRS, thromboembolic events, and death. We defined recurrence as symptomatic and radiologically confirmed recurrent subdural collection requiring a repeat surgery within 60 days of index surgery. Discharge mRS score and persistent functional impairment were the functional outcomes. Persistent functional impairment is defined as same or lower mRS score at discharge compared with pre-operative mRS. Vaso-occlusive events included venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus), ischemic stroke, and myocardial infarction (type not specified) during admission. Inpatient deaths were recorded.\n\nData sources\nWe identified eligible patients prospectively using local referral databases and operating theatre log books. Data collection of baseline and outcome variables was carried out prospectively. We submitted and stored the study data in a secure online database (Outcome Registry Intervention and Operation Network) that complies with UK government policies according to the Department of Health Information Governance and the Health and Social Care Information Centre.\n\nBias and sample size\nThe multicenter prospective study, from which this substudy is derived, was designed with clear eligibility criteria, recruited from a representative population, and minimized selection bias. A pre-defined and published study protocol reduced misclassification of baseline and outcome variables. A comprehensive set of variables allowed for control of confounders. This aim of the primary study was to describe the contemporary management and outcomes of patients with CSDH, and therefore no sample size calculation was performed.\n\nStatistical analysis\nWe included patients with missing data in the analysis, when possible, and excluded them if the relevant data were missing for the particular analysis. The main comparison groups were patients using antithrombotic drugs on admission and patients without antithrombotic drugs. We conducted comparisons of baseline characteristics using chi-squared/Fisher's exact tests, where appropriate. Ordinal variables (e.g., mRS, GCS) were compared using non-parametric tests. Because of the non-Gaussian distribution of parametric data, the Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparisons in these variables. We used chi-squared test for univariate analysis of outcome variables. We conducted Cox regression and multiple logistic regression for multi-variate analysis for recurrence and functional outcome, respectively. Variables known to be associated with the outcome or found to be significantly different between the groups were entered into these multi-variate analyses. We restricted patients who underwent surgical management in the Cox regression analysis. Graphical hazard functions were generated from the Cox regression analyses. We performed paired analyses using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test on pre- and post-operative functional outcome. We used Stata software (version 13.0; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX) for all statistical analyses. A\np\nvalue of <0.05 denoted statistical significance."

Football players participating in H2H2 were enrolled at pre-season (baseline). Those sustaining a concussion (CS-SRC) completed neuroimaging sessions at 24\u201348\u2009h, 8 days, 15 days, and 45 days post-concussion. Control groups completed the same imaging studies and clinical outcome assessments at similar time points. The CS-Control group included healthy football players matched on level (high school vs. college), school, team, age, estimated pre-morbid intelligence, race, handedness, concussion history, and position. The NCS-Control group consisted of non-contact sport athletes without current or high school football exposure matched on level (high school or college), age, estimated pre-morbid intelligence, and race.\nH2H2 definition of concussion was based on the HEADS UP educational initiative from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: an injury resulting from a forceful bump, blow, or jolt to the head that results in rapid movement of the head and causes a change in the athlete's behavior, thinking, physical functioning, or the following symptoms: headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness/balance problems, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, drowsiness, sensitivity to light/noise, blurred vision, memory difficulty, and difficulty concentrating. Certified athletic trainers and/or team physicians at each institution identified and diagnosed concussion. Study investigators then screened and triaged injuries to confirm that they met study definition and requirements.\n\nParticipants: The National Collegiate Athletic Association/Department of Defense Concussion Assessment, Research and Education Consortium\nThe study design and methods of NCAA-DoD CARE Consortium have been previously detailed.\n16\nThe current work focuses on athletes enrolled in the CARE Advanced Research Core from sites in which the neuroimaging protocol is deployed. Athletes were enrolled at pre-season. Contact sport athletes sustaining a concussion (CS-SRC) participated in multiple follow-up visits. Neuroimaging data were collected at the following visits: within 24\u201348\u2009h post-injury, after clearance to begin the return-to-play progression (i.e., when asymptomatic), 7 days after unrestricted return to play, and 6 months post-injury. Non-injured athletes from contact sports (e.g., football, hockey; CS-Controls) and non-contact sports (e.g., baseball, softball; NCS-Control) were matched on institution, sport (CS-Controls), sex, race/ethnicity, estimate of pre-morbid intelligence, concussion history (CS-Controls), years of participation (CS-Controls), status as a starter (CS-Controls), and head impact exposure estimate or data, if available (CS-Controls), and participated in similar time points individually matched to the schedule of matched injured athletes. NCS-Control athletes from CARE were not excluded if they had previous contact sport exposure (e.g., in high school or college).\nConcussions were diagnosed by research and medical staff of each participating institution based on the following definition: \u201cA change in brain function following a force to the head, which may be accompanied by temporary loss of consciousness, but is identified in awake individuals with measures of neurologic and cognitive dysfunction.\u201d\n17\nData collection protocols for clinical and demographic information were matched between studies. Detailed information regarding demographics, health history, and injury history were obtained upon enrollment and subsequent follow-up visits for both studies. Socioeconomic status (SES) was estimated using the modified Hollingshead four-factor index.\n18\nInjury characteristics were also collected, including presence of loss of consciousness (LOC), post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), and retrograde amnesia (RGA).\n\nImaging parameters\nAnatomical images were acquired on 3 Tesla GE MR750 (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK), Siemens Tim Trio, or Siemens Prisma scanners (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). Clinical interpretations were performed on T\n1\n-weighted images, T\n2\n-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images, multi-echo gradient recalled echo sequences to yield T\n2\n*-weighted images and subsequent susceptibility-weighted images, and T\n2\n-weighted images (if available). Specific scan parameters and the protocols deployed at various sites are listed in\nTable 2\n.

Initial reviews of structural MRI scans were blinded to presence/absence of injury. Reviews of subsequent scans in participants with multiple sessions were not blinded to initial results to track progression of potential pathology. For the purposes of this study, an MRI abnormality was operationalized as any acute (i.e., injury related) or non-acute finding that prompted a recommendation for clinical follow-up.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software (version 21; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). Group differences in demographic data were assessed using independent-samples\nt\n-tests, chi-square tests, or Kruskal-Wallis tests. Seven participants were injured after participating in the study as a CS-Control and subsequently enrolled as CS-SRC; these visits are treated as independent samples. The primary outcome measure of interest was the presence of an MRI finding that prompted recommendation for clinical follow-up at any of the available visits (i.e., yes or no). Ratings across multiple scans were collapsed into a single measure to improve confidence in MRI finding (i.e., utilize strength of repeated scanning sessions). The only MRI finding to show progression or resolution in any participant across multiple scans was sinus abnormalities (1 CS-SRC, 1 CS-Control, and 1 NCS-Control). Single predictor logistic regression analyses were used to determine the relationship between demographic variables and presence of MRI findings. Finally, multiple predictor logistic regression models were used to assess for group differences (i.e., CS-SRC, CS-Control, and NCS-Control) while accounting for variance explained by predictors that were significantly associated with MRI findings."

    "Methods": "All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the Animal Care Committee regulations of Case Western Reserve University. Adult male (350.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091.54\u2009g; Harlan Laboratories Inc.) were housed in groups of three, exposed to a normal dark-light cycle with access to food, water, and environmental enrichmentad libitum. The health and welfare of the animals were monitored on a daily basis by the study investigators and veterinary staff at Case Western Reserve University. There were 53 animals included in the study, divided into six groups: either control or ChABC injected animals (1) injected one week after injury with terminal recordings at week three, (2) injected one week after injury with terminal recordings at week six, and (3) injected four weeks after injury with terminal recordings at week six.Figure 1Csummarizes the distribution of animals between groups for analysis.\n\nSurgical procedures and treatment application\nAnimals were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (70\u2009mg.kg\n\u2212\n1\n) and xylazine cocktail (7\u2009mg.kg\n\u2212\n1\n; intraperitoneally [IP]) for all surgical procedures. Carprofen (5\u2009mg/kg; subcutaneously [SC]) and 0.002% bupivacaine hydrochloride were applied before the start of the surgical procedure. Body temperature during all surgical procedures was maintained at 37\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C. After the completion of recovery operations, yohimbine (1.2\u2009mg/kg; SC; Tocris) was administered to reverse the respiratory dampening effect of the xylazine. Muscle layers were sutured using (3-0 polyglactin) and the skin closed with wound clips. Animals were given buprenorphine (30\u2009\u03bcg/kg; maintained for 5 d) and saline SC and recovered in a heated environment before transfer to their home cage.\nLeft lateral C3 contusion\nUsing sterile techniques and surgical antisepsis, the cervical spinal column was exposed through a 3\u2009cm midline, dorsal incision between C1 and C4, and subsequent retraction of the skin and paravertebral muscles. While preserving the facet joints and dura, a laminectomy was performed over C2-C3.\n13\nThe vertebral column was clamped around the C3-C3 lamina using the Infinite Horizon contusion impactor (Precision Systems and Instrumentation). Animals received a single 150\u2009kD left lateral contusion with zero dwell time and a 1.3\u2009mm diameter impact tip.\n13\nThe completeness of the injury was confirmed through cresyl violet staining.\nSpinal injections\nAnimals received an injection of either ChABC (20 U.mL\n\u2212\n1\n; Seikagaku) or a saline vehicle control with investigators blind to the treatment condition applied. Similar to the injury, using sterile techniques and surgical antisepsis, the cervical spinal column over C2-C5 was exposed through a 2\u2009cm midline, dorsal incision, and retraction of the skin and paravertebral muscles. The spinal cord was cleared of scar tissue over C2-C3, and a laminectomy was performed over C4-C5, then the dura cut in line with each of the dorsal roots. A pulled pipette attached to a Nanoject II (Drummond Scientific Company) was placed sequentially at the position of the dorsal roots and stereotaxically lowered to the level of the phrenic motor pool (\nFig. 1B\n; 1.1\u2009mm left of midline and 1.6\u2009mm ventral from the spinal cord dorsal surface). After a 5-min rest period, 250 nL (C2/3) or 350 nL (C4/5) of drug/vehicle was injected into the spinal cord. After a 5-min rest period, the pipette was removed.\n\nElectromyography (EMG) recordings and right lateral C2 hemisection\nRespiratory muscle EMG recordings\nAt pre-determined end-points, animals were anesthetized with urethane (1.6\u2009mg/kg; IP). Using sterile techniques and surgical antisepsis, a number of incisions were made to enable implantation of EMG electrodes: (1) a 5-cm laparotomy exposed the abdominal surface of the diaphragm; (2) lateral 2\u2009cm incisions were made over the left and right rib cage, with the latissimus dorsi blunt dissected to expose the external intercostals at T1 and T2; and (3) a 1\u2009cm midline incision at the throat exposing the genioglossus after retraction of the digastric muscle. Bipolar electrodes (platinum; Grass Technology, Middleton, WI) were implanted into: (1) the crural region (dorsal to the anterolateral branch of the inferior phrenic artery) of each hemidiaphragm; (2) the left and right external intercostals at T1; and (3) the left genioglossus muscle.\nThe EMG signal was amplified (gain 5000\u2009\u00d7\u2009; Quad-P5ll Amplifier; Grass Technology), band pass filtered (30\u20133,000\u2009Hz; Grass Technology), digitized, and recorded using the CED 1401 (Spike2; Cambridge Electronic Design). The integrated signal was rectified and smoothed at a time constant of 0.08\u2009sec. All EMG recordings were measured during eupneic breathing over a 60-sec period, with the animals performing a number of spontaneous deep breaths (sighs) over this time frame. While absolute amplitude of the recordings has been reported for completeness, data were normalized subsequently to the average amplitude of the sigh for each animal.\n37\n,\n38\nAmplitude was assessed in this way to ensure results were not biased by slight alterations in electrode placement within the muscle. This is a standard method for assessment of such recordings because sigh activity maximally recruits the motor fibers required for eupneic breathing (type I and IIa) and is a reliable measure for activity; sigh amplitude has been shown to be unchanged after injury.\n19\n,\n39\n,\n40\nRepresentative traces for all respiratory muscle EMG recordings can be seen in\nFigure 2A\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nIllustration of respiratory muscle electromyography (EMG) recordings after midcervical contusion injury and contralateral C2 hemisection. The EMG data are shown for the contralateral and ipsilateral hemidiaphragms, external intercostals (eICs), and ipsilateral genioglossus (relative to the site of the contusion injury) from a control animal four weeks after the initial trauma. (\nA\n) Some recovery in ipsilateral hemidiaphragm activity after contusion is evident and activity of the eIC not diminished by the spinal cord injury. (\nB\n) This activity, however, in the ipsilateral motor system after subchronic midcervical contusion is not sufficient to maintain respiratory motor function when the ipsilateral pathways are isolated through completion of a contralateral C2 hemisection (dashed line). Without the support of the contralateral respiratory motor system and pathways, activity in all respiratory muscles immediately ceases. All panels are recorded in the same animal and all measures relative to the contusion injury.\nContralateral C2 hemisection\nDuring end-point EMG recordings, a C2 hemisection contralateral to the contusion was performed.\n13\n,\n14\nThis acted to remove any descending input to the ipsilateral PMP from the contralateral side of the cord and brain stem and isolate breathing activity solely to contused pathways. Using sterile techniques and surgical antisepsis, the cervical spinal column was exposed through a 3\u2009cm midline, dorsal incision between C1 and C3, and subsequent retraction of the skin and paravertebral muscles. The C2 spinal cord was re-exposed using microscissors and a durotomy performed.\nWith a 21G needle, a right hemisection was performed at the level of the C2 dorsal roots. This process was repeated five times and extended from midline to the most lateral point of the spinal cord. The hemisection was always performed while EMG recordings were being conducted; as such, the functional completeness of the injury was confirmed through absence of activity on the right diaphragm EMG. Representative traces for all respiratory muscle EMG recordings during the C2 hemisection can be seen in\nFigure 2B\n. The time the animal continued to breath after completion of the C2 hemisection was calculated from the last peak of the right hemidiaphragm to the final peak of any other inspiratory muscle using the integrated response.\n\nImmunohistochemistry (IHC) and lesion volumetrics\nTissue collection\nAfter terminal recordings, animals were transcardially perfused with 0.1M phosphate buffered saline (PBS), followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; pH 7.4).\n41\nThe C1-C5 spinal segments were post-fixed overnight at 4\u00b0C, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose for 72\u2009h at 4\u00b0C, and embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Leica). Tissue was collected using the dorsal roots as landmarks and collected as a function of distance from the lesion site to ensure accuracy and consistency in analysis. Serial cryostat spinal cord cross-sections (20\u2009\u03bcm) were mounted on slides.\nLesion volumetrics\nSpinal cord lesion volume was analyzed through iron eriochrome cyanine and 1% cresyl violet staining (Sigma). After imaging (Leica SCN400 Slide Scanner), the lesioned, white and gray matter areas in each section were determined automatically (Photoshop CC7, Adobe). The graft volume was assessed using the equation: V\u2009=\u2009\u03a3 (transplant area\u2009\u00d7\u2009section thickness\u2009\u00d7\u200918 [the number of sections in each sampling interval]).\n42\nIHC\nFive sections from each segmental level were assessed. The phrenic motor nucleus is located in the mediolateral ventral horn from C3-C6 and is easily recognized as a tight cluster of large motoneurons.\n43\nIt is at around the putative area of the PMP that all analysis was conducted. Sections were washed, blocked (10% normal goat serum, 0.1% bovine serum albumin in tris-buffered saline), then incubated overnight in primary antibody at 4\u00b0C. The next day, sections were washed and incubated in the appropriate secondary antibody for 2h at room temperature. After washing, sections were coverslipped using Fluorogold mounting medium (Invitrogen) and viewed using a fluorescence microscope (Leica). The 2B6 was purchased from Seikagaku, serotonin (5HT) from Immunostar, and neuronal nuclei (NeuN) from Millipore. All secondary antibodies were purchased from Life Technologies.\n\nData analysis\nAll experiments were assessed under blinded conditions. All animals in each group underwent treatment (drug or control) application, EMG recordings, contralateral hemisection, and histological analysis of lesion volumetrics. Power analysis was conducted before all experiments to ensure\nn\nnumbers were sufficient to yield reliable data. Data were subjected to the Shapiro-Wilk test for normalcy before analysis to ensure a normal distribution. No animal was excluded from data analysis based on functional output or lesion size. The parameters were compared between control and the test groups through one-way or two-way analysis of variance with\npost-hoc\nBonferroni test (SPSS or GraphPad Prism). Significance values represented as *\u2009=\np\n<\u20090.05, **\u2009=\np\n<\u20090.01, ***\u2009=\np\n<\u20090.001. Data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM)."

    "Methods": "Definitions and assumptions\nWe elected to analyze moderate and mild TBI separately, because most authorities treat them differently. Standard treatment for patients with moderate TBI is hospital admission, usually to a specialized nursing unit and accompanied by routine head CT. In contrast, hospital admission for mild TBI is usually reserved for patients with risk factors identified on examination and/or a positive CT scan. We define moderate TBI as a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 9\u201313. Although traditionally defined as scores of 9\u201312,\n11\nthere is evidence that a score of 13 is more properly included in the moderate category,\n12\nand most recent studies of moderate TBI\n13\u201320\nuse the latter definition. By exclusion, mild TBI is limited to GCS scores 14\u201315. We took as our base case a 20-year-old male, but also investigated 40-, 60-, and 80-year old males and females.\n\nLiterature search\nPubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane database were searched in February 2018 for the subject heading \u201chead injury,\u201d associated with \u201cmild\u201d or \u201cmoderate\u201d or \u201cminor\u201d in the title published since 1980. Abstracts were screened, and inappropriate articles were excluded. The rest were downloaded as full text and reviewed by at least two authors. We excluded studies involving animals, those not published in English, those with too few cases (100 for moderate TBI, 250 for mild), those in which fewer than 80% of qualifying patients received CT scans, and those lacking original data (reviews, editorials, duplicate publications, intracranial lesions not reported, etc.). The search returned 3240 abstracts, 22 of which were used in various analyses of the study. The review process is summarized in\nFigure 1\n. Because all data come from non-analytic studies, by definition they all represent Level III evidence.\n21\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSummary of literature search.\n\nData management and analysis\nWe abstracted estimates of the probability of intracranial lesions, the cost of a CT scan, and the operating characteristics (sensitivity and specificity) of clinical screening tests and the BTI.\n6\nThe reported point estimates of pooled data represent variance-weighted means (random-effects meta-analytic model) of observational data\n22\nand were tested for heterogeneity. Models and additional data required for analysis are discussed below. Uncertainties of the point estimates were addressed using one- to three-way sensitivity analyses, in which values of all parameters were varied within their 95% confidence intervals. All costs are calculated from a societal perspective, and costs are expressed in 2018 dollars. Point estimates were generated using Stata 12 (StataCorp, College Station, TX), and analyses of the model employed TreeAge Pro 2017 (Tree Age Software, Inc., Williamstown, MA).\n\nMild TBI\nBiomarker screening test\nThe model assumes that positive screening tests result in the performance of a CT scan and prompt treatment of positive findings; negative screening will result in hospital discharge. Possible outcomes of biomarker or clinical screening are discussed in the\nSupplementary Appendix\n; see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n.\nClinical decision rules\nA number of clinical decision rules have been introduced to assist in the decision about CT scans for patients with mild TBI.\n5\n,\n23\u201327\nEach rule uses slightly different clinical indicators for the risk of intracranial lesions; thus, all have different operating characteristics. For our model, we employed the Canadian CT Head rule.\n5\nThe model\nIllustrated in\nFigure 2\n, the model compares four different management strategies for deciding whether to perform a CT scan on a patient presenting after mild TBI. These strategies are outlined in the\nSupplementary Appendix\n; see online supplementary material at\nwww.liebertpub.com\n. The various pathways and outcomes following implementation of a treatment strategy are illustrated in\nFigure 3\n. These are discussed in more detail in the\nSupplementary Appendix\n. We assume all patients found to have surgical lesions are treated aggressively. Outcomes reflect the negative effects of delayed surgery, including increased death and morbidity (and increased associated costs). A proportion of patients with non-surgical lesions will recover at home. The rest will return to the hospital and incur additional testing, observation, and treatment.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nDecision tree for initial testing in mild traumatic brain injury: summarizes four management strategies and decision-making.

GOS (Glasgow Outcome Scale) score (5 good outcome; 4 moderate disability; 3 severe disability; 2 vegetative state; 1 dead).\nAnalysis\nWe abstracted the probabilities of surgical and non-surgical lesions, the other probabilities listed in\nFigure 4\n, as the operating characteristics (sensitivity and specificity) of the four management strategies from our literature search. We obtained the 2017 life expectancy of a 20-year-old male from the Social Security Administration\n28\nfor patients who had no lesion, non-surgical lesions, and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores of 4 or 5 after operation. We adjusted life expectancies downward for patients with GOS of 2 or 3 after surgical procedure to reflect GOS-specific mortality rates.\n29\u201332\nLong-term quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)\n33\nwere calculated based on the six-month GOS scores, which were assumed to last for the remainder of life expectancy. A description of QALYs and how they are calculated can be found in the\nSupplementary Appendix\n; see online supplementary material at\nwww.liebertpub.com\n. Calculations follow those used in our previous study of diagnostic screening for mild TBI.\n34\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 4.\nDecision tree for initial testing in moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI): all pathways and outcomes are shown. CT, computed tomography.\nAn additional sensitivity analysis for effectiveness involved Monte Carlo simulation,\n35\nin which all parameters follow beta distributions. We simulated 100 trials, each with 100 subjects in each group. We compared the results using one-way analysis of variance. Lacking the cost of the Banyan Brain Trauma Indicator, we were unable to perform Monte Carlo simulations of cost or cost-effectiveness.\nCosts\nIn the case of mild TBI, we analyzed lifetime direct and indirect societal costs for a 20-year-old male. Medicare reimbursements were used as proxies for direct (medical) costs.\n36\nRehabilitation and nursing care costs for survivors were calculated,\n37\nas were short- (first six months) and long-term indirect costs (lost productivity).\n38\nWe employed an overall discount rate of 3% per year and converted all costs to 2018 values.\n39\nDetails of the cost calculations can be found in Whitmore and associates.\n40\n\nModerate TBI\nCalculations for moderate TBI are much simpler. For the purposes of this analysis, we assume all moderately injured patients are admitted to a special care unit. This allows for frequent nursing checks and rapid access to CT scanning, neurosurgical consultation, and treatment, if necessary. We further assume that no patient has a delay in diagnosis of an intracranial lesion. Accordingly, there is no difference in effectiveness of various management strategies; the only differences relate to costs, which are limited to the diagnostic tests. Hence, this part of the analysis is more appropriately called a cost-minimization rather than a cost-effectiveness analysis.\n33\nThe model\nFigure 4\nillustrates the possible pathways and outcomes in moderate TBI. Patients found to have moderate TBI on hospital admission receive either a head CT scan or a biomarker test to screen for the need for a scan. In the latter case, there may or may not be an intracranial lesion. Those who do not have lesions may have a correct diagnosis (true negative) and save the expense of an unnecessary CT scan or they may have an incorrect diagnosis (false positive) and receive the scan. Patients who do have intracranial lesions will either have a correct diagnosis (true positive) by the screening test, or the lesion will be missed (false negative). Because we assume the lesion will at some point present clinically, all patients with lesions will receive both the screening test and an intracranial CT scan. Thus, the result of the model is the cost an average patient can expect if each management strategy is followed."

    "Methods": "Surgery and animal care\nThe University of Colorado Boulder Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all housing, surgery, and postoperative care, and this study was conducted in accordance with Animal Research: Reporting of\nIn Vivo\nExperiments guidelines. All animals were fed standard chow and filtered tap water\nad libitum\nand maintained on a 12:12 light/dark cycle. Rats were pair housed for most studies, but were housed individually for the entire fecal collection study to obviate the stress-related confound of moving pair-housed rats to individual cages. For all experiments, sham/SCI surgeries occurred throughout the light phase. Female and male Sprague-Dawley rats (females: 200\u2013250\u2009g, males: 320\u2013380\u2009g; 2\u20133 months old; Harlan Laboratories) were anesthetized with isoflurane inhalation anesthesia, and both sham and SCI rats were treated with prophylactic antibiotics (gentamicin sulfate (Butler Schein), 1.25\u2009mg subcutaneously in 0.25\u2009mL sterile water). A partial T8 laminectomy was performed prior to SCI. The periosteum, but not the dura, was removed for all surgeries.\nAnimals were subjected to a moderate contusion injury (150\u2009kDyne, 1\u2009sec dwell)\n20\nat T9 spinal cord using the Infinite Horizon device (Precision Systems and Instrumentation). Post-operative animal care included daily administration of intraperitoneal gentamicin (both sham and SCI rats; 1\u2009mL/day for 5 days), subcutaneous injection of saline (5, 5, 4, 3, 2\u2009mL on each of the first 5 days post-injury [dpi], respectively, for both sham and SCI rats) to prevent dehydration, and manual voiding of bladders twice daily (until recovery of bladder function at 2\u20133 weeks).\n21\n,\n22\nAnimals were monitored daily for infection or other signs of suboptimal recovery. A dim red headlamp was used for all manipulations that occurred during the animals' dark phase to limit circadian disruption.\n4\n\nMetabolic behavior studies\nTo study fecal output and food intake, individually housed rats were relocated from their home cages to hanging metal cages (dimensions l\u2009\u00d7\u2009w\u2009\u00d7\u2009h: 41\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u200924\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u200918\u2009cm) for 24\u2009h at a time, then returned to their home cages. All rats were acclimated to this system for 24\u2009h (no data collection in this period) at least 1 week before the initiation of experiments. Rats were placed in the hanging cages at Zeitgeber time (ZT) 9 (ZT0-12\u2009=\u2009lights on; ZT12-24\u2009=\u2009lights off). The rats had a 15\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u200915\u2009cm ceramic platform to stand or lie on and had\nad libitum\naccess to water and food. At all times in our facility, rats were provided Teklad 8460 diet (energy density: 12.6\u2009kJ/g, 3.0\u2009kcal/g). Fecal output was measured by collecting fecal pellets from each animal (fell through the cage onto a tray), then counting and weighing the pellets (every 3\u2009h throughout each 24\u2009h test, to enable studying diurnal rhythms of fecal output). Water (at end of 24\u2009h) and food weight (every 3\u2009h) also were examined. Pellet wet mass (immediate weighing) and dry masses (pellets weighed after air dried in covered cage \u223c48\u2009h) were assessed. Percent water content of fecal matter was calculated using this equation: 100 \u2013 (dry mass/wet mass).\nThree separate fecal output studies were conducted and are presented together here for clarity. The first study consisted of female rats (sham,\nn\n=\u20096; SCI:\nn\n=\u20095); the second study comprised male rats (sham,\nn\n=\u20097; SCI:\nn\n=\u20095); and the third study consisted of female and male rats run concurrently (female sham,\nn\n=\u20098; female SCI,\nn\n=\u200910; male sham,\nn\n=\u20098; male SCI,\nn\n=\u20099). In studies one and two, fecal pellets were collected prior to surgery (\u201cpre-\u201d), then at 2, 7, and 14 days post-surgery. Having the SCI rats in the hanging cages for fecal collections so soon and frequently after SCI (as in studies one and two) caused minor fur wetness and cutaneous sores, so for subsequent studies we avoided frequent acute time-points in these hanging wire cages. In study three, fecal pellets were collected prior to surgery, then at 7 days post-surgery (to confirm consistency with studies 1 and 2) and at 42 days post-surgery (to study fecal output at a chronic time-point).\nFor whole\u2013gut transit time (performed simultaneously with fecal output studies), unanesthetized rats were first acclimated to handling related to gavage. On test days, rats were gavaged with Evan's blue dye (2% Evan's blue, 5% gum Arabic in 2\u2009mL tap water)\n23\nusing a flexible feeding tube (FTP-18-75; Instech Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA) around ZT8.5, and then placed in the hanging cages for fecal pellet analysis. The time until blue fecal pellet production was assessed every 3\u2009h as an indication of whole\u2013gut transit time.\n\nCollection and measurement of plasma glucose\nRats were pair-housed; cage mates had the same surgery (at start: female sham\nn\n=\u20096; female SCI\nn\n=\u200910; male sham\nn\n=\u20096; male SCI\nn\n=\u200910); two female SCI rats and one male SCI rat died. Rats were acclimated to handling for 5 days. After acclimation to handling, blood samples were collected from immobilized unanesthetized rats via tail nick (< 500\u2009\u03bcL/24\u2009h). Blood was collected pre-surgery, and 2, 7, and 14 days post-surgery at ZT0, 6, 12, and 18 (starting at ZT0). Samples were centrifuged (10,000\u2009g/10\u2009min) to isolate plasma. Plasma was used for glucose testing (Bayer Contour). Several samples (various rats and time-points) had insufficient plasma, and therefore were excluded.\n\nCircadian regulation of gene expression\nFor the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) study in surgically na\u00efve rats, tissues were collected from uninjured female/male rats across the day (ZT0, ZT6, ZT12, ZT18;\nn\n=\u20096/sex/time-point for a total of 48 rats). Rats received intraperitoneal pentobarbital overdose, then were perfused with 0.9% saline. Tissues were flash frozen for PCR.\nFor the sham/SCI PCR study, female/male rats received sham/SCI surgery (\nn\n=\u20096/sex/surgery). Prior to surgery, rats were handled to minimize post-surgery bladder care stress. SCI rats received post-surgery bladder care and sham rats received similar handling (control for stress); the bladder care immediately prior to tissue collection was omitted to limit circadian disruption. Tissue from sham/SCI rats was collected for PCR analysis in the middle of the light phase (ZT6; \u223c48\u2009h post-surgery) and the middle of the dark phase (ZT18; \u223c60\u2009h post-surgery) at 2 days post-surgery. Two days post-surgery was chosen as an acute post-surgery time-point for two reasons: first, earlier studies in this manuscript suggested that circadian measures were most strongly disrupted soon after injury, and second, early post-SCI inflammatory and pathologic events likely influence the trajectory of recovery at later times.\n24\u201327\nTissue collections were completed within 1\u20132\u2009h of the time-point (e.g., ZT6 \u2013 tissue collected ZT5-7). Sub-groups of males and females were collected on the same days to minimize between-day differences and to enable sex comparisons (total of 48 rats included in this circadian-SCI experiment).\nQuantitative real-time PCR was completed as previously described\n28\nusing a BioRad iQ5 Real Time PCR Detection Instrument. Primers (Invitrogen) spanned exons (see\nTable 1\nfor sequences). Gene expression was assessed in duplicate and is presented relative to \u03b2-actin. There were no significant differences in \u03b2-actin expression between groups, and male, female, sham, and SCI rat samples were all run on the same plates to ensure consistency. PCR results were analyzed using 2\n-\u0394\u0394Ct\nand normalized with female sham-ZT6 set to 1.\nTable 1.\nPrimer Sequences of Assessed RNAs\nGene\nProtein function\nPrimer sequences\nb-actin\nHousekeeping control\nF: TTCCTTCCTGGGTATGGAAT\nR: GAGGAGCAATGATCTTGATC\nGlut2\nFacilitated glucose transport\nF: CTGGGTCTGCAATTTTGTCA\nR: TGTAAACAGGGTGAAGACCA\nG6pt1\nGlucose transport into endoplasmic reticulum; glucose homeostasis\nF: GTGGGTCCTGGACACTGACT\nR: ACCTCAGAACAGTCCGTAA\nPck1\nEnzyme critical for gluconeogenesis\nF: AGGAGGAAGAAAGGTGGCACCAG\nR: GGCAGAGAAGTCCAGACCATTATGC\nAldoB\nRoles in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis\nF: TTGCCAATGGGAAGGGTA\nR: ATCCTCTGTAGGCGGTTTCC\nPer2\nCircadian clock gene \u2013 with Cry, represses\nBmal\n&\nClock\ntranscription\nF: ACAAGCGGCTGCAGTAGTGA\nR: TTCAAGGTTGCCAGCGTGCT\nCry1\nCircadian clock gene \u2013 with Per, represses\nBmal\nand\nClock\ntranscription\nF: GTGGTGGCGGAAACTGCTCTC\nR: ACTCTGTGCGTCCTCTTCCTGA\nBmal1\nCircadian clock gene \u2013 with Clock, activates\nPer\nand\nCry\ntranscription\nF: AAAATGCAAGGGAGGCCCAC\nR: TCTAACTTCCGGGACATCGC\nRev-erba\n(\nNr1d1\n)\nCircadian clock gene \u2013 represses expression of core clock proteins\nF: AGACGCTGTGCGTTTTGGAC\nR: TGTGGGAACTGAGAGAAGCC\nIL-1b\nPro-inflammatory cytokine; secreted mainly by microglia/macrophages\nF: CCTTGTGCAAGTGTCTGAAG\nR: GGGCTTGGAAGCAATCCTTA\nTnfa\nPro-inflammatory cytokine; secreted mainly by microglia/macrophages\nF: CAAGGAGGAGAAGTTCCCA\nR: TTGGTGGTTTGCTACGACG\nCd68\nInflammation \u2013 expressed by microglia/macrophages; activation marker; cell homing and adhesion\nF: CAAGCAGCACAGTGGACATTC\nR: CAAGAGAAGCATGGCCCGAA\nIba1\n(\nAIF1\n)\nInflammation \u2013 expressed by all microglia/macrophages; increased with activation; binds calcium & actin\nF: GGCAATGGAGATATCGATAT\nR: AGAATCATTCTCAAGATGGC\nOpen in a separate window\n\nStatistical analysis\nData were analyzed (SigmaPlot 13.0; Systat Software, San Jose, CA) using Student's t-test or non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test, or analyses of variance (ANOVAs; one- two- or three-way ANOVA, as appropriate).

    "Methods": "Animals\nIn this study, 6- to 8-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River\nLaboratory) were randomly assigned to two different groups (control vs. bTBI).\nAnimals were housed under a cycle of 12-h light and 12-h dark with access to\nfood and water. All animal procedures and experiments were approved by the\nInstitutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Virginia.\n\nRat model of bTBI\nFour h prior to the PAM experiments, animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital\nand placed into a high-pressure shock tube located in the Aerospace Research\nLaboratory at the University of Virginia (\nSupplementary Fig. 1A\n;\nsee online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). The detailed layout of the shock tube is\nshown in\nSupplementary Figure\n1B\n. The tube has a square section of\n20\u2009\u00d7\u200920\u2009cm\n2\n. The total length of the test section is\n4.3\u2009m. At the end of the tube, the shockwave enters a catch chamber\n6.7\u2009m long, 2.5\u2009m in diameter and disintegrates. The animal was\nplaced \u223c5\u2009m away from the diaphragm, with the head facing the\nflow. The diaphragm was made of five polyester discs with a thickness of 0.014\nin, which were glued together to break at the desired pressure. To achieve a\nblast-type pressure profile, only the diaphragm section (10\u2009cm long) was\nrapidly pressurized by helium gas up to the point when the diaphragm broke\n(\u223c400\u2009psi). This shock tube is capable of generating blast waves\nwith a static pressure higher than 30\u2009psi (\u223c208\u2009kPa). In\nthe experiments presented herein, the pressure profile had a sharp peak, which\nthen dropped \u223c50% in 2\u2009\u03bcsec and \u223c90%\nin 5\u2009\u03bcsec (\nSupplementary Fig. 1C\n).\nThe time history of the pressure in the test section is typical of the positive\nphase of a Friedlander wave, which is associated with an explosion in a free\nfield. However, the measured profile did not capture the negative phase of the\nFriedlander wave. During the blast overpressure procedure, the animal was\nclosely monitored by a high-speed camera (10,000\u2009fps) to confirm that it\nwas maintained in the right position (\nSupplementary Video\n; see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). The total time for animal handling and blast\nexposure was less than 5\u2009min. Following the experimental overpressure\nexposure, the animal was placed on a homeothermic blanket with rectal probe to\nmaintain the body temperature and was supplied with pure oxygen, until\nrecovering from general anesthesia. Animals within the control group were\nhandled in the same way as those in the blast-exposed group, with the exception\nof blast overpressure exposure.\n\nAnimal preparation for PAM imaging\nBefore PAM imaging, a craniotomy was carefully performed following established\nprotocols.\n26\n,\n27\nThe animal was anesthetized\nwith isoflurane (3% for induction and 1.5\u20132% for surgery).\nToe pinch was performed to confirm that the animal was fully sedated before\nsurgery. The scalp was shaved using a trimmer and then depilated using hair\nremoval cream (Surgi-cream). After sterilization of the scalp using 70%\nethanol and povidone-iodine, a surgical incision was made and the periosteum was\nremoved to expose the targeted craniotomy site. An open-skull window\n(\u223c4\u2009mm in diameter) was created using a dental drill. To avoid\noverheating, drilling was paused every 30\u2009sec and saline flush was\nadministered. Once the skull became thin and deformable, it was removed using a\nfine forceps to expose the underlying tissue, followed by application of a\npre-soaked soft-gel foam to prevent bleeding. Next, ultrasound gel was applied\nto the cranial window, after which the animal was transferred to the PAM\napparatus. After being placed on the imaging stage, the exposed brain was gently\ncoupled with a transparent membrane at the bottom of a water tank for subsequent\ndelivery of ultrasound impulses. During imaging, the animal was maintained under\nanesthesia with 1.5% isoflurane and the body temperature was kept at\n37\u00b0C using a heating pad.\n\nMulti-parametric PAM system\nAs shown in\nSupplementary\nFigure 2\n(see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n), two\nnanosecond-pulsed lasers (BX40-2-G and BX40-2-GR, Edgewave) were used in the\nmulti-parametric PAM system for spectroscopic measurement of sO\n2\n,\nalong with C\nHb\nand CBF. Two beams with orthogonal polarization states\nwere combined using a polarizing beam splitter (48\u2013545, Edmund Optics).\nThen, the combined beam was attenuated by a neutral density filter (NDC-50C-2M,\nThorlabs), reshaped by an iris diaphragm (SM1D12D, Thorlabs), focused by a\ncondenser lens (LA1608, Thorlabs), and filtered by a pinhole (P50C, Thorlabs)\nbefore being coupled into a single-mode optical fiber (P1-460B-FC-2, Thorlabs)\nvia a microscope objective (M-10X, Newport). For accurate quantitative\nmeasurement, a beam sampler (BSF10-A, Thorlabs) and a high-speed photodiode\n(FDS100, Thorlabs) were used to monitor and compensate for the laser\nfluctuation. The fiber output was collimated and then refocused by a pair of\nidentical achromatic doublets (AC127-025-A, Thorlabs) into the rat brain through\nthe central opening of a customized ring-shaped ultrasonic transducer (central\nfrequency: 35\u2009MHz; 6-dB bandwidth: 70%; f-number: 1.5). An iris\ndiaphragm (SM05D5, Thorlabs) was used to control the beam width. To compensate\nfor the optical aberration at the water\u2013air interface, a correction lens\n(LA1207-A, Thorlabs) was used. To achieve maximum imaging sensitivity, the\noptical and acoustic foci were coaxially and confocally aligned.\n\nPrinciples of PAM measurements\nUsing two optical wavelengths (532\u2009nm and 558\u2009nm in this study),\nthe oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin (HbO\n2\nand HbR, respectively) can be\ndifferentiated by PAM, from which the sO\n2\ncan be derived in absolute\nvalues as\n28\n:\nwhere\nand\nare the relative concentrations of HbO\n2\nand\nHbR, respectively. With the aid of vessel segmentation,\n25\nthe sO\n2\nvalues of\nindividual feeding arteries and draining veins (s\na\nO\n2\nand\ns\nv\nO\n2\n, respectively) within the region of interest\n(ROI) can be extracted. With this, the regional OEF can be calculated as:\nwhere\nand\nare the\naverage sO\n2\nof all feeding arteries and that of all draining veins,\nrespectively.\nMeanwhile, the absolute C\nHb\ncan be quantified by analyzing statistical\nfluctuation in the PAM-acquired A-line signals, which is induced by the Brownian\nmotion of red blood cells (RBCs). The more RBCs, the higher the fluctuation.\nGiven that each RBC contains \u223c15\u2009pg of hemoglobin,\n29\nthe total amount of hemoglobin\nwithin the detection volume of PAM can be calculated. Based on the lateral\nresolution (2.7\u2009\u03bcm) and the penetration of 532-nm light in rodent\nblood (46\u2009\u03bcm),\n30\nthe detection volume of our PAM is estimated to be\n263\u2009\u03bcm\n3\n.\nTherefore, the average RBC count within the detection volume can be derived\nas\n22\n,\n31\n:\nwhere\nand\nrespectively denote the mean and variance operation,\nis the amplitude of the PAM signal, and\nis the electronic thermal noise of our PAM system.\nFurther, the blood flow speed can be simultaneously quantified by correlation\nanalysis of the same set of A-lines.\n32\n,\n33\nLinearly\nproportional to the flow speed, the decorrelation rate of the sequentially\nacquired A-lines can be used to generate flow maps with \u03bcm-level spatial\nresolution. Note that the correlation window consists of 46\u2009A-lines with\na constant interval of 0.1\u2009\u03bcm, resulting in a window size of\n4.6\u2009\u03bcm. Because the size of the window is comparable to the\naverage diameter of capillaries, our PAM is able to measure the blood flow in\nmicrovessels. By combining the flow speed and the vessel diameter extracted\nusing vessel segmentation, the volumetric blood flow in individual vessels can\nbe calculated as:\nwhere\nD\nis the vessel diameter and\nis the\naverage blood flow speed within the vessel.\nBy combining the aforementioned hemodynamic parameters, the total\nCMRO\n2\nin the ROI can be derived using Fick's law:\nwhere\nis the oxygen binding capacity of hemoglobin\n(1.36\u2009mL of oxygen per gram of hemoglobin),\nis the total volumetric blood flow through the region,\nand\nW\nis the tissue weight estimated by assuming an average\ncortical thickness of 1.2\u2009mm and a tissue density of\n1.05\u2009g/mL.\n\nCerebrovascular reactivity measurement\nTo study the CVR, 200\u2009mg/kg acetazolamide (ACZ) was injected through the\ntail vein of the animal after acquisition of the baseline images. The injection\nwas performed onsite without animal movement. Thus, no image registration was\nrequired. Five min post-injection, the same ROI was re-imaged. Side-by-side\ncomparison of the pre- and post-injection images at the single-vessel level,\nwith the aid of vessel segmentation, allowed comprehensive quantification of the\nCVR to the vasodilatory stimulation, in terms of the vessel diameter,\nsO\n2\n, blood flow speed, and volumetric blood flow.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe unpaired\nt\ntest was used for statistical comparison of the\nstructural, functional, and associated oxygen-metabolic parameters between the\ncontrol and bTBI groups in all figures. The paired\nt\ntest was\nused to compare these parameters before and after ACZ injection within each\ngroup. All figures and data are shown in the format of\nmean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation. Differences with\np\n-values <0.05 were considered statistically\nsignificant."

Once a stable level of anesthesia was achieved, the concentration of isoflurane was lowered to 2\u20133%. A midline incision was made to expose the spinal column at vertebral level T8\u2013T11. The T9 vertebra was carefully removed to expose the underlying T10 spinal cord, whereas the vertebral bodies of T8 and T10\u2013T11 were clamped to stabilize the spinal column. Contusion injury at T10 was induced using the Infinite Horizon Impactor (Precision Systems, Kentucky, IL) with a force of 150 kdyne and zero dwell time. Bilateral bruising of the dorsal spinal cord was verified by examination under the dissecting microscope. The overlying muscles were sutured and the skin closed with sterile 9-mm EZ-clips (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL). The animals were treated with triple antibiotic ointment (bacitracin-neomycin-polymixin B) topically. To compensate for fluid loss, rats were given a 3-mL intraperitoneal injection of 0.9% saline after surgery, and thereafter only if needed. Bladders were expressed twice daily (morning and evening) until the animals had empty bladders for 3 consecutive days at the times of expression. Animals were weighed daily for 1 week after surgery and monitored for infection or signs of unexplained discomfort. Rats used as sham controls underwent the same surgical procedure, but did not receive a contusion SCI.\n\nExperimental design\nThese experiments were designed to investigate the effect of peripheral sensitization induced by CFA following SCI on hindlimb mechanical withdrawal responses and on the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF\u03b1, its receptors, and several downstream targets, as well as the expression of phosphorylated extracellular related kinase (pERK)1/2. All animals received an SCI or sham procedure as described above. One day after the surgical procedure, rats in each group were treated with 100\u2009\u03bcL of CFA (1\u2009mg of\nMycobacterium tuberculosis\n, heat killed and suspended in 0.85\u2009mL paraffin oil and 0.15\u2009mL mannide monooleate; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or saline (Sal), which was administered subcutaneously to the dorsal surface of one hindpaw in a counter-balanced manner. Subsequently, animals from all four experimental groups (Sham-Sal, Sham-CFA, SCI-Sal, and SCI-CFA) were assigned to one of three behavioral/cellular groups.\nExperimental group 1 (28 day): This first experiment was undertaken to assess the effect of CFA on maintenance of pain hypersensitivity after SCI. Behavioral assessment of hindpaw sensitivity was done at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after CFA or saline treatment. Animals in this group were sacrificed for cellular assays immediately after the last behavioral assessment.\nExperimental group 2 (7 day): This experiment assessed the effect peripheral inflammation has on the onset or early expression of pain after SCI. Rats were evaluated for hindpaw mechanical sensitivity at 1\u2009h, 1 day, and 7 days after CFA or saline treatment. The rats were sacrificed immediately after day 7 behavioral tests for cellular assays.\nExperimental group 3 (1 day): A third group of animals was sacrificed 1 day after CFA or saline treatment for cellular assays.\n\nBehavioral locomotor assessment\nThe day after surgery, and before CFA or saline administration, locomotor behavior was assessed using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scale\n29\nin an open enclosure for all subjects to ensure the effectiveness of the contusion injury (for details, refer to Grau and associates\n6\n). Sham control rats with a baseline BBB score of 21 (no locomotor deficit) and SCI rats with a baseline BBB score <8 were included in the study (\nn\n=\u2009105; 50 sham and 55 SCI subjects). Following baseline evaluation, the subjects were assigned to a treatment group (CFA or Sal) in a manner that ensured injury severity was balanced across groups before treatment. BBB evaluation was then undertaken daily at 1\u20136 days post-CFA or saline treatment, in both 7-day and 28-day treatment groups, and at 14, 21, and 28 days after treatment for rats in the 28-day treatment group.\n\nAssessment of mechanical withdrawal responses\nTo assess the effect of noxious stimulation on mechanical sensitivity, we tested tactile thresholds using Semmes-Weinstein von Frey filaments (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL). Before surgical manipulation, all rats were acclimated to the room used for behavioral tests and testing apparatuses for at least 3 days. Prior to surgery (pre-surgery baseline) and at different post-surgery time-points, withdrawal response threshold to tactile stimulation was evaluated. For mechanical assessment, rats were individually placed in testing chambers with metal mesh floors at least 20\u2009min before testing for acclimation. Using calibrated von Frey hairs, the 50% g withdrawal threshold was determined using the up-down method of Dixon.\n30\nStarting with filament #4.31 (2\u2009g), the filaments were applied perpendicularly against the midplantar surface of each hindpaw in a sequential ascending or descending order. Even at acute time-points, when SCI rats are unable to adequately plantar place the hindpaws, every effort was taken to ensure the von Frey filament was consistently applied to the midplantar surface. For each rat, the mean withdrawal threshold was computed by averaging the withdrawal thresholds of both right and left hindpaws. A threshold value of 15\u2009g was considered a maximum cutoff. The establishment of mechanical hypersensitivity (demonstrated as a significant decrease in paw withdrawal threshold compared with pre-surgery baselines) was assessed in SCI and sham subjects after CFA or saline treatment. To minimize experimental bias, mechanical assessment was performed by two investigators. However, because CFA produces noticeable paw edema, it was impossible for investigators to be completely blind to the subject's treatment group.\n\nRNA extraction and qRT-PCR\nWe also investigated the effect SCI and CFA have on the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of TNF\u03b1, the TNF\u03b1 receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNFR2, c-jun, caspase 8, and caspase 3 in the lumbar spinal cord. The mRNA expression of c-fos, an immediate early gene and marker of neuronal activity, was also assessed. All rats from the individual experimental groups were sacrificed at 1 day (\nn\n=\u200920), 7 days (\nn\n=\u200946), or 28 days (\nn\n=\u200939) following CFA or saline treatment. The subjects were deeply anesthetized with urethane (1.2\u2009g/kg) and 1\u2009cm of spinal cord encompassing L3\u2013L5 was rapidly removed. The spinal cord was processed for the extraction of both total RNA (RNeasy Mini Kit; Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and total protein (see below). Total RNA (100\u2009ng) was converted into cDNA using TaqMan EZ RT-PCR Core Reagents (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) and the mRNA levels of the genes of interest were measured by TaqMan quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR using a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). \u03b2-actin served as a control gene. The sequences of probes, and forward and reverse primers for all targets were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA. The mRNA expression for each gene of interest was normalized to \u03b2-actin expression and presented as a fold-change increase or decrease in experimental groups compared with the Sham-Sal control (normalized to 1).\n\nProtein extraction and western blot\nWestern blotting was used for quantification of the protein expression of TNF\u03b1, c-fos, c-jun, caspase 8, caspase 3, and pERK1/2 in the lumbar spinal cord. Subsequent to RNA extraction, total protein was extracted from the organic layer containing protein and DNA using the QIAzol\n\u2122\nlysis reagent protocol for isolation of genomic DNA and/or proteins from fatty tissue (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Details on this procedure have been previously reported\n31\n,\n32\n(also see articles by Garraway and colleagues\n5\n,\n7\n). Following determination of the protein concentration using the Bradford Assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA), protein samples were diluted in Laemmli sample buffer and stored at \u221280\no\nC at known concentrations of total protein (typically 2\u20135\u2009\u03bcg/\u03bcL). Equal amounts (30\u2009\u03bcg) of total protein were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Following transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), the blots for non-phosphorylated proteins were blocked for 1\u2009h in 5% blotting grade milk (BioRad, Hercules, CA) in tris-buffered saline and Tween-20 (TBST), whereas blots for pERK1/2 were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin in TBST. After blocking, the blots were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in primary antibody diluted in blocking solution as follows: TNF\u03b1 (1:500; #ARC3012, Invitrogen, Camarillo, CA); c-fos (1:250; #SC-52, Santa Cruz Biotech, Dallas, TX); c-jun (1:2000; #NB110-55569), caspase 8 (1:1000; #NB100-56116), and caspase 3 (1:1500; #NB100-56113) from Novus Biological, Littleton, CO; and pERK1/2 (1:500; #07-467, Millipore, Temecula, CA). \u03b2-tubulin (1:1000; #05-661, Upstate Cell Signaling, Lake Placid, NY) served as a control.\nThe following day, blots were washed in TBST (3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009min) at room temperature, then were incubated in horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:5,000; #31460 or #31430, respectively; Pierce, Rockford, IL) for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Following wash (3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009min), the blots were developed with standard enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and imaged with Syngene Gel Imaging System. Ratios of the integrated densitometry of each protein of interest to the loading control (\u03b2-tubulin) were calculated, normalized to sham controls, and averaged for animals within each group. The data are presented as a percentage change compared with Sham-Sal (100%).\n\nStatistical analysis\nBehavioral data were analyzed using repeated measures (RM) analysis of variance (ANOVA) with time-point as the within-subjects factor (one-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVA), treatment/injury group as the between-subjects factor (two-way ANOVA), and an\na priori\nalpha value of 0.05 or below being considered significant. These were followed by post hoc tests corrected for multiple comparisons. In all cases, the choice of multiple comparisons test used (Tukey, Dunnett, or Sidak) was based on GraphPad Prism recommendation as being most appropriate for the particular dataset. Mean group differences were also evaluated with independent\nt\ntests, whenever applicable. Comparisons of cellular changes among the groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA, followed by appropriate post hoc comparisons. In text and figures, all data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM), and in figures, * and # indicate\np\n<\u20090.05, ** indicates\np\n<\u20090.01, and ^ indicates\np\n<\u20090.001. The statistical analyses were conducted with GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Prism, La Jolla, CA)."

    "Methods": "Spinal cord injury\nAll experimental procedures were approved by the Washington University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and performed according to the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\nGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\n(Institute of Laboratory Animal Resource, National Research Council, 1996). Sixteen 10-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) weighing \u223c20\u2009g were housed in the Washington University animal facility with a 12-h light/dark cycle. Before surgery, mice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine (80\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg). A spinal cord impactor device, modified from the device developed at Ohio State University, was employed to produce spinal cord contusion injury.\n21\nModifications included a flexure-based design in which the extent of overshoot was reduced with a micrometer-control and mechanical stop.\n22\nFor contusion injury, a 1.3-mm-diameter round tip and 0.1\u2009m/sec impact speed were used.\nThe skin above the vertebral column of all mice was shaved and cleaned with betadine. A 15-mm midline skin incision was made and the vertebral column was exposed. After the spinal thoracic region was exposed by separation of dorsal muscles to the side, the spinous processes of T8\u2013T13 vertebrae were exposed. A laminectomy was performed at vertebral level T10 and half of T9 to expose the dorsal cord surface with dura remaining intact. The vertebral column was stabilized with angled clamps on the T8 and T12 transverse processes and then SCI was induced using the spinal cord impactor. After laminectomy, 10 mice received 0.8-mm displacement contusion at the T9 vertebral level. The other six mice received no contusion to serve as the sham control. After surgery, the wound was closed in layers with 5-0 polyglactin and nylon sutures. Enrofloxacin (2.5\u2009mg/kg) and lactated Ringer's solution (1\u2009mL) were injected subcutaneously.\n\nDiffusion magnetic resonance imaging\nIn vivo\ndiffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements were performed 3 days after SCI or laminectomy on a 4.7 T Agilent DirectDrive\u2122 small-animal MRI system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) equipped with a Magnex/Agilent HD imaging gradient coil (Magnex/Agilent, Oxford, UK), capable of pulse gradient strengths up to 58 G/cm (\u2009=\u2009580\u2009mT/m) and a gradient rise time \u2264295\u2009\u03bcsec. Mice were anesthetized with \u223c1.0\u20131.5% isoflurane in oxygen during scans. Breathing rate was monitored and body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C with a small animal physiological monitoring and control unit (SA Instruments, Stony Brook, NY). The respiratory exhaust line was connected to a pressure transducer to synchronize diffusion-weighted MRI acquisition with the animal's respiratory rate. An actively decoupled volume (transmit)/surface (receive) coil pair, covering the T8 \u2013 T11 vertebral segments (15\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20098\u2009mm), was used for MRI excitation and signal reception.\n23\nDiffusion-weighted MRI data were acquired using a conventional spin-echo diffusion-weighted sequence with an icosahedral 25-direction diffusion-encoding scheme\n24\nwith one b\u2009=\u20090 image. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance acquisition parameters were repetition time (TR) of \u223c0.3\u2009sec (TR was slightly varied due to respiratory gating), echo time of 43\u2009msec, time between gradient pulses (\u0394) of 25\u2009msec, gradient pulse duration (\u03b4) of 6\u2009msec, maximum b-value of 2200\u2009sec/mm\n2\n(each of the diffusion encodings have a unique b-value and direction), slice thickness of 1.8\u2009mm, field-of-view of 10\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009mm\n2\n, and data matrix of 96\u2009\u00d7\u200996 (i.e., in-plane resolution of 104\u2009\u00d7\u2009104\u2009\u03bcm\n2\n).\n\nDiffusion-weighted MRI data analysis\nData was analyzed with both DBSI and conventional DTI analysis packages developed in-house and running in Matlab.\n17\n,\n25\nFor spinal cord white matter tracts (coherent fiber bundles), the diffusion-weighted imaging data was modeled according to\nEquation [1]\n:\nThe quantities\nS\nk\nand\nare the signal and\nb\n-value of the\nk\nth\ndiffusion gradient,\nis the angle between the\nk\nth\ndiffusion gradient and the principal direction of the anisotropic tensor,\nand\nare the axial and radial diffusivities of the anisotropic tensor,\nis the signal intensity fraction for the anisotropic tensor, and\na\nand\nb\nare the low and high diffusivity limits for the isotropic diffusion spectrum\n. DBSI-derived\nrepresents spinal cord white matter tract density in an image voxel. DBSI-derived \u03bb\n||\nand \u03bb\n\u22a5\nreflect residual axon and myelin integrity respectively: \u2193 \u03bb\n||\n\u2248 axonal injury and \u2191 \u03bb\n\u22a5\n\u2248 demyelination.\n12\n,\n17\n,\n25\n,\n26\nBased on our previous experimental findings, the restricted isotropic diffusion fraction reflecting cellularity is derived by the summation of\nat 0 \u2264 ADC \u22640.3\u2009\u03bcm\n2\n/msec. The summation of the remaining\nat 0.3 < ADC \u22643\u2009\u03bcm\n2\n/msec represents non-restricted isotropic diffusion, which putatively denotes vasogenic edema and cerebrospinal fluid.\n12\n,\n17\n,\n25\n,\n26\nRegions of interest (ROIs) were manually drawn in ventral and lateral white matter tracts on the diffusion-weighted image, corresponding to the diffusion gradient direction perpendicular to white matter fiber tracts (with good gray-white matter contrast), to minimize partial volume effects. ROIs were then transferred to the parametric maps to calculate each of the DBSI- and DTI-derived pathological metrics (e.g.,\nFig. 1A\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nRepresentative\nin vivo\ndiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) metric maps were overlaid on gray-scale diffusion-weighted images from one control and one spinal cord injury (SCI) mouse at T9 vertebral level\n(A).\nDTI axon/myelin pathological metrics are susceptible to the effect of co-existing inflammation and axonal loss that could exaggerate or underestimate the severity of SCI. In the present study, inflammatory cell infiltration resulted in a more significantly decreased DTI axial diffusivity (\u03bb\n\u2225\n)\n(B)\nthan that derived by DBSI\n(D),\nwhile the combined axonal loss and vasogenic edema led to a more significantly increased DTI radial diffusivity (\u03bb\n\u22a5\n)\n(C)\nthan DBSI \u03bb\n\u22a5\n(E).\nIncreased white matter volume (\nF\n; as a result of cell infiltration and vasogenic edema) and decreased DBSI fiber fraction (\nG\n; the decreased axonal density as a result of combined effects of increased cell infiltration, vasogenic edema, and axonal loss) were present at 3 days after SCI. DBSI-derived axonal volume\n(H)\nderived as the product of white matter volume (F) times DBSI fiber fraction (G) reflects the extent of axonal loss in the presence of tissue swelling. At this time-point, decreased DBSI-derived apparent axonal volume was observed, suggesting axonal loss (H). The intensity gradients in DBSI \u03bb\n\u2225\n, \u03bb\n\u22a5\n, and fiber fraction maps reflect spatial variation of injury severity that are intrinsic to the dorsal-to-ventral impact nature of this SCI model. *\np\n<\u20090.05.\n\nDBSI-derived axonal volume\nTo assess the extent of axonal loss, DBSI-derived axonal volume was computed by multiplying DBSI fiber fraction, f\nfiber\n(the density of fiber tract within a given image voxel, which may also be affected by infiltrating cells, vasogenic edema, and gray matter) by the corresponding volume of the ROI. Note that in the case of tissue swelling after SCI, the number of voxels occupied by the white matter tracts would increase with peripheral/distant voxels only partially occupied by the swollen tracts (reflected by reduced fiber density). Thus, multiplication of f\nfiber\nand voxel volume will derive an \u201capparent\u201d axonal volume (with a unit of mL or \u03bcL), linearly correlating with axon counts although not a real axonal volume.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nImmediately after the\nin vivo\ndiffusion MRI data acquisition, mice were deeply anesthetized and underwent perfusion-fixation via the left cardiac ventricle with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Spines were excised and stored in 4% PFA at 4\u00b0C for 24\u2009h, then transferred to PBS for further storage until processing. The 2-mm segment of spinal cord centered at the contusion epicenter was dissected, decalcified with the vertebral column intact, and embedded in paraffin wax. Paraffin blocks were sectioned at 5-\u03bcm thick, deparaffinized, and rehydrated for immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. Sections were blocked with 5% normal goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30\u2009min at room temperature to prevent non-specific binding. Slides were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibody and then 1\u2009h at room temperature with the appropriate secondary antibody. Primary antibodies used were anti-total neurofilament (SMI-312, BioLegend, 1:300), anti-phosphorylated neurofilament (SMI-31, BioLegend, 1:300), and anti-myelin basic protein (MBP; Sigma, 1:300). Secondary antibodies were goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit (Invitrogen, 1:240) conjugated to either Alexa 488 for SMI-31/SMI-312 or Alexa 594 for MBP.\nSlides were mounted with Vectashield Mounting Medium for 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratory, Inc., Burlingame, CA) and cover-slipped. Images were acquired on a Nikon Eclipse 80i fluorescence microscope with MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA) at 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009and 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnifications. Quantification was performed on the entire 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009IHC ventral and lateral white matter tract images using ImageJ. Images then underwent background subtraction, bilateral filtering for edge preservation, watershed segmentation, and threshold determination. The analyze-particles-macro was then performed on SMI-312 and SMI-31 to count numbers of total and intact axons. The MBP area calculation was then normalized to the entire area of white matter column.\n27\n,\n28\nBackground subtraction, threshold determination, and analyze particles were also used for counting DAPI-positive staining (National Institutes of Health [NIH];\nhttps://imagej.nih.gov/ij\n).\n\nHematoxylin and eosin staining\nWe stained 5-\u03bcm paraffin slices with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Histological slices were scanned with an Olympus Nanozoomer slide scanner (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). For quantification analysis, background subtraction, bilateral filter for edge preservation, threshold determination, and analyze particles were also used for counting cavity voids (\nhttps://imagej.nih.gov/ij\n).\n\nStatistical analysis\nFor all the boxplots, whiskers extend to the minimum/maximum and the mean is marked as diamonds. A two-sample t-test was performed between control and SCI groups. The correlation of histology data and DTI or DBSI measurements was analyzed by simple linear regression using the SAS REG procedure. All results are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation."

    "Methods": "In the current study, a high-resolution, anatomically accurate brain FEM, the ABM, was used to simulate various head impact scenarios at six locations of interest at three magnitudes per location.26The ABM (Fig. 1) has been validated against brain displacement measurements in five cadaver impact experiments originally conducted by Hardy and coworkers (2001).27,28\n\nImpact locations\nSix impact locations, adapted from Rowson and coworkers (2011) and Beckwith and coworkers (2012), were investigated in the current study (\nFig. 2\n).\n29\n,\n30\nExperimental impact tests were conducted on a helmeted Hybrid III (HIII) 50th percentile anthropomorphic test device (ATD) using a pneumatic linear impactor at each of the six impact sites. The kinematic data describing motion of the linear and angular motion of the headform from each test were used to define the boundary conditions of the ABM impact simulations.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nImpact locations.\n29\n,\n30\n\nData collection\nAs part of an ongoing study, real-time head impact data were collected during all practices and games for three youth football teams over the course of four seasons. Data collection, previously reported by Kelley and coworkers (2017), was conducted with the Head Impact Telemetry (HIT) System.\n11\nFor each impact, the impact location using two angles: azimuth (\n\u03b8\n) and elevation (\n\u03b1\n) was computed. The azimuth angle is measured from the back of the head (\n\u03b8\n=\u20090 degrees) about the z-axis to the front of the head (\n\u03b8\n=\u2009180 degrees), and the elevation angle as measured from the nose (\n\u03b1\n=\u20090 degrees) to the top of the head (\n\u03b1\n=\u200990 degrees) (\nFig. 3\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nAzimuth\n(A)\nand elevation\n(B)\nangles.\nThe youth head impact data were analyzed by impact location according to the azimuth and elevation angles for each impact. If the azimuth and elevation angles for a given impact were within 15 degrees of the azimuth and elevation angles of one of the six impact locations of interest, that impact was extracted and included in the distribution of impacts at the corresponding impact site.\n31\nFrom the distribution of extracted impacts at each site, 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile linear and rotational acceleration values were calculated.\n\nFE simulations\nThe boundary conditions for each impact were derived from linear impact tests performed with a helmeted HIII ATD head phantom and neck at the six impact locations of interest (\nFig. 2\n).\n29\n,\n30\nFor each impact location, the linear and rotational acceleration curves output by the HIII ATD were scaled to the corresponding magnitudes to represent the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile impacts. This resulted in three simulations per impact location, heretofore referred to as \u201clow,\u201d \u201cmoderate,\u201d and \u201chigh\u201d magnitude. The acceleration curves were integrated to obtain velocity curves, which were used as boundary conditions to drive the ABM simulations.\nAn example of the workflow for simulating the 5th percentile impact at location D is shown in\nFigure 4\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 4.\nExample of work flow for simulating the low magnitude impact at location D.\n\nEvaluating brain response\nMPS was used to quantify the strain response in the brain using two different response metrics: 95th percentile MPS and cumulative strain damage measure (CSDM).\n32\nThe 95th percentile MPS was calculated at each time point by analyzing the distribution of MPS values in all brain elements and calculating the 95th percentile. This resulted in a curve with a value corresponding to each time point in the simulation. The peak of this curve was taken as the 95th percentile MPS metric. The 95th percentile MPS value was used instead of the maximum MPS value, because the 95th percentile is less sensitive to the extremely large strain values sometimes encountered by a small minority of elements/brain volume in these simulations. It therefore better represents the overall deformation patterns of the brain.\n33\nFrom\nFigure 5\n, which shows the distribution of MPS values for the 1,600,000 brain elements at a single time point, we see how much the maximum value and 95th percentile value can differ from each other.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 5.\nSingle time point maximum principal strain (MPS) distribution for high magnitude simulation at location A.\nCSDM was calculated using the relationship between MPS for every element and the percentage of brain volume exceeding a given MPS value. This curve was generated by ranking the MPS for each brain element from high to low, and evaluating this versus the percentage of total brain volume (\nFig. 6\n). Specific CSDM values, such as CSDM (0.05), CSDM (0.10), and CSDM (0.15), were calculated from this curve as shown in\nFigure 6\n. An additional metric was calculated as the area under the CSDM curve (\nFig. 6\n), called CSDM area.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 6.\nMaximum principal strain (MPS) versus percent volume of brain exceeding given MPS threshold, or cumulative strain damage measure (CSDM) curve. Specific CSDM values are calculated from this curve as shown for CSDM (0.05), CSDM (0.10), and CSDM (0.15).\nFinally, the relationships between strain metrics and various kinematic values and brain injury risk measures were investigated. The kinematic values examined were linear acceleration, rotational acceleration, and rotational velocity. The brain injury metrics examined were the concussion correlate (CC) and the head injury criterion (HIC). The CC was derived from a risk curve for concussion as developed by Rowson and coworkers (2013) that accounted for both linear acceleration and rotational acceleration.\n34\n,\n35\nCC is calculated using the following function:\nwhere,\na\nis peak linear acceleration (in\ng\n), and\n\u03b1\nis peak rotational acceleration (in rad/sec\n2\n); the coefficients were from Rowson and coworkers (2013) was: \u03b2\n0\n=\u2009\u221210.2, \u03b2\n1\n=\u20094.33e-02, \u03b2\n2\n=\u20098.73e-4, and \u03b2\n3\n=\u2009\u22129.20e-7.\n34\nHIC was calculated according to:\nwhere\nt\n1\nand\nt\n2\nare any two arbitrary times during the resultant linear acceleration of the head CG and the limit on the HIC time interval (\nt\n2\n\u2013\nt\n1\n) was 15\u2009ms.\n36\n\nStatistical analysis\nFinally, generalized linear models were used to evaluate the effect of impact characteristics (kinematic values and impact location) on computed strain metrics using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC)."

    "Methods": "Materials\nChemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Anesthesia was ketamine hydrochloride injection (100\u2009mg/mL, 1044102, Henry Schein, Melville, NY and xylazine hydrochloride injection (100\u2009mg/mL, 13985-704-10, Vet One, Boise, ID). Reagents for BCA protein assay and sample preparation for LC\u2013MS/MS analysis were purchased from Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL). TMT reagent 10-plex kits were bought commercially (Thermo Scientific Pierce, Rockford, IL).\n\nExperimental design and statistical rationale\nThe experimental design incorporated four biological replicates for each group (total five groups: sham control, 3 and 24\u2009h, and 7 and 30 DPI after blast), across two independent TMT 10-plex tagging experiments to examine brain cortex. In order to perform robust quantitative analysis between the two independent TMT 10-plex tagging experiments, we pooled two biological replicates from the sham group together as an index for two TMT tagging cross-batch analysis. All experimental groups in the studies were handled in a randomized, double-blinded manner. For quantification purposes, all proteomics data were normalized across all proteins within each 10-plex batch to eliminate the batch effect. Welch's test and t-distribution were performed with R function \u201ct.test\u201d for proteomics data, and other statistical comparisons were made by student's\nt\ntest for two groups and by one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test followed by Tukey test for multiple comparisons. GraphPad Prism (version 6 for Windows; GraphPad Software) were used to calculate the\np\nvalues. The relative protein abundance ratios (fold changes) between blast and sham groups were calculated. As previously described, the changes in protein levels were considered significant if fold change was >1.0 (upregulated) or <1.0 (downregulated), and the\np\nvalue was <0.05 in two independent experiments.\n20\nThe threshold of this open-field LIB was determined based on peak overpressure (46.6\u2009kPa) as compared with literature reports (majority >100\u2009kPa),\n6\n,\n21\nand our previous pathological observations demonstrating the absence of macroscopic damage or necrosis in the presence of nanoscale ultrastructural injuries.\n5\n\nAnimals and open-field blast setting\nThe protocol for this study has been described previously.\n5\nTwenty male C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) at 2 months of age were housed with a 12\u2009h light/dark cycle (lights on at 7:00 a.m.) and given unrestricted access to food and water. Four mice were put in one cage. A cotton pad and an environmental enrichment toy (small plastic house) were placed in each cage. All animals were observed for good health before, during, and after testing. All experimental groups in the studies were handled in a randomized, double-blinded manner. All procedures were performed in accordance to the University of Missouri approved protocols for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Animal Research: Reporting of\nIn Vivo\nExperiments (ARRIVE) guidelines.\nBased on the blast exposure setting, animals were randomly grouped as the 3\u2009m (\nn\n=\u200916) blast, and sham control (\nn\n=\u20094). Animals with 3\u2009m blast were randomly grouped into four groups as 3\u2009h (\nn\n=\u20094), 24\u2009h (\nn\n=\u20094), 7 DPI (\nn\n=\u20094), and 30 DPI (\nn\n=\u20094). Mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 5\u2009\u03bcL/g body weight of ketamine/xylazine mixture (25\u2009mg/mL ketamine and 1.25\u2009mg/mL xylazine). The sham group underwent the identical anesthesia procedures only without blast exposure. Mice were placed in the prone position at the 3\u2009m platforms away from the 350\u2009g C4. No constraint was applied to the animals. Following blast wave exposure, animals were returned to the original cage. After recovery from anesthesia, mice were able to spontaneously move and continuously be monitored for at least 15\u201330\u2009min. Animals were allowed access to food and water\nad libitum\nbefore and after blast exposure.\n\nProtein sample preparation, isobaric TMT 10-plex labeling, IMAC enrichment, LC-MS/MS analysis, and protein identification\nAfter blast exposure, cerebral cortices were dissected from the immediately euthanized mouse brains as described previously.\n5\n,\n6\nTo lyse each brain tissue specimen (100\u2009mg), 600\u2009\u03bcL of sample buffer (2% sodium dodecyl sulphate [SDS], 0.5M tetraethylammonium bicarbonate [TEAB]), protease inhibitor cocktail was added and the specimen homogenized by TissueLyser LT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Tissue homogenates were centrifuged at 17,000\ng\nfor 20\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was transferred into a new vial for protein concentration measurement by BCA assay. Preparation of tryptic peptides for TMT 10-plex labelling was performed according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 100\u2009\u03bcg protein from each sample was transferred into a new vial and adjusted to a final volume of 100\u2009\u03bcL with TEAB and reduced with Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) at 55\u00b0C for 1\u2009h, and then alkylated with iodoacetamide for 30\u2009min in the dark. Methanol-chloroform precipitation was performed prior to protease digestion. In brief, four volumes of methanol were added to each sample and vortexed, followed by adding one part chloroform and three parts water to the sample, and vortexing. The sample was centrifuged at 14,000\ng\nfor 4\u2009min at room temperature and the aqueous phase was removed. The organic phases with protein precipitate at the surface were subsequently washed twice with four parts methanol, centrifuged, and subsequently supernatant was removed. After air-drying, precipitated protein pellets were re-suspended with 100\u2009\u03bcL of 50\u2009mM TEAB and digested with trypsin overnight at 37\u00b0C.\nTagging with TMT multiplex reagents enables relative quantitation of proteins present in multiple samples by labeling peptides with isobaric stable isotope tags. In this study, TMT 10-plex reagents were used for labeling of 10 samples (blast samples and controls) and analyzed simultaneously, in order to avoid run-to-run variation. Tryptic digested peptides from brain samples were labeled with TMT 10-plex reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the TMT reagents (0.8\u2009mg) were dissolved in 41\u2009\u03bcL of anhydrous acetonitrile. Aliquots of 95\u2009\u03bcL of the trypsin-digested peptides from cortical tissue samples were incubated with TMT reagents for 1\u2009h at room temperature. The reactions were quenched by 8\u2009\u03bcL of 5% hydroxylamine solution and reacted for 15\u2009min. The combined TMT labelled samples were dried under SpeedVac, and then reconstituted by dilute trifluoroacetic acid solution followed by desalting by Oasis HLB 96-well \u03bcElutionplate (Waters) prior to LC-MS/MS analysis.\nImmobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) was used as an affinity enrichment technique for the preparation of phosphopeptides for mass spectrometric analysis and sequencing as previously described.\n22\nBriefly, Pierce ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA) Phosphopeptide Enrichment Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific #88300) was used following the manufacture's protocol. This kit enables fast and efficient enrichment of phosphorylated peptides. Each spin column included in the kit contains phosphopeptide-specific resin that offers excellent binding and recovery properties for enriching phosphopeptides. Each trypsin-digested dried sample was re-suspended in 200\u2009\u03bcL of binding buffer and was added to a Fe-NTA spin column followed by incubation for 20\u2009min with a slow end-over-end rotation at room temperature. Then, the Fe-NTA spin column was centrifuged at 1,000\ng\nfor 1\u2009min and washed with wash buffer. The eluted phosphopeptides were applied to a Pierce Graphite Spin column (Thermo Fisher Scientific #88302), which enables fast and efficient capture, concentration, desalting, and elution of hydrophilic peptides. All eluents were quantitated and analyzed, and the phosphorylation sites were localized.\nWe performed proteomic profiling of global and phospho-proteomes using the established workflow for MS analysis (\nFig. 1A\n). LC-MS/MS was performed on a Q Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled with a Dionex ultimate 3000 HPLC system equipped with a nano-ES ion source.\n23\nThe TMT labelled peptides were separated on a C18 reverse-phase capillary column (PepMap, 75\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u2009mm, Thermo Fisher) with linear gradients of 2\u201335% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid, at a constant flow rate of 300\u2009nL/min for 220\u2009min. The instrument was operated in the positive-ion mode with the electrospray ionization (ESI) spray voltage set at 1.8\u2009kV. A full scan of MS spectra (300\u20131800\u2009m/z) was acquired in the Q Exactive at a mass resolution of 70,000 at 200\u2009m/z with an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 3e6. Fifteen peptide ions showing the most intense signal from each scan were selected for a higher energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD)-MS/MS analysis (normalized collision energy 32) in the Q Exactive at a mass resolution of 35,000 and AGC value of 1e5. Maximal filling times were 100\u2009ms in full scans and 120\u2009ms (HCD) for the MS/MS scans. Ions with unassigned charge states and singly charged species were rejected. The dynamic exclusion was set to 50\u2009sec and there was a relative mass window of 10\u2009ppm. Data were acquired using ThermoXcalibur 3.0.63. The phosphopeptides were analyzed under the same conditions as mentioned, except that separation was done with linear gradients of 1\u201330% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid, and full scan MS ranging 300\u20132000\u2009m/z with NCE at 25.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nProteomics analyses workflow and identification of differentially expressed global- and phospho- proteins after low-intensity blast (LIB) injury\n. (A)\nWorkflow for quantitative profiling of mouse brain global and phospho-proteome after blast exposure.\n(B, C)\nLIB differentially induced expression of 170 global proteins and 23 phospho-proteins at the 3\u2009h time point, respectively. Volcano plots were generated by R statistical software. Dashed lines indicate the thresholds of log2 (ratio/fold change) and \u2013log10 (\np\n). The identified proteins are displayed as dots in red (upregulation with significant changes), green (downregulation with significant changes), or black (no significant change).\n(D)\nHeatmap showing effects of LIB on phospho-protein expression over multiple time points. A large portion of blast-induced up-/downregulated phospho-proteins were dynamically changed along with the time after blast. For visualization, the calculated \u2013log(\np\nvalue) was shown in red for upregulation and in blue for downregulation. The darkness of the color in each box reflects the absolute value of \u2013log(\np\nvalue).\n(E)\nVenn diagram showing the overlapping differentially expressed global proteins among groups. The overlap portions indicate reoccurring proteins over time.\n(F)\nPrincipal component analysis showed that those differentially expressed global proteins effectively separated blast at 3\u2009h (red), 24\u2009h (green), 7 days post-injury (DPI) (dark blue), and 30 DPI (light blue) from sham control (black). Color image is available online.\nRaw data were processed using SEQUEST with Proteome Discoverer (Version 2.1, Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n24\nData were searched against the\nmus musculus\nUniversal Protein Resource sequence database (UniProt, August, 2013). The searches were performed with the following parameter settings: trypsin digestion with two missed cleavage allowed; fixed modification, carbamidomethyl of cysteine; variable modification, oxidation of methionine, TMT 10-plex (peptide labeled) for N terminus and Lys; MS tolerance, 5\u2009ppm; MS/MS tolerance, 0.02\u2009Da; false discovery rate (FDR) at peptide and protein levels, <0.01; and required peptide length, \u22656 amino acids. Protein grouping was enabled, meaning if one protein was equal to or completely contained within the set of peptides of another protein, these two proteins were put into the same protein group. At least one unique peptide per protein group was required for identifying proteins. The relative protein abundance ratios (fold changes) between all blast and sham groups were calculated. As previously described, the changes in protein levels were considered significant if fold change was >1.0 (upregulated) or <1.0 (downregulated), and the\np\nvalue was <0.05 in two independent experiments.\n20\n\nAnalysis of the mitochondrial respiratory chain\nCortical tissues (\u223c 20\u2009mg for each sample) were cut into small pieces and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in 1\u2009mL of 20\u2009mM phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The homogenate was diluted fourfold with 20\u2009mM PBS and used to determine the enzymatic activities of Complex I (or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [NADH] dehydrogenase), cytochrome C oxidase (COX), and citrate synthase (CS) using an Infinite M200 plate reader (Tecan Group Ltd., Switzerland) as described previously.\n25\nThe protein concentration of homogenate was determined using the DC (detergent compatible) protein assay (5000116, Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA). The maximal reaction speed (V\nmax\n) normalized to the amount of protein was used to characterize the activity of each enzyme. For assay of V\nmax\nof Complex I, diluted homogenate was first subjected to three freeze and thaw cycles. Next, 15\u2009mM coenzyme Q1 was added into a cuvette containing 150\u2009\u03bcM NADH and 40\u2009\u03bcL diluted homogenate. The decrease in NADH absorbance at 340\u2009nm was monitored for 2\u2009min for estimation of V\nmax\n. To measure the Complex I induced NADH oxidation, 10\u2009nM of the Complex I inhibitor rotenone was added and the post-rotenone rate was subtracted from the pre-rotenone rate to yield the rotenone-sensitive NADH oxidation V\nmax\n. For the COX V\nmax\nassay, 25\u2009\u03bcM reduced cytochrome C was added into the cuvette containing 20\u2009mM PBS, 5\u2009\u03bcL diluted homogenate, and 0.2\u2009mg/mL dodecyl maltoside, to make the total volume of 1\u2009mL. The oxidation of the reduced cytochrome C was monitored for 2\u2009min at 550\u2009nm and the pseudo first-order rate constant was calculated as V\nmax\n. For assay of citrate synthase V\nmax\nactivity, the substrates of CS, 100\u2009\u03bcM oxaloacetate, and 50\u2009\u03bcM acetyl coenzyme A (CoA), were added into the cuvette containing 100\u2009mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5\u2009\u03bcL homogenate, and 100\u2009\u03bcM 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) (1\u2009mL total volume) and then the formation of 5-mercapto-2-nitrobenzoic acid was monitored for 2\u2009min at 412\u2009nm, as previously described.\n25\n\nWestern blot analysis\nProtein samples were added to 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009SDS sample buffer with 1% 2-mercaptoethanol and resolved on 12%, 1.5mm SDS- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gels as previously described.\n26\nThen, proteins in SDS-PAGE gel were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was first incubated in PBS plus 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) (pH 7.4) containing 5% non-fat milk for 1\u2009h at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibody, including COX IV (ab16056 Abcam, 1:2000), MnSOD (ab13534 Abcam, 1:3000), GPX4 (ab125066 Abcam, 1:2000), Drp1 (ab184247 Abcam, 1:1000), Fis1 (10956-1-AP Proteintech, 1:1000), OPA1 (cst80471 Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000), Mitofusin 2 (cst9482 Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000), VDAC1 (sc390996 Santa Cruz, 1:1000), OXPHOS (containing a cocktail of complex I NDUFB8, complex II SDHB, complex III UQCRC2, complex IV MTCO1, and complex V ATP5A) (45-8099 ThermoFisher Scientific, 1:500), PINK1 (sc33796 Santa Cruz, 1:500), Parkin (cst4211 Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000), ATG12 (cst4180 Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000), LC3B (cst2775 Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000), ULK1 (cst8054 Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000), and Actin (A3854 Sigma-Aldrich, 1:15000) at 4\u00b0C overnight. After washing with PBST three times, the membrane was incubated with corresponding secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG, A0168 Sigma-Aldrich, 1:2000, anti-rabbit IgG, A0545 Sigma-Aldrich, 1:2000) in PBST for 1\u2009h at room temperature.

    "Methods": "Model motivation\nOur primary goals for this study were to mechanistically understand why GABA\nA\nreceptor agonists are not effective in treating TBI, and to test the efficacy of physiologically motivated drug combinations for neuroprotection. For this purpose, we built a Hodgkin\u2013Huxley\n59\nbased compartmental model of a regular spiking (RS) neuron\n60\nbased on realistic and known physiology. Specifically, we chose to model a prototypical RS pyramidal neuron, given its abundance and critical involvement in both the normal and pathological function of neocortical circuits.\n61\u201363\nThe properties of the model will be described in detail subsequently.\n\nRS neuron model\nMorphology and passive properties\nBased on the morphology of a prototypical neocortical pyramidal cell,\n64\nwe constructed a multi-compartmental model with one somatic compartment and seven dendritic compartments. Our model has a specific membrane resistance of 25\u2009k\u2126cm\n2\nand a specific membrane capacitance of 1\u2009\u03bcF/cm\n2\nresulting in a membrane time constant of 25\u2009ms.\n65\nThe model's input resistance is 399\u2009M\u2126, closely matching the input resistance of neocortical pyramidal neurons.\n65\nThe model has a resting membrane potential of \u221271.87\u2009mV.\n64\n,\n66\nThe model was simulated at a temperature of 30\u00b0C. To scale the temperature dependence of time constants, we used a q10 value of 3.\n67\nActive properties\nThe model consists of two ionic currents: fast sodium current and delayed rectifier potassium current. The channel kinetics and properties of these two currents will be described in detail subsequently. The model has a spike width of 1.03\u2009ms\n68\nand a threshold of \u221242.32\u2009mV.\n66\n,\n69\nSpike threshold was calculated as the membrane potential when\ncrosses 10\u2009V/s for the first time in the positive direction.\n70\nFast sodium current\nRS neurons exhibit fast sodium currents that are necessary for action potential generation.\n71\nThe fast sodium current was modeled based on the Hodgkin\u2013Huxley formalism\n59\nand consists of three activation gates and a single inactivation gate. This channel was distributed in both the somatic and dendritic compartments. Utilizing experimental data from a previous study,\n71\nwe modeled these fast sodium currents based on sodium channel gating properties commonly found in RS neurons. The maximal channel conductance (\n) of the channel is shown in\nTable 1\n.

By using data from a previous experimental study on pyramidal neurons,\n72\nwe modeled the potassium current by simulating the voltage dependence of steady state activation and time constant. The equations for voltage dependence of steady state activation\nits time constant\n, and channel currents\nare provided here.\nwhere\n\nBackground inputs\nRS neurons are known to receive phasic excitatory, phasic inhibitory, and tonic inhibitory background inputs\nin vivo.\n78\u201380\nTaking these aspects of the circuit into account, we modeled these inputs in the following way: 30 phasic excitatory (AMPA) inputs were modeled with a firing rate of 1\u2009Hz to mimic the background firing rate of pyramidal neurons\nin vivo.\n81\u201383\nThe time course of AMPAergic synaptic conductance was modeled using the following equation\n84\n,\n85\n:\nwhere\nand\nare decay and rise time constants respectively, and\nis the maximal synaptic conductance.\nN\nis a normalization factor that makes maximum of\nequal to\n. The values of\nand\nwere 0.9\u2009ms and 5.1\u2009ms respectively, based on AMPAergic currents from pyramidal neurons of the rat prefrontal cortex.\n78\nfor phasic excitatory inputs was set to a value of 200\u2009pS.\nTwo hundred phasic inhibitory inputs were modeled using\nEquation (9)\n. The firing frequency of phasic inhibitory input was set to 5\u2009Hz.\n86\nThese inputs had a rise time constant of 0.88\u2009ms and a decay time constant of 9.4\u2009ms, which were taken from inhibitory post-synaptic current (IPSC) recordings of pyramidal neurons of the rat visual cortex.\n79\nPhasic inhibitory inputs were modeled with a\nof 600\u2009pS, threefold greater than that of phasic excitatory inputs, closely replicating the excitatory-IPSC ratio of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons.\n87\nTonic inhibitory background inputs were modeled with a conductance value of 350\u2009pS\n80\n,\n88\nusing the following equation\n89\n:\nwhere\nis the tonic inhibitory current,\nis the tonic inhibitory conductance, and\nis the chloride reversal potential.\n\nModeling of increase in extracellular potassium and intracellular chloride\nTBI is characterized by increases in the concentration of both extracellular potassium and intracellular chloride.\n22\n,\n57\n,\n58\nThe effect of changes in the concentration of these ionic species on the excitability of the neuron were modeled using the Nernst and Goldman equations.\n5\u20137\n,\n84\nIncrease in extracellular potassium affects the Nernst potential of potassium ions as well as the resting membrane potential. The effect of extracellular potassium increase on the potassium reversal potential was modeled according to the following equation\n5\u20137\n,\n84\n:\nwhere\nR\nis the gas constant (8.314\u2009J K\n\u2212\n1\nmol\n\u2212\n1\n),\nT\nis the temperature in Kelvin,\nF\nis Faraday's constant (96485 C mol\n\u2212\n1\n),\nZ\nis the valence of the ion,\nis the extracellular potassium concentration,\nis the intracellular potassium concentration, and\nE\nK\nis the reversal potential of potassium.\nThe effect of increase in extracellular potassium on the resting membrane potential was modeled according to the Goldman equation\n84\n,\n90\n:\nwhere\np\nk\n,\nand\nare the relative permeability of potassium, sodium, and chloride ions respectively (1 : 0.04 : 0.45).\n90\nand\nare the extracellular sodium and chloride ion concentration respectively, and\nE\nl\nis the leak reversal potential.\nand\nare the intracellular sodium and chloride ion concentration respectively. Extracellular and intracellular concentration of various ions at resting conditions are given as follows:\n,\n.\nR, T, Z,\nand\nF\nfollow the same schema as described previously.\nIncreases in the concentration of intracellular chloride ions affect the reversal potential of chloride through the following equation:\nwhere\nE\nCl\nis the reversal potential of chloride ions.\n,\n,\nR, T, Z,\nand\nF\nfollow the same schema as listed previously. Increases in intracellular chloride also affects the resting membrane potential as shown in\nEquation (12)\n.\n\nModeling of drug conditions\nIn this study, we tested the efficacy of GABA\nA\nreceptor agonists alone and in combination with an NKCC1 co-transporter blocker to determine if these drugs can rescue the RS neuron model from depolarization block. GABA\nA\nreceptor agonists were modeled as twofold increases in the maximal synaptic conductance of phasic inhibitory inputs based on experiments that show that a GABA\nA\nagonist increases phasic inhibitory single channel conductance by two- to sevenfold.\n91\nNKCC1 co-transporter blocker was modeled as a 95% decrease in the elevated levels of intracellular chloride according to the following equation:\nwhere\nis the concentration of intracellular chloride,\nis the initial concentration of intracellular chloride (6\u2009mM), and the value of percentage decrease is 0.95. All simulations were run using a range of these parameters, with no change in the qualitative results.\nWe also probed the mechanisms behind the neuroprotective efficacy of inverse agonists of GABA\nA\nreceptors in cerebral ischemia.\n92\nGABA\nA\nreceptor inverse agonist was modeled as an 80% reduction in the maximal synaptic conductance of phasic GABAergic inputs.\n93\n\nModeling of bicarbonate dependent GABA\nA\nconductance\nWe separately modeled the ionic mechanisms responsible for activity dependent membrane depolarization mediated by GABAergic activity.\n94\nThe GABA\nA\ncurrent in these simulations was modeled using the following equations\n95\n:\nwhere\nis the chloride ion mediated GABAergic current,\nis the bicarbonate ion mediated GABAergic current, and\n,\nare their respective reversal potentials.\nP\nis the relative permeability of bicarbonate ion through the GABA\nA\nreceptor.\nP\nwas set to a value of 0.2, consistent with published estimates.\n96\n.\nfollows the same schema as in\nequation (9)\n.\n\nModeling of GABAergic activity induced change in the concentration of anions\nThe anionic concentrations (chloride and bicarbonate) in the intra- and extracellular compartments were updated from their respective currents at each time step of the simulation.\nThe change in the concentration of chloride ions as a result of GABAergic inputs and their decay back to resting values were modeled according to the following equations.\n30\n,\n95\nIn this schema,\nand\nwere updated at each time step as follows:\nSimilarly,\nand\nwere updated at each time step of the simulation using the following equations:\nwhere\nis the ratio of extracellular volume to intracellular volume, also known as the volume fraction.\n97\nThe value of\nwas set to 0.1429,\n30\n,\n40\n,\n97\n,\n98\nmimicking the relative proportion of extracellular volume (14.29% of intracellular volume) under normal conditions when osmotic forces are non-existent.\naids the conversion from current units to concentration units,\n30\nwhere S is the surface area of the neuron, V is its volume, and F is the Faraday's constant.\nwas set to 3\u2009s to mimic the physiological chloride ion decay to resting levels (extrusion).\n95\n,\n99\nRegeneration of\nin the simulations was facilitated by setting\nto 0.1\u2009ms, while the regeneration was blocked by setting\nto 10\u2009s.\nand\nare the extracellular concentrations of the respective ionic species at resting conditions.\n100\nSimilarly,\nand\nare the intracellular concentrations of the respective ionic species at rest.\n100\nThe anionic reversal potentials were also updated at each time step using the Nernst equation (Eqn [13]). Equations (18)\u2013(21) ensure that the total number of chloride (and bicarbonate ions) inside and outside the neuron is conserved throughout the duration of the simulation.\n30\n\nData analysis\nAll simulations were performed using the NEURON 7.5 simulation environment.\n101\nSpike times and membrane potential were recorded with a sampling frequency of 40,000\u2009Hz and analyzed using custom routines written in MATLAB 2017B (\nwww.mathworks.com\n).\nWe considered the model neuron to have entered depolarization block when the mean peak height of its spikes was < \u221220\u2009mV during a 1\u2009sec simulation run. To determine if the model reached our threshold of depolarization block, we injected direct current (DC) in steps of 20\u2009pA amplitude up to 4 nA. The minimum current that produced spikes below \u221220\u2009mV was categorized as I\nDB\n. Other values of depolarization block thresholds (0\u2009mV, 5\u2009mV, 10\u2009mV) yielded results that were qualitatively similar. Firing rate was calculated as the number of spikes during a 1\u2009sec simulation run of the model. Membrane potential was calculated by taking the median of all membrane potential data points during a 1\u2009sec simulation run of the model. The percentage change in I\nDB\nof the neuron model in the presence of the drug(s) was computed from seven different model runs according to the following equation:\nwhere\nis the I\nDB\nof the neuron model in the presence of the drug(s) and\nis the I\nDB\nof the neuron model under drug-free conditions. Similarly, the percentage change in the median membrane potential of the neuron model in the presence of the drug(s) was computed from seven different model runs according to the following equation:\nwhere\nV\nm\nrepresents the median membrane potential."

    "Methods": "Animals and surgery\nAdult male (250-300\u2009g; Harlan) and female SD rats (200-250\u2009g; Harlan;\nn\n=\u200926) were housed in controlled conditions with a 12:12 light:dark schedule, and\nad libitum\naccess to food and water. Prior to surgery, the animals were anesthetized with ketamine (40\u2009mg/kg)/xylazine (5\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneally), and inflicted with either a laminectomy only or a moderate midline contusive SCI as described previously.\n14\n,\n15\nBriefly, a customized vertebral stabilizer\n16\nwas set to support the 10th thoracic vertebrae (T10) and a laminectomy was performed to expose the spinal cord surface. With dura intact, the NYU/MASCIS Impactor\n17\n(2.5\u2009mm tip, 10\u2009g weight) dropped from a height of 12.5\u2009mm was used to inflict a moderate bilateral injury. Parameters of displacement and velocity ensuring spinal cord contusion using the NYU/MASCIS impactor are shown in\nFigure 1\n. Sham-operated animals received laminectomy only. Following surgery, animals received an injection of 3\u2009mL 0.9% saline subcutaneously for hydration and were placed in temperature-controlled housing overnight for monitoring recovery. All surgical and animal handling procedures were performed as approved under the\nGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\n(National Research Council) and the Guidelines of the Indiana University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nMale and female spinal cord injury (SCI) impact data from the NYU/MASCIS impactor. During spinal cord contusion impact, males and females showed similar average velocity values at cord impact (\nA\n;\np\n>\u20090.05) and spinal cord displacement values (\nB\n;\np\n>\u20090.05). In addition, little variation in values within groups was observed for these parameters. These findings indicate that contusions were consistent within and between groups. Sham:\nn\n=\u20095/gender/group. SCI:\nn\n=\u20098/gender/group.\n\nBehavioral assessments\nTo assess long-term functional recovery or deficit differences and similarities between age-matched male and female SD rats post-SCI, animals were divided into four groups: male sham (\nn\n=\u20095), male SCI (\nn\n=\u20098), female sham (\nn\n=\u20095), and female SCI (\nn\n=\u20098). We conducted behavioral tests including the Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB)\n18\nlocomotor rating scale, Hargreaves test of nociceptive thermal sensation of the hindpaws,\n19\nand Gridwalk assessments of sensorimotor coordination for 9 weeks post-SCI. Animals were weighed weekly through Week 6 of the study (\nFig. 2\n). At the end of the study, all animals were sacrificed, their spinal cords harvested, and tissues prepared for histologic analysis.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nMale and female weight changes before and after spinal cord injury (SCI). Males weighed more at the start of the study (7 weeks old, \u223c260\u2009g) compared with females (7 weeks old, \u223c180\u2009g). Males continued to increase in weight at a greater rate than females until SCI at 9 weeks of age. For the first 2 weeks following SCI, males dropped a small but significant percentage of weight (\np\n<\u20090.05) and recovered it compared with uninjured males by Week 3 post-injury. By comparison, female rats did not lose any weight following SCI with a similar growth trend as uninjured female rats until Week 6 post-SCI. *\np\n<\u20090.05 compared with male SCI rats. Sham:\nn\n=\u20095/gender/group. SCI:\nn\n=\u20098/gender/group.\n\nBBB locomotor rating scale\nHindlimb locomotor functional recovery was assessed using the BBB locomotor rating scale.\n18\nBBB testing was performed prior to surgery as a baseline measurement, and was assessed at 2 days and weekly thereafter until 9 weeks following SCI. Briefly, all rats were allowed to roam freely in a 42-inch diameter open field and observed for 4\u2009min by two trained individuals blinded to the experimental groups. The scores determined for the rats during observation ranged from 0 (no hindlimb movement) to 21 (normal locomotor function) based on overall hindlimb movement, joint movement, stepping, coordinated locomotion, and other factors.\n\nGridwalk analysis\nGridwalk analysis was performed to assess sensorimotor function as previously described.\n20\u201322\nFor this test, rats were allowed to freely navigate over a 3 foot\u2009\u00d7\u20093 foot plastic mesh grid with 4.5\u2009\u00d7\u20095.0\u2009cm spaces. The rats were required to walk for a minimum of 30\u2009sec up to 3\u2009min maximum for the testing period. All groups were tested at Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 9 post-SCI. For this assessment, rats were observed by two individuals blind to the experimental groups and the total number of hindlimb footfalls were documented. One footfall was defined as a drop of the hindlimb through a space (including the ankle joint) below the level of the grid.\n\nHargreaves test\nAt 2, 4, 6, and 9 weeks post-SCI or sham operation, thermal hindpaw sensation was measured in the rats using a plantar heat testing device (IITC Life Sciences, Inc., Woodland, CA) as described by Hargreaves and colleagues.\n19\nBriefly, the rats were placed in clear rectangular Plexiglas containers on a transparent glass plate. After allowing the rats to acclimate to the environment for 10\u2009min, the plantar surface of the hindpaw was exposed to a noxious infrared light beam, and latency in paw withdrawal was recorded in seconds. To avoid injury to the paw tissue, the light stimulus had a maximum exposure time of 30\u2009sec before automatic shut off. Five trials, with a minimum 1-min interval between trials, were performed for both right and left hindpaws of each rat. The highest and lowest latency score for each paw were discarded to minimize variability caused by initial and final stimulus exposures and the remaining middle three scores averaged for one mean latency score per paw per animal at each time-point.\n\nHistological analyses\nWe used cresyl violet\u2013eosin stain to quantify spinal cord lesion volume, and Luxol fast blue to determine spared myelin volume surrounding the lesion in the injured cord according to previously published methods.\n23\n,\n24\n\nImmunofluorescence labeling and analysis of astrocyte, microglia, and macrophage response\nImmunofluorescence labeling of lesioned spinal cord tissue was performed as previously described.\n23\n,\n24\nIn brief, a section at the epicenter and 1.5\u2009mm rostral and caudal to the epicenter were chosen per animal and adjacent serial sections were selected for each cellular immunolabeling procedure. For immunofluorescence labeling, sections were hydrated in 0.1\u2009M phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with PBS +0.1% TritonX-100 (PBST; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and blocked with PBST +10% normal goat serum (blocking buffer) to inhibit non-specific antibody labeling. Then, sections spanning the lesion epicenter was incubated with one of the following primary antibodies in blocking buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C: chicken anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:1000; Aves Inc., Tigard, OR) to label reactive astrocytes, rabbit anti-ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1; 1:500; Wako, Japan) to label reactive microglia, and mouse anti-ED1 (1:500, Millipore) to label macrophages. The next day, the tissues were washed and incubated with respective fluorophore-conjugated goat-anti chicken, rabbit, or mouse secondary antibodies (1:200; Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) for 1\u2009h at room temperature. The sections were then washed and mounted with Prolong Gold Anti-Fade mounting medium with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA).\nFor quantifying GFAP and Iba1 labeling, the intensity of labeling of the selected sections was measured using Image J software (National Institutes of Health [NIH], Bethesda, MD). In brief, a section at the epicenter, one section 1.5\u2009mm rostral and one 1.5\u2009mm caudal to the epicenter were selected for immunolabeling intensity measurement. Immunofluorescent images of the selected sections were acquired at equal exposure settings for each animal. To measure immunolabeling intensity, the labeled tissue section was outlined in ImageJ, converted to grayscale and mean gray value measured in the selected region of interest (the outlined tissue section). The values of all animals per gender at each location were averaged and graphed in GraphPad Prism 7.0 software (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). For quantifying ED1 labeling of macrophages, ED1+ area relative to the spinal cord section area was quantified with Image J. Briefly, selection of ED1-labeled tissue sections followed the protocol described for GFAP and Iba1 labeling. To quantify ED1 labeling, we measured percent ED1+ labeled area relative to the outlined tissue section area by setting threshold values (equivalent for all selected sections) and measuring all positive-labeled areas. Image J provided percent ED1+ area per tissue section. Percent ED1+ area per group and location were then averaged and graphed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 software. All images were taken on an Olympus BX60 epifluorescent microscope and Neurolucida software (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT).\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data are represented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean. Histological data between Sham and SCI injured groups were assessed via Student's t-test. Behavioral data were analyzed using repeated measures two-way analysis of variance with Tukey\npost hoc\ntest. To determine if weight influenced functional recovery scores, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed using BBB scores as the dependent variable. Statistical significance was determined when\np\n<\u20090.05. Most data were analyzed using Graph Pad Prism 7.0 software (GraphPad Software Inc.), although ANCOVA of weight influence on BBB score outcomes was performed using XLStat software (Addinsoft, New York, NY)."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nEighty-four adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) weighing 300\u2013325\u2009g on the day of surgery were pair-housed in ventilated polycarbonate cages and maintained in a temperature- (21\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C) and light-controlled (on 7:00\nam\nto 7:00\npm\n) controlled environment with\nad libitum\nfood and water. After 1 week of acclimatization all rats underwent a single day of beam-walk training, which consisted of 3\u20135 trials to reach the criterion of traversing the length of the beam in under 5\u2009sec. After training, the rats were randomly assigned to TBI + STD + daily VEH (1.0\u2009mL/kg;\nn\n=\u200910), TBI + EE + daily VEH (\nn\n=\u200910), TBI + STD + daily HAL (0.5\u2009mg/kg;\nn\n=\u200910), TBI + EE + daily HAL (\nn\n=\u200910), TBI + STD + intermittent HAL (\nn\n=\u200910), TBI + EE + intermittent HAL (\nn\n=\u200910), and respective sham controls (\nn\n=\u20094 per condition;\nN\n=\u200924). All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, PA). Every attempt was made to limit the number of rats used and to minimize suffering.\n\nSurgery\nA CCI injury was produced as previously described.\n26\u201330\n,\n33\nBriefly, surgical anesthesia was induced and maintained with 4% and 2% isoflurane, respectively, in 2:1\u2009N\n2\nO:O\n2\n. Rats were intubated and mechanically ventilated before being secured in a stereotaxic frame. Utilizing aseptic procedures, a midline scalp incision was made, the skin and fascia were reflected to expose the skull, and a craniectomy was made with a dental drill in the right hemisphere over the parietal cortex. The impacting rod was extended and the impact tip (6\u2009mm, flat) was centered and lowered through the craniectomy until it contacted the dura mater, then the rod was retracted and the impact tip was advanced 2.8\u2009mm farther to produce an injury of moderate severity (2.8\u2009mm brain deformation at 4\u2009m/s). Except for the cortical impact, sham controls experienced all surgical procedures. Body temperature was maintained at 37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u00b0C with a heating blanket and recorded with a rectal thermistor. Immediately after the CCI or sham injury, anesthesia was discontinued, the incision was sutured, rats were extubated, and acute neurological evaluations were conducted.\n\nAcute neurological assessments\nImmediately after the termination of anesthesia, hindlimb reflexive ability was assessed by gently squeezing the rats' paw every 5\u2009sec and recording the time to elicit a withdrawal response. The time required to turn from the supine to prone position on three consecutive attempts was the criterion for return of the righting reflex. These tests are sensitive indicators of injury severity and duration of anesthesia.\n26\u201330\n\nHousing conditions: environmental manipulation\nAfter surgery, and after the effects of anesthesia abated (as evidenced by spontaneous movement in the holding cage), rats were returned to the colony where those designated for enrichment were immediately placed in specifically designed stainless steel-wire cages (91\u2009\u00d7\u200976\u2009\u00d7\u200950\u2009cm). EE cages consisted of three levels with ladders to ambulate from one level to another and contained various toys and objects with which to engage (e.g., balls, blocks, and tubes) and\nad libitum\nfood and water.\n31\n,\n32\n,\n34\n,\n35\nTo maintain novelty, objects were rearranged every day and changed each time the cage was cleaned, which took place 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009per week. Ten to 12 rats, which included HAL and vehicle-treated TBI and sham controls, were housed in the EE together to minimize variability. Rats in the STD conditions were placed in typical ventilated polycarbonate cages (37\u2009\u00d7\u200925\u2009\u00d7\u200918\u2009cm, 2 rats per cage) with only food and water.\n\nDrug administration\nHAL (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was prepared daily by dissolving in 20% dimethyl sulfoxide, which also served as the VEH. The dose of HAL was chosen because it has been reported to be comparable to that used clinically to control psychosis\n36\nand has been used in several TBI studies investigating functional outcome.\n24\n,\n26\u201330\nTreatments began 24\u2009h after CCI or sham surgery and were provided intraperitoneally (i.p.) either once-daily for 19 days (daily treatment TBI and sham groups) or once every other day (intermittent treatment TBI and sham groups). The half-life of HAL in rats using this dose and route is reported to be 2.6\u2009h,\n37\nand thus it was provided\nafter\nthe daily behavioral assessments to circumvent sedative effects, which may confound the results. However, the biological effect of HAL was active during the exposure to EE.\n\nMotor performance\nMotor function was assessed using the well-established beam-balance and beam-walk tasks.\n26\u201330\nBriefly, the beam-balance task consisted of placing the rat on an elevated (90\u2009cm) narrow beam (1.5\u2009cm wide) and recording the time it remained on for a maximum of 60\u2009sec. The beam-walk task, modified from Feeney and colleagues\n21\nand used extensively in our laboratory,\n26\u201330\nconsists of training/assessing rats using a negative-reinforcement paradigm to escape bright light and white noise by traversing an elevated narrow beam (2.5\u2009cm wide\u2009\u00d7\u2009100\u2009cm long) and entering a darkened goal box at the opposite end. Beam-walk performance was assessed by recording the elapsed time to traverse the beam as well as distance traveled. The scoring criteria for distance traveled is based on a rating scale from 0 to 5, where 0 indicates an inability to ambulate beyond the start point, 1\u20134 corresponds to distal segments of 20, 40, 60, or 80\u2009cm from the starting point, respectively, and 5 indicates walking down the entire length of the beam (100\u2009cm) and entering the goal box. Rats were trained before CCI or sham injury to perform the tasks without errors (i.e., maintain their balance for 60\u2009sec and traverse the beam in under 5\u2009sec). A baseline performance assessment was taken on the day of surgery. Performance on the beam tasks was assessed on post-operative days 1\u20135 and consisted of three trials (60\u2009sec allotted time per trial) per day on each task. Average daily scores for each subject were used in the statistical analyses.\n\nCognitive function: acquisition of spatial learning\nSpatial learning was assessed in a MWM task that has consistently been shown to be sensitive to cognitive performance after TBI.\n26\u201330\n,\n38\n,\n39\nThe maze was a plastic pool (180\u2009cm diameter; 60\u2009cm high) filled with tap water (26\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C) to a depth of 28\u2009cm and was situated in a room with salient visual cues that remained constant throughout the study. The escape platform was a clear Plexiglas stand (10\u2009cm diameter, 26\u2009cm high) that was positioned 26\u2009cm from the maze wall in the southwest quadrant and held constant for each rat. Spatial learning began on post-operative day 14 and consisted of providing a block of four daily trials (4-min intertrial interval) for 5 consecutive days (14\u201318) to locate the platform when it was submerged 2\u2009cm below the water surface. On day 19, the platform was made visible to the rats by raising it 2\u2009cm above the water surface as a control procedure to determine the contributions of non-spatial factors (e.g., sensory-motor performance, motivation, and visual acuity) on cognitive performance. For each daily block of trials, rats were placed in the pool facing the wall at each of the four possible start locations (north, south, west, and east) in a randomized manner. Each trial lasted until the rat climbed onto the platform or until 120\u2009sec had elapsed, whichever occurred first. Rats that failed to escape the water within the allotted time were manually guided to the platform. All rats remained on the platform for 30\u2009sec before being placed in a heated incubator between trials. The times of the four daily trials for each rat were averaged and used in the statistical analyses. All data were obtained using ANY-maze video tracking software (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL).\n\nCognitive function: probe trial (memory retention)\nOne day after the final acquisition training session (i.e., day 19), but before the visible platform test, all rats were given a single probe trial to assess memory retention. Briefly, the platform was removed from the pool and the rats were placed in the maze from the quadrant opposite of where the platform was previously situated (i.e., \u201ctarget quadrant\u201d) and allowed to freely explore the pool for 30\u2009sec. The percent time spent in the target quadrant was used in the statistical analysis as a measure of intact memory.\n\nHistology: quantification of cortical lesion volume\nThree weeks after CCI or sham injury, the rats were anesthetized with Fatal-Plus\n\u00ae\n(0.3\u2009mL, i.p.) and perfused transcardially with 200\u2009mL of 0.1\u2009M of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) followed by 300\u2009mL of 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were extracted, post-fixed in the perfusate for 1 week, dehydrated with alcohols, and embedded in paraffin. Coronal sections (7\u2009\u03bcm thick) were cut at 1-mm intervals through the lesion on a rotary microtome and mounted on Superfrost\n\u00ae\n/Plus glass microscope slides. After drying at room temperature, sections were deparaffinized in xylenes, rehydrated, and stained with cresyl violet. Cortical lesion volumes (mm\n3\n) were determined by calculating the area of the lesion (mm\n2\n), which was done by outlining the inferred area of missing cortical tissue for each section (typically 5\u20137) taken at 1-mm intervals (MCID; Imaging Research, Inc., St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada), and then by summing the lesions obtained from each section as previously reported.\n40\u201344\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data were collected by experimenters blinded to treatment conditions and statistical analyses were performed using Statview software (version 5.0.1; SAS Institute Inc., Cary NC). Motor and cognitive data were analyzed by repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Acute neurological assessments, swim speed, and cortical lesion volume were analyzed by one-factor ANOVAs. When the overall ANOVAs revealed a significant effect, the Newman-Keuls post-hoc test was used to determine group differences. Data are presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM) and are considered significant when corresponding\np\nvalues are \u22640.05."

All mice that received visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were used for histological analysis.\n\nOptic nerve histology\nAfter perfusion, the proximal segment of optic nerve was collected, post-fixed in glutaraldehyde, and embedded in Resin 812 and Araldite 502 (catalog numbers 14900 and 10900, respectively; Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) according to previously published protocol.\n41\n,\n44\u201346\nOne-micron-thick sections were collected on a Leica EM-UC7 microtome (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and stained with 1% paraphenylenediamine and 1% toluidine blue. Cross-sections were imaged on a Nikon Eclipse Ni-E microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY) using a 100\u2009\u00d7\u2009oil immersion objective. Total and degenerating axons were quantified in an average of seven nerves/group using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). A grid was used to count 20% of the optic nerve cross-sectional surface area to avoid bias. In addition, tissues were assigned numbers and the investigator performing the axon counts was masked to the identity of the samples.\n\nStatistical analysis\nGraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA) was used to perform statistical analysis of all data.

    "Methods": "Animals\nThe study was performed according to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines in compliance with National Institutes of Health (NIH; Bethesda, MD) guidelines. Adult Sabra male mice (Harlan, Jerusalem, Israel) ages 6 to 8 weeks and weighing 40\u201345\u2009g were used, unless otherwise stated. The animals were housed in individual cages during the testing period under controlled temperature and light conditions. During the entire experiment, they had free access to food and water. Knockout experiments were performed in male C57Bl/6 wild type (WT) mice (age 6\u20138 weeks; Harlan), which served as controls for CB\n2\nreceptor\u2013deficient mice (CB\n2\n-/-\n) with C57Bl/6 strain background, generously provided by Professor Itai Bab. A dose\u2013response experiment was performed in C57Bl/6 WT mice, which was designed to evaluate the therapeutic dose of the tested compound, HU-914, in the particular mice strain. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250\u2013300\u2009g; Harlan) were used for the corticospinal tract study.\n\nClosed-head injury model\nExperimental closed-head injury (CHI) was induced by using a weight-drop device previously developed in our laboratory.\n34\n,\n35\nUnder isoflurane anesthesia, a midline longitudinal incision was performed, the skin was retracted, and the skull was exposed. The left anterior frontal area was identified, a tipped Teflon cone was placed 2\u2009mm lateral to the midline and 1\u2009mm caudal to the left coronal suture, and a metal rod (200\u2009g for rats and 95\u2009g for mice) was dropped down on the cone from a pre-adjusted height (according to body weight of each animal), resulting in a focal injury to the left hemisphere. After trauma, the mice received supporting oxygenation with 95% O\n2\nfor no longer than 2\u2009min and were then returned to their cages. Sham controls were anesthetized and their scalps were incised, but they were not subjected to CHI. It is noteworthy that <10% of the injured mice were excluded from the study, mostly because of death by apnea within minutes of injury.\n\nNeurological Severity Score\nThe functional neurological status of mice after CHI was determined by Neurological Severity Score (NSS), a 10-point scale based on the ability to perform motor and behavioral tasks.\n36\nOne point is awarded for failing to perform a task; scores range from 0 (complete success) to 10 (complete failure). The severity of injury was determined by the NSS evaluated at 1\u2009h after CHI and referred to as NSS (1\u2009h). Only mice with NSS (1\u2009h) of 6\u20138 points (moderate TBI) were included in the study (< 10% were excluded on that basis). Immediately after evaluation of NSS, mice were randomly assigned to treatment groups and NSS was reevaluated during a time course indicated for each experiment. The extent of the recovery, \u0394NSS, was used to present the neurological improvement and is calculated as the difference between the NSS at 1\u2009h and NSS evaluated at any subsequent time-point after the trauma. Animals were scored by one observer who was blinded to the treatment groups. It should be noted that the functional neurological status of rats was determined by NSS on a 16-point scale (and not by the 10-point scale used for mice).\n\nDrug administration\nHU-910 and HU-914 were synthesized by a procedure described by Magid and colleagues\n30\u201332\nDose\u2013response experiments were performed in the range of 0.1\u201310\u2009mg/kg for HU-910, and 5 and 10\u2009mg/kg for HU-914, unless otherwise stated. To evaluate whether the CB\n2\nreceptor was involved in the neuroprotective effects exerted by HU-910 and HU-914, CB\n2\nselective antagonists/inverse agonists SR144528 1\u2009mg/kg\n37\n,\n38\nand AM630 1\u2009mg/kg\n39\n,\n40\nwere administered alone or together with the tested compounds. The time window for the drug administration was determined in the preliminary experiments. All drugs, dissolved in ethanol:cremophor:saline 1:1:18, or vehicle alone, were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) 1\u2009h after injury. In the experiment with AM630, due to insolubility of the compound in ethanol, the drugs were dissolved in 0.75% Tween 20, 0.75% dimethylsulfoxide and saline.\n\nEvaluation of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 levels\nTumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 levels were analyzed 4\u2009h after injury or sham. Cortical (\u223c50\u2009mg) and hippocampal (\u223c15\u2009mg) tissue segments from the ipsilateral hemisphere were immersed in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221278\u00b0C until assayed. Tissue segments were homogenized in ice-cold buffer, 10\u2009w/v ratio, containing 50\u2009mM Tris-HCl, 1\u2009mM EDTA, 1\u2009mM EGTA, 0.5\u2009mM Na\n3\nVO\n4\n, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 50\u2009mM NaF, 5\u2009mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10\u2009mM sodium \u03b2-glyceropyrophosphate, 0.1\u2009mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000\u2009rpm for 20\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. Following determination of protein content according to Bradford method (BioRad Laboratories, Munich, Germany), the resulting supernatants were frozen at \u221278\u00b0C until enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis. TNF-\u03b1 levels were measured in triplicates using a Duo Set ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).\n\nEvaluation of synaptophysin levels: subcellular fractionation and Western blot analysis\nBoth cortex and hippocampus were dissected and homogenized 1:10 in homogenization buffer (320\u2009mM sucrose, 10\u2009mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1\u2009mM EDTA, 1\u2009mM EGTA, protease inhibitor mixture; Sigma). Subcellular fractionation was performed as described previously.\n41\nBriefly, homogenates were centrifuged at 1000\u2009g for 5\u2009min at 4\u00b0C to remove nuclei and large debris. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 10,000\u2009g for 30\u2009min to obtain a crude synaptosomal fraction (pellet denominated P2 and supernatant denominated S2). A total of 5\u2009\u03bcg protein of S2 fraction were loaded in 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with synaptophysin 1:10,000 primary antibody (Chemicon, MAB 5258-20\u2009uG) and then incubated (1\u2009h at room temperature) with anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch 315-035003).\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging studies\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were performed on a 7.0 T/30\u2009cm horizontal bore Bruker Biospec (Karlsruhe, Germany) MRI scanner equipped with a gradient system capable of producing gradient pulses of up to 400\u2009mT/m. A body coil was used as the transmit coil and a quadrature coil (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) dedicated for the mouse brain was used as the receiving coil. Anesthesia was induced with \u223c4% isoflurane (Vetmarket Ltd., Petah Tikva, Israel) and maintained with 1\u20132% isoflurane in 95% O\n2\nat a flow rate of 0.3\u20130.5\u2009L/h. Respiratory rate was monitored throughout the entire MRI experiments and was maintained between 30\u201360 breaths/min. Body temperature was maintained by a feedback system of circulating water at 39\u00b0C. MRI experiments were performed on Days 1 and 36 post-trauma. The MRI experiments consisted of T\n2\nweighted images acquired with the following parameters: RARE12 repetition time/echo time\u2009=\u20093500/70\u2009msec, field of view of 1.8\u2009\u00d7\u20091.8\u2009cm\n2\n, matrix size of 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009128 zero filled to 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256 resulting in an in-plane resolution of 70\u2009\u00d7\u200970 (\u03bcm)\n2\n, and the number of scans was eight. Nine contiguous coronal slices of 0.9\u2009mm thickness were collected from each animal. The collected images were analyzed by summation of all hypo-intense and hyperintense pixels in the ipsilateral hemisphere relative to the contralateral hemisphere. The brain damage was reported by expressing the percentage difference in the hypo-intense and hyperintense pixels observed at Day 1 and Day 36 ((d1-d36)/d1)*100. Damage evaluation was performed blindly by two independent examiners.\n\nAnterograde tracing of corticospinal tract\nFourteen days after induction of CHI, rats were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (0.85/0.15, 0.1\u2009mL/100\u2009g body weight). To expose the right uninjured sensorimotor cortex, a 4\u2009mm\n2\ncraniotomy was performed in an area bordered anteriorly by the bregma suture and medially by the central suture.\n42\nBiotinylated dextran amine (BDA 10,000\u2009MW, 10% w/v; Invitrogen) in phosphate-buffered saline was injected stereotaxically using a 10\u2009\u03bcL Hamilton syringe (26\u2009G). The injections were conducted into 12 points, one mm distant from one another. At each point the BDA was injected at depths of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0\u2009mm and the volume injected was 0.2, 0.4, and 0.2\u2009\u03bcL respectively. The skin was sutured in place and 5\u2009mL of saline was subcutaneously injected.\n\nTissue preparation and histology\nTwenty-one days after BDA injection, the rats were re-anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and perfused transcardially with 0.9% saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brain and spinal cord were removed as one unit and post-fixed in PFA at 4\u00b0C for 24\u2009h, then transferred to 30% sucrose solution at 4\u00b0C for at least 1 week. Tissue from the lumbar area of the spinal cord was embedded in OCT (Tissue-Tek, USA), 50\u2009mm free-floating coronal sections were cut using a microtome cryostat (Microm HM 505E, Microm International, GmBH), and sections were transferred into cryobuffer solution (potassium acetate, polyvinylpyrrolidone 40K and ethylene glycol in DDW). To visualize the trajectory of the corticospinal tract (CST) axons, avidin-biotin complex conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Vectastain Elite ABC Kit, Vector Laboratories) was used and further reacted with the glucose oxidase-nickel DAB technique. Stained sections were mounted on glass slides (Super Frost plus, Fisher). BDA-labeled axons were identified ipsilaterally to the injection site. The number and length of these midline-crossing axons were quantified using ImageJ software. The central canal and dorsal median fissure were used as midline landmarks.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software Inc.). The data are expressed as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean. \u0394NSS values expressing the neurobehavioral evaluation were compared between the experimental groups and statistical significance was determined at the selected time-points using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. Statistical significance for the quantification of TNF-\u03b1 was calculated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett's test. A value of\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Study design\nSubjects were prospectively enrolled through the University of Pittsburgh Brain-Trauma Research Center protocol. Informed consent was obtained from legal authorized representatives. Inclusion criteria were: being between 16 and 80 years of age, having sTBI with admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score <9 and an external ventricular drain (EVD) per standard institutional clinical protocol. Exclusion criteria were imminent brain death and pregnancy. A total of 435 subjects were consecutively enrolled between 2006 and 2014. The University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board approved the study.\n\nDNA collection and genotyping\nPer our previously published protocol, DNA was obtained and extracted from white blood cells by the simple-salting out method.\n5\nGenotyping was performed using Illumina (Human-Core Exome v1.0) multiplex platform by the Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR) and included 11 SNPs distributed across\nTRPM4\n: rs11667393, rs3760666, rs113984787, rs146564314, rs1477363, rs10410857, rs56355369, rs909010, rs145847114, rs8104571, and rs150391806. SNPs were not identified\na priori.\nSNP selection was unbiased and included all available TRPM4 SNPs covered by the Illumina Human-Core Exome v1.0 chip. Data cleaning and quality control included blind technical duplicates, Hardy\u2013Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) testing, and exclusion of SNPs that did not have a minimum 95% call rate. Principal-component analysis demonstrated that most participants clustered as Caucasian with the small numbers outside of that cluster being too few to analyze. After quality control exclusion of 50 samples, genotypes for 385 patients were included in the analysis.\nABCC8\nSNPs in this TBI cohort had previously been genotyped per our published protocol and evaluated for associations with ICP and outcome; significant\nABCC8\nSNPs were evaluated for interactions with\nTRPM4\nSNPs in this analysis.\n4\n,\n5\nCIDR research assistants involved in genotyping SNPs were blinded to demographic and outcome data.\n\nClinical data collection\nTwo previously established outcome measures were investigated.\n5\n,\n14\n1.\nHourly ICP (continuous), subcategorized into average and peak ICP (typically 5 days of neuromonitoring at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center), as well as proportion of ICP spikes >25\u2009mm Hg. Each hourly measurement was a point value obtained at the end of the hour. Proportion of ICP >25\u2009mm Hg per patient was calculated by total number of ICP measurements >25\u2009mm Hg for the specific patient divided by their total number of ICP measurements recorded over 5 days. The threshold of 25\u2009mm Hg was selected because it evaluates the presence of intracranial hypertension regardless of the Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines defining intracranial hypertension as either 22 (4th edition) or 20 (3rd edition) mm Hg.\n19\n2.\nSix-month Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score (binary): favorable (GOS \u2265 4) versus unfavorable (GOS <4).\nSecondary analyses censoring ICP recordings based on timing of craniectomy (if present) were also performed. Because exact matches for hourly ICP recording relative to timing of surgery were unavailable, standard censors were applied as follows. For patients who received their craniectomy on the day of presentation, ICP recordings after the first 6\u2009h were censored, for patients who underwent craniectomy on post-TBI day 1, ICP recordings after the first 24\u2009h were censored, for patients who underwent craniectomy on post-TBI day 2, ICP recordings after the first 48\u2009h were censored, for patients who underwent craniectomy on post-TBI day 3, ICP recordings after the first 72\u2009h were censored, for patients who underwent craniectomy on post-TBI day 4, ICP recordings after the first 96\u2009h were censored, and for patients who underwent craniectomy on or after post-TBI day 5, or did not undergo craniectomy, all 120\u2009h of ICP recordings were retained.\n\nSpatial relationship modeling between\nABCC8\nand\nTRPM4\n(gene) regions and SUR1-TRPM4 (protein) structure\nChromosomal locations were determined using the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser, human genome assembly-38. Putative and canonical topology for human TRPM4 amino-acid sequence was obtained from PROTTER version-1.0, UniProt ID Q8TD43.\n20\nPeptide sequences encoded by specific exons were identified by Ensembl (release-92) and confirmed by the UCSC genome browser.\n21\nProtAnnot within the Integrated-Genome Browser identified TRPM4 protein annotations in the context of\nTRPM4\ngenomic sequence.\n22\nThe established TRPM4 3-dimensional electron microscopy structure (6BQV) was obtained from the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank.\n23\n,\n24\nUniversity of California, San Francisco Chimera was used to generate three-dimensional structures of TRPM4 with its regulatory associated subunit SUR1 (5WUA).\n25\n,\n26\n\nFunctional category of\nTRPM4\nSNPs\nPredicted functional effects for exonic-SNPs were investigated using PolyPhen, SIFT/PROVEAN, and MutPred2.\n27\u201329\nRegulomeDB and Ensembl's Varient Effect Predictor were used for intronic-SNPs.\n30\n,\n31\nSignificant and proxy-SNPs were evaluated for established clinical significance via PubMed, Embase, and ClinVar searches (see Supplementary Methods at at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n).\n\nStatistical analysis\nOutcome variables between SNP genotypes were compared using analysis of variance (F-test, ANOVA) and Fisher's exact test. Between-group comparisons were adjusted using Bonferroni's method. Pairwise linkage-disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs was determined using LDlink for proxy-SNPs.\n,\n32\nUnivariable linear and logistical regression models evaluated independent relationships between\nTRPM4\nSNPs and continuous or categorical outcomes. Basic multivariable regression models were developed with clinically relevant variables (age, gender, initial GCS score, presence of craniectomy) to control for confounders that could influence ICP and/or outcome. Expanded multivariable models also included pattern of primary injury, computed tomographic (CT) appearances (either collectively in expanded model-1, or with individual components separated out as independent predictors in expanded model-2; that is, cistern effacement, sulcal effacement, ventricular compression, midline shift, herniation), and (for clinical outcome), proportion of intracranial hypertension recordings >25\u2009mm Hg. Multiple imputations were used for missing data; models with and without multiple imputations are presented. Odds ratios (OR) and \u03b2-coefficients were based on genotype: homozygous-wild-type (AA), heterozygous (Ab), or homozygous-variant (bb). Multiple comparisons for the regression models were adjusted using the established Benjamin\u2013Yekutieli (B\u2013Y) method\n5\n,\n33\n,\n34\nyielding a significance threshold of\np\n=\u20090.01656. The likelihood ratio test compared full (with SNP) versus reduced (without SNP) models to test whether the inclusion of the respective SNP significantly added to model fit. The exact test assessed HWE. Weighted and unweighted gene risk scores were calculated for\nTRPM4\nand\nABCC8\nSNPs using a similar method as previously described by Lu and coworkers (see Supplementary Methods at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n).\n35\n,\n36\nAnalyses were performed using Stata 15.0 (StataCorp, TX) and RStudio Version 1.1.453."

    "Methods": "This study was performed under the approval of the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board with a U.S. Food and Drug Administration Investigational Device Exemption (IDE G150167), and all experiments were performed in accord with the regulations and guidelines of these regulatory bodies.\n\nSubject descriptions\nTwo males diagnosed with a sensorimotor complete, American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale Grade A (AIS-A) SCI\n38\nwere enrolled in this clinical trial (NCT02592668), and both provided written, informed consent to experimental procedures. Subject 1 was a 26-year-old male who sustained a T6 SCI during a snowmobile accident 3 years before study enrollment. Subject 2 was a 37-year-old male who sustained a T3 SCI from a fall 6 years before study enrollment. Data from subject 1 have been previously reported\n12\n; however, all data and analysis demonstrated in this report were not previously published.\n\nMotor training before to epidural electrical stimulation system implantation\nIn order to confirm that rehabilitation alone would not result in functional recovery, both subjects performed motor training for 6 months before implantation of the EES system. A detailed description of pre-surgical motor training for subject 1 was previously reported.\n12\nBriefly, subjects underwent approximately 60 motor training sessions performed over 22 weeks for approximately three sessions per week by a team of physical therapists and kinesiologists. Motor training sessions consisted of approximately 15\u2009min of lower extremity stretching, 45\u2009min of locomotor training on a treadmill, and 30\u2009min of balance and task-specific strengthening exercises. All motor training activities were performed with body weight support and trainer assistance provided as needed.\n\nSurgical approach to the spinal canal\nAfter general anesthesia, subjects were positioned prone using a Jackson surgical table and Mayfield head clamp. General anesthesia was maintained by intravenous delivery of propofol and fentanyl. Inhalation agents and neuromuscular blocking agents were avoided for purposes of intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring of spinal sensorimotor activity during EES trialing.\nA midline incision that spanned vertebrae T11\u2013L2 was made based on palpation of anatomical landmarks and fluoroscopy. After initial exposure, surgical dissection of back musculature continued through the lumbodorsal fascia to the level of the spinous processes in an avascular plane using electrocautery. Once the spinous processes were exposed, vertebral level was confirmed intraoperatively by inserting a radio-opaque marker in proximity to the spinous process followed by fluoroscopy. Next, subperiosteal dissection of the muscle from the spinous process down to the lamina and then laterally toward the facets was performed. Then, the T11\u201312 and L1\u20132 interspinous ligaments were severed and the spinous processes of T12 and L1 were removed with a rongeur. The facet joints of both locations were preserved to ensure spinal stability. The laminae were then thinned with a 4-mm diamond drill bit and removed by rongeurs. Finally, the ligamentum flavum was dissected free from the underlying dura.\n\nInitial positioning of the epidural electrical stimulation electrode array\nA 16-contact epidural electrode array (Specify 5-6-5; Medtronic, Fridley, MN) was passed through the T12\u2013L1 laminectomy and directed rostrally along the dorsal midline of the dura to span the T11\u2013L1 vertebrae (\nFig. 1\n). Insertion of the electrode to the adequate level was visualized through the L1\u20132 opening. T12\u2013L1 exposure provided access to the caudal portion of the array while the L1\u20132 opening provided access to the rostral portion, allowing array visualization and mediolateral array manipulation. To determine array integrity and compliance with surrounding tissue, the array was connected to an external pulse generator to capture impedance values at each electrode contact. Upon initial implantation, intraoperative fluoroscopy was used to confirm the electrode array spanned the appropriate vertebral levels.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSurgical implantation of the EES electrode array spanning the lumbosacral spinal cord. (\nA\n) Intraoperative image of the location of the EES array at the T11\u2013L1 vertebral levels. (\nB\n) Anterior-posterior X-ray of each subject before and after EES electrode array implantation. Subject 1 imaging was captured in a seated position. Subject 2 imaging was captured while lying supine. Inserts depict zoomed in view of the EES array. EES, epidural electrical stimulation.\n\nIntraoperative electrophysiology\nAfter induction but before surgical exposure, 13-mm subdermal electrodes were placed over selected muscles of the lower limbs in a muscle to tendon recording montage. The active electrode was placed over the midpoint of the appropriate muscle with the reference electrode over the distal tendon. A ground electrode was placed in the anterior thigh.\nRecording electrodes were placed bilaterally into the rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL), medial hamstring (MH), tibialis anterior (TA), medial gastrocnemius (MG), and soleus (SOL). These muscles were selected to assess selectivity of EES to activate proximal or distal muscle activation as well as to assess symmetry of activation between the legs.\n34\nOnce the array was inserted, minor changes in position were guided based on leg muscle intramuscular electromyography (EMG) recordings of EES-evoked motor responses. EES-evoked motor response recordings were captured during multiple EES configurations and stimulation parameters (0\u201310\u2009V, 0.5\u20131.0\u2009Hz), progressing from rostral to caudal and wide field to local. Additionally, EMG recordings were captured from the paraspinal muscles to record a stimulation artifact, which acted as the sweep trigger for real-time display of EES-evoked motor responses.\n\nLead and battery placement\nAfter confirmation of electrode position by electrophysiology, the electrode array was secured to the fascia and leads were tunneled subcutaneously to the right upper abdomen where a small subcutaneous pocket was made to house the lead wires. After meticulous hemostasis and copious irrigation with a bacitracin solution, the posterior wounds were closed in anatomical layers. Subjects were then positioned on the operating table in a lateral decubitus position. After prepping and draping the side and lateral abdomen, the lead wires were externalized and a pocket was made to insert the implantable pulse generator (RestoreUltra SureScan MRI Neurostimulator, Model 97712; Medtronic) in a pre-determined area that would least interfere with daily activities. The neurostimulator was connected to the lead wires and inserted into the subcutaneous pocket. The anterior wound was then irrigated with bacitracin solution and closed in anatomic layers.\n\nPost-operative electrophysiology\nAfter 3 weeks of rest, subjects returned to the laboratory to record EES-evoked motor responses from leg muscles while lying supine using EES parameters that were applied during intraoperative recordings (0\u201310\u2009V, 0.5\u20131.0\u2009Hz).\n\nEpidural electrical stimulation\u2013enabled motor activity\nDuring the first 5 days of testing with EES, both subjects attempted to perform motor tasks in the presence of EES. Tasks included attempts to stand, control flexion/extension lower extremity movements while supine or side-lying, and move their legs in response to an audio or visual cue. All tasks were performed with trainer assistance provided as needed. These tasks were performed with the primary goal of identifying EES configurations and stimulation parameters that enabled intentional control of lower extremity motor activity.\n12\nTo determine whether EES could enable intentional control of coordinated, robust leg muscle activity, subjects were positioned side lying with the top leg suspended using non-elastic nylon fabric support slings to allow gravity-neutral movement to identify EES parameters that enabled intentional control over robust rhythmic muscle activity to generate step-like movements.\n39\n,\n40\nA range of electrode configurations and voltage intensities were tested based on past literature in combination with intra- and post-operative interpretations of EES-evoked motor responses. EES voltage intensity was increased until volitional control over leg muscle activity and movement was observed.\n11\n,\n20\n,\n22\n,\n41\nSkin-surface EMG recordings were captured over the same leg muscles as intra- and post-operative EES-evoked motor response recordings. For subject 2, goniometer recordings of knee joint changes were synchronized to EMG recordings.\n\nStatistical analysis\nEMG and goniometry data were collected at a sampling rate of 4\u2009kHz (PowerLab; ADInstruments, Austin, TX) and analyzed using custom code written in MATLAB (Version R2015a; The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA). Notch (60\u2009Hz) and bandpass (20\u20131000\u2009Hz) filters were applied to EMG recordings to reduce environmental artifacts. EES-evoked motor response latencies were calculated as the time from stimulus pulse to the onset of the motor response of each muscle; defined as the time at which the response amplitude exceeded \u00b13 standard deviations (SDs) from baseline EMG values during quiescent recordings. Mean and SD values were calculated from five consecutive stimuli. Root mean square (RMS) envelopes were calculated from full-wave rectified EMG using a moving window of 200 samples and an overlap of 50 samples. Area under the curve values were calculated by taking the trapezoidal integral of the calculated RMS EMG data. The Shapiro-Wilk method was used to test for normal distributation of data. For normally distributed data, statistically significant differences between motor response amplitudes were calculated using standard parametric\nt\n-tests to compare muscle activity. Data that were not normally distributed were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. To determine statistically significant differences in motor activity across muscles, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was followed by a multiple comparisons test."

    "Methods": "Experimental animals\nAll procedures met national guidelines for care and use of laboratory animals, and all experimental protocols were approved by the Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. FVB/NJ WT and MMP9 KO adult male mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were housed (4 littermates/cage) under a temperature- (22\u00b0C) and humidity-controlled environment, with food and water\nad libitum\n, and subjected to a 12-h dark-light cycle. Mice of each strain (20\u201330\u2009g; 8\u201311 weeks old) were randomly selected and subjected to midline mFPI or sham injury. In preliminary experiments, FVB/NJ WT and MMP9 KO mice subjected to sham-injury (\nn\n=\u20094/group) failed to show differences in OMP, a principal molecular measure of ORN axon injury used in the study. From these data, FVB/NJ WT sham-injured cases were selected,\na priori\n, to serve as injury controls. Subsets of injured and WT sham-injured groups (FVB/NJ WT Sham [\nn\n=\u20094], FVB/NJ WT mFPI [\nn\n=\u200953], and MMP9 KO mFPI [\nn\n=\u200936]) were allowed to survive for either 1, 3, 7, or 21 days before molecular, histological, or ultrastructural analyses.\n\nSurgery preparation and injury\nMice were anesthetized with isoflurane (4% in 100% O\n2\ncarrier gas) and maintained on 2.5% isoflurane in carrier gas delivered through a nose cone. Once stabilized in a stereotaxic frame, heads were shaved, body temperature maintained at 37\u00b0C by Gaymar T/Pump water pump (Gaymar Industries Inc, Orchard Park, NY), and heart rate (bpm), arterial oxygen saturation (percent O\n2\n), breath rate (brpm), and pulse/breath distension (\u03bcm) monitored by pulse oximetry (MouseOx; Starr Life Sciences, Oakmont, PA). Mice then received a dorsal cranial incision and a 2.7-mm craniectomy prepared over the midline, centered between bregma and lambda. Without damaging the underlying dura, a Leur-Loc syringe hub was cemented to the skull surrounding the craniectomy and dental acrylic poured around the hub to stabilize the site. Topical anesthetic/antibiotic was applied to the incision site and mice housed in recovery cages. After 1\u2009h of surgical recovery, mice were anesthetized for 4\u2009min (4% isoflurane, 100% O\n2\n) and subjected to mFPI as previously described.\n55\n,\n56\nThe device consisted of a 60\u2009\u00d7\u20094.5\u2009cm Plexiglas water-filled cylinder, fitted at one end with a piston mounted on O-rings, with the opposite end housing a pressure transducer (EPN-0300A; Entran Devices, Inc., Fairfield, NJ). At the time of injury, the Leur-Loc fitting, filled with saline, was attached to the transducer housing. Injury was produced by a metal pendulum striking the piston, transiently injecting a small volume of saline into the cranial cavity, and briefly deforming the brain tissue (20-ms pulse duration). The resulting pressure pulse was recorded extracranially and registered 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\u2009atm of pressure. After injury, all mice were promptly ventilated with room air until spontaneous breathing resumed. The duration of suppression of the righting reflex (5.0\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0\u2009min) was used as an index of traumatic unconsciousness. Once righting reflex was determined, mice were reanesthetized for hub removal, scalp suture, and topical anesthetic/antibiotic application. FVB/NJ WT sham-injured controls received the same surgical preparation, anesthesia, and connection to the injury device, except that the intracranial pressure pulse was not applied. All animals were returned to their home cages and assessed for weight loss, locomotion, and eye/nose exudate once per day until weights stabilized.\n\nProtein extraction\nFVB/NJ WT and MMP9 KO mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane in carrier gas of 100% O\n2\nfor 4\u2009min, then sacrificed by decapitation at 1, 3, 7, or 21 days after FPI or sham injury, with bilateral OBs dissected (n\u2009=\u20094\u20137/group) for assessment of protein expression. Tissue samples were homogenized on ice in 100\u2009\u03bcL of radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) and centrifuged at 14,000\ng\nfor 20\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. Supernatant was aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Before blot or zymography analysis, protein concentration was determined using Pierce BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Thermo-Fisher, Waltham, MA) and the FLUOstar Optima plate reader (BMG Labtech, Inc., Cary, NC).\n\nWestern blot analysis\nWestern blot (WB) probe was carried out utilizing Bio-Rad products (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Twenty micrograms of protein was prepared in WB XT Sample Buffer and reducing agent (Bio-Rad Laboratories), then denatured at 95\u00b0C for 5\u2009min (except for unreduced CD44 WB protocol, where samples were prepared without reducing agent). Samples were electrophoresed on 4\u201312% or 12% Bis-Tris Criterion XT gels (200\u2009v\u2009\u00d7\u200945\u2009min in 3-morpholinopropane-1-sulfonic acid running buffer), then protein transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (1\u2009h at 100\u2009V). Post-blotted gels were stained with 0.1% Coomassie brilliant blue (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in 40% MeOH +10% glacial acetic acid, then destained at room temperature (RT) to confirm protein load and even transfer. Membranes were rinsed with deionized water and Tris-buffered saline (TBS) before blocking with 5% milk TBS-Tween (mTBS-T). Blots were then incubated in 5% mTBS-T overnight (4\u00b0C) with individual primary antibodies to either OPN (1:500; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN; and 1:500; Rockland Immunochemicals Inc., Limerick, PA), CD44 (1:500; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), or OMP (1:20,000, Wako, Richmond, VA). After primary incubation, membranes were washed with mTBS-T, then incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked secondary antibodies (immunoglobulin G [IgG] bovine antigoat, IgG bovine antirabbit [1:15,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX], IgG goat antimouse, and IgG goat antirat [1:15,000; Rockland Immunochemicals] in mTBS-T for 1\u2009h at RT. Finally, blots were washed with mTBS-T and antibody binding visualized using Super Signal Dura West chemiluminescence substrate (Thermo-Fisher). WB images were captured with Syngene G:Box and positive band signal subjected to densitometric analysis (relative optical density; ROD) with Gene Tools software (Syngene, Frederick, MD). Protein data were expressed as percent change relative to paired FVB/NJ WT sham-injured cases run on the same transferred gel. Cyclophillin A (EMD Millipore) or beta actin (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as load controls for signal detection.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nAt 3, 7, and 21 days post-injury, FVB/NJ WT injured and sham mice, along with MMP9 KO mice (\nn\n=\u20094/group) were prepared for fluorescent IHC analysis according to a published protocol.\n15\nAnimals were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (400\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneally [i.p.]) and transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffer (0.1\u2009M of NaHPO\n4\n, pH\u2009=\u20097.4), after which brains with attached OBs were extracted and placed in fixative for 24\u2009h before transfer to 0.03% NaN\n3\nin 1.0\u2009M of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). For IHC, fixed brains were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose for 3 days, then sucrose solutions exchanged each day. Frontal lobes were blocked and attached bulbs mounted in Tissue Tek media (Thermo-Fisher) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Coronal cryostat OB sections (13\u2009\u03bcM) were collected using a Cryostar\u2122NX70; Cryotome\u2122FSE; HM525 NX cryostat (Thermo-Fisher, Waltham, MA) and prepared for immunofluorescence visualization.\nFree-floating sections were first permeabilized in 5% peroxidase for 30\u2009min. After a wash with PBS, tissues were pre-incubated in blocking buffer (fish gelatin in PBS +0.05% Triton X-100) to prevent non-specific binding and then incubated overnight in primary antibody (OPN, 1:40; R&D Systems; MMP9, 1:100; R&D Systems; microtubule-associated protein 2 [MAP2], 1:500; EMD Millipore; tyrosine hydroxylase [TH], 1:300; EMD Millipore; glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP], 1:20,000; Dako, Glostrop, Denmark; ionized calcium-binding adaptor protein 1 [IBA1] for microglia, 1:300; Wako, Richmond, VA; and cholecystokinin [CCK], 1:20; R&D Systems) at 4\u00b0C. Sections were next washed with PBS, placed in blocking buffer for 30\u2009min, after which they were incubated with secondary fluorescent antibody (Alexa-Fluor 488 donkey antigoat, 1:1000 and Alexa-Fluor 594 donkey antirabbit, 1:1000; Thermo-Fisher) in Blotto for 1\u2009h at RT. Slices were then PBS washed, equilibrated in phosphate buffer, and mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) with Vectashield +4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). IHC signal was visualized on the Zeiss LSM 700 (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) confocal microscope (VCU Microscopy Core).\n\nGelatin zymography\nZymographic enzyme assay was performed using previously described methods.\n9\n,\n57\nBriefly, 20\u2009\u03bcg of protein from the same OB extracts used for WB were prepared with 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009Tris-glycine sodium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer, then separated by gelatin electrophoresis (at 4\u00b0C, 45\u2009V for 1.5\u2009h) on Novex\n\u00ae\n10% Zymogram gels (Thermo-Fisher). Gels were renatured in Novex Zymogram Renaturing Buffer (Thermo-Fisher) for 30\u2009min at room temperature before development in Novex Zymogram Developing Buffer over 6 days at 37\u00b0C. Gelatin lysis was visualized with Coomassie brilliant blue (Sigma-Aldrich). Zymogram signal was captured on a Syngene G:BOX and densitometry analyzed as ROD with Gene Tools software (Syngene). Enzyme activity was expressed as percent change relative to paired FVB/NJ WT sham-injured controls run on the same gel.\n\nTransmission electron microcopy\nAt 21 days after FPI, FVB/NJ WT injured, MMP9 KO injured, and FVB/NJ WT sham-injured mice (\nn\n=\u20093/group) were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (400\u2009mg/kg, i.p.), transcardially perfused with mixed aldehyde fixative (2% PFA and 2.5% glutaraldehyde) in 0.1\u2009M of phosphate buffer (pH, 7.2). Brains were removed and post-fixed overnight at 4\u00b0C before processing for TEM as described previously.\n56\nOBs were next blocked in the sagittal plane, placed in 1% osmium tetroxide (0.1\u2009M of cacodylate buffer), and processed for embedding with Epon resin (Embed; Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). After curing, OB areas containing glomeruli were mounted, and both semithin (0.5\u2009\u03bcm) and ultrathin (silver, 600 \u00c5) sections were cut with a Leica EM UC6i ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Semithin sections were used to guide subsequent ultrastructural sampling. Ultrathin sections were collected on Formvar-coated slotted grids and observed on a JEOL JEM-1230 electron microscope (JEOL USA, Inc., Peabody, MA), equipped with a Gatan Ultra Scan 4000SP CCD camera (Gatan, Inc., Pleasanton, CA).\n\nStatistical analysis\nChanges in protein level and enzyme activity induced by injury were evaluated using the generalized linear model and multi-variate analysis of variance routines in SPSS software (v.22; International Business Machines, Corp., Armonk, NY). Normality (Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test) and homogeneity of variance (Levene Statistic) were confirmed before analysis of variance analyses. The Duncan multiple-range test was used for post-hoc pair-wise group comparisons. Results are reported as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean. An alpha level of 0.05 was used in all analyses."

    "Methods": "Animals\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats (23\u201324 days old; weighing 60\u201380\u2009g) were procured from Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, and housed under controlled conditions. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences-New Jersey Medical School in accordance with the National Institutes of Health policy on the use of research animals. Blinding of animal groups for behavior was not performed because the same personnel performing surgical and injury procedures also performed the behavioral tests.\n\nLateral fluid-percussion injury\nAnimals underwent a lateral fluid percussion injury (FPI) aged P31 (\nFig. 1A\n) in a similar manner to our previous studies and those of other independent groups\n30\n,\n31\nand were assigned randomly for the various treatments. For Luer lock placement, rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal ketamine (80\u2009mg/kg)-xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg) and positioned on a stereotaxic frame. After ascertaining surgical plane anesthesia by the absence of tail-pinch reflexes, a 3\u2009mm craniotomy was performed on the left side of the skull \u22125\u2009mm posterior to the bregma and 3\u2009mm lateral to the sagittal suture keeping the dura intact. A Luer lock syringe hub was glued surrounding the exposed dura using a cyanoacrylate adhesive. The TBI was performed 24\u2009h after Luer lock implantation.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\n(\nA\n) Schematic of the experimental design and time line assessing effects of drug or vehicle treatment on traumatic brain injury, behavioral and metabolomic assessments. (\nB\n) Schematic of the rat brain indicating the stereotaxic location of injury and craniotomy. Color image is available online.\nRats were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane in an induction chamber, observed for anesthesia mediated loss of consciousness through head tilt, and transferred quickly to the FPI device (Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA). The Luer lock hub was affixed to the syringe of the FPI device under isoflurane anesthesia. A pendulum drop delivered a brief 20\u2009msec impact on the intact dura. The impact pressure was measured by an extracranial transducer and controlled between 1.8\u20132.0\u2009atm. Overall duration under isoflurane anesthesia and the FPI procedure was approximately 2\u20133\u2009min. After injury, rats were transferred to a soft bedding cage and monitored for the return of righting reflex and any signs of seizures for the next 30\u2009min. No special temperature management was necessary.\nA mortality rate of 10% (4 of 36 animals) was observed throughout the current study. Two naive animals were lost\u2014one immediately after ketamine administration and another during the Luer lock implantation procedure. Two TBI animals were lost\u2014one at 24\u2009h after the first dose of kaempferol treatment and another at 24\u2009h after first vehicle dose. The 32 surviving animals were included in the study after randomly grouping into sham (\nn\n=\u20096), TBI-untreated (\nn\n=\u20099), TBI+ vehicle (\nn\n=\u20097), and TBI+ kaempferol (\nn\n=\u200910). Sham and TBI-untreated animal subjects from our previously published study\n16\nwere combined with additional new animal subjects in the current study to achieve adequate sample sizes. Animals were monitored within their cage environment daily throughout the duration of the experiments.\n\nTissue sample extraction and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS)\nAt 72\u2009h after TBI (\nFig. 1A\n), animals were decapitated and brains rapidly removed (<60\u2009sec). Cerebellum and brain stem areas were removed, cerebral hemispheres separated (\nFig. 1B\n; schematic), and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Brain tissue samples were weighed and disrupted in extraction buffer (80% methanol in water) using a microhomogenizer. Each sample was transferred to a pre-cooled (dry ice) homogenization tube with 4\u2009mL of pre-cooled 80% methanol and homogenized for 15\u2009sec using the standard microhomogenizer (Pro Scientific). A 500\u2009\u03bcL of sample was taken out to a new Eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 15\u2009min at 14,000\u2009rpm. Supernatants were collected and normalized to tissue weight.\nThe LC/MS measurements were performed on the brain extract samples using a Q ExactiveOrbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) coupled to a Vanquish UPLC system (Thermo Scientific). The Q Exactive operated in a polarity-switching mode. A Sequant ZIC-HILIC column; 2.1\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u2009mm i.d, (Merck. Co), was used for metabolite separation. Buffers consisted of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) buffer-A (100% acetonitrile), and HPLC buffer-B (pH\u2009=\u20099.0: 95% [vol/vol] water, 5% [vol/vol] acetonitrile, 20\u2009mM ammonium hydroxide, 20\u2009mM ammonium acetate). The HPLC flow rate was set at 150\u2009\u03bcL/min, and gradients were from 85% to 30% for buffer A in 20\u2009min followed by a wash with 30% buffer A and re-equilibration at 85% buffer A. Metabolites were identified based on exact mass within 5\u2009ppm and standard retention times. Relative metabolite quantification was performed based on peak area for each identified metabolite.\n\nMetabolite data analysis and statistics\nStatistical comparisons between hemispheres of sham and TBI were made as shown in\nFigure 1B\n. Data analysis was performed using the software Metaboanalyst 3.0.\n32\n,\n33\nTo minimize variations introduced during sample preparation effects of ion suppression, metabolite peak intensities were normalized to tissue wet-weight. Because of deviations from normality as tested by the Shapiro-Wilk test, data subsequently were log transformed and auto-scaled (mean-centered and divided by the standard deviation of each variable), effectively converting them to Z-scores. Plots of fold change in log scale were determined to efficiently represent metabolite concentration changes in both directions (increase or decrease).\nPartial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used to determine the separation between groups of the metabolite variables through rotation of the principal components obtained by principal component analysis (PCA). This multivariate analysis was used because of the presence of more metabolite variables than observations in addition to correlation among the variables in the data.\n34\nThe PLS-DA two-dimensional and three-dimensional score plots were generated from the first two and first three principal components, respectively, for classification. The PLS-DA analysis was also used for feature selection, and feature importance measures were generated (VIP: variable importance in projection). R\n2\nX and R\n2\nY, the fraction of variation that the model explains in the independent variables (X) and dependent variables (Y) and Q\n2\nY: the predictive accuracy of the model was estimated by the PLS-DA cross-validation. These variables range between 0\u20131 with values >0.5 indicating good and >0.8 indicating outstanding predictive accuracies, respectively. Loading plots (top 25 variables) were used to determine the clustering of variables and whether their relationship within (weightings) scores changed in response to TBI.\nTo measure the impact of individual metabolite changes on biochemical pathways, metabolic pathway analysis (MetPA)\n35\nand metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA)\n36\nwere performed. The MetPA combined results from pathway enrichment analysis with pathway topology analysis using a high-quality Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes metabolic pathway database. Data were analyzed using a pre-existing rat reference library with global test algorithm for MSEA and relative-between centrality algorithm for pathway topology analysis provided within the Metaboanalyst software.\nPathway enrichment analysis used metabolite concentration values to calculate\np\nvalues based on the asymptotic distribution without using permutations. Because many pathways were tested simultaneously,\np\nvalues were corrected for multiple comparisons using Holm-Bonferroni method (Holm\np\n) and false discovery rate (FDR). Pathway topology analysis estimated node importance based on two node centrality measures\u2014namely, degree centrality and betweenness centrality. While degree centrality represented the number of links converging on a node, betweenness centrality represented the number of shortest paths passing through the node. Different from the degree centrality measure focusing on local connectivity, the betweenness centrality measure focused on global network topology. Hence, our analysis used the betweenness centrality measure to calculate the pathway impact values in MetPA as implemented in our previous study.\n16\nThe MSEA directly investigates a set of functionally related metabolites without the need to pre-select metabolites based on some arbitrary cutoff threshold. Patterns of metabolites that are significantly enriched in biologically relevant pathways can be assessed.\n36\nIt has the potential to identify subtle but consistent changes among a group of related compounds in a certain biological pathway. A quantitative enrichment analysis algorithm and a custom-made metabolite set library containing 36 metabolite sets based on metabolic pathways related to the detected brain metabolites, as implemented in our earlier studies,\n16\nwas used as the reference library. The enrichment analyses considered the reference metabolome built based on our analytical platform of the current targeted brain metabolites. A global test algorithm using a generalized linear model was used to estimate a Q-statistic for each metabolite set describing the correlation between metabolite concentration profiles (X) and physiological outcomes (Y). The Q statistic for each metabolite was derived from the average of the Q statistics for each metabolite within the set. Statistical\np\nvalues after MSEA were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Holm\np\nand FDR.\n\nWhisker stimulation-induced motor response (WSIMR)\nTo assess early sensorimotor defects, WSIMR was performed 24, 48, and 72\u2009h after injury. The WSIMR test is an adaptation of a previously established whisker stimulation-induced paw placement test in adult animals.\n37\nWe have modified this sensorimotor test successfully to developmental stage animals as established by our previous studies.\n16\n,\n27\nAnimals were placed in a test cage and left to habituate for 1\u2009min. Subsequently, whiskers on either side were stroked in a rostrocaudal direction using an applicator stick. Each trial consisted of multiple strokes at 3\u2009Hz frequency, and up to 10 trials were performed on each side of the animal with an intertrial gap of 1\u2009min.\nResponses were scored on a scale of 0\u20135. Active avoidance by running away with 1\u20132 strokes\u2009=\u20095; with 1\u20132 strokes, quick head movement away from the stroking stick\u2009=\u20094; slower head movement after 1\u20132 strokes away from the stick\u2009=\u20093; head movement away from the stick after 3\u20136 strokes\u2009=\u20092; slower head movement after 3\u20136 strokes\u2009=\u20091, and no reaction to stroking beyond nine strokes\u2009=\u20090. An average score of the 10 trials was determined.\n\nForelimb usage test\nThe neural basis of spatial and motor behaviors, used as an assay of brain function, can be assessed by natural exploratory behavior in the rat. The forelimb usage test was a modified version of the cylinder test and provides a way to evaluate spontaneous forelimb usage in the home cage environment as demonstrated in our previous studies.\n16\nEach animal was observed for 5\u2009min duration in a test cage 24, 48, and 72\u2009h after injury. Active exploration of vertical surfaces by rearing up on the hind limbs and wall surface exploration with forelimbs were observed and scored. The number of independent wall placements observed for contralateral, ipsilateral, or both forelimbs were scored. Animals using both forelimbs simultaneously\u2009=\u20095; exploring cage wall with only the contralateral forelimb usage\u2009=\u20094; exploring cage wall with only ipsilateral forelimb usage\u2009=\u20093. Percentage forelimb usage within the 5\u2009min observation duration was determined."

    "Methods": "Rat microbleed model\nNineteen male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 350\u2009g\u2013450\u2009g (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were used. The animals were maintained on a standard rodent diet with free access to water. All animals were previously healthy. All of the experiments and the general handling of the animals were approved by the National (Hungarian) Scientific Ethical Committee on Animal Experimentation (Number of permission: BA02/2000-69/2017 - valid for five years). All the procedures fully complied with national and international standards especially with Decree No. 40/2013 (II. 14.) of the Hungarian Government and EU Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes.\nAnesthesia was induced in a bell jar for 5\u2009min under 4% isoflurane (Forane, Abbott, Abbott Park, IL) and a 7:3 mixture of N\n2\nO/O\n2\n, and maintained using isoflurane decreased to 1\u20133% delivered through a nasal mask. Rectal temperature was measured with a rectal probe (RET-4, Physitemp Instruments, Clifton, NJ) and thermometer (BAT-12, Physitemp Instruments, Clifton, NJ). The animal temperature was held at 36\u201338\u00b0C using a silicon tube, shaped to form a cylinder around the animal, connected to a hot/cold water circulator device (Scanvac heat safe SHC 2000, Labogene, Lynge, Denmark).\nThe rat was placed in a laboratory standard stereotactic frame (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL). A midline scalp incision was made, and the skull was exposed with blunt dissection. A burr hole was placed 2\u2009mm lateral to midline, 5\u2009mm posterior to bregma, on both sides. To elicit microbleed formation, the brain was pierced vertically in a depth of 4\u2009mm from the dura, using a stainless steel needle (Hamilton, Reno, NV) with a diameter of 159\u2009\u03bcm (34 G) on the right side and 474\u2009\u03bcm (26s G) on the left side. No blood or material was injected. The burr hole was sealed with bone wax, the wound was closed, and the rat was immediately transferred to the MR scanner. The entire surgical procedure took approximately 30\u2009min.\n\nMRI\nAnimals were anesthetized during MRI as well, with 1\u20133% isoflurane and a 7:3 mixture of N\n2\nO/O\n2\nadministered through a nose cone animal holder. The animal temperature was held at 36\u201338\u00b0C degrees using a digital circulator device (Thermo Scientific Haake SC100, Waltham, MA). Imaging was performed on a Bruker (Bruker) 4.7 T Biospec 47/16 scanner with a receive-only 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 surface array coil for rat brain (Bruker). After obtaining a three-plane gross scout imaging, high resolution T2 weighted imaging was performed also in three planes to localize injury sites precisely (RARE sequence repetition time/echo time [TR/TE]\u2009=\u20092428/ 36\u2009msec, RARE factor\u2009=\u20098, echo spacing\u2009=\u200912\u2009msec, number of averages\u2009=\u20092, image matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256 FOV\u2009=\u200935\u2009\u00d7\u200935\u2009mm\n2\n). Previous to acquiring SWI, map shimming was performed covering the brain with an ellipsoid volume. The SWI slice volume was adjusted centered to lesion sites based on the T2 images. The SWI was performed using the following parameters: three-dimensional (3D) acquisition type FcFLASH sequence, TR/TE\u2009=\u200929/11\u2009msec, number of averages\u2009=\u20092, image matrix\u2009=\u2009192\u2009\u00d7\u2009192\u2009\u00d7\u200948, FOV\u2009=\u200932\u2009\u00d7\u200932\u2009\u00d7\u20098\u2009mm\n3\n, flip angle\u2009=\u200912 degrees, mask weighting\u2009=\u20094 with gauss broad\u2009=\u20090.33\u2009mm). Filtered phase data were stored.\nAs a pilot, three animals underwent imaging at five time points (immediate, 12\u2009h, 24\u2009h, 48\u2009h, 125\u2009h after injury). Based on the findings of these images and adhering to scanner availability, three imaging time points were set as immediate, 24\u2009h, and 125\u2009h for the further 16 animals. Of these 16 animals, 10 completed the three time points and were euthanized under anesthesia for histopathological evaluation. Three animals were euthanized after the immediate, and another three after the 24\u2009h imaging.\n\nMRI data analysis\nTo visualize hypointense lesions without partial volume effects or dependence on slice orientation, ParaVision Acquisition 6.0.1 software (Bruker) was used to create coronal plane minimum intensity projection (minIP) images of 0.2\u2009mm thick sections of the 3D SWI volumes. These sections were placed on the site of injury based on the signs of the skull burr holes and anatomy. The sections were checked to include all hypointensities related to the injury site. The minIP images were exported upsampled to a matrix of 768\u2009\u00d7\u2009768. To visualize 3D filtered phase data, the same steps were performed except using maximal instead of minimal intensity projection.\nQuantitative analysis of hypointense lesion extent referring to microbleeds was performed using ImageJ software version 1.51k (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health).\n34\nA stack was built from all animals all time point SWI minIP images. First, voxel hypointensity was defined: in immediate time point minIP images, a rectangle shaped region of interest (ROI) of 50 voxels width (\u2009=\u20092.1\u2009mm) and 100 voxels height (\u2009=\u20094.2\u2009mm) was drawn and fitted over the normal appearing brain parenchyma (next to but excluding lesion sites, also excluding large vessels) in all animals (\nFig. 1a\n). Using such ROIs, histogram analyses were applied to find the lowest included intensities (\nFig. 1d\n). The average value of these lowest intensities was found to be 76; therefore, voxels with an intensity of \u226475 were defined as hypointense.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nIllustration of the applied regions of interests (ROIs, overlaid on an immediate time point minimal intensity projection image) and their histograms with dash-dot lined boxes indicating \u201chypointense voxel\u201d range. (\na, d\n) Normal brain ROI and histogram, used to define hypointensity: the average value of the lowest intensities over normal brain (including all animals' immediate time point images, not only the presented one) was found to be 76; therefore, voxels with an intensity of \u226475 were defined as hypointense. (\nb, e\n) Microbleed ROI and histogram, used to calculate the number of hypointense voxels at injury sites corresponding to microbleed volumes (applied at all time points). The presented microbleed ROI included 791 hypointense voxels (see box in histogram). (\nc, f\n) Control ROI and histogram, for calculating the hypointense voxel number (applied at all time points) of the hypointense structure parietal bone assumed not to undergo volume changes over time. The presented control ROI included 1,202 such hypointense voxels (see box in histogram).\nThis ROI at identical sites and histogram analysis were also applied to the 24\u2009h and 125\u2009h minIP images to calculate average intensities. Based on these intensities, 24\u2009h and 125\u2009h image intensities were normalized to the immediate image intensity for each animal. Then, another rectangle shaped ROI of 50 voxels width (\u2009=\u20090.2\u2009mm) and 100 voxels height (\u2009=\u20090.42\u2009mm) was created. This ROI was placed over the injury sites (\nFig. 1b\n), based on burr holes if the microbleed not visible, blinded to imaging time points, to extract the number of hypointense (\u2264 5) voxels referring to microbleeds (\nFig. 1e\n). Ventricular hemorrhage was included, if present.\nBone was used as a control structure, because bone appears hypointense in SWI but can be assumed to not undergo any volume changes over the 125\u2009h investigation period. Therefore, a control ROI with identical dimensions as lesion ROI was placed over the lateral part of the parietal bone at the same level as the injury site and was rotated perpendicular to the bone (\nFig. 1c\n). The number of hypointense voxels of the bone under the control ROI was extracted using the same intensity threshold value of 75 (\nFig. 1f\n).\nThe number of hypointense voxels over both side lesion sites (i.e., microbleed extents) and parietal bone (control) across the immediate, 24\u2009h, and 125\u2009h time points were compared using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni correction using Medcalc ver. 13.0.0.0 (MedCalc Software bvba, Ostend, Belgium).\n35\nSuch corrected\np\nvalue less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Thirteen animals were available with the necessary three imaging time points for this analysis (the other six animals of the overall 19 animals were euthanized at earlier time points).\n\nHistology\nAfter euthanasia, transcardial perfusion was performed with isotonic saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. That was performed in three cases after the immediate MRI acquisition, in another three cases after the 24\u2009h acquisition, and after the 125\u2009h imaging time point for the rest of the animals. The formalin fixation of the heads was continued for at least two weeks. Then, the brains were removed from the skull and were embedded in paraffin. If lesion sites were visible on the surface of the brain, the surrounding region was cut into 6\u2009\u03bcm thick coronal sections and stained using Prussian blue. When lesion sites were not visible, the coronal sections were cut from the region supposed to contain lesions based on anatomy, and only every 10th section was first stained with Prussian blue to identify sections including the bleedings in the largest volume. Second, the adjacent sections were also stained to capture the entire bleeding. Bleedings were defined as extravasated red blood cells, or hemosiderin reaction at the lesion sites."

    "Methods": "Animals and experimental design\nAll animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Kentucky and complied with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The Division of Laboratory Animal Resources at the University is accredited by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation for Laboratory Animal Care, International, and all experiments were performed within its guidelines. All data were analyzed and reported according to ARRIVE guidelines.\nYoung adult (7\u20139 week old; 22\u201326\u2009g) C57BL/6J male mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were acclimated for a one week period to the vivarium where they were housed (five per cage) in a 14\u2009h/10\u2009h light/dark cycle with food and water available\nad libitum.\nMice were then randomly assigned to two groups (CHI and sham) for single CHI experiments or three groups (CHI, repeated CHI at a 48\u2009h interval, and repeated CHI at a 96\u2009h interval) for the repeated CHI experiments.\nFor single CHI assessments, animals (\nn\n=\u20096/group) were euthanized before mitochondrial isolation at 6\u2009h, 24\u2009h, 48\u2009h, or 96\u2009h post-CHI. For repeated CHI experiments, animals (\nn\n=\u20098/group) were euthanized before mitochondrial isolation at 48\u2009h or 96\u2009h after the last CHI. An additional cohort (\nn\n=\u20092\u20133/group) was included, mirroring the repeated CHI experiments, to examine histopathological outcomes. No mice died as a result of CHI procedures, and none were removed from the study; 105 mice were utilized in total for all experiments. For all assays, technical triplicates were included for each sample. Data analysis was performed blinded to treatment groups.\n\nCHI\nExperimental CHI was induced according to a previously described procedure.\n41\nMice were anesthetized with 2.5% isofluorane delivered via a nose cone, and the head of each mouse was fixed between two zygomatic cuffs stabilized in a stereotaxic frame. The incision site was first cleaned with 70% ethanol and Betadine, and local analgesia was achieved by subcutaneous injection of 0.2\u2009mL 1:200,000 epinephrine and 0.5% bupivacaine (Henry Schein Animal Health, Dublin, OH) in sterile, isotonic saline before scalp reflection. A pneumatically controlled cortical impact device (TBI-0310 Impactor, Precision Systems and Instrumentation, Fairfax Station, VA) with a 5\u2009mm diameter, cushioned tip of 55 Shore A hardness was programmed to deliver a 2.0\u2009mm impact at 3.5\u2009m/sec with a 500\u2009msec dwell time. The posterior edge of the tip was aligned at the lambda suture (approximately bregma level \u22125\u2009mm). The diameter of the tip (5\u2009mm) is such that the anterior edge of the tip meets the bregma suture (0\u2009mm bregma level). If applicable, subsequent injuries were induced at the same midline location at the indicated time post-injury. This impact was characterized previously such that a single injury would result in minimal gliosis or cell death without resulting in skull fracture.\n21\nImmediately after impact, mice were removed from the stereotaxic device and placed onto their backs on a heating pad. Apnea duration and the time to spontaneously right to a prone position (righting reflex) were assessed. On righting, mice were briefly re-anesthetized to suture the scalp using Vicryl sutures containing antibiotic agents (Ethicon, Cincinnati, OH). After suturing, 1\u2009mL of sterile saline was delivered subcutaneously to increase hydration after the injury. Sham-injured animals underwent identical anesthesia and surgical procedures without receiving an impact. All animals received the same duration of surgical anesthesia.\nAll mice were monitored on a heating pad until they became ambulatory. In addition, mice were evaluated to 1\u20133\u2009h and 24\u2009h after each injury, followed by daily inspections. All mice were required to maintain 85% of their starting weight to receive repeated head injury. No mice needed to be removed from the study, however.\n\nIsolation of mitochondria from brain tissue\nThe mitochondrial isolation protocol was adapted from previously described protocols with modifications.\n42\u201345\nAll the steps were performed at 4\u00b0C or on ice. After mice were euthanized with CO\n2\nfollowed by rapid decapitation, the bilateral ventral cortex (containing entorhinal cortex) and bilateral hippocampus, vulnerable regions to mTBI,\n41\nwere dissected out quickly on a cold block and homogenized using a Teflon-glass dounce homogenizer containing isolation buffer (215\u2009mM mannitol, 75\u2009mM sucrose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin [BSA], 20\u2009mM HEPES, 1\u2009mM EGTA, adjusted to pH 7.2 with potassium hydroxide).\nThe homogenate was transferred to a 2\u2009mL microcentrifuge tube and spun at 1,300\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 3\u2009min. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh 2\u2009mL microcentrifuge tube and spun at 13,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 10\u2009min. The supernatant was discarded and the crude mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 400\u2009mL of isolation buffer. This suspension was added to a pressurized nitrogen cell disruptor at 1,200\u2009psi for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C to release the synaptic mitochondria from synaptosomes.\nThe suspension of total mitochondria was then transferred to 1.5\u2009mL microcentrifuge tubes and pelleted at 10,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 10\u2009min. The supernatants were discarded, and the total mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in EGTA-free isolation buffer to get \u226510\u2009mg/mL approximate concentration of mitochondria. The absolute protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) by recording absorbance at 560\u2009nm on a Biotek Synergy HT plate reader (Winooski, VT).\n\nMitochondrial bioenergetics measurements\nMitochondrial bioenergetic measurements were performed using a Seahorse XFe24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) to measure the oxygen consumption rates (OCR) during various states of respiration. The OCR were measured in the presence of different substrates, inhibitors, and uncouplers of the electron transport chain using previous methods with slight modifications.\n45\u201348\nThe stocks used for the assays were 500\u2009mM pyruvate, 250\u2009mM malate, and 30\u2009mM ADP, and 1\u2009M succinate (pH for all was adjusted to 7.2). Assay solutions of 1\u2009mM oligomycin A, 1\u2009mM carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP), and 1\u2009mM rotenone were prepared in ethanol.\nAs per the instructions from the XFe24 Extracellular Flux kit, the sensor cartridge was hydrated and kept at 37\u00b0C overnight before the experiment. The injection ports A to D of the sensor cartridge were loaded with 75\u2009\u03bcL of different combinations of the above substrates/inhibitors/uncouplers as follows: Before loading, the stocks were diluted appropriately in the respiration buffer (RB) (125\u2009mM KCl [potassium chloride], 0.1% BSA, 20\u2009mM HEPES, 2\u2009mM magnesium chloride [MgCl\n2\n], and 2.5\u2009mM monobasic potassium phosphate [KH\n2\nPO\n4\n]; pH 7.2) to get the final concentrations in the respiration chamber of 5\u2009mM pyruvate, 2.5\u2009mM malate, and 1\u2009mM ADP (via port A), 1\u2009\u03bcM oligomycin A (via port B), 4\u2009\u03bcM FCCP (via port C), and 0.1\u2009\u03bcM rotenone and 10\u2009mM of succinate (via port D) starting with the initial volume of 525\u2009\u03bcL RB in the chamber and diluting each substrate to 9X, 10X, 11X, and 12X with every injection through ports A to D, respectively.\nOnce loaded, the sensor cartridge was placed into the Seahorse XFe24 Flux Analyzer for automated calibration. Seahorse Standard XFe24 assay plates were used for loading mitochondria. Initially, total mitochondria were diluted to 10\u2009\u03bcg/50\u2009\u03bcL in RB, and 50\u2009\u03bcL was loaded in each well resulting in 10\u2009\u03bcg mitochondria/well. The assay plates were centrifuged at 3,000\u2009rpm for 4\u2009min at 4\u00b0C to adhere the mitochondria at the bottom of the wells. After centrifugation, 475\u2009\u03bcL RB (pre-incubated to 37\u00b0C) was added without disturbing the mitochondrial layer to obtain a final volume of 525\u2009\u03bcL per well. After the instrument calibration with the sensor cartridge was complete, the utility plate was replaced by the plate loaded with mitochondria for bioenergetics analysis.\nThe assays were performed under a previously optimized protocol.\n48\nBriefly, it involved cyclic steps of mixing, sequential injections of substrates/inhibitors via ports A through D, mixing, equilibration, and measurement of the OCR through fluorimetric optical probes. The data output gives State III respiration in the presence of pyruvate and malate (PM) and ADP (port A) followed by State IV rate in the presence of oligomycin A (port B). Sequentially, it gives uncoupled respiration State (VPM) and State V succinate (Suc) (State V2) in the presence of FCCP (port C) and rotenone plus succinate (port D), respectively. Raw OCR values were used for analysis within a given experiment and reported in all figures. Plate-to-plate and day-to-day variation may result in different absolute OCR values between experiments.\n\nOxidative damage assays\nMitochondrial homogenate aliquots (unused during respiration assays) were stored at \u221220\u00b0C until utilization for oxidative stress blots. Three separate markers, 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), and protein carbonyls (PC), were assessed in these samples. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay. For PC, 5\u2009\u03bcL of sample, 5\u2009\u03bcL of SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate, 12% solution in H\n2\n0), and 10\u2009\u03bcL of 2,4- dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) (1:10 dilution in phosphate buffered saline [PBS]) was added to a 0.6\u2009mL Eppendorf tube. Then 7.5\u2009\u03bcL of neutralization buffer was added to each sample assayed for PC. For HNE and 3-NT, 5\u2009\u03bcL of sample, 5\u2009\u03bcL of 12% SDS, and 10\u2009\u03bcL of Laemmli buffer (0.125\u2009M Trizma base, 4% SDS, and 20% glycerol) was added to a 0.6\u2009mL Eppendorf tube without neutralization buffer. All samples were incubated at room temperature for 20\u2009min. Protein concentration of the sample was titrated to 1\u2009ng/\u03bcL in a 2\u2009mL Eppendorf tube.\nThe BioRad Bio-Dot SF Microfiltration System was assembled by placing three filter papers in the lower Bio-Dot tray followed by the nitrocellulose membrane. The Bio-Dot system was then attached to a laboratory vacuum system and washed with 250\u2009\u03bcL of PBS. After the PBS wash, each sample was vortexed and then loaded into the upper tray. Each sample was loaded into two \u201cslots\u201d in proximity. The samples were then processed onto the membrane by vacuum. The membrane was then removed, marked, and left to dry overnight. Blocking solution (25\u2009mL of Wash Blot Solution/750\u2009mg of BSA [Sigma]) was added to membranes placed in trays. The blocking solution was left on the membranes for 90\u2009min and then removed.\nFor PC, 100\u2009\u03bcL of polyclonal RbxDNP (from Oxy Blot Protein Oxidation Kit, Chemicon-Millipore, Billerica, MA, dilution 1:200; Cat No. S7150) was transferred into 20\u2009mL of Wash-Blot Solution. For HNE, 4\u2009\u03bcL of anti-protein-bound HNE pAb (Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX; dilution 1: 500) was transferred into 20\u2009mL of Wash-Blot Solution. For 3-NT, 8\u2009\u03bcL of anti-3-NT pAb (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA; dilution 1:2500) was transferred into 20\u2009mL of Wash-Blot Solution.\nPreviously, all antibodies were characterized using appropriate positive and negative controls. The appropriate antibody solutions were added to the trays and allowed to incubate for 120\u2009min on the rocker. After 120\u2009min, the antibody solutions were removed and the membranes were washed thrice 5\u2009min each. The secondary antibody solution was made using 2.5\u2009\u03bcL of Anti-Rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase produced in goat (Sigma\u2013Aldrich) added to 20\u2009mL Wash-Blot Solution. The membranes were incubated with the secondary antibody for 60\u2009min. The membranes were then washed. Developing solution was then prepared using 30\u2009mL of alkaline phosphatase buffer, 99\u2009\u03bcL of BCIP (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate), and 198\u2009\u03bcL of nitroblue tetrazolium and added to trays. Membranes were allowed to develop and then washed with ddH\n2\nO water and allowed to dry overnight. The next day the membranes were scanned with a photo scanner (Epson Perfection V600, Long Beach, CA), and slot-blot line densities were quantified by the ImageQuant TL software package (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Piscataway, NJ).\n\nTissue processing for histopathological analysis\nA cohort of mice receiving either single CHI, repeated CHI at a 48\u2009h interval, or repeated CHI at a 96\u2009h interval were euthanized at 48\u2009h after the final injury by intraperitoneal injection of Fatal Plus (130\u2009mg/kg, Henry Schein Animal Health) before transcardial perfusion with cold, heparinized sterile saline followed by cold, 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10\u2009min. After perfusion, mice were decapitated, and the brains were then removed from the skull and post-fixed in 4% PFA for an additional 24\u2009h. After post-fixation, tissue was placed into 30% sucrose in 1X-Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 48\u2009h for cryoprotection. The brain tissue was frozen in \u221225 to \u221235\u00b0C isopentane before being cut into 40\u2009\u03bcm thick coronal sections using a sliding microtome (Dolby-Jamison, Pottstown, PA).\nFor qualitative assessment of cell loss, sections spaced at 400\u2009\u03bcm intervals were Nissl stained with 2.5% cresyl violet. Fluoro-Jade C (FJC) staining, as described previously,\n21\nwas used to identify degenerating neurons and axons in four sections selected at 400\u2009\u03bcm intervals within the caudal hippocampus and entorhinal cortex.\nTo label for activated microglia, a series of free-floating tissue sections spaced 400\u2009\u03bcm apart was used for immunohistochemistry, as performed previously.\n21\n,\n41\nTissues were blocked with 5% normal horse serum in 0.1%Triton X-100/1XTBS before incubation in anticluster of differentiation-68 (CD-68; 1:1000; MCA1957; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) overnight at 4\u00b0C. On the following day, tissue sections were rinsed and incubated in donkey anti-rat IgG, biotin-labeled (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 1\u2009h. The tissue was washed before incubating in Avidin-Biotin complex (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1\u2009h and then treated with 3,3\u2019-diaminobenzidine as directed by the manufacturer (Vector Laboratories).\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). For all analyses, the significance of differences among groups was set at\np\n<\u20090.05. For each measure, data were measured using interval/ratio scales. The Brown-Forsythe and Bartlett tests were performed to ensure homogeneity of variance. Further, the Shapiro-Wilk test was completed to ensure normality. As these criteria were met for all experimental data, parametric statistics were employed for data analyses. Statistical outliers, after averaging technical triplicates, were identified by internally studentized residuals as published previously.\n49\nFor the single CHI experiments, one statistical outlier was removed for all measures from the 48\u2009h survival group. In the repeated CHI experiments, one statistical outlier was removed for all measures from each of two groups: the single CHI group and the group with repeated CHI at a 96\u2009h interval euthanized at 96\u2009h after the final CHI. For mitochondrial assessments and oxidative damage assays, data sets were evaluated using a one-way analysis of variance and, when appropriate,\npost hoc\ncomparisons employing the Fisher least significant difference test. Power analysis was calculated for single mTBI mitochondrial experiments using the following assumptions: \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05, 1-\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.8, and standard deviation 10% of mean for two groups.\n50\nSimilarly, power analysis was calculated for repeated mTBI mitochondrial experiments using the following assumptions: \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05, 1-\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.8, and standard deviation 25% of mean for four groups."

    "Methods": "All animal studies were conducted in accordance with the guidelines established by the internal Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. Studies are reported following the Animal Research: ReportingIn VivoExperiments guidelines. Randomization of animals was achieved by assigning individuals to treatment groups before initiation of the study to ensure equal distribution among groups. A power analysis was performed to identify group sizes that enable statistically robust detection of injury-induced deficits while minimizing the number of animals needed; this was based on preliminary data and previously published work from our group.23Data collection was stopped at pre-determined final endpoints based on days post-injury (DPI) for each animal. Animals were excluded from the study if post-operative weight decreased by \u226515% of pre-surgical weight or baseline rotarod score was not met. All animal behavior was scored by investigators blinded to the treatment groups.\n\nAnimals\nMale C57BL/6 mice (Harlan Laboratories, Inc., Indianapolis, IN) were used for all experiments (\nn\n=\u200953). Mice were housed in a 14-h light/10-h dark cycle at a constant temperature (23\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00b0C), with food and water available\nad libitum\naccording to the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. All mice used in this study were singly housed as necessitated by the sleep recording system. Following shipment, mice were acclimated to their environment for at least 3 days before any experiments. After surgery, mice were evaluated daily during post-operative care by physical examination and documentation of each animal's condition. Animal care was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Arizona (Phoenix, AZ).\n\nMidline fluid percussion injury\nMice (20\u201324\u2009g) were subjected to midline fluid percussion injury (mFPI) consistent with methods previously described.\n23\n,\n27\u201330\nGroup sizes are indicated in the\nResults\nsection and figure legends for individual studies. Mice were anesthetized using 5% isoflurane in 100% oxygen for 5\u2009min, and the head of the mouse was placed in a stereotaxic frame with continuously delivered isoflurane at 2.5% by nosecone. While anesthetized, body temperature was maintained using a Deltaphase\n\u00ae\nisothermal heating pad (Braintree Scientific Inc., Braintree, MA). A midline incision was made exposing bregma and lambda, and fascia was removed from the surface of the skull. A trephine (3-mm outer diameter) was used for the craniotomy, centered on the sagittal suture between bregma and lambda without disruption of the dura. An injury cap prepared from the female portion of a Luer-Loc needle hub was fixed over the craniotomy using cyanoacrylate gel and methyl-methacrylate (Hygenic Corp., Akron, OH). The incision was sutured at the anterior and posterior edges, and topical Lidocaine ointment was applied. The injury hub was closed using a Luer-Loc cap, and mice were placed in a heated recovery cage and monitored until they were ambulatory before being returned to their respective sleep cages.\nFor injury induction 24\u2009h post-surgery, mice were reanesthetized with 5% isoflurane delivered for 5\u2009min. The cap was removed from the injury-hub assembly, and the dura was visually inspected through the hub to ensure it was intact with no debris. The hub was then filled with normal saline and attached to an extension tube connected to the male end of the fluid percussion device (Custom Design and Fabrication; Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA). An injury of moderate severity for our injury model (1.4 atm) was administered by releasing the pendulum onto the fluid-filled cylinder after the return of a toe-pinch response. Sham-injured mice underwent the same procedure, except that the pendulum was not released. Injured mice were monitored for presence of a forearm fencing response, and righting reflex times were recorded as indicators of injury severity.\n31\nThe righting reflex time is the total time from the initial impact until the mouse spontaneously rights itself from a supine position. The fencing response is a tonic posturing characterized by extension and flexion of opposite arms that has been validated as an overt indicator of injury severity.\n31\nThe injury hub was removed, and the brain was inspected for uniform herniation and integrity of the dura. The dura was intact in all mice, so none were excluded as technical failures. The incision was cleaned with saline and closed using sutures. Moderately brain-injured mice had righting reflex recovery times greater than 6\u2009min and a positive fencing response.\nMice subjected to a moderate mFPI regained gross neurological function with no intervention, and therefore these injuries were most consistent with mild-moderate TBI, with a Glasgow Coma Score of 9\u201313, in which patients are generally responsive, but likely disoriented.\n17\nSham injured mice recovered a righting reflex immediately when removed from the injury device (within 20\u2009sec). To control for anesthetic used during the induction of injury, uninjured shams were split into two groups receiving a second exposure to isoflurane 3 or 9\u2009h after the initial exposure (\nFig. 1B\n). The single-TBI group also received a second exposure to isoflurane 3 or 9\u2009h before injury. After spontaneously righting, mice were placed in a heated recovery cage and monitored until they were ambulatory (approximately 5\u201315\u2009min) before being returned to their piezoelectric sleep cage (see below). Adequate measures were taken to minimize pain or discomfort.\n\nSleep recordings\nThe non-invasive sleep cage system (Signal Solutions, Lexington, KY) used in this study consisted of 16 separate units that simultaneously monitored sleep and wake states, as previously published.\n27\n,\n32\n,\n33\nEach cage unit housed a single mouse inside 18\u2009\u00d7\u200918\u2009cm walled compartments with attached food and water structures.\n32\nThe cages had open bottoms resting on polyvinylidine difluoride (PVDF) sensors that served as the cage floor.\n32\nThe non-invasive high-throughput PVDF sensors were coupled to an input differential amplifier that classified motions consistent with either activity related to wake or inactivity and regular breathing movements associated with sleep.\n27\n,\n32\nBriefly, sleep was primarily characterized by periodic (3\u2009Hz) and regular amplitude signals recorded from the PVDF sensors, typical of respiration from a sleeping mouse. In contrast, signals characteristic of wake were both the absence of characteristic sleep signals and higher-amplitude, irregular signals associated with volitional movements, even during quiet wake. The piezoelectric signals in 2-sec epochs were classified by a linear discriminant classifier algorithm based on multiple signal variables to produce a binary label of \u201csleep\u201d or \u201cwake.\u201d\n32\nMice sleep in a polycyclic manner (often more than 40 sleep episodes per hour\n34\n); therefore, mouse sleep was quantified as the minutes spent sleeping per hour, presented as a percentage for each hour. In the current study, brain-injured mice slept more during the dark cycles, but less during the light cycles, compared to control shams. To accurately measure this change in sleep, each mouse's percent sleep was converted to cumulative minutes slept and the absolute change in cumulative minutes was compared to control sham sleep.\n\nRotarod\nSensorimotor function was assessed using the Economex Rotarod system from Columbus Instruments (Columbus, OH). Mice were acclimated 3 days before surgery/injury. Mice were placed on the stationary rod and allowed to explore for 30\u2009sec. After exploration, mice were placed on the rod at a constant speed of 5 revolutions per minute (rpm). If the mouse fell off the rod, it was placed back on the rod and the timer was restarted (until the mice could walk 15\u2009sec at 5\u2009rpm). Next, mice were placed on the rod with an initial rotation speed of 5\u2009rpm and an acceleration of 0.2\u2009rpm/sec. The trial ended when the mouse fell off the rod; the acclimation period ended after two trials. After acclimation, mice were trained over 3 consecutive days before surgery/injury and the last training session was recorded as baseline. Testing occurred at 2, 5, and 7 DPI. For the training and testing phase, mice were placed on the stationary rod and the motor was started at 5\u2009rpm with an acceleration of 0.2\u2009rpm/sec. Two trials were run back to back, and mice were returned to cages thereafter. After 10\u2009min, mice preformed a third trial. Time spent on the rotarod from the best two trials were averaged to generate a time score for each mouse.\n\nNeurological Severity Score\nPost-traumatic neurological impairments were assessed at 2, 5, and 7 DPI using an 8-point Neurological Severity Score (NSS) paradigm adapted from those previously used in experimental models of TBI.\n35\u201338\nOne point was given for failure on an individual task, whereas no points were given if a mouse completed a task successfully. Mice were observed for hindlimb flexion, startle reflex, and seeking behavior (presence of these behaviors was considered successful task completion). Mice traversed in sequence, 3-, 2-, and 1-cm beams. The beams were elevated, and mice were given 1\u2009min to travel 30\u2009cm along the beams. The task was scored as a success if the mouse traveled 30\u2009cm with normal fore- and hindlimb position (fore-/hindlimb did not hang from the beam). Mice were also required to balance on a 0.5-cm beam and a 0.5-cm round rod for 3\u2009sec in a stationary position with front paws between hind paws. The resulting non-parametric data are presented as a composite score ranging from 0 to 8, representing performance on all tasks combined. High final NSS scores were indicative of task failure and interpreted as neurological impairment.\n\nOpen field\nThe open field task was used to assess locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior as previously described.\n39\nAt 7, 14, and 28 DPI, mice were placed in an empty arena (45\u2009\u00d7\u200945\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u2009cm, W\u2009\u00d7\u2009L\u2009\u00d7\u2009H) and allowed to explore freely for 5\u2009min. Mouse movement was tracked by an overhead camera, and the distance traveled, time spent in the center of the arena (29.5\u2009\u00d7\u200929.5\u2009cm), and number of entries into the center were calculated using EthoVision XT 10 software (Noldus Information Technology, Leesburg, VA).\n\nForced swim task\nDepressive-like behavior was assessed using the forced swim task (FST), as previously described.\n40\n,\n41\nFor 6\u2009min, mice were placed into glass cylinders (15\u2009cm diameter\u2009\u00d7\u200924.5\u2009cm H) filled with water (25\u00b0C). The first minute was excluded from analysis as an acclimation phase. Mice were visually recorded using an overhead camera. Videos were analyzed using EthoVision XT 10 software (Noldus Information Technology) for time spent actively swimming and time spent immobile.\n\nNovel object recognition\nCognitive impairment was tested using the novel object recognition (NOR) test as previously published.\n7\n,\n24\nThe test consisted of three phases: habituation, training, and testing. On the day of the test, mice were placed in an open field (42\u2009\u00d7\u200921\u2009\u00d7\u200921\u2009cm) for 1\u2009h of habituation. Mice were removed, and two identical objects were placed in opposing quadrants of the field for the training phase. Mice were then placed in the center of the open field and given 5\u2009min to explore the objects. After training, mice were returned to their home cages. Testing began 4\u2009h after training. One familiar object was placed in an original location, and one novel object was placed in the opposing quadrant of the open field. Mice were placed into the center and given 5\u2009min to explore. For testing, times spent actively investigating the novel and familiar object were quantified. Investigation of an object included the mice sniffing, touching, or climbing onto an object while facing the object. If an animal climbed onto an object and sniffed into the air, this time was not calculated into the exploration of the novel object. Testing data are displayed as the percentage of total investigation time spent with each object and as a discrimination index (DI) in which\n.\n\nTissue preparation\nAt pre-determined time points (7, 14, and 28 days) post-injury or sham operation, mice were given an overdose of sodium pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde after a phosphate-buffered saline flush. Brains were transferred to fresh fixative solution and sent to NeuroScience Associates Inc. (Knoxville, TN) to be processed for histological and immunohistochemical staining. Brains were embedded into a gelatin matrix where they could be frozen and sectioned from one solid block (MultiBrain\n\u00ae\nTechnology; NeuroScience Associates). Sections of 40-\u03bcm thickness were taken in the coronal plane and wet-mounted on 2% gelatin-subbed slides. Three series of tissue sections were labeled for neuropathology, neuroinflammation, and Orexin-A (see below). Both stained and unstained brain sections were returned to our laboratory.\n\nAminocupric silver technique\nNeuropathology, indicated by argyrophilic reaction product, was examined using the de Olmos amino cupric silver (Ag) technique according to proprietary protocols.\n42\u201345\nBrain sections were counterstained with Neutral Red to stain normal cell bodies. Stained sections were analyzed in our laboratory. Primary quantification of Ag-stained sections was carried out for hemispheres. Immunostained slides were imaged using a Zeiss Imager A2 microscope with AxioCam MRc5 digital camera (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany)). Digital images were taken of the right hemisphere of all brains using fixed exposure settings to ensure consistency, though mFPI is expected to exert equal forces bilaterally. Images were converted to grayscale, followed by digitally thresholding the pixel distribution to separate positively stained pixels from unstained pixels (ImageJ software; NIH, Bethesda, MD;\nhttps://imagej.nih.gov/ij/\n). Thresholded images were each then segmented into white and black pixels, indicating positive and negative staining, respectively. Finally, the percentage of positive pixels was calculated within the hemisphere.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nOne series of brain sections was labeled for ionized calcium binding protein-1 (Iba-1), and one series was labeled for Orexin-A by NeuroScience Associates using their proprietary protocols. Digital photomicrographs of Orexin-A tissue were captured from the lateral hypothalamus at 200\u2009\u00d7\u2009total magnification. Digital photomicrographs of Iba-1\u2013immunostained tissue were captured from the cortex at 400\u2009\u00d7\u2009total magnification. Care was taken to ensure that illumination and contrast settings were identical between treatment groups at the time of image acquisition.\n\nMicroglial identification and morphology analysis\nStained sections (\nn\n=\u20094 per group) were analyzed after Iba-1 staining to determine the average ramification of microglia post-injury. The area of interest, the primary somatosensory barrel fields (S1BF), was chosen based on previous work that demonstrated a multi-focal concentration of neuropathology and microglial activation in the S1BF after mFPI in the rodent.\n24\n,\n46\u201348\nSections were screened using a Zeiss (AXIO imager A2) microscope with attached digital camera (AxioCam MRc5). Images were captured with proprietary Zen software (Carl Zeiss) at 200\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification. The area of interest was examined in both hemispheres and in two different coronal planes: an anterior section (approximately bregma \u22121.555mm) and a posterior section (approximately bregma \u22122.255mm). A total of four photomicrographs per brain were analyzed in ImageJ (NIH). All photomicrographs were converted to binary and skeletonized images.\n49\nIn addition to creating skeletonized images, cell somas were manually counted for each photomicrograph. The Analyze Skeleton Plugin was then applied to the skeleton image, which tags skeletal features relevant to microglia ramification. For each photomicrograph, there was an original image, binary image, and skeleton image used to convert an entire original photomicrograph to a plugin-tagged image. We summarized the number of process endpoints and length from the Analyze Skeleton Plugin data output and normalized all data by the number of microglia cell somas per image to calculate the number of microglia endpoints per cell and microglia process length per cell.\n\nStatistical analyses\nFor each analysis, shams receiving isoflurane 3\u2009h apart and shams receiving isoflurane 9\u2009h apart were statistically compared. No differences were detected between sham groups, so shams were combined from each treatment. Percent sleep, mean bout length, bout episode duration, and differences in rotarod performance were analyzed using a repeated-measures two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons test. Cumulative sleep (min), open field (sec), elevated plus maze (EPM; sec), FST (sec), NOR (ratio/sec), hemispheric silver stain area (percent), and Orexin-A\u2013positive cells (number) were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons test. Non-parametric NSS data were analyzed using a Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by Dunn's multiple comparisons test. Differences in microglia cell counts/field, endpoints per cell, summed process length, and a spatial-temporal interaction between region and time post-injury were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey's multiple comparisons test. For all continuous variables, the assumption that variables were normally distributed was verified using a combination of density and q-q plots and Shapiro-Wilk tests to ensure validity of the analytical approaches used. Resulting critical values are included in the figure legends. All normally distributed data were screened using the Grubb's outlier test for statistical outliers; outliers are reported in the\nResults\nsection. All of the aforementioned analyses were conducted, and associated figures were constructed, using GraphPad Prism (version 6; GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA); results are shown as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM), with statistical significance assigned at the 95% confidence level (\u03b1 < 0.05).\nTo investigate whether the NSS or rotarod behavioral tests or cumulative sleep were predictive of silver stain pathology, microglia cell count, number of microglia process endpoints per cell, or summed microglia process lengths, we fit multiple linear regression models by maximum likelihood implemented using the lm function in R statistical software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).\n50\nWe used silver stain pathology, microglia cell count, endpoints per cell, and summed process lengths as outcome variables in four separate regression models (i.e., one model for each outcome), with NSS scores, rotarod scores, and cumulative sleep over the first 6\u2009h post-injury (CumSleep) as predictor variables. We included the TBI group as a categorical variable in all models to control for confounding; this variable had four levels (sham, TBI, rTBI 3\u2009h, and rTBI 9\u2009h) with\nsham\nas the reference level. Shapiro-Wilk tests were used to assess normality of continuous variables; results indicated that all continuous variables were approximately normally distributed (\np\n=\u20090.08\u20130.46). Multi-variate imputation by chained equations implemented in the R package MICE was used to replace missing data points with values estimated directly from the data by predictive mean matching, which assumed values were missing at random.\n51\nFive imputations were conducted using 50 Markov chain Monte Carlo iterations for each imputation, with a random number generator seed of 500. Convergence of iterations for each of the five imputations was assessed using trace plots, and plausibility of the imputed values was assessed by plotting imputed against observed values. We pooled fitted regression models for each outcome variable to produce combined coefficient estimates (\u03b2). Statistical significance was assigned to \u03b2 estimates if 95% confidence intervals (CIs) excluded zero."

    "Methods": "Literature search strategy\nA research librarian identified potential studies by searching the PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, and Web of Science electronic databases for any entries from inception until June 2017. Search results were limited to English language studies. The full search strategies are available in\nAppendix A\n. A combination of Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms (or equivalent) and free text were utilized including: brain injuries [MesH], Craniocerebral Trauma [MesH], Head Injuries, Closed, brain trauma, closed head injur*, concuss*, Mild TBI, mild traumatic brain injur*, mtbi AND diffusion tensor imaging [MesH], Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging, diffusion magnetic resonance, diffusion mri, diffusion tensor imag*, diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor MRI, diffusion tensor tractography, diffusion weighted imag*, DTI, DTT, diffusion tensor, magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging. All studies were imported into DistillerSR software (Evidence Partners Incorporated, Ottawa, Ontario) for duplicate removal, screening and data extraction.\n\nSelection criteria\nTwo independent reviewers (M.S, A.G) conducted an initial title and abstract screening. Studies were included at this stage if both reviewers agreed that the study: 1) was conducted in humans; 2) used DTI; 3) compared a mild and/or moderate TBI population with a control group; 4) did not study children <18 years old; and 5) was an original research paper (e.g., not a case study or review article). The full text of the studies that passed the abstract screening were then reviewed by two independent reviewers (M.S., J.S.) using the aforementioned criteria in addition to the following requirements for inclusion: 1) fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), mean diffusivity (MD), or the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in white matter was measured in both the TBI and control group; 2) An ROI (including tractography) or VW analysis (including TBSS) was employed; 3) the TBI population did not have a clinically diagnosed psychiatric comorbidity; and 4) the study was published in a peer reviewed journal (e.g., not a meeting abstract). Disagreements in full text screening were resolved by a third reviewer (L.H.). All reviewers were supervised by a board-certified neuroradiologist (M.L.L.)\n\nData extraction\nFor each study, the following variables were extracted by two reviewers (N.W., L.H.) and discrepancies were resolved via a collaborative review of the manuscript: number of male and female TBI and control subjects, age of TBI and control subjects, severity of injury, type of TBI population, time since injury, magnet field strength, number of diffusion directions, b value (other than 0), threshold used to test for significance, method of correction for multiple comparisons, and the DTI parameters explored. For ROI papers, we extracted data necessary to calculate a pooled effect size (mean and standard deviation [SD], or\np\nvalue and sample size or t- statistic and sample size) in each region of interest.\n10\nFor VW analysis, we extracted the X, Y, and Z coordinates (in any standard space) and significance level (\np\nor t values) of positive and negative peaks reported in each study. In the event of missing data, the authors were contacted at least twice, to request necessary data.\n\nStatistical analysis\nROI\nAll analyses were performed using the Comprehensive Meta Analyses Program v.3. We calculated the standardized mean difference (Hedges' g) in DTI parameters between TBI patients and controls in regions of interest reported in \u22652 studies. Given the methodological heterogeneity in DTI studies of TBI,\n3\nwe implemented a random effects models when <20 studies were available. The I\n2\nstatistic was calculated to determine whether to employ a fixed or random effects model where data from \u226520 studies were avaiable.\n11\nData from left and right hemispheres were considered as independent regions in order to directly compare ROI with VW analysis. Publication bias was assessed via visual inspection of funnel plots, if \u226510 studies were included in the primary analyses\n12\nand by using the Egger's test. Forest plots were generated using Meta Data Viewer.\n13\nVW\nAnisotropic Effect-Size Signed Differential Mapping (AES-SDM)\n14\n,\n15\nwas used to conduct a meta-analysis across VW studies. We utilized the following pre-processing parameters for all analyses: modality, DTI-FA; randomizations,1; correlation template, FA; anisotropy, 1; isotropic full width at half maximum, 20; and mask, white matter. We applied the default thresholds: peak z\u2009>\u20091, voxel\np\n=\u20090.005 and cluster size \u226510 voxels.\n14\nTo maximize our power, we conducted our AES-SDM analysis combining peak coordinates data from papers that used whole\u2013brain or TBSS voxel-wise methods.\n8\n,\n16\nFor sensitivity analyses, we considered locations within 10 voxels of the X, Y and Z as consistent with the primary results. Publication bias was assessed using the Egger's test.\nBoth\nIf data from TBI subjects were divided into separate groups, we calculated a pooled mean and standard deviation. For longitudinal studies, we utilized the more chronic time-point for analysis. Additionally, we conducted jackknife sensitivity and subgroup analyses (mild TBI patients only, <3 months and \u22653 months since injury) when more than two studies were available.\nAll procedures for this systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.\n17\nQuality assessment of individual studies was not quantified because suitable metrics are not available for observational DTI studies."

    "Methods": "Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and participant consents\nThe study protocol was approved by the Human Research Protection Office at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri. All individuals gave informed written consent. The study was registered with\nClinicalTrials.gov\n(NCT02980484). All procedures, outcome measures, and analyses were pre-specified and registered with the Open Science Foundation (osf.io/vjddq).\n49\nThe study was reviewed on a weekly basis by the investigators for safety.\n\nSubjects\nReferrals were solicited from the TBI clinics at Washington University in St. Louis and the Rehabilitation Institute of St. Louis. Participants included adults (age 18\u201365) with a primary diagnosis of TBI and a minimum score of 10 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). All subjects met\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition\n(DSM-5) criteria for a major depressive episode secondary to TBI (ICD-10 F06.32\u2014Mood disorder due to known physiological condition with major depressive-like episode) that persisted after at least one trial of antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Subjects with elevated seizure risk, including those with penetrating or hemorrhagic TBI, were excluded. TBI severity was classified according to the patient's existing clinical diagnosis, which was based on the consensus guidelines defined in 1993 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.\n50\nOther baseline clinical criteria were determined based on review of medical records. Intracranial metallic implants or neurostimulation devices were considered contraindications to treatment. Additional excluded diagnoses included dementia, moderate\u2013severe autism spectrum disorder, bipolar I disorder, schizophrenia spectrum disorders, active psychosis, or dysphoria clearly explained by etiology other than TBI or major depressive disorder (MDD; such as a substance-induced mood disorder). No changes or recommendations were made for the subject's usual medical treatment regimen as part of the study.\n\nMeasures\nThe primary outcome measure was the MADRS.\n51\nDSM-5 diagnostic assessment and MADRS were conducted by one of two senior psychiatry residents (SHS, NTT) who were blinded to the subjects' group assignments. For each subject, all MADRS assessments were administered by the same physician. MADRS was completed at baseline, after the 10th treatment, and after the final treatment.\nAdditional measures collected at baseline and after the full treatment course included personality testing with the temperament and character inventory (TCI)\n52\n; self-report mood scales in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox Emotion Battery\n53\n; cognitive testing with the NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery (CB)\n54\n;\nself-report headache Likert scores and six-question Headache Impact Test (HIT-6)\n55\n; and an expert psychiatric evaluation based on DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. Structural and functional MRI scans were performed at baseline and at the end of the treatment course for all subjects. At the end of the treatment course, all subjects were asked to guess their group assignments to assess the adequacy of blinding.\n\nSample size\nA recent meta-analysis of studies investigating rTMS for MDD demonstrated a weighted mean effect size of 0.86 for improvement in depressive symptom scores.\n56\nHowever, this meta-analysis did not include the effects of structural MRI-guided neuronavigation, which has been shown to improve efficacy of rTMS with a relative effect size of 0.56.\n57\nThis suggests that the efficacy of neuronavigated rTMS in comparison with sham may be estimated as the sum of these two values, or 1.42. Further, bilateral rTMS is likely more effective than unilateral rTMS6. We thus conservatively anticipated an effect size of between 0.86 and 1.42.\nThese values were used to estimate the sample size required to achieve an 80% chance of detecting an effect at\np\n<\u20090.05 using an unpaired two-tailed\nt\n-test. This yielded a required sample size between 20 and 46 subjects. We thus planned to conduct an interim analysis for sample size re-estimation after enrolling 20 subjects with total maximum enrollment of 50 subjects.\n\nMRI acquisition and analysis\nAcquisition\nPre- and post-treatment images were acquired with a 3T Siemens Magnetom Prisma magnetic resonance scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Functional acquisition included 16.5\u2009min of resting-state blood oxygen level\u2013dependent (BOLD) scans in three runs (416 frames per run, 48 axial slices using multi-band acquisition factor of 4, 3\u2009mm cubic voxel resolution, repetition time [TR] 800\u2009msec, echo time [TE] 26.6\u2009msec, flip angle 61\u00b0, imaging matrix 72\u2009\u00d7\u200972). Structural acquisition included one T1 Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acquisition Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) structural sequence (176 frames, 0.9375\u2009\u00d7\u20090.9375\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm voxel resolution, TR 2400\u2009msec, TE 3.19\u2009msec, flip angle 8\u00b0, imaging matrix 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256). This T1 weighted scan required approximately 5\u2009min. The complete imaging protocol required approximately 30\u2009min per subject.\nProcessing\nSpatial alignment, atlas registration, motion scrubbing at framewise displacement of 0.2\u2009mm and frequency filter for respiratory artifact,\n58\nnuisance regression, global signal regression, temporal filtering, spatial smoothing, and motion epoch interpolation were performed using in-house scripts by the methods described by Power and colleagues.\n59\nResulting time courses were used for all subsequent resting-state functional connectivity analyses.\nIndividualized resting-state network mapping\nProcessed time courses were used to construct individual-level resting-state functional connectivity maps via the multi-layer perceptron-based machine learning classifier as described in Hacker and colleagues.\n47\nThis method involves a machine learning algorithm that has been trained to recognize resting-state networks (RSNs) based on each voxel's seed-based connectivity profile. The algorithm classifies individual voxels in a patient's brain based on likelihood of membership in one of seven networks (dorsal attention, ventral attention, frontoparietal control, default mode, motor, language, and visual).\nThese seven RSNs were chosen meta-analytically based on task fMRI studies of 10 distinct networks, each containing several foci of activity. After refining these foci to maximize intra-network correlation and minimize inter-network correlation, three of the original networks (cingulo-opercular network, affective network, and distinct foveal and peripheral vision networks) were not clearly discriminable at the individual level.\n47\nHowever, the optimal number of networks in the brain remains a topic of active debate due to improved granularity with newer RSN mapping procedures, which are outside the scope of the present work. The Yeo 2011 seven-network parcellation is still widely used as a consensus definition of network boundaries since it agrees with boundaries defined by task activation studies.\n41\nThis approach was chosen because it has been used successfully for preoperative neurosurgical mapping,\n60\nwhile newer approaches to individualized RSN mapping have not been implemented clinically to our knowledge. Some recent techniques carry the advantage of further subclassifying certain RSNs,\n27\n,\n46\nbut we were unable to identify a theoretical basis for targeting a specific subdivision of DAN and DMN in this study.\nrTMS target selection\nIndividualized rTMS treatment targets were identified as described in Siddiqi and colleagues, 2018 (preprint at\nbiorxiv.org/content/early/2017/11/21/151696\n). The individualized RSN maps were used to calculate the absolute difference between likelihoods of DAN and DMN membership for each voxel. The image was masked to include only voxels within 6\u2009mm of the outer surface of a standard Talairach atlas template brain in order to include only superficial gray matter regions,\n61\nwhich are more readily accessible via rTMS.\n62\nAs an approximation of DLPFC, a second mask was applied to include only voxels within 20\u2009mm of Brodmann areas 9 and 46, which was a smaller radius than described in previous retrospective work.\n29\nA smaller size was chosen to avoid inclusion of excessively anterolateral regions (which are likely to produce substantial facial muscle contraction) and excessively posterior regions (which are associated with increased seizure risk due to possible inadvertent stimulation of motor cortex). Positive clusters in the resulting image were identified using FSL's cluster algorithm (FMRIB Software Library, Oxford, UK)\n63\n,\n64\nwith an image threshold of 75% of the maximum Z-score. The centers of gravity of the peak clusters in each hemisphere were chosen as optimal left- and right-sided rTMS stimulation sites (exemplars shown in\nFig. 1\n). These coordinates were transformed from Talairach to native space using the 4dfp tool suite. In four subjects who volunteered to receive two additional resting-state fMRI scans for reliability assessment, test\u2013retest variability of the target coordinates ranged between 0.9 and 8.3\u2009mm (\nFig. 1B\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nA priori\nregions of interest used for functional connectivity analysis depicted on a group-mean surface projection. Dorsal attention and default mode networks were identified using individualized winner-take-all maps for each subject. Left and right stimulation sites were identified using the individualized difference between dorsal attention and default mode network membership likelihoods. Subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, which was defined based on an\na priori\ngroup seed, generally overlapped with the default mode network parcel. Color image is available online.\n\nStudy treatment\nSubjects were randomized to receive active rTMS or sham treatment with a Magstim Rapid-2 stimulator. Active treatment was delivered using a double 70-mm air-cooled coil. Sham treatment was delivered using a double 70-mm Alpha sham coil, which produces a similar sound, but delivers only a weak magnetic pulse that is not adequate for substantial stimulation of deep or superficial nerves. All other study procedures, including neuronavigation, were identical for the two groups.\nTreatment course included 20 daily sessions of bilateral rTMS using high-frequency left-sided stimulation (4000 pulses at 10\u2009Hz frequency with 5-sec trains and 20-sec inter-train interval) followed by low-frequency right-sided stimulation (a single train of 1000 pulses with 1\u2009Hz frequency). A dorsolateral prefrontal node, which was identified based on individual-level functional connectivity mapping as described above, was targeted using the Brainsight neuronavigation system (Rogue Research, Montreal, Canada). The intensity of rTMS stimulation was 120% of resting motor threshold (RMT). RMT was determined bilaterally by measuring electromyogram (EMG) activation in the contralateral abductor pollicis brevis muscle. An EMG activation of at least 50\u2009\u03bcV was considered to be a positive test. The overall RMT was determined using the titration algorithm implemented by the TMS motor threshold assessment tool.\n65\n\nTest\u2013retest reliability\nA subset of four subjects returned for two follow-up resting-state fMRI scans. To avoid bias from acute effects of treatment, these scans were completed at least 3 months after completion of study treatments. Parameters for each imaging sequence were identical to the initial and final study visits. The follow-up session included one structural T1 MPRAGE sequence and six 5.5-min BOLD runs following the same protocol as the pre-treatment and post-treatment imaging sessions. After the first three BOLD runs, each subject was removed from the scanner and asked to take a 5-min break. The subject was then placed back into the scanner for the final three BOLD runs. Connectivity results from these sessions were used for analysis of test\u2013retest reliability.\n\nStatistical analysis\nClinical measures\nThe primary analysis of the primary outcome measure was mean percentage change in MADRS, which was compared between the active and sham groups. The original plan was to perform unpaired two-tailed\nt\n-tests at the interim and final analyses. Because the study stopped before the planned interim analyses, no formal test of statistical significance was performed for treatment-induced changes. Instead, effect sizes are reported for the purposes of planning future trials. Equality of variances was assessed via F-tests.\nSecondary analyses of the primary outcome included mean percentage change in individual MADRS subscales\nSecondary outcomes included changes in NIH Toolbox cognitive composite scores; NIH Toolbox emotional composite scores; temperament and character inventory scales; and HIT-6 and headache Likert scores.\nImaging analyses\nA whole\u2013brain \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d parcellated map was generated by assigning each voxel to the network with which it demonstrated the highest likelihood of membership. The networks identified by this parcellated map were used as regions of interest (ROIs) for seed-based connectivity analysis.\nBOLD time courses were analyzed for seed-based functional connectivity by determining covariance matrices between five\na priori\nspecified regions of interest (ROIs). ROIs included the individualized winner-take-all maps of DAN and DMN; sgACC as defined by the meta-analysis in Fox and colleagues\n29\n; and 24-mm diameter spherical ROIs at the left and right-sided stimulation sites (\nFig. 1A\n). Effect sizes were calculated to compare treatment-induced changes in connectivity between DAN, DMN, and sgACC in active and sham groups.\nTo examine connectivity-based predictors of response, the connectivity of both stimulation sites with sgACC was compared with antidepressant response. A least squares regression model was constructed using baseline target-sgACC connectivity and baseline MADRS as predictors of post-treatment MADRS. Because antidepressant response could not be assumed to be normally distributed in this small sample, all data were rank-transformed, which is consistent with prior methods described in Weigand and colleagues.\n31\nImaging test\u2013retest reliability\nTest\u2013retest reliability of the targeting method was assessed for the four subjects who received a pair of follow-up scan sessions several months after treatment. The target stimulation coordinates were computed separately for each session. Euclidean distance between this pair of coordinates was calculated in order to confirm the intrinsic test\u2013retest reliability of the targeting method.\nTest\u2013retest reliability was also assessed for functional connectivity measures. For each ROI, seed-based connectivity was computed with the five\na priori\nROIs used for functional connectivity analysis. This generated 15 connectivity values for each of the four subjects. Pearson correlations were calculated for these 60 connectivity values between pre-treatment and post-treatment scans. The resulting correlation values were used as estimates of test\u2013retest reliability of the\na priori\nROI pairs.\nReliability of individualization\nTo assess whether individualization was reliable, FC values and target coordinates were compared within individuals and between individuals. We hypothesized that inter-individual variability would significantly exceed intra-individual variability, suggesting that the observed variability results from genuine differences between individuals rather than methodological limitations.\nFor the four subjects who received additional test\u2013retest scans, individualization was assessed for ROI-ROI connectivity values. For each ROI pair, intra-individual variability was calculated as the mean change in connectivity between the two separate scan sessions across these four subjects. To estimate inter-individual variability, this calculation was modified such that each subject's first scan was compared with the second scan for the other three subjects. Mean inter-individual variability was compared with mean intra-individual variability using paired\nt\n-test.\nTo determine whether the target remained stable during the course of treatment, optimal stimulation sites were computed separately for the pre-treatment scan and the post-treatment scan for all subjects in the study. The Euclidean distance between these two coordinates was used as an estimate of intra-individual change. To estimate inter-individual variability, this calculation was modified such that each subject's pre-treatment scan was compared with the post-treatment scan for all other subjects, which is representative of the variability expected by chance. To confirm whether individualized targets were more stable than expected by chance, inter-individual and intra-individual variability were compared for both targets using a permutation test."

    "Methods": "Animals\nYoung adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN; 10 weeks old, 300\u2013325\u2009g) were used for these studies (see\nTable 1\nfor numbers). Dually housed animals had access to food and water\nad libitum\n.

Specifically, the animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (2\u20134%) and placed in a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA); the skin was retracted and a 6-mm unilateral craniotomy was performed that was centered between bregma and lambda. The skull cap was removed without disruption of the underlying dura. The exposed brain was injured using a 5-mm beveled tip that impacted the cortex at \u22653.5\u2009m/sec to a depth of 2.2\u2009mm. Following the injury, surgical foam (Surgicel, Johnson & Johnson) was laid upon the dura and the craniotomy site was sealed with a sterile 8-mm plastic disc glued to the skull with Mascot tissue adhesive (Gesswein, Bridgeport, CT). The wound was closed with wound clips, the animal was removed from the stereotactic device, and the animal regained consciousness in a recovery cage on a circulating water heating pad.\n\nChemicals\nSodium pyruvate, malate, rotenone, carbonyl cyanide\np\n-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), magnesium chloride (MgCl\n2\n), sucrose, mannitol, EGTA, EDTA, bovine serum albumin (BSA), glycerol, HEPES potassium salt, Triton-X, Tris Buffered Saline with Tween 20 (TBS-T), TrisHCl, NaCl, KCl, and potassium phosphate monobasic anhydrous (KH\n2\nPO\n4\n) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO); oligomycin was obtained from Enzo Life Sciences (Farmingdale, NY); and protease inhibitors (Complete Mini Preotease Inhibitor Cocktail tablet) were obtained from Roche Diagnostics (Indianapolis, IN).\n\nDrug preparation and dosing\nPhenelzine sulfate salt (PZ; MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) was freshly diluted each day in 0.9% saline. For subcutaneous (s.c.) injections, dilutions were made to deliver the assigned dose in an injection volume of 0.2\u2009mL/100\u2009g rat. A 10\u2009mg/kg dose of PZ was administered at 15-min post-TBI followed up by a maintenance dose of 5\u2009mg/kg at 12\u2009h post-TBI. For the pilot delay study, a 10\u2009mg/kg dose of PZ was administered at 1\u2009h post-TBI followed by a maintenance dose of 5\u2009mg/kg at 24\u2009h post-TBI. These dosages were used based upon previously published work.\n46\n,\n47\nA separate, blinded experimenter administered treatments (either PZ or vehicle) to the animals.\n\nIsolation of Ficoll-purified total cortical mitochondria\nRat brain mitochondria were isolated from the ipsilateral (injured) cortex as previously described\n4\n,\n7\n,\n46\n,\n50\nat 24 and 72\u2009h post-injury (hpi) or from sham (craniotomized, but not injured) rats at the corresponding post-surgery time-points. In brief, rats were deeply anesthetized with CO\n2\nand decapitated, and cortical tissue was rapidly dissected using an 8-mm tissue punch to collect the injury epicenter and surrounding peri-contusional cortical tissue. Brain tissue was then homogenized using a Potter-Elvejhem homogenizer containing ice-cold isolation buffer (215\u2009mM mannitol, 75\u2009mM sucrose, 0.1% BSA, 20\u2009mM HEPES, 1\u2009mM EGTA). The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 1300\u2009rcf for 3\u2009min, then pelleted at 13,000\u2009rcf for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. The crude mitochondrial pellet was re-suspended in isolation buffer and subjected to nitrogen bombing at 1200\u2009psi and layered on top of a discontinuous 7.5% and 10% Ficoll gradient and centrifuged at 32,000\u2009rpm for 30\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. The final mitochondrial pellet was rinsed with isolation buffer without EGTA and then re-suspended in an appropriate volume of isolation buffer without EGTA to yield a protein concentration of 10\u2009\u03bcg/\u03bcL. Mitochondrial protein concentration was determined using a Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Omaha, NE) measuring absorbance at 562\u2009nm with a BioTek Synergy HT plate reader (Winooski, VT).\n\nMeasurement of\nex vivo\nmitochondrial respiratory function\nMitochondrial respiratory rates were measured using a Clarke-type electrode in a continuously stirred, sealed, and thermostatically controlled chamber (Oxytherm System, Hansatech Instruments Ltd., Norfolk, England, UK) maintained at 37\u00b0C as previously described.\n4\n,\n12\n,\n18\n,\n51\n,\n52\nMitochondria loaded into the chamber were normalized based on protein content: 40\u2013100\u2009\u03bcg of isolated mitochondrial protein were placed into the chamber with 250\u2009\u03bcL KCl-based respiration buffer (RB; 125\u2009mM KCl, 2\u2009mM MgCl\n2\n, 2.5\u2009mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 20\u2009mM HEPES, and 0.1% BSA, pH 7.2) warmed to 37\u00b0C and allowed to equilibrate for approximately 1\u2009min. State II respiration was fueled by addition of the Complex I substrates, 5\u2009mM pyruvate and 2.5\u2009mM malate. One minute later, two boluses of 150\u2009\u03bcM ADP were sequentially added to the mitochondria to initiate State III respiration, followed by the addition of 2\u2009\u03bcM oligomycin, an inhibitor of ATPase, to monitor State IV respiratory rate for an additional 2\u2009min. To assess the uncoupled respiratory rate (State V (I)), 2\u2009\u03bcM FCCP was added to the mitochondria, followed by the addition of 1\u2009\u03bcM rotenone to shut down Complex I-driven respiration completely. Complex II-driven respiration (State V (II)) was then initiated with the addition of 10\u2009mM succinate, a Complex II substrate.\n4\nThe slope of the oxygen consumption trace corresponded with the respiratory rate and the respiratory control ratio (RCR) was calculated by dividing the State III oxygen consumption rate (defined as the maximal rate of respiration in the presence of ADP, second bolus addition) by State IV oxygen consumption rate (defined as the rate of respiration in the presence of oligomycin, using the last 30\u2009sec of the 2\u2009min after the addition of the substrate). Mitochondria were isolated and prepared fresh for every experiment and were used immediately for respiration assays and then stored at \u221280\u00b0C for further analysis.\n\nReal-time evaluation of mitochondrial Ca\n2+\nbuffering and membrane potential\nMitochondrial CB and membrane potential (MP) experiments were performed simultaneously in a stirred cuvette loaded into a spectrofluorimeter (Shimadzu RF-5301) maintained at 37\u00b0C. Mitochondria (\u223c0.1\u2009mg protein) were added to 2\u2009mL RBat pH 7.2 with a combination of the fluorescent Ca\n2+\n-sensitive dye (CaG5N 100\u2009nM; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to monitor extra-mitochondrial concentrations of Ca\n2+\nand tetra-methyl rhodamineethyl ester (TMRE; 150\u2009nM) for estimating transmembrane potential (\u0394\u03c8\nm\n) as previously described.\n4\nThere was sequential addition of the following each minute: pyruvate (5\u2009mM)/malate (2.5\u2009mM), ADP (150\u2009\u03bcM), then oligomycin (1\u2009\u03bcM) (\nFigs. 1\nand\n\u200b\nand2).\n2\n). At the fifth minute, continuous Ca\n2+\ninfusion (32\u2009mM CaCl\n2\n) was initiated using a 50-\u03bcL Hamilton syringe on an infusion pump at a rate of 0.5\u2009\u03bcL/min.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nOxygen consumption rates for each state of mitochondrial respiration were quantified and representative graphs\n(A\u2013F)\ndemonstrate the changes in cortical mitochondrial dysfunction in response to a 24- versus 72-h PZ treatment paradigm following severe TBI in male rats. There was a significant reduction in oxygen consumption rates at 24\u2009h for most states of respiration that persisted and deteriorated further by 72\u2009h post-injury (hpi) in isolated cortical mitochondria from vehicle-treated animals compared with sham (stats in results). More importantly, administration of PZ after TBI was able to significantly recover these deficits at both the 24- and 72-h time-points for most states of respiration compared with vehicle. Delayed administration of PZ also significantly improved some states of mitochondrial respiration at 72\u2009h following TBI compared with 72-h vehicle-treated animals (*\np\n<\u20090.05, **\np\n<\u20090.01, ***\np\n<\u20090.001). PZ, phenelzine; TBI, traumatic brain injury.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nRepresentative CaG5N spectrophotometer traces\n(A)\nillustrate differences to increasing Ca\n2+\nload between isolated cortical mitochondria from the experimental groups at 24\u2009h post-TBI. The inset (A) illustrates how the traces were analyzed. Evaluation of the CaG5N traces for the time to\n(B)\nreveal a slight decrease in the time to MPT, however, PZ treatment had no effect. Additional analysis of CaG5N traces\n(C)\nreveal a significant decrease in Ca\n2+\nbuffering capacity (increased CB slope) in isolated cortical mitochondrial from vehicle-treated animals compared with sham (*\np\n<\u20090.05) and PZ administration appeared to partially restore the CB capacity back down to within sham levels. PZ, phenelzine; TBI, traumatic brain injury.\n\nCalculation of mitochondrial Ca\n2+\nbuffering capacity\nThe responses of isolated cortical mitochondria to Ca\n2+\ninfusion were calculated from recorded CaG5N traces (\nFig. 1A\n, inset) as previously described.\n4\n,\n12\n,\n53\nAs the mitochondria begin to buffer the Ca\n2+\nbeing infused into the chamber, the CaG5N trace levels out. To determine the steady state of CB, linear regression was used to plot and generate equations. As the mitochondria in the chamber are no longer able to buffer anymore Ca\n2+\n, and the membrane permeability transition pore (mPTP or MPT) opens, the CaG5N trace goes up again. Using 1-min slope intervals, the peak slope was calculated during the phase of the trace where the mitochondrial are failing to buffer Ca\n2+\n; again linear regression was used to plot and generate equations. The linear regression intersection was calculated algebraically to obtain the time to MPT, then to convert the x-value (time) to nmol Ca\n2+\n/mg protein/min.\n\nCalculation of mitochondrial membrane potential\nThe changes in MP in response to sequentially added substrates (see above) and infused Ca\n2+\nwere calculated from recordings of fluorescence quenching of the cationic dye TMRE, a mitochondrial MP indicator (\nFig. 2A\n, inset). The mitochondrial MP increases with the addition of Pyr/Mal (TMRE intensity decreases), decreases with ADP (TMRE intensity increases), and increases maximally with the addition of Oligo. The mitochondrial MP remains relatively stable while the mitochondria are still able to buffer Ca\n2+\n, but as they reach MPT, the mitochondria lose their MP. Once the TMRE trace begins to level off and peak close to baseline levels (highest TMRE intensity), the uncoupler FCCP was added to complete the trace and confirm loss of MP (not shown on trace). After additions of substrates/inhibitors, average TMRE intensities were quantified. Additionally, the gradual loss of MP was evaluated by calculating the change in TMRE intensity over time (area under the curve [AUC] using Graph Pad Prism).\n\nPreparation of cortical mitochondrial samples for measurement of oxidative damage\nA portion of the isolated cortical mitochondria (see\nTable 1\nfor numbers) was used for the quantitative measurements of 4-HNE and acrolein as an index of LP-mediated oxidative damage at 24 and 72\u2009h post-TBI. Mitochondrial samples were centrifuged at maximum speed for 10\u2009min to remove residual isolation buffer. The pellets were re-suspended in 20\u201330\u2009\u03bcL ice-cold Triton lysis buffer (1% Triton-X, 20\u2009mM tris-HCl, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 5\u2009mM EGTA, 10\u2009mM EDTA, 10% glycerol) with protease inhibitors. Samples were then briefly sonicated, repeatedly vortexed, and incubated on ice for 45\u2009min; then they were centrifuged at maximum speed for 30\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. Supernatants were collected for protein assay and stored at \u221220\u00b0C.\n\nPreparation of cortical and hippocampal homogenates for measurement of oxidative and cytoskeletal damage\nRats were deeply anesthetized with CO\n2\n, and decapitated; the injured ipsilateral cortical tissue (left hemisphere; 8-mm tissue punch; as described above) and the underlying ipsilateral hippocampus were rapidly dissected and immediately transferred to tubes on ice pre-filled with Triton lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. Samples were briefly sonicated, repeatedly vortexed, and incubated on ice for 45\u2009min. The samples were centrifuged at maximum speed for 30\u2009min at 4\u00b0C and supernatants were collected for protein assay and stored at \u221220\u00b0C.\n\nMeasurement of mitochondrial reactive aldehydes by Western blot\nForty microgram aliquots of cortical mitochondrial protein samples were resolved on 12% Bis-Tris Criterion\u2122 XT pre-cast sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide (SDS-PAGE) gels (BioRad, Hercules, CA; 20\u2009\u03bcL total volume) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a semi-dry electro-transferring unit set at 15\u2009V for 60\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. Following gel transfer, membranes were incubated in a TBS blocking solution with 5% milk for 1\u2009h at room temperature (RT). The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and imaged to validate sample loading. For detection of proteins, the membranes were incubated with one of the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-4-HNE (1:2000; Alpha Diagnostics Intl. [ADI], San Antonio, TX), rabbit anti-acrolein (1:2000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), or rabbit anti-VDAC (1:30,000; Millipore) in TBS-T with 5% milk on an orbital shaker overnight at 4\u00b0C. After washing with TBS and TBS-T, the membranes were incubated for 1\u2009h at RT with an infrared labeled secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IRDye 800 (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE) to bind to the primary antibody. The bound complex was detected using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor). The images were analyzed using the Odyssey Application Software (Image Studio) to obtain the integrated intensities.\n\nMeasurement of cellular oxidative markers by Western blot\nFifty microgram aliquots of each sample, combined with an XT Reducing Agent (BioRad), were resolved on 4\u201312% Bis-Tris gels and transferred as described above. The membranes were incubated with the following antibodies: rabbit anti-4-HNE (ADI; 1:2000) or rabbit anti-acrolein (Abcam; 1:2000) in combination with a second primary antibody, mouse anti-\u03b1-tubulin (Abcam, Cambridge, MA; 1:10,000) in TBS-T with 5% milk. After washing, the membranes were incubated with infrared labeled secondary antibodies goat anti-rabbit IRDye 800 and goat anti-mouse IRDye 680 (Li-Cor) to bind to the primary antibodies. The images were obtained using the Li-Cor and analyzed using Image Studio (as described above).\n\nMeasurement of \u03b1II-spectrin degradation by Western blot\nFor evaluation of the 150 and 145\u2009kD spectrin breakdown products, 10-\u03bcg aliquots of each sample were used. Prepared cortical and hippocampal tissue samples were combined with an XT Reducing Agent (BioRad), resolved on 3\u20138% Tris-Acetate gels and transferred as described above. The membranes were incubated with a mouse anti-\u03b1-spectrin antibody (ENZO; 1:5000) in combination with a rabbit \u03b2-tubulin (Abcam; 1:10,000) in TBS-T with 5% milk. After washing, the membranes were incubated with infrared labeled secondary antibodies goat anti-rabbit IRDye 800 and goat anti-mouse IRDye 680 (Li-Cor) to bind to the primary antibodies. The images were again obtained using the Li-Cor and analyzed using Image Studio (as described above).\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed with Prism version 7.0 (Graph Pad, San Diego, CA). The data were analyzed using an initial one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) or Tukey's\npost hoc t\ntests. For all data sets, a\np\n-value of <0.05 was defined as statistically significant. For all ANOVAs, if the Brown-Forsythe test showed significant differences in variance, then the Mann-Whitney (M-W) test was used to specifically look at the pharmacological effect of PZ compared with the vehicle for each time-point. Quantitative analysis revealed significant differences among groups for multiple outcome measures in this article; however, the emphasis of graphical representation was designed to highlight the statistically significant differences of the pharmacological treatment paradigm(s); therefore, significant differences as compared with the sham group are mostly noted in the\nResults\nsection, and not annotated on the graphs. All data for graphical representation are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD) (ANOVA) or median \u00b195% confidence interval (CI) (M-W)."

Twenty-one volunteers with SCI were screened for this study. Seven candidates were not recruited because they did not fit into inclusion criteria (e.g., neurological level of injury was too high [above C5] or too low [below T12;\nn\n=\u20094], presence of stem cells implant in the injury site [\nn\n=\u20091], pressure sores [\nn\n=\u20091], or contractures [n\u2009=\u20091]), and the remaining two decided to not participate due to scheduling conflicts.

Reference signals were recorded from the stimulator to monitor stimulation artifacts.\n\nIneffective (sham) stimulation\nIn seven participants, P1\u2013P2, P4\u2013P7, and P9 (\nTable 1\n), intentionally ineffective for standing sham stimulation was administered at one of the locations as effective tSCS, between the T11 and T12 spinous processes, at a frequency of 30\u2009Hz, and intensities up to 200\u2009mA, but utilizing\nbiphasic\npulses instead of\nmonophasic\n, with each 1-msec pulse filled by a carrier frequency of 10\u2009kHz. Such an approach mimicked the experience and visceral sensation of the effective tSCS, from the perspective of the participant, by creating strong tonic contraction of the paraspinal muscles. Even with a higher stimulation intensity, however, biphasic pulses filled by a 10\u2009kHz carrier frequency did not induce detectible activity of motor pools projecting to the leg muscles, and therefore, were not producing motor output in the lower limbs. In four participants P3, P11\u2013P12, and P14 (\nTable 1\n), stimulation was delivered remotely from the lumbosacral enlargement, between the spinous processes of T7\u2013T8, with the pulse configuration, frequency, and intensities of stimulation being the same as the effective tSCS. Similarly, with such an approach, the participants stated perceiving the contraction of the paraspinal muscles; however, the motor pools projecting to the leg muscles were not activated. During all sham and effective tSCS conditions, the procedures of placement of the stimulating and recording electrodes, order of tests, and instructions remained constant from the perspective of the participants and trainers (\nFig. 1A\u2013B\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSchematics presenting the experimental design and interventions.\n(A)\nFifteen individuals were tested in a single experimental session without and in the presence of tSCS. Eleven participants received sham stimulation by using intentionally ineffective for standing pulse configuration or location of delivery.\n(B)\nSix participants underwent 12 training sessions, where trials without and with spinal stimulation were randomly assigned within each session. Shown is an example of protocol during a single training session.\n(C)\nDecision tree exemplifying the adjustment of the stimulation parameters during \u201costural adjustments\u201d in each experimental session (see description in the text).\u201d\n+\u201d\nand \u201c\n\u2212\u201d\nindicate an increase or decrease of spinal stimulation intensity, respectively. tSCS, transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation.\n\nEMG recording\nSurface electromyogram (EMG) signals were recorded bilaterally using bipolar surface electrodes (Noraxon, US) placed over the soleus (SOL), tibialis anterior (TA), vastus lateralis (VL), and medial hamstring (MH) muscles with fixed inter-electrode distance of 20\u2009mm. The EMG signals were amplified using PowerLab system (ADInstruments, Australia) with a band-pass filter of 10\u2009Hz to 2\u2009kHz, and digitized at a sampling rate of 4\u2009kHz.\nDuring tSCS, evoked motor potentials were induced in the leg muscles, and their peak-to-peak amplitude was calculated within a \u22125 to 45\u2009msec time window in relation to the reference signals from the stimulation channel. Because of the relatively low stimulation frequency and remoteness of stimulation electrodes from the EMG, there was little interference between the stimulation artifacts and recorded signals, allowing for derivation of the induced responses in the time windows free of artifacts. Typically, six spinally evoked motor potentials from a given muscle were analyzed and compared between different tSCS characteristics, including stimulation intensity, frequency, location, and motor task.\nTo compare the muscle output without stimulation and with tSCS or sham stimulation conditions, the digitized EMG time series were full-wave rectified and processed as described previously.\n29\nBriefly, the reference signal from the stimulation channel was used to determine the onset and offset of stimulation artifacts; to set the portion of the artifact corresponding to the stimuli to zero, a linear adaptive filter was utilized to reduce the magnitude of the noise signal and remove any significant outliers while retaining prominent muscle activation features, for example, muscle activation peaks. Muscle activity was quantified by calculating the mean EMG signal amplitude within a 1-sec measurement window, immediately before and during leaning in the mediolateral or anteroposterior direction as described below.\n\nApparatus for standing\nA custom-designed stand frame was used to provide balance assistance during upright standing, and did not passively constrain the participant's torso or legs. This frame included height adjustable handrails that participants could use for weight-bearing and/or balance if required. External assistance was provided as needed by trainers to the participants' knees and/or hips. The amount of applied assistance was titrated to be as minimal as possible to promote knee and hip joint extension and maintain upright posture; the trainers were instructed to remove their hands from the participant's knees or hips if independent extension was achieved and the assistance was not required. Two 4-cm\u2009\u00d7\u20094-cm force-sensing resistor (FSR) sensors (Interlink Electronics, Inc., US),were placed above the participant's knees, and they were used to measure the interactive force between the surface of the participant's leg and the trainer's hands, to quantify the level of assistance provided by the trainer to facilitate each knee's extension. The FSR sensors were powered from a regulated 5-V supply, and calibrated using a set of fixed weights. The trainer placed their palms on the FSR sensors and the amount of force during the manual assistance was recorded. The system also incorporated a force plate system Stabilan-01 (Rhythm Ltd., Russia), which measured the participants' center of pressure (COP) excursions. The data from the FSR sensors and force plate were digitized at a sampling rate of 4000 and 50\u2009Hz, respectively.\n\nExperimental protocol\nThe experimental sessions typically involved at least three team members: two trainers who assisted in standing, and one researcher controlling the stimulation parameters. Neither participants nor trainers knew whether and at which intensity spinal stimulation was initiated by the researcher, thereby blinding the study.\nPrior to the sessions, the participants had been requested to empty the bladder. All participants were examined initially during sitting to characterize the level of recruitment of motor pools innervating leg muscles, using stimulation over a range of intensities at the T11 and L1 vertebral sites. The participants were then transferred to the standing position, and the tests were performed without and in the presence of tSCS. During all tests in standing, participants were instructed to minimize the use of their arms for weight-bearing and to attempt to extend their knees and hips. We have defined \u201cself-assisted\u201d standing as the one during which the participants were able to maintain their standing posture with knees and hips extended without any additional support via mechanical constrain of the joints or trainer assistance. \u201cMinimally assisted standing\u201d was characterized as the one when some trainer assistance was applied to the knee or/and hip joint. In both conditions, the participants could use their hands for upper body balance.\nEach 120-min session routinely included \u201cpostural adjustments,\u201d during which trainers positioned the participant on the force plate and, using a mirror on a side, prompted them to align the body and limbs to achieve an upright position that was biomechanically close to natural standing. Specifically, the effort was made to ensure full knee and hip extension bilaterally, and to maintain the body's center of mass toward the forward limit of stability\n32\n(\nSupplementary Movie S1\n; see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). Once the standing posture was optimized, the participants were instructed to view the monitor placed in front of the stand frame, where real-time biofeedback of their COP position was displayed. The participants were asked to lean in the mediolateral or anteroposterior direction and maintain this position for 1\u2009sec, with the goal to maximize the COP limits of stability during these self-initiated body-weight displacements.\n33\nSubsequently, tSCS was administered by the researcher. Stimulation intensity was set to induce independent extension in at least one knee with the ultimate goal of no assistance provided to the knees and hips. If stimulation induced flexion in the leg antigravity muscles, the intensity was reduced. Once the researcher verified the stimulation parameters corresponding to the level minimizing the external support during standing, the self-initiated body-weight displacements were performed as described above in the presence of tSCS (\nFig. 1C\n).\nIn six participants (P1\u2013P5, P8) the effects of tSCS delivered during standing over the T11 and L1 at frequencies of 5, 15, and 25\u2009Hz, and at intensities up to 100\u2009mA, were investigated during the first experimental session to induce self-assisted or minimally assisted standing. In the remaining participants, the L1 and a frequency of 15\u2009Hz were used consistently, with only stimulation intensity adjusted to the level sufficient to maximally facilitate standing.\n\nStand training\nSix participants (P1\u2013P6) underwent 12 sessions of stand training, performed 3 days per week (\nFig. 1B\n). Two types of exercises were utilized: \u201cCircle,\u201d where the participants were instructed to shift their body weight in a circular pattern and follow a trajectory displayed on the monitor, and \u201cBasketball,\u201d where three targets of different colors appeared on the top of the screen, and the participants were instructed to direct the target into the \u201cbasket\u201d of the matching color by shifting their COP. The duration of each exercise varied from 1 to 2\u2009min. To motivate participants to improve their performance, they were instructed to maximize their score during each exercise. The game-based exercises were practiced both without and in the presence of optimized tSCS. Stimulated and non-stimulated conditions were interspersed in a pseudo-random sequence at the individual level to achieve balanced protocol, and each participant received an equal number of each condition within a given experimental session, which lasted as long as the participant's endurance allowed on a given day.\n\nMulti-site spinal cord stimulation\nEffects of multi-site stimulation\n34\nwere tested in the participants P1\u2013P2 (during 12th session), and P15. In P1 and P2, during standing enabled by stimulation over L1 at 15\u2009Hz, T11 stimulation was periodically delivered at 30\u2009Hz, at the intensity corresponding to motor threshold responses in the leg muscles. P15 (AIS C) was instructed to lift the right foot off the ground during standing, and to maintain body weight on the left leg. These unilateral stepping-like movements were performed without stimulation, during stimulation over T11 delivered at 30\u2009Hz, and during combined stimulation over T11 at 30\u2009Hz and L1 at 15\u2009Hz. The right hip and knee joint angles were measured using electrogoniometers.\n\nTraining logs and questionnaires\nDuring training, the participants were requested to document any changes in their body, including fatigue and endurance, sleep, appetite, perspiration, muscle tone, etc., daily. During each visit, they were additionally requested to evaluate their (a) general health condition, (b) mood, (c) spasticity, and (d) bladder and bowel functions since the prior session, by grading each as: below, usual, or above the \u201cnormal\u201d level. Blood pressure, heart rate, and skin condition were monitored by the team throughout each session.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe study comprised three conditions: standing without (\nn\n=\u200915), in the presence of effective tSCS (\nn\n=\u200915), and during sham stimulation (\nn\n=\u200911). Statistical analyses were performed by an independent statistician using a fully within-subject statistical design implemented through general linear model, linear mixed model, or generalized estimating equations as appropriate based on tests of statistical assumptions of primary end-points. The co-primary end-points were assistance-free standing (binary outcome), quantitative measurement of force needed for knee assistance, and amount of time spent standing. The impact of stimulation was assessed in a completely within-subject design with stimulation, no stimulation, and sham stimulation in the same participants (participants served as their own control). The statistical design consisted of three within-subject independent variables (stimulation, session, muscle/joint/activity), and the interactions of those. The within-subject study design enabled high power (\u03b7\n2\n=\u20090.67\u20130.91) for assessing training efficacy in six participants. During training, stimulation intensity required to achieve minimally assisted standing, as well as the time in upright position, were monitored and compared. Finally, the performance was monitored and expressed as a score for each exercise. The level of significance was set at \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05 for all analyses."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAdult female Fischer 344 rats (150\u2013175\u2009g,\nn\n=\u200912) were used for experiments. All rats were cared for and treated according to Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and Society for Neuroscience guidelines throughout all experiments. The animals were housed three per micro-isolator cage. All cages were maintained in a temperature and light-cycle controlled environment.\n\nTelemeter implantation\nThe na\u00efve rats underwent anesthesia through inhalation of 4% isoflurane for initial surgery preparation, and later were given 2% isoflurane for sustainment during surgery. A skin incision was made in the midline of the ventral abdomen and the muscle layer was opened to expose the abdominal cavity. The organs were pushed aside, and the descending abdominal aorta was separated from the vein. Subsequently, the catheter of a radio telemetric pressure transducer (model HD-S10, DSI) was tipped into the abdominal descending aorta for 3\u20134\u2009cm. A drop of tissue glue was used to seal the lesion in the artery. The transducer body was anchored on the abdominal wall. After the organs were reoriented to their original regions, the muscles and skin were then sutured, respectively. This implanted device allows for the measurement of hemodynamics such as the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and HR. Rats were given subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of buprenex (0.035\u2009mg/kg) and cefazolin (10\u2009mg/kg) for post-surgical care.\n\nT4 spinal cord crush\nRats were anesthetized with isoflurane for spinal cord crush injury at the fourth thoracic (T4) level. An isoflurane administration procedure was performed as previously described. An incision of 2\u20133\u2009cm was created in the skin of the back. Connective tissues and muscles were separated with a tissue separator until the T3 spinal process was exposed. After T3 dorsal laminectomy, the T4 spinal cord was completely crushed with fine forceps. During the process, the forceps were placed around the spinal cord and touching the ventral side of the vertebrae, then the forceps were pressed tightly together for 10\u2009sec. Visual verification was performed to ensure the crush injury was complete, the dura remained intact, and no spared tissue remained on the lateral or ventral edges. Once active bleeding was controlled, the muscles were sutured, and the skin was stapled. Rats were then given injections of buprenex and cefazolin for post-surgical care. Animals had their bladder manually expressed 3 times daily for the first 2 weeks after surgery and then 2 times daily until sacrificed.\n\nHemodynamic recordings\nThe Dataquest Acquisition & Analysis System ART (Data Sciences International) was used for telemetric monitoring of hemodynamic parameters. Using this program, pulse arterial pressure was transmitted as a radiofrequency signal to a receiver, and data from receivers were collected and analyzed. MAP and HR values were derived from the pulse arterial pressure with a computerized acquisition system. Basal cardiovascular parameters and events of spontaneous AD were recorded prior to injury (1 week after telemeter implantation) as well as 2 and 4 weeks post-injury. Colorectal distention (CRD)-induced AD was measured at 2 and 4 weeks post-SCI. Prior to any hemodynamic recordings, the bladder was manually expressed to eliminate any possible confounds due to distention.\nResting MAP and HR. For resting cardiovascular parameters, singly housed rats (\nn\n=\u20097) were placed on the top of individual receiver pads associated with their specific telemeters. As each receiver was associated with the Dataquest system, it allowed for specific monitoring of hemodynamic parameters for each rat. Once their telemeters were activated, the rats were then undisturbed for 10\u201315\u2009min to allow for acclimation and stabilization of cardiovascular parameters. The basal MAP and BP parameters were then recorded for a total of 30\u2009min with a sampling rate of 10\u2009sec. The environment was kept in a quiescent state throughout the period. The resting MAP and BP recordings were collected prior to the injury, 2, and 4 weeks post-injury. Afterwards, the values of MAP and BP were averaged per animal for statistical analysis.\nEvents of spontaneous autonomic dysreflexia (AD). To measure events of spontaneous AD over a span of 24\u2009h, Dataquest acquisition, as previously described, was implemented along with a specific algorithm.\n16\nThis algorithm used the waveforms of MAP and HR acquired by the Dataquest software to effectively assess the approximate number of instances a steep increase in BP occurred concurrently with a decrease in HR. The rats (\nn\n=\u20096) were prepared in the same manner as for the basal hemodynamic recordings. The caged rats were placed on their individual receivers and allowed an acclimation period of 10\u201315\u2009min. Cardiovascular parameters were recorded with data sampling rate of 2\u2009sec for 24\u2009h. Each rat was housed with adequate food and water during this task in a quiet environment. Spontaneous AD recordings were collected prior to injury as well as 2 and 4 weeks post-injury. Due to the strain-related variation, the parameter settings for detecting an AD period were modified from previous reports, including MAP increase threshold over baseline 15\u2009mm Hg, MAP increase threshold peak-to-peak 20\u2009mm Hg, HR decrease threshold peak-to-peak 15\u2009bpm, and MAP rise duration 35\u2009sec. The principle was to set the threshold of AD incidence close to 0 in na\u00efve rats.\nColorectal distention (CRD)-induced AD. To induce AD, a clean balloon catheter coated with a petroleum-based lubricant was placed 2\u2009cm into the rectum of each rat (\nn\n=\u20098). A syringe was attached at the end of each catheter to inflate the balloon. The catheter was then anchored to the tail for stabilization using athletic tape. Once the catheter was secured, the rats were then placed in a restraining tube on the receiver and covered with a cloth towel to create a calming environment. Although rats might have stress right after being put into the restrain tube, they were then allowed an acclimation period of 10\u201315\u2009min in a quiet environment until the BP and HR were stable at the normal level. To initiate a distended colorectum, the balloon was inflated with 1.4\u2009mL of air and held in an inflated state for 1\u2009min. MAP and HR were recorded 1\u2009min before, during, and after the distension with data sampling rate of 3\u2009sec. Each rat was subjected to two trials with at least 15\u2009min between recordings. Once completed, the catheter was removed, and the rat was injected s.c. with buprenex. The difference between the basal and CRD-induced MAP and HR for each animal was calculated and then averaged across the two trials. The experiment was performed at both 2 and 4 weeks post-SCI.\n\nPharmacological interventions of cardiovascular dysfunction\nTo minimize the interference of freely moving, conscious rats, we administered the drugs s.c. during cardiovascular recordings. We chose to give three different doses of drugs to a same group of rats but not separated ones in order to more accurately compare the cardiovascular responses with different drug concentrations without individual variations. For each drug, the interval between different doses was chosen based on previous reports but modified according to the specific slow entry delivery. In fact, a pilot experiment confirmed the effective response of this diagram.\nSubcutaneous drug delivery. To examine the possible effects of spinal receptors for serotonin and dopamine on cardiovascular performance in SCI rats, we employed several pharmacological reagents to manipulate receptor activation during basal hemodynamic recordings at 4 to 5 weeks post-injury, including a 5-HT\n1A\nagonist, 8-OH-DPAT, a 5-HT\n2A\nagonist, Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI),\n17\n,\n18\nand a non-selective dopamine receptor agonist, apomorphine (APO).\n19\nTo record basal BP and HR, a total of 100\u2009\u03bcL of drug was administered s.c. in a cumulative manner of low, middle, and high concentrations after an equilibrium period of 10\u201315\u2009min. 8-OH-DPAT (\nn\n=\u20094) and DOI (\nn\n=\u20099) were given in dosages of 5, 20, and 100\u2009\u03bcg/kg, whereas APO (\nn\n=\u20097) was given at 10, 100, and 300\u2009\u03bcg/kg. Approximately 5\u2009min after each injection, the cardiovascular measurements were recorded for 10\u2009min. An additional period of 10\u201315\u2009min was allotted for parameters to return to baseline prior to the injection of the following concentration. Between two different drugs, a time-period of 30\u2009min was allowed to elapse to wash out the effect. At the completion of all trials, the average MAP and HR of each concentration for each animal was calculated for analysis. After the DOI trial, ketanserin (100\u2009\u03bcg/kg), a 5-HT\n2A\nantagonist, was given at a dose of 100\u2009\u03bcL to counteract the effects of DOI.\nIntrathecal administration of DOI. To verify specific central effects of DOI, we delivered the drug i.t. during hemodynamic recordings at 4 to 5 weeks following SCI. Prior to the recording and injection, rats were lightly anesthetized by s.c. injection of urethane (0.8\u2009mg/kg). Afterwards, rats were placed on the receiver to record resting hemodynamics for 5\u2009min. The i.t. injection was achieved using a revised transcutaneous lumbar puncture method.\n20\nBriefly, the rat was placed in the prone position and a needle (30 gauge\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u00bd inch) attached to an insulin syringe was inserted transcutaneously into the L5\u20136 intervertebral space. DOI (20\u03bcL) was slowly injected into the intrathecal space.\n21\nThe MAP and BP measurements were then recorded for 5\u2009min. Similarly, the drug was administered in three different concentrations (1, 4, and 20\u2009\u03bcg/kg). Subsequently, a total of 20\u2009\u03bcL of ketanserin (20\u2009\u03bcg/kg) was also administered to counteract the effect of the 5-HT\n2A\nagonist. The values of MAP and HR for each concentration were then averaged for analysis.\nInjection of DOI for CRD-induced AD. Four weeks after SCI, rats (\nn\n=\u20098) and equipment were prepared, and telemetric parameters were set for CRD, as previously described. Once the equilibration period had elapsed, the rats received a single s.c. injection of 100\u2009\u03bcL of DOI (20\u03bcg/kg). After 5\u2009min, CRD was induced and cardiovascular parameters were recorded. The difference between basal and CRD-induced MAP and HR measurements were then analyzed for each animal. Once the experiment was terminated, the catheter was removed, and each rat received an s.c. injection of buprenex.\n\nFluorogold injection\nOne week before sacrifice, selected animals (\nn\n=\u20094) received an intraperitoneal injection of Fluorogold (FG; 0.4\u2009mL of 0.5% in distilled water; Fluorochrome) to label SPNs in the intermediolateral cell column (IML).\n22\n\nHistological analysis\nRats were overdosed with an intraperitoneal injection of Euthasol and subsequently transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. The spinal cord was then dissected out and placed in the same solution for post-fixation overnight. Afterwards, the segments were transferred to 30% sucrose for at least 24\u2009h. One 3-cm spinal segment containing the lesion site was embedded in Tragacanth medium for cryosectioning. Spinal cords were serially cryosectioned in the longitudinal, horizontal plane at 35\u2009\u03bcm in six series of free-floating sections.\n9\nEach section was submerged in Tris-buffered saline (TBS). To further verify lesion completeness, we performed immunostaining for platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-\u03b2, 5-HT, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Floating spinal sections were blocked in TBS containing 0.5% Triton X and 5% normal donkey serum for 1\u2009h, and then incubated in primary antibody of rabbit anti-PDGFR-\u03b2 (1:1000, Abcam), rabbit anti-5-HT (1:1000, Immunostar), and mouse anti-GFAP (1:1000, Abcam) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Following three washes in TBS, secondary antibodies such as goat anti-rabbit conjugated to Alexa 488 or anti-mouse conjugated to Alexa 594 (1:300, Invitrogen) were added for 3\u2009h at room temperature. The sections were mounted on slides at room temperature to dry. The slides were then reviewed and imaged using a Leica DM5500B fluorescent microscope.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe basal MAP and BP before or following pharmaceutical interventions were assessed using one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a post hoc analysis with a Bonferroni adjustment. Events of spontaneous AD were analyzed using the non-parametric Friedman's test. CRD-induced AD data were analyzed using the paired\nt\ntest. For all statistical analyses,\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered a value of significance and all data are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM)."

Eligible participants were between 18 and 75 years old, demonstrated intact quadriceps or plantar flexor tendon reflexes, and were capable of overground walking without physical assistance with walking speeds <1.0\u2009m/sec, with assistive devices (e.g., walker or cane) and below-knee braces as needed. Exclusion criteria consisted of the following: severe lower-extremity contractures; history of osteoporosis; cardiovascular or metabolic instability; unhealed decubiti; existing infection; active heterotrophic ossification; previous history of other central nervous system injury; or inability to adhere to study requirements. Participants were restricted from participating in other physical therapy during the study. All research procedures were approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Review Board, and participants provided written informed consent. All subjects underwent complete motor evaluation using Lower Extremity Motor Scores (LEMS) to determine their weaker and stronger limb.\n17\n\nIntervention\nIn this pilot investigation, we utilized a randomized crossover design to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of high- versus low-intensity LT on walking outcomes in iSCI. Participants received up to 20 1-h sessions of either a high- or low-intensity LT within 4 to 6 weeks, followed by a 4-week washout,\n19\n,\n43\nafter which participants received the other LT paradigm. The washout period was adopted from previous literature. Goals of the training sessions were to achieve up to 40\u2009min of stepping practice in variable contexts (tasks and environments\n43\n), while achieving the desired intensity ranges. Training intensity was evaluated primarily by HR, with high-intensity LT targeting 70\u201385% of age-predicted maximum HR (HRmax; calculated as 208 \u2212 [0.7*age]), and low-intensity targeting at 50\u201365% HRmax. The former range has been utilized in previous studies evaluating the effects of high-intensity LT,\n21\nwith lower ranges approximating HRs achieved during conventional physical therapy.\n44\n,\n45\nIf targeted HRs could not be achieved, the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale was utilized, with high-intensity LT targeting \u201chard\u201d to \u201cvery hard\u201d and low-intensity targeting (< \u201csomewhat hard\u201d).\n17\n,\n21\nThe primary training goals during both high- and low-intensity LT have been articulated previously\n42\n,\n43\nand included: (1) maximizing the amount of successful stepping practice in a specific direction; (2) achieving specific HR intensities; and (3) increasing difficulty of skilled walking tasks as tolerated. Each training session was composed of four different intervention subcomponents, namely (i) speed-dependent, (ii) skill-dependent, (iii) stair, and (iv) overground training, each practiced for 10\u2009min per training session. Speed-dependent TM training focused on walking forward on a TM while maintaining targeted HRs. Limb-swing assistance, body-weight support, and nylon straps stabilizing the pelvis were provided as needed to ensure successful stepping, characterized by positive step lengths, lack of stance-phase limb collapse, and sagittal/frontal plane stability. Skill-dependent TM training was designed to challenge postural stability, propulsion, and limb swing by altering the biomechanical demands of stepping tasks. Skill training consisted of walking in multiple directions, over inclines and over obstacles, with and without ankle weights, with limited handrail use as tolerated. Selected tasks were intermittently practiced within the 10-min time frame allocated to skill training, with specific tasks selected by the treating therapists based on patients-specific gait deficits. Overground training focused on speed- or skill-dependent locomotor activities similar to those described above, with use of a gait belt or overhead suspension system for safety. Additional stepping activities included walking over uneven or narrow surfaces and stepping around obstacles. Stair climbing was also performed for 10\u2009min over static or rotating stairs (Stairmaster, Vancouver, WA) with attempts to use reciprocal gait patterns and progression to higher speeds and reduced handrail use as able.\nTraining sessions were administered and supervised with licensed physical therapists, with documentation of total stepping duration, types of practiced tasks, HR, and RPE. Patients were provided as many rest breaks as needed, but were encouraged to achieve as much stepping practice as possible (up to 40\u2009min) during the 1-h sessions while achieving the targeted HR range. Approximately one to eight rest breaks were provided as needed, with a reduced number of resting episodes during low-intensity LT. Amount of stepping per session was measured using accelerometers on the ankle of the more impaired limb (StepWatch, Modus, Washington, DC). Patients' HR was continuously monitored using pulse oximeters with forehead sensors (Masimo, Inc., CA).\n\nData collection\nEach patient completed four separate gait assessments, including immediately prior to and following completion of 6 weeks (20 sessions) of high- and low-intensity LT paradigms.\n44\nCollection of gait kinematics and electromyographs (EMGs) were performed during a graded TM test performed on a split-belt TM with embedded force plates surrounded by an eight-camera motion capture system (Motion Analysis Corp., Santa Rosa, CA). Initial TM speed was 0.1\u2009m/sec with increases of 0.1\u2009m/sec every minute until the participant experienced significant gait instability, could not continue walking at that speed, or requested to stop. All participants wore a safety harness to minimize fall risk and were not provided any body-weight support. The highest TM speed that participants could achieve for 1\u2009min was recorded as peak TM speed. During testing, 32 reflective markers were placed bilaterally on pelvis, thighs, shank, and foot (modified Cleveland Clinic 6 degrees of freedom [DOF] model),\n45\nand 12 EMG electrodes (Ag/AgCl Noraxon USA Inc., Scottsdale, AZ), were placed bilaterally on the following lower extremity muscles: medial gastrocnemius (MG), medial hamstring (MH), vastus lateralis (VL), rectus femoris (RF), tibialis anterior (TA), and soleus (SOL). A total of 30\u2009sec of data were collected at each speed. Participants could hold onto bilateral handrails, which were instrumented with 6 DOF load cells (JR3 Inc., Woodland, CA). Kinematic data were sampled at 100\u2009Hz, with analog EMG and load cell data sampled at 1000\u2009Hz.\n\nData analysis\nKinematic data were processed using Cortex software (Motion Analysis Corp., Santa Rosa, CA), and further analyzed using custom pipelines in Visual3D (C-Motion Inc., Germantown, MD) and MATLAB (Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA). Marker and force data for all walking trials were filtered using a low-pass, second-order Butterworth filter (10\u2009Hz). Joint excursion and spatiotemporal measurements were calculated from the transformation between the respective model segments. A full stride was identified as the period when the vertical ground reaction force exceeded 25\u2009N and confirmed with the most anterior position of the calcaneal marker and most posterior position of the metatarsal marker. Kinematic measures were normalized to percentage of the gait cycle and average step cycle profiles were created. Additional kinetic variables could not be accurately analyzed due to participant's inability to place each limb on separate TM belts.\nKinematic variables of interest included bilateral sagittal hip, knee, and ankle joint angles, sagittal joint excursions, and hip-knee joint coordination characterized using a cyclogram of sagittal hip versus knee angles. This cyclogram was quantified in terms of its stride-to-stride consistency (i.e., \u201cconsistency\u201d) and its shape skewness (SKW). Consistency was calculated as the angular component of the coefficient of correspondence (ACC),\n17\n,\n46\nwhereas SKW was quantified as the ratio of hip to knee joint excursion during a gait cycle. The ACC ranges between 0 and 1, with values closer to 1 indicating further stride-to-stride variability to accommodate stepping demands. SKW is an uni-dimensional variable with values between 0.60 and 0.80 representing healthy individuals.\n47\nEMG signals were band-pass filtered with a finite impulse response filter (Lancosh type 79-point window filtering, band-pass range from 30 to 450\u2009Hz), rectified, and smoothed using root mean square calculations over a 50-msec window.\n48\nAll EMG waveforms were visually inspected, with removal of gait cycles with substantial movement artifact or low signal-to-noise ratio, with at least 20 gait cycles included for each participant. EMGs were amplitude-normalized to the corresponding average of their peak values across all available cycles. Specific analyses of EMG activity were performed using NNMF, a computational technique that extracts the underlying principals from interdependent, often redundant, EMG signals.\n33\nNNMF is widely used to factorize the experimental EMG signals into a reduced number of independent activation signals (namely neural commands) and groups of muscles that are activated together in response to a neural command, namely synergy coordination.\n36\n,\n37\nOf note, factorized activation signals, referred as neural command, are fabricated computationally and do not represent the actual neural commands from the central nervous system. However, the terminology is well-accepted across the literature and is adopted for the rest of this study. Mathematically, normalized EMG signals, arranged as a (100\u2009\u00d7\u20096) matrix, was split into two matrices; synergy activation or neural command (H) and synergy coordination (W) such that:\nwhere \u201c\nn\n\u201d refers to the size of factorization. An example of inputs and outputs of NNMF is presented in\nFigure 1\n. Considering the redundancy of the neuromuscular system, size of factorization (n) can vary between one (i.e., assuming that all muscles were activated simultaneously through a single neural command) and six (i.e., assuming that each muscle is activated with a separate neural command). NNMF determines the smallest size of factorization (\nn\n) to minimize the Euclidian distance between experimental EMG and W\u2009\u00d7\u2009H such that the latter explains at least 90% of the variance in experimental EMG:\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSchematic representation of neuromuscular synergy analysis. Six normalized electromyographic (EMG) envelopes were arranged in a matrix (100\u2009\u00d7\u20096) and imported into non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF). This iterative optimization algorithm seeks the smallest number of activation profiles (Synergy activation: H), which suffice to regenerate the original EMG signals with at least 90% accuracy. Synergy activation profiles (H) and synergy coordination (W) are then determined so as to minimize the error between original EMG measurements and reconstructed EMG signals (W\u2009\u00d7\u2009H). In this schematic diagram, the optimization algorithm of NNMF has been solved for four synergies leading to H (4\u2009\u00d7\u2009100) and W (6\u2009\u00d7\u20094). MG, medial gastrocnemius; MH, hamstring; RF, rectus femoris; SOL, soleus; TA, tibialis anterior; VL, vastus lateralis. Color image is available online.\nwhere\nVAF\nrepresents the variance accounted for and\ni\nrefers to every 1% increment in normalized gait cycle. The quality of NNMF is determined by the accuracy of reconstructed EMG (\nVAF\n> 90%). The VAF may be calculated for each individual EMG signal, the entire EMG matrix, or for various portions of gait cycle (stance and swing). Presented in this study,\nn\nwas determined such that\nVAF\n> 90% was achieved for every and all EMG signals. Size of factorization,\nn\n, was then chosen as the variable of interest. According to previous literature, a higher\nn\nvalue in NNMF indicates the existence of independently timed muscle activations to accommodate specific biomechanical demands (weight transfer, limb swing, etc.) within a gait cycle, whereas lower values of\nn\nindicate over-lapping (i.e., non-discrete) synergies and co-activation of multiple muscles.\n41\nAccordingly, the variable\nn\nis often interpreted as neuromuscular complexity and higher complexities (i.e., large\nn\n) repeatedly reported to associate with higher function and better coordination in patients with neurological injuries.\n36\n,\n37\nTo maintain consistent terminology with previous literature\nn\n(i.e., the smallest number of independently timed synergy activations necessary to reconstruct the experimental EMG signals with at least 90% accuracy\n37\n) is referred as \u201cneuromuscular complexity\u201d for the rest of this study. Neuromuscular complexity was calculated separately for weak and strong limbs of each participant.\n\nStatistical analysis\nRepeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) were used to compare the outcomes before enrolling in high- versus low-intensity LT to ensure that a participant's locomotor performance was equivalent prior to each training strategy. With the possibility of differences in participants' walking speed before enrolling, speed was used as a covariate in the repeated-measure ANOVA.\nPaired\nt\ntests evaluated differences in changes in performance, or post-training (POST) minus baseline (BSL) following high- versus low-intensity LT. With this pilot evaluation, Bonferroni corrections were not performed to identify any differences with such training. Two separate paired tests were conducted for each LT paradigm, including changes in measured variables before and following the 6-week period (BSL vs. POST) at peak TM speeds achieved, as well as measures at BSL to similar measures at POST with speeds matched to participants' BSL peak TM speed (BSL vs. POST-MATCH). These latter comparisons allowed for evaluation of potential changes while adjusting for changes due to higher speeds. In addition, paired\nt\ntests also evaluated potential changes within each training paradigm (BSL to POST or POST-MATCH).\nStep-wise multiple-linear regression models were used to investigate any potential relationships between changes in the participants' peak TM speed during high- or low-intensity LT and changes in gait kinematics or neuromuscular synergies observed. In addition, correlation and regression analyses were employed to investigate what kinematic variables were associated with improvements in peak TM speed. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS (v22, IBM, Armonk, NY)."

    "Methods": "Study population\nThis study was approved by our institutional review board. Written consent was obtained from all subjects' parents or legal guardian. In addition, consent was obtained from the subject if >11 years of age and assent was obtained from subjects between ages 7 and 11 years. TBI subjects were enrolled consecutively subsequent to hospital admission if consent was obtained and if they met the following criteria: 1) age between 4 and 18 years at the time of injury; 2) absence of previous brain injury, neurological disorders, drug or alcohol abuse, or MRI contraindications, including dental braces; 3) moderate-to-severe TBI with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores between 3 and 12 or complicated mild (cMild) TBI (GCS 13\u201315) if hemorrhage was detected on an acute brain imaging (CT) exam. Justification for including subjects with cMild TBI is based on the Mayo TBI Severity Classification System, which reclassifies subjects into the moderate-severe injury category in the presence of known brain injury such as intracerebral, subdural or epidural hematomas, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or contusion confirmed by radiological imaging.\n21\nControl subjects who met criteria 1 and 2 were recruited from our pediatric clinics and were scanned without sedation. We took time to familiarize nonsedated children with the scanner environment to ensure that they were comfortable before scanning in order to decrease the failure rate. Images and spectra were checked for motion and repeated when necessary and as allowed by the subject.\n\nData acquisition methods\nTBI subjects were scanned acutely, within 6\u201317 days and at 1 year after injury. Controls were scanned twice, 1 year apart using the same protocol. Whole-brain MRI scans were acquired on a 3T whole-body imager (Trio/Tim; Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) using a 12-channel receive-only head array coil. Imaging included an isotropic 3D sagittal T1-weighted inversion prepared fast spoiled gradient echo sequence (repetition time [TR]/echo time [TE]\u2009=\u20091950/2.26\u2009ms, number of excitations [NEX]\u2009=\u20091, voxel size 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u20091.0\u2009\u00d7\u20091.0\u2009mm\n3\n) and a 3D sagittal T2-weighted fast spin echo sequence with variable flip angles (TR/TE\u2009=\u20093200/415\u2009ms, NEX\u2009=\u20091, voxel size 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u20091.0\u2009\u00d7\u20091.0\u2009mm\n3\n). In addition, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), susceptibility-weighted imaging and diffusion tensor-weighted images were acquired.\n3D proton MRSI was acquired using a volume-selective, water-suppressed, point-resolved spectroscopy sequence (PRESS) with a TR\u2009=\u20091700\u2009msec, TE\u2009=\u2009144\u2009msec, NEX\u2009=\u20091, elliptical k-space weighting, 1024 data points sampled with a dwell time of 1\u2009ms for an acquisition time of 17.1\u2009min. Images from three orthogonal planes acquired during the imaging portion of the study were used for slab placement to match positioning along the anterior commissure-posterior commissure line. Manual shimming was performed to obtain signal line widths or a full width half maximum of <20\u2009Hz and 3D-MRSI using phase encoding in the z-direction to obtain four or five 10-mm-thick slices, a 160\u2009\u00d7\u2009160\u2009\u00d7\u200980\u2009mm field-of-view, and 16\u2009\u00d7\u200916\u2009\u00d7\u20098 phase encoding arrays in the x-y-z direction for an individual voxel volume of 1 cc. The number of slices in the z direction and the volume of interest (VOI) size in the x-y directions within each slice varied and depended on the size of the brain. The slice thickness within the VOI was kept at 10\u2009mm for all subjects. For example, in younger children, an 8\u2009\u00d7\u20098 VOI (64 voxels) in each of four 10-mm-thick slices for a total of 256 voxels (\nFig. 1\n) was typically acquired compared to older children in which an 8\u2009\u00d7\u20099 VOI (72 voxels) in each of five 10-mm-thick slices for a total of 410 voxels was acquired. The slabs for each subject were positioned to cover from the level of the mid-CC through the superior brainstem (BS), including portions of the gray and white matter in the frontal (FG; FW), parietal (PG; PW), temporal (TG; TW), occipital gray matter (OG), cerebellum (CB), basal ganglia (BG), and thalami (TH). Saturation bands were used to suppress chemical shift artifacts arising from lipids outside the VOI. MRSI spectra were post-processed using LCModel (LCModel Version 6.0; Stephen Provencher Inc., Oakville, Ontario, Canada). For each MRSI voxel, individual metabolite concentrations were reported with a Cramer Rao estimation of the lower bounds of measurement error, CRLB percentage (CRLB%), reflecting maximum-likelihood estimates and their uncertainties. Peak concentrations for NAA (2.02\u2009ppm), total Cr (3.02\u2009ppm), total Cho (3.20\u2009ppm), and lactate (Lac), if present (identified as an inverted doublet at 1.33\u2009ppm and 7-Hz splitting), were measured and recorded for each individual MRSI voxel in a spreadsheet for further analysis. Metabolite ratios were then calculated (NAA/Cr, NAA/Cho, Cho/Cr, and Lac/Cr) for each voxel. Brain segmentation and 3D registration techniques were used to calculate the percentage of gray, white, and cerebrospinal fluid in each voxel and make region assignments as described previously.\n22\nFor statistical analyses, the following limiting criteria were applied to ensure that the data chosen were based on quality spectra. As a start, metabolite concentrations with a CRLB% of 20 or less for TBI and 10% or less for control subjects for at least one of the three main metabolites (NAA, Cr, or Cho) were included. This resulted in the inclusion of approximately 90% of spectra for most subjects. Of particular concern was to avoid excluding too much data from TBI subjects with injury resulting in low metabolite levels, thus higher CRLB% and lower signal-to-noise ratio. Therefore, all spectra were visually inspected and excluded only if they showed excessive distortion, artifacts, and/or lipid contamination. For example, spectra near hemorrhagic lesions in TBI subjects tended to have major distortion artifacts or were missing peaks and could not be included. In addition, CB, BS, and OG measurements were prone to spectral distortions attributed to location; therefore, these data are missing in 29% of our control subjects and in up to 50% of our TBI subjects. Next, a fractional tissue volume criterion was applied to only include voxels with underlying tissue volume of 80% or more. Finally, an outlier exclusion criterion was applied to exclude voxels with metabolite values greater than 3 times the standard deviation (SD) of the corresponding metabolite value over all the voxels within a particular region which excluded approximately 1% or less of voxels. For each subject, data from included voxels were then used to calculate mean metabolite ratios for each region.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nPositioning of the 3D-MRSI VOI on (\nA\n) sagittal T1-weighted and (\nB\n) axial T2-weighted FLAIR MRI illustrating a 16\u2009\u00d7\u200916\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u2009cm\n3\nFOV and 8\u2009\u00d7\u20098\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u2009cm\n3\nVOI.

Only the 1-year NP testing results were used in this report. The NP battery included measures of general intelligence (Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence [6\u201318 years] or Wechsler Preschool Primary Scale of Intelligence [4\u20135 years]), attention (Sky Search subtest from the Test of Everyday Attention for Children (TEA-Ch-G; 6\u201316 years]), and memory (Children's Memory Scale [5\u201317 years] or Wechsler Memory Scale [17\u201318 years]). The Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) was used as an NP outcome. Memory scores were converted to z-scores for ease of statistical comparison across measures.\nA Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category Scale score (PCPCS) was assigned by a pediatric neurologist to assess neurological outcome. Serial neurological examinations were performed in TBI patients at six time points (study entry, acute MRI, hospital discharge, and 3, 6, and 12 months) and twice for controls, 1 year apart. Clinical data collected during hospital stay on TBI subjects were also recorded in the database.\n\nStatistical analysis\nSubjects were grouped as controls, cMild/Moderate TBI (GCS\u2009=\u20099\u201315), or Severe TBI (GCS\u2009=\u20093\u20138). This grouping was used in an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to test for significant group differences for metabolite ratios and 1-year NP testing scores using age as a covariate. Bonferroni post-hoc tests were used as appropriate to control for multiple comparisons. Paired\nt\n-tests were used to test for significant longitudinal metabolite ratio changes within each group at an alpha level of 0.001 to adjust for multiple comparisons. Spearman correlations were calculated to determine associations between MRSI metabolite ratios, clinical variables, and neurological and NP outcomes. All statistical analyses were performed in SPSS software (version 22; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL).\nFactor analysis, a method previously used by Mohamed and colleagues,\n23\nwas performed using the principal components of 27 MRSI variables and five clinically observed variables to generate eigenvectors. Ratios from the BS, CB, and OG regions were omitted because of data sparsity. Only eigenvectors with eigenvalues greater than 1 were kept. Varimax rotation with Kaiser normalization was applied to produce five factors that explained 81.5% of the variance. Only strong factor loadings over 0.6 were accepted. Each subject was assigned a score for each of the five rotated factors on the basis of the loadings.\nt\n-tests determined that two of the five scores could differentiate cMild/Moderate TBI versus Severe TBI.\nScores that differed significantly between TBI groups were subsequently used in a binary logistic regression to predict 1-year neurological and NP outcomes. To do this, the 1-year NP outcomes (memory Z-score, attention, and FSIQ) were dichotomized by utilizing a cutoff at 1.50 SDs below the normative mean, which yielded the following groupings: scores above the cutoff (scaled scores >5 and standard scores >78; >\u22121.50 SDs) comprised Group 1 (Not Impaired) and scores below the cutoff (scaled scores <6 and <79; <\u22121.49 SDs) comprised Group 2 (Impaired). The PCPCS was dichotomized into Not Impaired (PCPCS\u2009=\u20091\u20133) or Impaired (PCPS\u2009=\u20094\u20136). Each dichotomized NP outcome (memory, attention, and FSIQ) or dichotomized PCPCS was separately input as the dependent variable in a binary logistic regression to determine how well the independent variables (i.e., scores from the factor analysis or individual MRS parameters such as BG NAA/Cr) could accurately predict whether the patient was impaired or not impaired."

    "Methods": "We performed a retrospective medical record review of patients with acute TBI presenting to a level I trauma center in Washington, DC (MedStar Health Washington Hospital Center) and a level II trauma center in Bethesda, Maryland (Johns Hopkins Suburban Hospital). The National Institutes of Health Office of Human Subjects Research Protection approved this study as an exempt medical record review, and the privacy board of Johns Hopkins Suburban Hospital and the Institutional Review Board for MedStar Health Washington Hospital Center approved this study as an expedited protocol for de-identified medical record review.\n\nPatient population\nDe-identified data were collected from paper-based and electronic medical records of patients presenting to the ED at each hospital on two randomly selected days of each month between 2009 and 2013 (120 days total per site). A patient's record was reviewed and included if 1) the documented chief complaint or cause of injury was consistent with TBI (assault, falls, road traffic accidents, pedestrian struck, sports injury, and any other type of trauma such as hit/struck with object) and 2) a CT scan of the head was performed before discharge. Patients <18 years of age were excluded from the analysis.\n\nData collection and classification\nInformation was extracted from ED medical records and/or trauma intake records. For patients who were admitted to the hospital, additional information was collected from hospital inpatient admission intake records. Abstracted data included: time, day of the week, month, and year of ED admission; age; sex; race; ethnicity; cause of injury; presentation of ACRM TBI criteria; interval of injury to admission, discharge, hospitalization; drug and alcohol screening results; CT imaging results; and documented diagnoses (\nSupplementary Fig. 1\n) (see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). The majority of data (95%) were collected and coded by two investigators (M.R.C. and A.D.M.), who were also available for questions from the investigators who collected the remaining 5%. Unclear data were resolved through consensus of the two initiating investigators.\nAfter data collection, each patient was categorized as TBI positive (TBI\n+\n) or TBI negative (TBI\n\u2212\n) using the ACRM diagnostic criteria. To be categorized as TBI\n+\naccording to the ACRM criteria, the patient record must indicate evidence of brain injury using radiological studies or one of the following clinical signs: 1) period of LOC or decreased LOC; 2) loss of memory for events immediately before or after the injury (PTA); or 3) any AMS at the time of injury.\n11\nFor this retrospective chart review, a patient was coded as positive for AMS if there was any documentation in the chart indicating that the patient was dazed, confused, had AMS, or had a post-injury Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) <15 that was different from the patient's pre-injury baseline. Presence of neurological deficits (weakness, balance, vision changes, sensory loss, etc.) is an additional component of the ACRM criteria; however, these data were not well documented in patient ED medical records and were therefore not used in this study. Absent definitive evidence of meeting ACRM criteria in the medical records, a patient was classified as TBI\n\u2212\n. At the time of the data collection, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) coding data were not available to the study team and were therefore not included in the analysis.\nPatients were classified as having a documented ED diagnosis of TBI if the patient's medical record stated \u201cconcussion,\u201d \u201cpost-concussive symptoms\u201d or \u201cPCS,\u201d \u201cclosed head injury,\u201d \u201ctraumatic brain injury\u201d or \u201cTBI,\u201d or a reported finding on imaging consistent with TBI, such as subdural hemorrhage. All other nonspecific descriptors, such as \u201croad traffic accident,\u201d were classified as having no documented ED diagnosis of TBI.\nFor describing discord, ACRM criteria were considered the \u201ctrue\u201d condition and ED TBI diagnosis was considered the \u201cpredicted\u201d condition. Using this convention, a patient meeting ACRM criteria for TBI (TBI\n+\n), but absent a diagnosis of TBI in the medical records (no documented ED diagnosis of TBI), was considered a false-negative documented diagnosis.\n\nVariables examined\nVariables examined for these groups included age (18\u201340, 41\u201365, and >65 years), sex, race, cause of injury, and lowest documented GCS. Dementia was noted if documented. Variables for the ACRM criteria were individually examined: LOC, AMS, PTA, and CT findings. CT results were classified as CT TBI positive when clinical radiology reports indicated presence of TBI or findings suggestive of TBI, including the presence of intracranial hemorrhage, contusion, or diffuse axonal injury. Time of injury and ED discharge location (home, intensive care unit [ICU], against medical advice [AMA], operating room [OR], floor, and transferred) were examined. Clinical diagnoses of injuries other than TBI were documented and were classified as being TBI and other, or other (e.g., trauma to an extremity, a medical diagnosis).\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics were used to summarize the demographics and clinical characteristics of the study population. Chi-square analyses were performed to evaluate statistical differences between the TBI\n+\nand TBI\n\u2212\npopulations and the patients with and without a documented ED diagnosis of TBI. To determine the characteristics associated with a patient's receiving a documented ED diagnosis of TBI or no documented ED diagnosis of TBI, a binary logistic regression multi-predictor model was performed, adjusting for age, race, sex, trauma level, trauma team involvement, LOC, PTA, AMS, CT results, GCS, and cause of injury.

    "Methods": "Study population\nThis prospective controlled cohort study enrolled a sample of male collegiate student football athletes from Pennsylvania State University participating in a single competitive season in a Division I NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision. Eligibility for the study was determined by the coaches and research team. Participants were excluded if they refused the blood draws or were unable to participate in the football season. This study was approved by the Penn State Institutional Review Board. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to enrollment. Normal controls were obtained from a bank of serum from young healthy individuals acquired from Bioreclamation Inc.\n\nStudy procedures\nAssessments were made by the research team together with the team physicians and trainers. All participants completed a comprehensive pre-season interview, which included demographic information, medical and concussion history, and history of learning disabilities. The Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC)\n20\nwas administered at the pre-season visit to provide an estimate of baseline neurocognitive function. The SAC is most sensitive to change as a result of concussion and includes abbreviated forms of established tests best suited to measure those functions in brain injury patients.\nBlood samples were taken within the week before the athletic season began (prior to any pre-season or in-season contact practices or competitions) and within the week after the last game of the season (post-season). None of the athletes were recovering from, or were diagnosed with, a concussion in the 9 months prior to the pre-season evaluation. A blood sample of 5\u2009mL was placed in a serum separator tube and allowed to clot at room temperature before being centrifuged. The serum was placed in bar-coded aliquot containers and stored at \u221270\u00b0C until transport to a central laboratory where samples were analyzed in batches. Laboratory personnel conducting the miRNA analysis were blinded to the clinical data. All athletic trainers, physicians, and research personnel were blinded to the serum biomarker results.\nWithin the same time frame as the blood sampling, participating athletes also underwent previously validated baseline VR neurocognitive testing consisting of three components: a spatial navigation/memory module, a balance module, and a whole body reaction time module. Scores were summarized as an overall comprehensive score.\n21\n,\n22\nA three-dimensional (3D) TV system (\nHeadRehab.com\n) with a head mounted accelerometer was used. In the balance task, subjects were instructed to hold a Tandem Romberg position for all trials. In the first trial, the virtual room was completely still (for a baseline measure) and in the subsequent six trials, the virtual room moved in various directions. In the reaction time module, subjects were instructed to stand with feet shoulder width apart, hands on their hips. The virtual room moved and they were instructed to move their body in the same direction as that of the virtual room. In the spatial memory module, subjects were shown a randomized virtual pathway with multiple turns to a door and then the return trip. Afterwards, they were instructed to repeat the exact pathway using a joystick. Detailed methods of the modules along with their sensitivity and specificity have been described previously.\n21\n,\n22\n\nOutcome measurements\nThe primary outcome measure was the association between the pre-season SAC score and levels of the selected miRNA biomarkers. The SAC is a reliable and valid measure for evaluating the early neurocognitive effects of sports-related brain injury.\n20\nThe pre-season SAC score was dichotomized into two groups as a baseline to compare athletes with pre-season SAC results of 28\u201330 with those with SAC scores of <28. Previous work has shown that a three point difference between scores represents a clinically significant change in performance.\n20\nThe secondary outcome measures included the performance of the biomarkers in enrolled athletes compared with non-athlete controls, as well as changes in levels pre- and post-season. Additionally, changes in concentrations of the miRNA biomarkers were compared pre- and post-season in those with and without concussion. Diagnosis of concussion was determined clinically by certified athletic trainers and team physicians within 24\u2009h of injury. Study investigators then screened and triaged all injuries to confirm that they met study definition and requirements. Concussion was defined as a type of TBI caused by a bump, blow, or jolt to the head or by a hit to the body that caused the head and brain to move rapidly back and forth, resulting in a change in mental status, behavior, thinking, or neurological functioning. This definition is consistent with that of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention HEADS UP initiative.\n23\nA tertiary outcome was a change in neurocognitive function over the playing season as measured by a VR graphics system that was used to evaluate balance, spatial memory, and reaction time. In additional to individual component scores, an overall \u201ccomprehensive score\u201d was calculated by combining the three test scores mathematically into a 10 point scale (0\u2009=\u2009worst and 10\u2009=\u2009best).\n21\nThese VR assessments were performed both pre- and post-season and were assessed at the same time as pre- and post-season miRNA serum levels.\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics with means and proportions were used to describe the data. For statistical analysis, biomarker levels were treated as continuous data, measured in copies/\u03bcL. Data were assessed for equality of variance and distribution. Paired samples were analyzed using paired sample\nt\ntests or related-samples Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Unpaired samples were assessed using independent sample\nt\ntests with variance consideration and the Mann\u2013Whitney\nU\ntest. Linear regression and correlational analysis examined changes in cognitive function over the season by changes in miRNA levels over the season.\nReceiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were created to evaluate the ability of pre-season miRNA concentrations to predict pre-season SAC scores. Estimates of the area under these curves (AUC) were obtained with 95% confidence intervals (AUC\u2009=\u20090.5 indicates no discrimination and an AUC\u2009=\u20091.0 indicates a perfect diagnostic test). All analyses were performed using the statistical software package SPSS 22.0 (IBM Corporation\n\u00ae\n, Somers, NY).\n\nSample size calculations\nPost-hoc sample size power calculations were conducted based on differences in miRNA levels relative to pre-season SAC scores. For miRNA-505* a sample size of 21 achieved a 79% power to detect a difference of \u22120.70 copies/uL between the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis with known group standard deviations of 0.40 and 0.80 and with a significance level (\u03b1) of 0.05. The power for miR-20a was 92%, the power for miR-362-3p was 100%, the power for miR-30d was 45%, the power for miR-92a was 66%, the power for miR-486 was 26%, the power for miR-195 was 86%, the power for miR-9-3p was 70%, and the power for miR-151-5p was 90%.\n\nMiRNA analysis\nRNA isolation\nSerum samples from athletes (pre- and post-season) along with healthy controls were used to isolate total RNA. RNA was isolated using 100\u2009\u03bcL of serum using a serum/plasma miRNA isolation kit (Qiagen Inc.) as per manufacturer's recommended protocol. The RNA was eluted in 20\u2009\u03bcL of DNAse RNAse free water and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for further use. For a quality check of the RNA, a bioanalyzer assay using a small RNA assay was performed to confirm the quality of the RNA.\nDroplet digital PCR (ddPCR)\nFor absolute quantitation of miRNAs, we used a ddPCR platform (Bio Rad Inc.). For ddPCR reaction, 10\u2009ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed using the specific miRNA TaqMan assays (Thermofisher Scientific Inc.) as per recommended protocol in a 15\u2009\u03bcL total reaction volume; 5\u2009\u03bcL of reverse transcribed product was used to set up the real-time PCR reaction using miRNA TaqMan assays; and 20\u2009\u03bcL of the final real-time PCR reaction was mixed with 70\u2009\u03bcL of droplet oil in a droplet generator (Bio Rad Inc.). Following the droplet formation, the PCR reaction was performed as per recommended thermal cycling conditions. The final PCR product within the droplets was analyzed in a droplet reader (Bio-Rad Inc). The total positive and negative droplets were measured and the concentration of the specific miRNA/\u03bcL of the PCR reaction was determined. All the reactions were performed in duplicates.\nResults\nThere were a total of 53 participants included in the study, 30 non-athlete control subjects and 23 male collegiate student football athletes. Twenty-two athletes completed pre-season blood draws and 20 completed post-season blood draws: the first (pre-season) was within 1 week before the athletic season began (prior to any pre-season or in-season contact practices or competitions) and the second was within 1 week after the last game of the season (post-season). The missing post-season samples from two subjects resulted in a pool of 20 pairs with complete pre- and post-season blood sample data. Mean age of the enrolled athletes was 21 years (with a range from 19 to 24) with a mean height and weight of 75 inches (191 centimeters) and 270 pounds (122 kilograms) respectively. The average number of years of football experience was 11. Nine athletes (41%) had had either one or two previously diagnosed concussions (\nTable 1\n). Control subjects were healthy adults with no chronic diseases and were a mean age of 31 years (with a range from 30 to 35) and 50% were female. There were no statistically significant differences in miRNAs between male and female control subjects except for miRNA-195, which showed higher levels in female controls (\np\n=\u20090.043).\nTable 1.\nCharacteristics of Athletes Included in the Study\nSAC score 28\u201330\nn\n=\u20097 (95%CI)\nSAC Score <28\nn\n=\u200915 (95%CI)\nTotal\nn\n=\u200922 (95%CI)\np\nvalue\nAge\n22 (21\u201323)\n21 (20\u201322)\n21 (21\u201322)\n0.398\nRange\n21\u201323\n19\u201324\n19\u201324\nHeight (inches)\n76 (75\u201377)\n75 (73\u201376)\n75 (74\u201376)\n0.416\nWeight (lbs)\n291 (267\u2013315)\n261 (240\u2013282)\n270 (254\u2013287)\n0.076\nYears playing football\n13 (11\u201316)\n10 (8\u201312)\n11 (9\u201313)\n0.017\nPrevious concussions\n0\n3 (43%)\n10 (67%)\n13 (59%)\n0.290\n1\n3 (43%)\n4 (27%)\n7 (32%)\n2\n1 (14%)\n1 (7%)\n2 (9%)\nHistory of ADHD\n1 (14%)\n2 (13%)\n3 (14%)\n0.705\nPlayer positions\n0.490\nOffense\n2 (26%)\n6 (40%)\n8 (36%)\nDefense\n5 (71%)\n9 (60%)\n14 (64%)\nOpen in a separate window\nSAC, standard assessment of concussion; CI, confidence interval; ADHD, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nInterestingly, all the athletes had elevated levels of circulating miRNAs at the beginning of the season prior to any contact practices. To evaluate the relationship between baseline neurocognitive functioning and elevated baseline miRNA concentrations, pre-season SAC scores were compared with pre-season miRNA levels. The worse the neurocognitive score (lower scores) the higher the levels of the miRNAs. There were statistically significant negative correlations with miR-20a (correlation coefficient \u22120.53;\np\n=\u20090.017), miR-505* (\u22120.54;\np\n=\u20090.011), miR-195 (\u22120.55;\np\n=\u20090.008), and miR-151-5p (\u22120.63;\np\n=\u20090.002). Accordingly, athletes were divided into two groups based on their baseline SAC score and the distribution of clinical characteristics in each group is presented in\nTable 1\n. There were no statistically significant differences in age, height, weight, previous concussions, or player position between the groups except for years playing football.\nIn\nFigure 1\n, baseline (pre-season) levels of the selected miRNA biomarkers were compared in athletes with pre-season SAC results of 28\u201330 versus those with SAC scores of <28.

There were significant differences in miRNA concentrations among all three groups (\np\n<\u20090.001). Specifically, there were significantly elevated levels on miRNAs in athletes pre-season compared with non-athlete control subjects (\np\n<\u20090.001) for all the miRNAs. Similarly, the elevations were significantly higher in players at the end of the season compared with control subjects (\np\n<\u20090.001).

Images were acquired for Rhod-3-loaded cells and collected using an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 40 CFL; Carl Zeiss Inc). Images were captured on a cooled CCD camera. Image acquisition and analysis were performed and visualized by fluorescence, and images were obtained on a PC computer using a Zeiss Axiovert 40 CFL fluorescence microscope with Zeiss Zhen microscope software (Zeiss Inc).\nImmunofluorescence microscopy\nFluorescence immunocytochemistry was performed on cells as described previously.\n20\n,\n21\nAfter washing, cells were fixed with acetone/methanol (1:1) for 5\u2009min at \u221220\u00b0C. Alternatively, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30\u2009min at room temperature. After fixing, the cells were washed twice with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15\u2009min. Non-specific binding sites were blocked in blocking buffer (2% bovine serum albumin [BSA] and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 2\u2009h. Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies selective for NF-\u03baB or NFAT at 1:100 dilutions in blocking buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by washing three times with blocking buffer, 10\u2009min per wash. The cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488- or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technologies), respectively, at 1:100 dilution in blocking buffer at room temperature for 1\u2009h, then washed two times in blocking buffer and once in PBS. Fluorescence was visualized with an epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Carl Zeiss Inc), and images were obtained on a PC computer using Zeiss ZEN microscope software (Zeiss Inc).\nImmunoblotting\nAt the end of the treatment period, cells were washed with cold PBS and scraped into 500\u2009\u03bcL radioimmunopreciptation lysis buffer with antiprotease/phosphatase and incubated for 30\u2009min in ice with agitation as described previously.\n20\n,\n21\nLysates were sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000\u2009\u00d7\ng\nfor 5\u2009min. The supernatant was collected and either used immediately or frozen at \u221280\u00b0C. Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL), and equal amounts of protein were loaded per lane onto 10\u201312% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and were electrophoresed as before. Gels were then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in transfer buffer containing 48\u2009mM Tris, 150\u2009mM glycine, and 10% methanol using a Trans-Blot apparatus (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 100\u2009V for 1\u2009h at 4\u00b0C. The membranes were saturated in 10\u2009mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, and 5% non-fat dry milk for 1\u2009h at room temperature, then probed with specific antibodies for iNOS, Orai1, or STIM1 using the same buffer for 1\u2009h at room temperature with gentle agitation.\nRabbit and mouse primary antibodies were used at working dilutions of 1:500 and 1:1000, respectively. Membranes were washed three times with 10\u2009mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150\u2009mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween-20. Bound antibodies were identified after incubation with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (1:2000 dilutions in 10\u2009mM Tris, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween buffer) for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Membranes were then rewashed thrice, and the position of the individual proteins was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare Bioscience Corp, Piscataway, NJ).\nNF-\u03baB and NFAT nuclear translocation\nCytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously.\n22\nNFAT and NF-\u03baB in nuclear extracts were evaluated by Western blot using specific antibodies for NFAT and NF-\u03baBp65. We also assessed nuclear NFAT and NF-\u03baB translocation using immunofluoresence as described previously.\n20\nDetection of nitrite\nNitrite accumulation in media was determined as described previously.\n21\n,\n23\nBriefly, BV2 cells seeded onto 6\u201312 well plates (2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n5\ncells/well) were cultured overnight, then switched to serum-free medium for 2\u20134\u2009h, and subsequently stimulated with 1\u2009\u03bcg/mL LPS, Poly (I:C, 100\u2009mg/mL), or IFNg (100\u2009ng/mL) with or without CM-EX-137 for 24\u2009h. Nitric oxide (NO) was detected in the culture supernatants using the Griess assay; 50\u2009\u03bcL of culture supernatant from each sample was transferred to a 96-well plate in triplicate, to which an equal volume of Greiss reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was added. Absorbance was read at 540\u2009nm on a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) using Softmax Pro software analysis. After a 10\u2009min incubation, the nitrite concentration was calculated with reference to a standard curve of freshly prepared sodium nitrite (0\u2013100\u2009\u03bcM).\n\nIn vivo\nstudies\nAnimal protocols were approved by the institutional panel on laboratory animal care. All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines for the use of animals in research. Male C57/B6 mice (3\u20134 months of age and weighting 20\u201325\u2009g, Simonsen Laboratories. Gilroy, CA) were housed and underwent a surgical procedure described in strict accordance with institutional guidelines. Forty-six mice were used in our studies as follows: sham-operated group (\nn\n=\u20092), mice underwent TBI with/without CM-EX-137 treatment and survived three (22 or\nn\n=\u200911/group) or 14 days (16 or\nn\n=\u20098/group), and mice injected with LPS with/without CM-EX-137 (6 or\nn\n=\u20093/group). Controls were treated with vehicle.\n\nControlled cortical impact (CCI)\nThe CCI to model TBI\nin vivo\nwas performed according to a previously established protocol.\n24\nMice were anesthetized by face mask using isoflurane (4% induction; 2% maintenance) in a mixture of O\n2\n:N\n2\nO gases in the ratio of 2:1. The depth of anesthesia was assessed every 15\u2009min during operation (absence of a toe pinch response, absence of any spontaneous movements, and the absence of a positive blink reflex to a puff of air directed at the eyes). Rectal temperature was maintained between 36.5\u201337.5\u00b0C with heating pads and a lamp during operation.\nInitially, anesthetized mice were fixed in a stereotaxic frame, and a midline scalp incision was made, followed by a burr hole (5\u2009mm in diameter) in the left parietal plate immediately posterior to bregma. The dura was not disrupted. Subsequently, CCI was performed with an automated impactor (Pinpoint Precision Cortical impactor, Hatteras Instruments, Cary, NC) with a tip size of 3\u2009mm (diameter) at 1.5\u2009m/sec velocity to generate 2\u2009mm penetration with a 100\u2009msec dwell time. The excised cranial bone was replaced immediately, and the incision was then closed with suture. Mice were euthanized three days or 14 days after CCI.\n\nBrain inflammation model\nAs a positive control for neuroinflammation, a separate set of mice was given LPS (5\u2009mg/kg) by intraperitoneal (IP) injection. In this model, transient brain inflammation develops, but the animals do not have any brain cell death.\n25\nThe LPS was prepared in sterile physiological saline before injection, and mice were euthanized one day after LPS injection.\n25\n\nCRAC channel inhibitor treatment\nThe same inhibitor studied in the above\nin vitro\nstudies (CM-EX-137) was administered at a dose of 5\u2009mg/kg/day IP starting 20\u2009min after CCI. This treatment continued once daily for a maximum of seven days. This dosing regimen was chosen based on previous pharmacokinetic data that estimated a brain:plasma ratio of 4\u20135 after IP dosing and a relatively long half-life of approximately 43\u2009h (\nSupplementary Fig. 2\n; see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). Dosing continued for seven days because past work in a related model indicated that this is the period during which microglia are activated with peak numbers by 5\u20137 days.\n26\nThe CM-EX-137 was dissolved in a sterile mixture of Carbowax 400 (NF) and pharmaceutical grade Trappsol in a 3:1 mixture. Carbowax 400/Trappsol was given as vehicle. Based on previous dose response and brain penetration studies performed by CalciMedica and pilot studies in our laboratory, the dose of 5\u2009mg/kg CM-EX-137 was chosen to have sufficient tolerability and brain penetration after IP administration to achieve brain levels within the range that produced neuroprotection and microglial suppression in our\nin vitro\nstudies.\n\nBehavior studies\nNeurological deficits were assessed before operation (baseline) and at one, three, seven, and 14 days after CCI, as described previously.\n27\nAll tests were recorded using a video camera, and scoring was performed by two different investigators blinded to the experimental conditions.\nElevated body swing test\nThe elevated body swing test was performed to evaluate motor deficits. Initially, mice were suspended vertically by the tail with their heads elevated 3 inches above the test bench. A lateral swing was counted each time the animal moved its head >10 degrees away from the vertical axis. Each trial lasted 15 secs, and for each mouse, the number of right-biased swings (contralateral to the injury) was counted and compared with the total number of swings (reported as % bias). A decrease in the % bias indicated improvement.\nAdhesive removal test\nTo estimate deficits in sensorimotor function, 50-mm\n2\n(4-mm diameter) adhesives were attached to the palm of each forepaw, and mice were observed for 2\u2009min and scored for identifying the presence of (contact time, which estimates the ability to sense the adhesive and is thus a measure of sensory function) and removal of (removal time, which estimates motor function) the adhesive. Shorter contact and removal times indicate improved neurological function.\nHemorrhage size\nHemorrhage size was assessed three days after CCI (\nn\n=\u20098/group). This time point was used because hemorrhage size is difficult to assess at later times because of resorption of blood. On sacrifice, mice were transcardially perfused with PBS. Brains were removed quickly, submerged in PBS, and cut into 2\u2009mm-thick sections. Gross brain sections were scanned using a Hewlett-Packard Scanjet. Hemorrhage volumes were digitally quantified using an ImageJ (v. 1.31; publicly available through NIH), as reported previously by our group.\n28\nWe estimated the total area of brain occupied by any blood multiplied by the section thickness (hemorrhage volume).\nLesion size\nLesion size was assessed 14 days after CCI from cresyl violet-stained brain sections (\nn\n=\u20098/group). On sacrifice, mice were perfused with PBS and 4% PFA. Brains were removed, fixed in PFA overnight, and subsequently cryoprotected by sinking them in increasing concentrations of sucrose (5\u201320%). Brains were then frozen and cut into 25\u2009\u03bcm thick sections on a cryostat. The six centermost sections containing the bulk of the lesion were taken for further investigation and were averaged to approximate lesion size relative to the ipsilateral hemisphere according to a previously established protocol.\n24\n,\n27\n\nHistochemistry and fluorescence microscopy\nFor immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, an additional three brains/group were assessed three days post-CCI. Brains were frozen and cut into 15\u2009\u03bcm thick sections on a cryostat. After fixing with 4% PFA for 15\u2009min, sections were reacted with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10\u2009min at room temperature, blocked with 2% normal goat serum in PBS for 1\u2009h at room temperature, then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies in PBS or blocking solution, followed by secondary antibody. Antigen retrieval was used for STIM1 and Orai1 staining, employing 0.1% trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid for 30\u2009min at 37\u00b0C before incubation with the primary antibody.\nImmunohistochemistry\nMicroglia were identified by lectin histochemistry. Sections were blocked with 2% normal goat serum in PBS, followed by incubation in 0.3% H\n2\nO\n2\nfor 5\u2009min at room temperature. Sections were incubated in peroxidase-labeled IB4, then colorized with diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and counterstained with hematoxylin. The images were captured on a PC computer using a microscopy camera (INFINITY2; Lumenera, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada).\nImmunofluorescence\nThe following primary antibodies and concentrations were used: anti-CD11b (1:200), anti-CD68 antibody (1:50 dilution), and anti-iNOS antibody (1:200 dilution). After incubating in primary antibodies overnight, sections were incubated with secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 594 for CD68 and Alexa Fluor 488 for iNOS) at 1:200 dilution in blocking solution for 1\u2009h at room temperature. The STIM1 and ORAI1 activation were also assessed by double staining. The following primary antibodies/concentrations\u2014anti-STIM1 antibody at 1:50 dilution and anti-Orai1 antibody at 1:50 dilution\u2014plus anti-CD11b antibody at 1:200 dilution were incubated with secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 568/488 for STIM1/CD11b and Alexa Fluor 488/568 for Orai1/CD11b) at 1:200 dilution in blocking solution for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Sections were rinsed with PBS three times, 5\u2009min each; DAPI was used to stain cell nuclei. The images were visualized with an epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axiovert; Carl Zeiss) and captured on a PC computer using Axiomatic software (ZEN lite; Zeiss). Images were visualized and captured using laser confocal microscopy (LSM510, Zeiss).\n\nCell counting\nPositive cells and DAPI-stained nuclei were counted using ImageJ software. Counts were performed using methods published previously by our group.\n22\nActivated microglia were counted from immunopositive cells (IB4, CD68, iNOS, and CD11b), which also met criteria for activated microglia based on morphological changes.\n29\nThese criteria included increased immunomarker staining plus rounded amoeboid morphology or shortening of processes and enlargement of the cell soma. For CCI, positive cells were counted in five randomly chosen, non-overlapping high-power fields from the perimeter of brain injury, as delineated by the cresyl violet-stained sections. For the LPS-treated animals, inflammatory brain regions were also selected and counted from five non-overlapping fields from both lateral cortices. The percentage of positive cells was normalized to the total number of cells within a given field. For double labeling, numbers of double-labeled cells were normalized to the phenotype marker, CD11b, to identify microglia.\n\nStatistics and rigor\nAnalysis of variance and\nt\ntest were used for the comparison of three or two experimental groups, respectively. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 23.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). The significance level was set at\np\n<\u20090.05. Animals were randomized to the experimental groups, and all assessments were performed by investigators who were blinded to treatment assignments."

    "Methods": "Retinoic acid-induced animal model of MMC\nAll experiments were conducted under the guidelines of Temple University's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Time-dated Sprague-Dawley pregnant rats obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) were placed on a standard dark:light schedule. An MMC defect was induced in the fetuses of time-dated pregnant rats by gavage of a single dose of 50\u2009mg/kg of all trans-retinoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical, Saint Louis, MO) dissolved in olive oil on embryonic day 10 (E10), as described previously.\n42\n,\n45\nNormal control mothers were gavage fed with olive oil. AF samples from MMC fetuses (\nn\n=\u2009168) and normal fetuses (\nn\n=\u2009122) were collected at E18, E20, and E21 (term\u2009=\u2009E22). Dams were euthanized using chamber inhaled CO\n2\n, and the total number of fetuses were determined following the midline laparotomy and exposure of the uterus. AF samples were collected using aseptic techniques into 1.5\u2009mL Eppendorf tubes. After collection of AF, the uterus and gestational membranes were removed and each fetus was examined for the presence of lumbosacral MMC defect. The incidence of isolated MMC defects was observed in 79.2% (168/212) of fetuses. After harvesting, fetuses were collected and euthanized by decapitation according to standard procedures.\n\nMeasurement of HA concentration in AF\nAmniotic fluid HA concentrations were analyzed using a competitive Hyaluronan Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (HA ELISA; K-1200; Echelon Biosciences Inc, Salt Lake City, UT) according to the manufacturer instructions.\n46\nAll AF samples collected from fetuses at different embryonic ages (E18, E20, and E21) were diluted 100\u2009\u00d7\u2009in provided diluent and analyzed in duplicate. Absorbance of each well was measured at 405\u2009nm after 30\u2009min of incubation with working substrate solution (K-1208). When high variation in duplicate reading was observed, samples were re-assayed in triplicate. A total of 18 randomly selected AF samples isolated from E18, 18 AF samples from E20, and 92 AF samples from E21 MMC fetuses as well as 18 AF samples isolated from E18, 18 AF samples from E20, and 66 AF samples from E21, normal controls were analyzed for the amniotic fluid HA levels. The HA concentration was normalized to the volume of amniotic fluid.\n\nAgarose gel electrophoresis in TAE buffer\nElectrophoresis of HA on agarose gels in Tris\u2013acetate\u2013EDTA (TAE) buffer (40\u2009mM Tris, 5\u2009mM acetate [CH\n3\nCOONa], and 0.9\u2009mM EDTA, pH 7.9) was performed as previously described.\n47\n,\n48\nIn brief, agarose gels were prepared by dissolving 1.5\u2009g of agarose in 300\u2009mL of TAE buffer for final concentrations of 0.5%. Dissolved and equilibrated agarose solution was poured into a gel casting tray to form a 6.5-mm thick gel. For electrophoresis, the gel was transferred to a Kodak BioMaxMP1015 electrophoresis unit filled with TAE buffer. Samples of amniotic fluid were prepared by adding to 15\u2009\u03bcL of amniotic fluid, 35\u2009\u03bcL of dd water and 10\u2009\u03bcL of loading buffer (0.02% bromophenol blue and 2\u2009M sucrose in 1XTAE buffer) to load 1.5-2.5\u2009\u03bcg of HA. To determine the specificity of HA, 15\u2009\u03bcL of each amniotic fluid sample was digested with\nStreptomyces hyaluronidase\n(Sigma-Aldrich Chemical, St. Louis, MO) as described in section \u201cEnzymatic assay of hyaluronidase.\u201d HA standards (MEGA Ladder and High Ladder; HYALOSE, Oklahoma City, OK) were prepared in water at concentrations of 0.04\u20130.1\u2009\u03bcg/\u03bcL. HA standards, analyzed AF samples, high molecular weight (HMW) HA (1,630\u2009kDa, Sigma-Aldrich) and AF samples after treatment with hyaluronidase were loaded onto gels and subjected to electrophoresis. Electrophoresis was carried out at room temperature at a constant voltage of 30\u2009V for 30\u2009min and then 50\u2009V for 6h. The gels were stained with 0.005% StainsAll (Sigma Aldrich) in 50% ethanol overnight under light-protective cover on a shaker at room temperature. The gels were de-stained in water for 4\u2009h and then scanned using Bio-RAD Gel Doc\n\u2122\nEZ Imager (Bio-RAD laboratories, USA). Densitometric analysis was performed using ImageJ software.\n\nEnzymatic assay of hyaluronidase\nIn order to examine the effect of MMC-AF on degradation of HA, 20\u2009\u03bcg of commercially available HMW HA (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to 100\u2009\u03bcL MMC-AF and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. Positive control samples were prepared by adding 20\u2009\u03bcg of HMW HA (Sigma-Aldrich) to 100\u2009\u03bcL MMC-AF and 80\u2009U/mL of\nStreptomyces hyaluronidase\n(Sigma-Aldrich Chemical, Saint Louis, MO), which specifically degrades HA,\n49\nand incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. After overnight incubation, hyaluronidase was denatured by boiling at 90\u00b0C for 10\u2009min and concentration of HA in analyzed samples was measured using HA ELISA assay as described in section \u201cMeasurement of HA concentration in AF.\u201d A total of six randomly selected MMC-AF samples were analyzed in duplicates. An aliquot of each reaction solution was also electrophoresed on agarose gel and stained with Stains-all as described in section \u201cAgarose gel electrophoresis in TAE buffer.\u201d\n\nDetermination of viscosity\nThe viscosity of amniotic fluid was determined using a Black Pearl Viscometer (ATS Rheo System). The viscometer is a cone and plate type with a diameter of 30\u2009mm and an angle of 2\u00b0. The viscometer was set to a shear rate of 2000 (1/sec) to ensure sufficient torque for measurement. The viscometer allows measurement of a small volume of liquids. The device was calibrated to the known viscosity of pure water 0.001 Pa\u00b7sec. 500\u2009\u03bcL of each AF sample was placed on thin sensor plate cone brought to gap height, and the viscosity was then immediately measured at 25\u00b0C. In order to examine the effect of HA on the viscosity of MMC-AF, 150\u2009\u03bcg of commercially available HMW HA (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to 500\u2009\u03bcL MMC-AF collected from E21 fetuses and the viscosity was measured as described above.\n\nProtein concentration\nProtein concentration in amniotic fluid was measured using colorimetric detection and quantitation Pierce\n\u2122\nBCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, USA) according the manufacturer protocol. Absorbance was measured at 570\u2009nm using BioTek ELx808 Absorbance Reader and analyzed using Gen 5.2 Plate Reader Software.\n\nStatistical analysis\nComparison between the groups after measuring concentration of HA in AF was performed using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's multiple comparison test. For statistical analysis of viscosity and protein concentration Student's\nt\n-test was used. All data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD). Differences in\np\nvalues of <0.05 were considered to be significant."

    "Methods": "All animal protocols were approved in advance by Georgetown University Animal Care and Use Committee. All animals were housed in the Georgetown University Division of Comparative Medicine with unlimited access to food and water. At no point were food deprivation or food rewards used as motivators.\n\nRats and spinal cord injury protocol\nOne hundred eight adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were used (approximately 5 weeks old, 160- to 220-g range, 186\u2009\u00b1\u200912\u2009g mean; Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY). The rats are part of our ongoing robotic gait training studies, and we have previously reported a non-linear regression gait analysis of 46 of these animals\n4\nand an irregular conical gait analysis of 74 of these animals.\n7\nPresented here, for the first time, is a novel multi-dimensional gait analysis of 108 animals.\nRats received a right overhemisection injury at the C4\u2013C5 level, which bilaterally ablates the dorsal corticospinal pathway and unilaterally ablates the contralateral rubrospinal pathway. This results in profound asymmetric impairments, with the right side more impaired than the left and the forelimbs more impaired than the hindlimbs. Thus, this model is ideally suited to investigate spontaneous asymmetric gait recovery and development of compensatory techniques. The surgery has been previously described,\n8\n,\n9\nbut, briefly, rats were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane, a partial C4/C5 laminectomy was done, and iridectomy scissors were used to create a lesions at C4\u2013C5. At the end of the study, all lesion sites were reconstructed from serial cresyl violet sections or magnetic resonance imaging images. We only included the 77 animals with appropriate injuries in post-injury analysis.\nWhereas the other 58 animals entered training protocols not discussed here, a subset of 19 untrained animals were then tested weekly for an additional 6 weeks starting on post-injury day 11 and ending on post-injury day 46 (hereafter referred to as weeks 2 through 7). Animals were randomly assigned to treatment groups by the MATLAB randperm function (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA) or the drawing of numbers out of a hat. Frequently, not all 19 untrained animals took appropriate steps for each week; therefore, the total\nN\nfor each week varies from 15 to 19.\n\nMice and traumatic brain injury protocol\nFor controlled cortical impact (CCI) surgery, the contusion occurred over the sensory cortex, as previously described.\n10\n,\n11\nWe compared sham mice (\nn\n=\u200912) to CCI mice (\nn\n=\u200913). Wild-type C57Bl/6 male mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and were 3\u20134 months of age at the time of injury. CCI mice were administered surgical anesthesia using 4% isoflurane with maintenance in 2%, at flow rate of 1.0\u20131.5\u2009L/min in freely breathing oxygen. Bupivicaine was administered intradermally to the surgery site, a 10-mm midline incision was made over the skull, the skin and fascia reflected, and a craniotomy performed (4\u2009mm) on the central aspect of the left parietal bone. The impounder tip of a Leica StereoOne Impactor (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) was sterilized, positioned to the surface of the exposed dura, and set to impact the cortical surface at 5.25-m/s velocity and 2-mm tissue deformation. The skull was replaced after injury. Sham mice received isoflurane anesthesia, skin incision, and reflection, but no impact or craniotomy. After injury, the incision was closed with wound clips, anesthesia discontinued, 1\u2009mL of saline administered by intraperitoneal injection, and the mouse placed in a heated cage to maintain normothermia for a 45-min recovery period.\n\nCatWalk protocol\nFor 3 non-consecutive days, animals were pre-trained on the CatWalk XT10.1 (Noldus Information Technology) gait analysis system before pre-operative overground locomotion was recorded. The Catwalk device consists of a long glass walkway with a green light internally reflecting. When the rodent paw contacts the glass, light is reflected down and recorded by the digital camera. With the software, users assign the recorded prints to identify the time and location of steps. From this point, our custom software (MATLAB; The MathWorks) analyzed the rodent gait. No time, velocity, or directional constraints were placed on the trials as animals were allowed to cross the walkway at their own self-selected walking speed. The trial was considered complete once several walking steps were recorded from each limb. This could be accomplished from as few as one complete pass or from several partial passes. Trotting or galloping steps were omitted. As to not bias the group data toward animals that took more steps, a cap of 15 steps per animal was applied. These 15 steps were not randomly chosen, but were selected from the steps that were most similar to one another. One week after injury, with no retraining the overground locomotion of the animals was reassessed with the CatWalk and weekly thereafter."

    "Methods": "Animals and SCI model\nFemale wild-type C57Bl/6 mice between eight and nine weeks of age were obtained from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME), housed in groups of 3\u20135, and allowed to habituate for seven days before use. To determine the mitochondrially biogenic effect of formoterol in the spinal cord under physiological conditions, na\u00efve mice were treated with intraperitoneally with 0.1\u2009mg/kg formoterol once daily for 48\u2009h, followed by euthanasia via anesthesia overdose and isolation of the T9-13 region of the spinal cord.\nFor SCI studies, mice were randomized into sham and SCI groups. Animals were anesthetized with ketamine 10\u2009mg/kg and xylazine 6\u2009mg/kg via intraperitoneal injection and continuously monitored for spontaneous breathing. Mice underwent a complete single-level laminectomy at the 10th\u201312th thoracic vertebrae (T10\u201312). The vertebral column was clamped and stabilized at the upper thoracic and lumbar levels, and a controlled contusion with a force of 80 kilodynes was administered using the Infinite Horizon IH-0400 impactor (Lexington, KY) with the dura intact. Sham mice received laminectomy only. Manual bladder expression was performed twice daily until functional recovery. Injured mice were divided further into formoterol- or vehicle-treated groups. Groups were euthanized three days, seven days, or 15 days post-SCI via anesthesia overdose, and spinal cords were isolated for analysis.\nAll studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Medical University of South Carolina and the University of Arizona in accordance with the guidelines set forth by the National Institutes of Health\nGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\n. The schematic representation of the experimental design is seen in\nFigure 1\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSchematic representation of experimental design.\n\nDrug treatment\nFormoterol fumarate dehydrate was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and dissolved in saline/0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide to 0.01\u2009mg/mL. Given that we have observed mitochondrially biogenic effects in mice with doses as low as 0.1\u2009mg/kg,\n27\nmice were treated intraperitoneally daily with either formoterol 0.1\u2009mg/kg or vehicle control beginning 1\u2009h or 8\u2009h after injury.\n\nLocomotor capability assessment\nLocomotor capability was assessed using the 10-point (0\u20139) Basso Mouse Scale (BMS)\n34\nby an observer blinded to the experimental groups. Each mouse was observed for 3\u2009min, with bladder expression taking place before assessment. Animals were observed 24\u2009h after the surgical procedure and every other day thereafter until euthanasia. Sham animals maintained a BMS score of 9 throughout the experiment.\n\nRibonucleic acid (RNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) expression\nThe injury site and spinal cord regions approximately 5\u2009mm rostral and caudal to the injury site (peri-injury sites) were collected and total RNA extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) based on the manufacturer's protocol. The complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) performed using 500\u2009ng of cDNA template and SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Fold changes were calculated using the \u0394\u0394Ct method.

ND1, a mitochondrial gene, was measured and normalized to the nuclear encoded gene \u03b2-actin.\n\nImmunoblot\nProtein was extracted from the injury and peri-injury sites of the spinal cord using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50\u2009mM Tris-HCl, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) with protease inhibitor cocktail (1:100), 1\u2009mM sodium fluoride, and 1\u2009mM sodium orthovanadate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Samples were agitated for 2\u2009h at 4\u00b0C and then centrifuged at 14,000\u2009\u00d7\ng\nfor 15\u2009min and the supernatant collected. Protein was quantified using a bicinchoninic acid assay, and 10\u201312\u2009\u03bcg of protein was separated via electrophoresis using 4\u201315% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBST and incubated overnight with primary antibodies with constant agitation at 4\u00b0C. Membranes were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized using chemiluminescence (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) on a GE ImageQuant LAS4000 (GE Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA). Optical density was determined using ImageJ software. Primary antibodies used were as follows: Nrf2 (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), PGC-1\u03b1 (1:1000), TFAM (1:1000), NDUFS1 (1:1000), ATP Syn \u03b2 (1:1000), \u03b1-tubulin (1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK).\n\nHistopathological analysis\nSpinal cord tissues were processed as described previously.\n35\nBriefly, mice were transcardially perfused with 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffered saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). A 1\u2009cm segment of the spinal cord centered on the injury epicenter was removed and post-fixed in PFA for 2\u2009h, then washed in 0.2\u2009M phosphate buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C. Tissues were then cryoprotected in 20% sucrose with 0.1% sodium azide at 4\u00b0C until the spinal cords sank (>3 days). Spinal cords were trimmed to 6\u2009mm segments centered on the injury sight and frozen in optimal cutting temperature compound at \u221280\u00b0C. The entire 6\u2009mm was cryosectioned into 10\u2009\u03bcm coronal sections and every section collected.\nEriochrome cyanine (EC) staining for myelin was used to distinguish damaged and spared tissue.\n35\nSlides were warmed for 60\u2009min, then hydrated in dH\n2\nO, submerged in acetone for 2\u2009min, and rehydrated in dH\n2\nO. Slides were exposed to serial dilutions of decreasing concentrations of ethanol and incubated in EC solution for 30\u2009min. Selective myelin staining was obtained by differentiation in 0.3% ammonium hydroxide for 30\u2009sec. Slides were then exposed to serial dilutions of increasing ethanol concentrations. Analyses were performed in a blinded fashion, with respect to treatment group, using an Olympus BX41 microscope (Tokyo, Japan) and ImageJ software. Lesion and spared tissue areas were quantified across 2\u2009mm of spinal cord centered on the epicenter at 100\u2009\u03bcm intervals using the Cavalieri method,\n35\ntotaling 21 sections per animal.\n\nStatistical analysis\nTissue isolated from a single animal or a single animal's behavior represented n\u2009=\u20091. Behavioral assays were on a total of n\u2009=\u20098 sham mice and n\u2009=\u200912 injured mice per group, and data were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures followed by the Tukey\npost hoc\ntest. All data sets underwent and passed the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Differences in mtDNA and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression between two groups were analyzed using the two-tailed Student\nt\ntest, while that of three or more groups was analyzed using a one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey\npost hoc\ntest. Differences in individual protein expression between all three groups (Sham, SCI + Vehicle, SCI + Formoterol) were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey\npost hoc\ntest. Two-way ANOVA was used to analyze tissue histopathology (lesion, gray and white matter area) across the spinal cord. Total lesion, gray matter and white matter volumes were analyzed using the two-tailed Student\nt\ntest.\nFor expression analyses, different superscripts are indicative of statistically significant differences, while bars with the same superscript are not significantly different (\nFig. 2\u20135\n,\n\u200b\n,6E).\n6E\n).

    "Methods": "All animal experiments and protocols were carried out in accordance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Sugitani Campus of the University of Toyama. The approval numbers for the animal experiments are A2013INM-1 and A2016INM-3. All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used.\n\nPrimary cortical neuron culture\nEmbryos of ddY mice (Japan SLC, Japan) were obtained at the 14th day of gestation. The dura was removed, and cerebral cortices were isolated, minced, and dispersed. Cells were cultured on 8-well chamber slides (Corning, NY), coated with poly-D-Lysine (PDL; 5\u2009\u03bcg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), at a density of 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n4\ncells/well, in Neurobasal medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) containing 12% horse serum, L-glutamine, and 0.6% D-glucose at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 10% CO\n2\n. Five hours after seeding, the medium was replaced with fresh Neurobasal medium containing 2% B-27 supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.6% D-glucose, and 2\u2009mmol/L L-glutamine. For CSPG coating, culture dishes were coated with 5\u2009\u03bcg/mL PDL (Sigma-Aldrich) and 2\u2009\u03bcg/mL aggrecan (Sigma-Aldrich) in Hank's buffered salt solution (HBSS; Thermo Fisher Scientific) overnight at 37\u00b0C.\n\nPrimary skeletal muscle cell culture\nPost-natal Day 3 ddY mice (Japan SLC, Hamamatsu, Japan) were decapitated under anesthesia with isoflurane (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan). Hindlimbs were cut and the skin was peeled off. Isolated skeletal muscle from the whole hindlimb was minced, then dissociated in HBSS containing 1\u2009mg/mL collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.02\u2009mg/mL dispase I (Sigma-Aldrich), and 2.5\u2009mM CaCl\n2\nfor 1\u2009h. The obtained myocytes were grown in Myocyte Medium (Promo Cell, Heidelberg, Germany) in several culture plates without coating; cells were plated at a cell density of 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n4\ncells/well in white-walled 96-well plates (Greiner Japan, Tokyo, Japan), 2.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n4\ncells/well in eight-well chamber slides, or 6.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n5\ncells/dish in 100-mm dishes (Corning). Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 10% CO\n2\n.\n\nPreparation of conditioned media (CM)\nMouse skeletal muscle cells were treated with acteoside (Extrasynthese, Lyon, France) at doses of 1, 100, and 1000\u2009nM or with vehicle solution at culture Day 1. Three days after treatment, cells were washed two times with and kept in fresh serum-free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific). CM was collected and filtered using a 0.45-\u03bcm pore membrane filter (Advantec, Tokyo, Japan) to remove cell debris. For axonal growth assay, the CM was mixed with Neurobasal medium containing B-27 supplement in a one-to-one ratio. For silver staining and Western blotting, the CM was concentrated using a centrifugal filter device (Amicon Ultra-4, 3K; Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), and the protein concentration in the CM was quantified using the Pierce 660\u2009nm Protein Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n\nImmunocytochemistry for cultured cortical neurons\nAfter treatment with the CM, recombinant pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2; 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10\u2009ng/mL), or vehicle solution, neurons were fixed with paraformaldehyde for 90\u2009min. Axons were immunostained with the mouse monoclonal anti-phosphorylated neurofilament-H (pNF-H) antibody (1:250; Covance Inc., Princeton, NJ). Neuronal cell bodies were immunostained with the rabbit polyclonal anti\u2013microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) antibody (1:2000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK). As secondary antibodies, we used Alexa Fluor-488-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Alexa Fluor-568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:300; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Nuclear staining with 1\u2009\u03bcg/mL 4\u20326-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was performed at room temperature. Eight to 23 images per well were captured using a fluorescent microscope (Axio Cell Observer Z1; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), at a field of 432\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u2009323\u2009\u03bcm or 863\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u2009645\u2009\u03bcm. The length of pNF-H\u2013positive axons was measured using MetaMorph software (Molecular devices, San Jose, CA), which automatically traces and measures neurite lengths. The total axonal length in a given image was divided by the number of MAP2- and DAPI-double positive cells to calculate the axonal length per neuron.\n\nImmunocytochemistry for skeletal muscle cells\nSkeletal muscle cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde for 90\u2009min after treatment with acteoside or vehicle solution. Myotubes were immunostained with the rabbit polyclonal anti-desmin antibody (1:250; Covance Inc.), followed by the Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:300). Images, 10\u201313 per well, were captured using a fluorescent microscope (Axio Cell Observer Z1, Carl Zeiss), at a field of 432\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u2009323\u2009\u03bcm or 863\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u2009645\u2009\u03bcm. Desmin-positive cells were counted using MetaMorph software.\n\nSilver staining\nConcentrated CM samples (1 or 3\u2009\u03bcg/lane) were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE (10% separating gel), and separated proteins were stained using SilverQuest Silver Staining kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The target protein bands were cut out, in-gel digested with trypsin (Promega, Fitchburg, WI), and identified using nano liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS; Japan Bio Services, Saitama, Japan) and MASCOT database search.\n\nWestern blotting\nConcentrated CM samples (3\u2009\u03bcg/lane) were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE (10% separating gel) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1\u2009h at room temperature, the membrane was incubated with the rabbit monoclonal antibody against PKM2 (1:1000; Cell signaling, Danvers, MA) in 0.1% Tween 20-containing TBS (T-TBS) overnight at 4\u00b0C. After four times washing with T-TBS, the membrane was incubated with horse-radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) for 2\u2009h at room temperature. After four times washing with T-TBS, the membrane was soaked in a detection solution (ECL prime reagent; GE healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) for 2\u2009min, and bands were detected using a luminescence image analyzer (LAS 4000, Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). CS analyzer (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan) was used to quantify the luminescence intensity of each band.\n\nSCI experiment\nTen-week-old female ddY mice (SLC) were used for the SCI experiment. Mice were housed in a plastic cage (23\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u200916\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u200912\u2009cm) under a 12-h light/dark cycle (light period: 7:00\u201319:00), at constant temperature and humidity (22\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00b0C, 55\u2009\u00b1\u200910%). Water and solid food were allowed\nad libitum.\nMice were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of a mix of three types of anesthetics: 0.675\u2009mg/kg of medetomidine (ZENOAQ, Koriyama, Japan), 3.6\u2009mg/kg of midazolam (Sandoz, Tokyo, Japan), and 4.5\u2009mg/kg of butorphanol (Meiji Seika Pharma, Tokyo, Japan). After laminectomy at the level of T11, contusion injury was performed onto the exposed L1 segment of the spinal cord by drop of a 13.5-g rod (tip diameter of 1\u2009mm) from a 3-cm height (approximately 13.5\u2009kdyn). Mice were allowed to recover on a hot pad to maintain body temperature, and 0.75\u2009mg/kg atipamezole (ZENOAQ) was injected to antagonize medetomidine.\nActeoside is known to reach the skeletal muscle after oral administration,\n25\nwhere it is highly distributed; thus, we considered it should also reach the muscle by an intramuscular injection. By using this administration route, we expected that acteoside would reach the atrophied muscle directly and in high concentration. Thirty days after SCI, acteoside or vehicle solution was injected intramuscularly into the right and left biceps femoris muscles (three times/week). Behavioral observations were performed during the pre-injection (30 days) and injection period (62 days), once every 7 days. Acteoside was injected to the vastus lateralis of the right and left hindlimbs (0.1\u2009mg/limb), three times a week.\n\nBehavioral evaluation\nFor behavioral scoring after surgery, mice were placed in an open cage (50.0\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u200942.5\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u200915.0\u2009cm) and observed while moving free for 3\u2009min. The motor function of hindlimbs was evaluated using the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS)\n26\nand Toyama Mouse Score (TMS).\n27\nMovements of the left and right hindlimbs were evaluated independently.\n\nWet weight of muscles and immunohistochemistry for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)\u2013positive axonal tracts\nAfter the behavioral observations, mice were anaesthetized by administration of a mix of three anesthetics (0.75\u2009mg/kg of medetomidine [ZENOAQ], 4.0\u2009mg/kg of midazolam [Sandoz], and 5.0\u2009mg/kg of butorphanol [Meiji Seika Pharma], i.p.) and perfused with ice-cold saline and 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline to fix the tissues.\nThe bilateral biceps femoris and tibial anterior were excised. The tendons were carefully cut. The muscle wet mass was weighed using an electronic analytical balance with a precision of 0.1\u2009mg.\nThe spinal cords were dissected at the T10-L1 and L2-L6 level, soaked in 30% sucrose, embedded with cryomold 3 (Sakura Finetech Japan, Tokyo, Japan), and stored at \u221230\u00b0C until use. Spinal cords were then cut into 14-\u03bcm sagittal sections using a cryostat (CM 3050S; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The sections were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and immunostained at 4\u00b0C for 24\u2009h with the rabbit polyclonal anti-serotonin (5-HT; 1:500; ImmunoStar, Hudson, WI) and mouse monoclonal anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:400; Life Technologies) and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:400; Life Technologies) were used as secondary antibodies. Nuclear staining with 1\u2009\u03bcg/mL DAPI was performed at room temperature. Images were obtained using a fluorescence microscope (BZ-ZX700/BZ-X710, Keyence, Osaka, Japan) and quantified using Image J (National Institutes of Health). The area surrounded by the GFAP-positive area was defined as the injury area, where the glial scar was formed. The three most center slides of serial sections were selected for quantification. Areas of 5-HT\u2013positive axons in the gray matter, located at rostral and caudal positions 2\u2009mm away from the injury site were quantified.\n\nImmunohistochemistry for synaptophysin on Fluoro-Gold\u2013positive motor neurons\nSeven days before the end of behavioral observations, 5% Fluoro-Gold solution (Sigma-Aldrich) was injected into the tibial anterior and gastrocnemius muscles of right and left hindlimbs (2.5\u2009\u03bcL/site). Spinal cord sections at the L2-L6 level were prepared as described above for the 5-HT immunohistochemistry. Sections were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, immunostained with the mouse monoclonal anti-synaptophysin (1:500; Sigma-Aldrich) and rabbit monoclonal anti-Fluoro-Gold (1:500; Fluorochrome, Denver, CO) antibodies at 4\u00b0C for 24\u2009h, followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:400; Life Technologies) and Alexa Fluor-Cy5-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:50; Life Technologies) secondary antibodies, and counterstained with DAPI. Images were obtained using a fluorescence microscope (BZ-ZX700/BZ-X710; Keyence) and quantified using Image J (National Institutes of Health). The number of Fluoro-Gold\u2013positive motor neurons was counted. Synaptophysin-positive puncta on Fluoro-Gold\u2013positive motor neuron cell bodies were quantified. All slices containing Fluoro-Gold\u2013positive neurons were quantified.\n\nPKM2 levels in skeletal muscle, plasma, and brain\nPKM2 levels in the whole brain, biceps femoris, and plasma were quantified using ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) Kit for mouse PKM2 (Cloud-Clone, Katy, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, acteoside was injected to the vastus lateralis of the right and left hindlimbs (0.1\u2009mg/limb) of healthy ddY mice (female, 10-weeks-old). After 1, 3, and 6\u2009h, mice were perfused with ice-cold saline, and biceps femoris and plasma were isolated. After the frozen biceps femoris tissue was ground using a multi-bead shocker (Yasui Kikai, Osaka, Japan), lysates were prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA) buffer, and protein concentration was adjusted to 5\u2009\u03bcg/100\u2009\u03bcL for ELISA. Plasma was collected using Amber BD Microtaine Plasma Separator Tube (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ), and its protein concentration was also adjusted to 5\u2009\u03bcg/100\u2009\u03bcL for ELISA.\nRecombinant mouse PKM2 (10\u2009\u03bcg) or saline was intravenously injected in healthy ddY mice (female, 10-weeks-old). After 20\u2009min, mice were perfused with ice-cold saline and the brain was isolated. After chopping the tissues with microscissors, brain lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer, and protein concentration was adjusted to 5\u2009\u03bcg/100\u2009\u03bcL for ELISA.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical comparisons were performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with\npost hoc\nBonferroni tests, repeated measures two-way ANOVA with\npost hoc\nBonferroni tests, or unpaired two-tailed\nt\n-test, using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Split plot and\npost hoc\nTukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) test was performed using JMP Pro 13 (SAS Institute Japan, Tokyo, Japan). A\np\nvalue of <0.05 was considered significant. The data are presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM)."

    "Methods": "Overview\nWe jointly analyzed IPD of 359 children and adolescents 5\u201318 years of age collected across five RCTs of OFPST for pediatric TBI. One of the authors was principal investigator (PI) for each study, all of which have been conducted since 2000 and randomized participants to OFPST or one or more alternative treatments (\nTable 1\n). Because substantial deviations in therapist training at one site in one study raised questions of treatment fidelity, we excluded the IPD for all seven subjects recruited at that site.\nTable 1.\nRecruitment Summary by Study\nCharacteristic\nOnline\nCDC\nTOPS-Orig\nCAPS\nTOPS-RRTC\nFull study name\nOnline Problem Solving\nGroup versus Individual Problem Solving\nTeen Online Problem Solving\nCounselor Assisted Problem Solving\nTeen Online Problem Solving Multisite Study\nn\na\n43\n85\n40\n132\n152\nDates\nb\n2003\u20134\n2005\u20136\n2006\u20139\n2007\u201311\n2010\u201314\nTypical procedure\nc\nRecruitment from a trauma registry or during inpatient hospitalization/rehabilitation, with potential participants contacted by letter with follow-up by phone or in person at a clinic\nProcedure anomalies\nd\nNo inpatient recruitment\nAdditional recruitment at neurosurgery follow-up clinic, but no inpatient recruitment\nNo inpatient recruitment\nAge (y)\n5\u201318\n5\u201318\n11\u201318\n12\u201317\n11\u201318\nTime since injury (m)\n0\u201324\n0\u201324\n0\u201324\n0\u20137\n0\u201318\nInjury severity\nc,e\nOvernight hospitalization, GCS score <13 or 13-15 with positive neuroimaging findings\nTypical exclusionary criteria\nc\nAbusive head trauma, insufficient recovery for child to participate, significant pre-injury intellectual impairment, pre-injury psychiatric hospitalizations, parent hospitalized for psychiatric reasons in past year\nExclusionary criteria reductions\nf\nPre-injury intellectual impairment, pre-injury psychiatric hospitalizations, and parent hospitalization for psychiatric reasons\nPre-injury psychiatric hospitalizations, and parent hospitalization for psychiatric reasons\nTreatment groups\nOFPS, IRC\nOFPS, OMFG, UC\nOFPS, IRC\nOFPS, IRC\nOFPS, IRC\nOpen in a separate window\na\nn\n, number of participants assessed at baseline;\nb\nDates of baseline assessment;\nc\nApplies to all studies;\nd\nProcedure Anomalies, recruitment in addition to typical procedures, or other deviations;\ne\nInjury severity inclusionary criterion was identical for all studies;\nf\nExclusionary criteria reductions, typical exclusionary criteria that were not applied.\nTOPS-RRTC, Teen Online Problem Solving\u2013Rehabilitation Research Training Center; GCS, Glasgow Coma Scale; OFPS, online family problem solving; IRC, Internet resource comparison, OMFG, online multi-family group; UC, usual care.\nThis project received institutional review board approval. Participant recruitment relied on review of trauma registries of participating hospitals, current hospital admissions, and outpatient medical visits, or via referral from clinical providers.\nTable 1\ndetails minor study-specific deviations from this procedure and other design elements. Across studies, eligibility required overnight hospitalization for a complicated mild TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score of 13\u201315 with positive findings on imaging), moderate TBI (lowest GCS score 9\u201312), or severe TBI (lowest GCS score 3\u20138). Current behavioral concerns were not a requirement for eligibility.\n\nRCT design\nIn all five studies, participants were randomized to OFPST or one or more comparison conditions at the completion of the baseline assessment. Trained research coordinators administered assessments and questionnaires prior to randomization and at a follow-up assessment 6 months later (treatment completion). Assessments were administered in family's homes to minimize attrition. In all but one study, research coordinators were aware of group assignment at follow-up.\n\nTreatment and control groups\nOFPST\nIn all trials, participants randomized to OFPST began treatment 1\u201324 months post injury. Although the specific content and numbers of sessions varied somewhat across studies (see\nTable 1\n), OFPST consistently involved the child with TBI and at least one parent, with both parents and siblings included when possible, and provided training in cognitive reframing, problem-solving, communication skills, and behavior management. In all studies, supplemental sessions addressing specific issues (i.e., marital stress, sibling behavior, pain, or sleep difficulties) allowed families to receive content tailored to their unique concerns. After completing the core modules, families could receive up to four of these supplemental sessions as determined by the therapist and family. OFPST integrated online, didactic modules, which families completed independently, with synchronous videoconference sessions with a trained therapist. During the therapist-directed sessions, the therapist reviewed the online content with the family and facilitated problem-solving regarding a family- or child-identified goal or concern. Parents completed questionnaires assessing the child's behavior and self-reported depression and distress at baseline, before randomization, and after treatment (6 months later) in all studies.\nFour RCTs used access to Internet resources for pediatric TBI as the control treatment (IRC, group), whereas one used continuation of usual psychosocial care. The IRC group received Internet access and a home page of links to online information about TBI. However, they did not have access to a study therapist or online problem-solving content. Overall, 16.16% attrition across the OFPST and control arms resulted in some follow-up data for 301 of the 359 participants with baseline data. In the IPD meta-analyses reported here, we combined IRC and usual care participants.\n\nMeasures\nOutcome measures administered across studies overlapped substantially, thereby minimizing common barriers to IPD meta-analyses.\n22\n,\n23\nBackground and demographic variables used in the meta-analysis were harmonized via recoding to a common codebook.\nBackground interview\nAll studies included a parent interview regarding the child's injury, as well as medical, psychiatric, and educational history, including prior diagnoses and history of special education placement. Parents also provided information about their income and education, with the latter serving as our proxy measure of SES.\nInjury information\nInformation abstracted from the medical chart included mechanism of injury, length of hospital stay, and lowest GCS score.\nChild Behavior Checklist (CBCL)\nMeasures of child internalizing and externalizing behavior problems were derived from the CBCL,\n24\na highly reliable questionnaire regarding child behavioral symptoms. The CBCL is a validated instrument that has been identified as a primary outcome for child behavioral adjustment following TBI by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Common Data Elements working group.\n25\nBehavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Functions (BRIEF)\nThe Global Executive Composite (GEC) was derived from the 86 item BRIEF and used as an overall measure of everyday executive function (EF). The BRIEF is particularly suited to these studies because this instrument has been validated as a measure of behavioral regulation and metacognition in both normative and TBI samples.\n26\n,\n27\nParents completed the BRIEF at baseline and follow-up.\nHome and Community Social Behavior Scale (HCSBS)\nChild prosocial adaptive behaviors were measured via the Social Competence Scale of the HCSBS parent rating form. Parents completed this well-validated instrument (relative to other social behavior measures) at both baseline and follow-up.\n28\nCenter for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)\nParental depression was measured by the CES-D,\n29\na 20 item measure assessing how often the respondent experienced symptoms associated with depression over the past week. The CES-D has been used successfully across wide age ranges,\n30\nand is sensitive to changes in depressive symptoms after intervention.\n31\nSymptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R)\nPsychological distress was measured via the Global Severity Index of the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised, a 90 item self-report inventory that assesses symptoms over \u201cthe past 7 days including today.\u201d The SCL-90-R has been validated in a number of studies.\n32\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic, pre-morbid, and injury characteristics within each study, whereas simple summary statistic meta-analyses were used to characterize the combined studies. Linear mixed effect models were used to model four post-intervention child behavioral outcomes (BRIEF GEC, CBCL Externalizing and Internalizing Problems, HCSBS social competence) and two parent outcomes (CES-D, SCL-90 Global Severity Index [GSI]). All models were adjusted for child age, sex, race, parental education, and baseline outcome. Intent-to-treat analysis was used to preserve the benefit of randomization and to ensure unbiased estimation of the treatment effect. Study-specific random intercepts accounted for dependence of outcomes within the same study. We examined the heterogeneity of treatment effects across eight baseline variables: age, sex, race, child intelligence (IQ), pre-morbid self-reported learning disability (LD) or ADHD, parental marital status and education, and child's or parent's pre-treatment symptom levels. For each of these variables, a separate model (including an extra main effect as appropriate) was used to test its interaction with the treatment group. To address multiple comparisons, we used the less formal approach suggested by the\nNew England Journal of Medicine\nspecial report on reporting subgroup analyses in clinical trials, by noting the number of nominally significant interaction tests that would be expected to occur by chance alone.\n33\nEight characteristics were examined for each of the six outcomes, resulting in 48 pre-specified subgroup analyses. An average of 2.4 statistically significant interaction tests (\np\n<\u20090.05) would be expected on the basis of chance alone.\nFor models with significant interactions, post-hoc analyses examined treatment effects in subgroups for discrete baseline characteristics, and at the 10th and 90th percentiles for continuous baseline characteristics. All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC)."

    "Methods": "Case selection\nDogs were recruited prospectively from the patient pool of the Canine Spinal Cord Injury Program at the North Carolina State University (NCSU) College of Veterinary Medicine and via trial advertisement online (\nhttps://cvm.ncsu.edu/research/labs/clinical-sciences/canine-spinal-cord-injury/\n,\nwww.dodgerslist.com\n). To be included, dogs must have sustained an acute, clinically complete (hindlimb paralysis with loss of pain perception) thoracolumbar SCI and demonstrated an incomplete recovery at least 3 months following injury characterized by chronic motor deficits and severely reduced to absent hindlimb and tail pain perception (with or without urinary and fecal incontinence). Dogs with concurrent health issues precluding general anesthesia or sedation and dogs with seizure disorders were excluded. For this study, dogs underwent baseline (pre-4AP) and post-4AP evaluation of spasticity, gait, and long tract and local circuitry function using electrodiagnostics and structural lesion severity using MRI (\nTable 1\n). Brief explanations of the procedures performed are provided subsequently in this article. Baseline. spasticity, electrodiagnostic, and imaging results for a subset of this population have been reported previously and should be referenced for a more detailed description of procedures.\n9\n,\n10\n,\n23\n,\n24\nInformed consent was obtained for all animals and examinations were conducted in accordance with the NCSU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol #15-004-01).\nTable 1.\nStudy Protocol Overview\n9\n,\n10\n,\n23\n,\n24\nStudy day\nTests/activities performed\nDay 1 \u2013 Baseline\nNeurological examination\nGait analysis (open field, treadmill stepping, and coordination scores)\nSpasticity testing\nElectrodiagnostic testing (MEPs, SEPs, NCS, F-wave, H-reflex)\nMRI with DTI\nEstablish test dose for 4AP (8\u201312\u2009h between 4AP doses)\nDay 2 \u2013 Post-4AP\nAdminister test dose of 4AP\nAs for Day 1, except no MRI\nOpen in a separate window\nMEP, motor evoked potential; SEP, sensory evoked potential; NCS, nerve conduction study; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; DTI, diffusion tensor imaging; 4AP: 4-aminopyridine.\n\n4AP protocol\nDogs were admitted to the hospital at the North Carolina State Veterinary Hospital for baseline (pre-4AP) procedures, drug titration, and then repeat testing of the same procedures post-administration of 4AP. The targeted dose for this study was determined based on prior evaluation of 4AP in chronically non-ambulatory dogs.\n22\nCompounded 4AP oral capsules were specifically prepared for this study and included 1\u2009mg, 2.5\u2009mg, 5\u2009mg, and 10\u2009mg sizes. Using each dog's current body weight, the appropriate combination of capsules was used to achieve a dose of \u223c0.5\u20130.75\u2009mg/kg given orally. If that dose was well tolerated with no apparent side effects, each dog received a second dose of \u223c0.75\u20131\u2009mg/kg orally at least 8\u2009h after the initial dose and if tolerated, this dose was used for subsequent testing (test dose). If a dog displayed drug-related anxiety at the higher dose, the lower dose was used as the test dose. If more severe side effects were noted (tremors, generalized seizures) the drug was discontinued, and the dog was withdrawn from the study. On the 2nd day, each dog was administered the test dose of 4AP and 1\u2009h later all baseline procedures were repeated using the same protocols except MRI. MRI was only performed at baseline. Dogs were monitored during the study period for adverse drug reactions or other adverse events. Seizure activity was treated with 0.25\u2009mg/kg midazolam IV, repeated if necessary, and 4AP was discontinued and the dog was withdrawn from the study. Excessive anxiety was treated by discontinuation of 4AP and administration of 0.25\u2009mg/kg midazolam or other sedative (such as butorphanol) at the discretion of study investigators. 4AP was reintroduced at a lower dose the following day. Any other adverse events were recorded and treated accordingly at the discretion of investigators.\n\nStandard neurological and gait evaluation\nAll dogs underwent a neurological examination including standard evaluation of gait, proprioception, spinal reflexes, and pain perception. Dogs were also walked on a non-slip surface and on a treadmill for \u223c3\u2009min with the speed adjusted to a comfortable pace for each individual. Sling support was provided for the pelvic limbs as needed. All gait examinations were videotaped including footage with and without sling support. Gait was categorized as ambulatory (able to take at least 10 consecutive weight-bearing steps unassisted) or not, and quantified using an ordinal, open field scale (OFS) that ranges from 0 to 12.\n25\n,\n26\nTreadmill footage was scored using previously described measures of pelvic limb stepping (stepping score) and coordination (regularity index).\n27\n,\n28\nTreadmill scores (stepping score and regularity index) were generated without sling support for the statistical analysis unless otherwise specified.\n\nSpasticity evaluation\nSpasticity testing was performed for all dogs using the Canine Spasticity Scale adapted from human clinical scales.\n23\nThe Canine Spasticity Scale is composed of the assessment of patellar clonus duration and flexor spasm duration and degree on each pelvic limb with a standard scoring system developed for each component.\n23\nOrdinal scores (0\u20133) were assigned for each pelvic limb for each scale component (patellar clonus duration, flexor spasm duration, flexor spasm degree) which were then summed to give a Canine Spasticity Scale overall score representing all components and both pelvic limbs (0\u201318).\n\nElectrodiagnostic evaluation\nLong tract function was evaluated by recording MEPs and cortical somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs), and local reflex circuitry was assessed by H-reflex, F-waves, and M-waves as previously reported.\n9\nThe presence (yes/no) and minimum latency of MEPs were recorded with the conduction velocity calculated from the latency. The presence (yes/no) and minimum latency of SSEPs and cord dorsum potentials were recorded. The minimum latency of the F-waves, F-wave persistence (percentage of F-waves present in 10 stimulations), and the F-ratio [(latency F \u2212 latency M \u22121)/ 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009latency M] were recorded. The H-reflex threshold (stimulus intensity at which H-reflex first appeared), the minimum H-reflex latency, and the maximum H-reflex amplitude and maximum M-wave amplitude (defined as the largest negative to the largest positive peak for each waveform) were each recorded during H-reflex testing and used to calculate the H:M ratio (maximum H amplitude/maximum M amplitude).\n\nImaging acquisition and analysis\nA subset of dogs were anesthetized and underwent thoracolumbar MRI at baseline. MRIs were performed using a 1.5T scanner (Symphony; Siemens Medical Solutions USA Inc., Malvern, PA) with acquisition of standard transverse and sagittal sequences (T1W pre- and post-contrast, T2W, short-TI inversion recovery [STIR], half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo [HASTE],\u2009\u00b1\u2009proton density and gradient recalled echo [GRE]/T2*) followed by DTI obtained for the same region. Full imaging protocol and processing details have been reported.\n10\n,\n24\nT2-weighted images were used to identify the lesion and to measure the length of the region within the lesion with 100% abnormal spinal cord signal intensity normalized to the length of the L2 vertebral body.\n24\nPost-processed DTI images were imported into Mango (\nhttp://ric.uthscsa.edu/mango/\n) in order to manually outline regions of interest (ROI) within the spinal cord above, below, and within the lesion epicenter. Fractional anisotrophy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were calculated for each ROI constructed (cranial, lesion epicenter, caudal). Tensor maps displaying the orientation of tensors across all voxels were used to perform tractography using TrackVis (\nhttp://trackvis.org\n). Tractography was assessed visually for continuity (yes/no) of the represented white matter tracts across the lesion.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll analyses were performed using R (Version 3.3.0,\nhttp://cran.r-project.org/\n) and Jmp 13 Pro (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Responders to 4AP were defined as having an improvement in open field score \u22651 point between pre- and post-4AP administration, whereas non-responders were defined as showing no positive change. Summary statistics comparing responders and non-responders were reported for all baseline variables. The following variables at baseline were then assessed as predictors of response to 4AP: age, duration of injury, open field score, Canine Spasticity Scale overall score, H-reflex threshold, H:M ratio, presence of pelvic limb MEPs, length of the region with 100% abnormal signal intensity on T2W images relative to L2, FA for each ROI cranial to and within the lesion epicenter, and the presence of translesional fibers. A classification tree for the responder status was constructed using baseline patient characteristics and models were fit using R.\n29\nDescriptive statistics were subsequently presented to demonstrate the effects of 4AP. With dogs separated into responder and non-responder groups, the following variables were investigated for changes pre- versus post-4AP in each group: Canine Spasticity Scale overall score, stepping score, regularity index, H-reflex threshold, H:M ratio, F ratio, and motor nerve conduction velocity. Additionally, the number of dogs with detectable MEPs or SSEPs at baseline and post-4AP administration was reported."

    "Methods": "Spinal cord injury procedure\nForty female Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (250\u2013300\u2009g) were used for this experiment. The sample size was determined using a power analysis, which is described in the\nsupplementary information\nsection (available online at\nwww.liebertpub.com/neu\n). Female rats were chosen due to lower incidence of urinary tract infections; however, future studies would benefit from including both male and female populations. Rats underwent a graded spinal cord contusion injury at the T8 vertebral level using the MASCIS impactor (W.M. Keck Center for Collaborative Neuroscience, Piscataway, NJ), which is a widely-used injury model for experimental SCI in rodents.\n24\u201327\nRats were anesthetized with 4% inhaled isoflurane prior to the procedure, ensuring absence of leg flexion-withdrawal and corneal reflexes; 2.5% isoflurane was maintained during the procedure. The back was shaved and sterilized with povidone-iodine, and a longitudinal incision was made over the mid-thoracic region. After gently moving aside the muscle and placing retractors, the lamina at T8 was cut and removed to expose the cord. The rat was suspended with clamps and the impactor rod was placed on the spinal cord above T8. The contusion was performed by dropping the 10\u2009g rod from a height of 12.5, 25.0, or 50.0\u2009mm to induce a mild, moderate, or severe injury, respectively, with 10 animals in each severity condition. The trajectory of the falling rod, impact velocity, cord compression distance, time, and rate were recorded and were consistent with expected values. Cord compression (mm) was also used as a parametric measure of injury severity. Ten sham animals underwent a laminectomy with the weight briefly placed on the cord, but they did not experience the weight drop. After the injury, the muscles were sutured in layers.\nAfter surgery, rats were placed on post-operative care, including twice-daily bladder expression, one dose of enrofloxacin (10\u2009mg/kg subcutaneously; Bayer Healthcare LLC, Shawnee Mission, KS), buprenorphine hydrochloride (0.1\u20130.5\u2009mg/kg subcutaneously; Rickitt Benckiser Health Care Ltd, Hull, U.K.), and 6\u2009cc of lactated Ringer's solution. Animals were kept under post-operative care procedures until bladder function returned and no signs of infection or stress were evident. All rats survived the injury procedures, but two animals were euthanized prior to the final time-point due to complications.\nEach week, the rats' functional post-injury motor behavior was assessed on the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) scale, following standard procedures,\n28\n,\n29\nas a measure of functional recovery and locomotion. Briefly, rats were placed on a flat, one-meter diameter surface and observed for 4\u2009min. Hindlimb function was assessed according to the 0 to 21 BBB scoring where 0 is flaccid paralysis and 21 is normal gait. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at the Medical College of Wisconsin, the Zablocki VA Medical Center, and Marquette University.\n\nMRI\nMRI was performed at 2, 30, and 90 days after the injury procedure on a Bruker 9.4 T Biospec System using a commercial 3.8\u2009cm inner diameter quadrature Litz volume coil (Doty Scientific, South Carolina). Animals were placed prone in a custom head holder with ear bars to minimize motion as previously described.\n30\nA four-shot, diffusion weighted EPI acquisition (echo time [TE]\u2009=\u200928\u2009msec; repetition time [TR] \u22651500\u2009msec, varied by respiratory rate) was used with a 25.6\u2009\u00d7\u200925.6\u2009mm\n2\nfield of view, matrix of 128\u2009\u00d7\u2009128, and nominal spatial resolution of 0.20\u2009\u00d7\u20090.20\u2009mm\n2\nwith 3/4 partial Fourier sampling. Fourteen axial slices with a thickness of 1.0\u2009mm and 0.75\u2009mm gap were positioned perpendicular to the spinal cord main axis spanning vertebral segments C1 to C5 with the first slice consistently positioned at the junction of the cerebellum and medulla. The phase encoding direction was along the A-P axis. Fat saturation was achieved with a frequency-selective saturation pulse in addition to gradient reversal of the slice selection and refocusing pulses.\n31\nDiffusion weighting employed Stejskal-Tanner diffusion gradients along 30 unique diffusion directions\n32\nat b values of 250, 500, 1000, and 2000\u2009sec/mm\n2\nwith a gradient duration (\u03b4) and separation (\u0394) of 8.25 and 12.5\u2009msec, respectively. Additional 15 non-diffusion-weighted images were collected. Three signal averages were used and the entire acquisition required approximately 1\u2009h. T2-weighted rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) images were acquired with the identical spatial resolution at TE\u2009=\u200916, 48, and 80\u2009msec, TR\u2009=\u20093500\u2009msec, number of excitation\u2009=\u20094, RARE factor\u2009=\u20094.\n\nMRI processing\nThe preprocessing pipeline (\nFig. 1\n) included correction for EPI artifacts, motion and eddy currents, and spatial registration to a common coordinate frame using a combination of open-source and custom software. The EPI phase correction to minimize ghosting artifacts was based on the algorithm described by Chen and colleagues\n33\nusing an automated, iterative adjustment of the constant and linear phase of multi-shot complex k-space, which maximized the image signal relative to the background using histograms (\nFig. 2\n). To correct for motion and eddy currents, a version of the Spinal Cord Toolbox\n34\nwas modified to perform iterative slice-by-slice corrections. Briefly, each diffusion-weighted image was spatially aligned to the mean of all other images, weighted by the angle between the current and all other diffusion weighting vectors, a procedure similar in principle to methods implemented in FMRI Software Library (FSL)\n35\nusing increasing degrees of freedom from translation, rigid-body, and affine transformations and three full iterations.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nImage analysis pipeline. Schematic representation of image preprocessing, including phase correction, and registration to template space for group-level analysis.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nEcho planar imaging (EPI) artifact phase correction. Ghosting artifacts present in multi-shot diffusion-weighted EPI were evident in both non\u2013diffusion-weighted and diffusion-weighted images (top). The automated phase correction had a negligible effect on artifact free images (A-A\u2032), reduced artifacts caused by motion (B-B\u2032 and D-D\u2032) and corrected phase artifact likely due to motion occurring during the pre-scan EPI calibration (C-C\u2032 and D-D\u2032). Four spatial suppression bands placed outside the cord reduced the contamination from non-cord tissues.\nDiffusion modeling and parameter maps were calculated on a voxel-by-voxel basis by fitting signal intensity to several models. The diffusion tensor model of Basser and colleagues\n36\nwas fit according to:\nwhere Si is the diffusion-weighted signal, S0 is the signal without diffusion encoding, D is the estimated diffusivity, and b is the strength of the diffusion weighting given by\nThe Free Water Elimination technique\n18\n,\n19\nused a two-compartment model to fit the diffusion signal where tissue and free water compartments are modeled as separate attenuation vectors, A, given as\nand f is the volume fraction of the tissue and D is the diffusion tensor. The Free Water Fraction (FWF) is calculated as 1-f. Since multiple b-value images were used, no spatial regularization was employed.\nAll parameter maps were spatially registered to a common study-specific template space using slice-by-slice iterative registration with Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTS).\n37\nFractional anisotropy (FA) and radial diffusivity (RD) maps contain high contrast between white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and CSF and were jointly used for all registrations. The template was created by registering all images to the initial mean using increasing degrees of freedom from rigid, affine, and non-linear, with six iterations at each step. The spinal cord was straightened along the long axis by aligning the central canal in all slices. Once the template was completed, each dataset was re-registered to the template using a single transformation and interpolation step, and all other DWI parameter maps were similarly transformed. Due to the large slice gap, no interpolation along the slice axis was performed.\n\nStatistical analysis\nFor all metrics, the maps of mean and coefficient of variation (CoV) were calculated. CoV for each metric was calculated as a ratio of standard deviation over the mean across all sham animals at the first time-point. Regions of interest (ROIs) were manually traced on the template in the white matter, gray matter, and CSF, and ROIs were applied to each of the individual datasets in template space. DTI and FWE ROI values were analyzed for an effect of injury or time by injury interaction using mixed-effect analysis of variance (ANOVA) with injury severity (mild, moderate, severe, and sham) as a fixed effect and time as a repeated factor. Each of the metrics were assessed with a significance threshold of\np\n<\u20090.05.\nA linear regression analysis was performed to relate the injury biomechanics (compression) and BBB scores to the DWI metrics. An ROI analysis was first performed at a significance level of\np\n<\u20090.05. Steiger's Z test was used to compare the difference in correlation coefficients between any of the MRI metrics, with BBB scores being a common criterion.\n38\nFor ROIs that had a significant effect of injury severity, a subsequent voxel-wise analysis was performed to visualize the spatial pattern of the relationship. The non-parametric statistical method of randomize with threshold-free cluster enhancement in the FSL\n39\nwas used with a statistical threshold of 0.05 and multiple comparison correction by controlling for the false discovery rate at the voxel level. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS (IBM Corp., 2017, Statistical Package for Social Sciences, Version 25.0, Armonk, NY) and Stata (StataCorp, 2011, Stata Statistical Software, Release 12, College Station, TX).\n\nWater content measurement\nA separate cohort of animals was used to measure total cord water content in the cord using the dehydration method.\n40\nNineteen animals (\nn\n=\u200910 sham and\nn\n=\u20099 severe) underwent the same contusion injury procedure as described above and were euthanized at the 90-day time-point with 0.22\u2009mL/kg Beuthanasia-D injection (Med-Pharmex, Pomona, CA). The full spinal cord was excised and cut into segments using vertebral bodies as landmarks (C2-T13). The sections were weighed, placed in a 100\u00b0C oven for at least 12\u2009h, and weighed again. The percentage of water content lost due to dehydration relative to the initial weight (expressed as %) was calculated for each segment, and the values were averaged across the thoracic and cervical cord segments. A two-sample\nt\n-test was performed to evaluate changes in water loss between sham and severe groups."

    "Methods": "Animals\nYoung adult male and female C57BL/6 mice (12 weeks old) from Taconic Biosciences (Germantown, NY) were housed on standard bedding in a specific pathogen free facility (12\u2009h light/dark cycle). All animals had access to chow and water\nad libitum.\nAnimal procedures were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals, and approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Maryland School of Medicine. The average body weight at the time of injury was 26.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7\u2009g for males and 20.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\u2009g for females. We used random cycling of female mice to better reflect clinical applicability. We measured 17\u03b2-estradiol in the serum of females and males by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay (Cayman Chemicals Corporation; 17\u03b2-estradiol; Ann Arbor, MI) according to manufacturer's instructions. Sham and controlled cortical impact (CCI) male and female mice at 1, 3, and 7 days post-injury (randomly selected\nn\n=\u20094/group) were analyzed (\nTable 1\n), and males had significantly reduced 17\u03b2-estradiol levels than females at each time-point (\np\n<\u20090.05). Notably, sham and CCI females had equivalent levels of estradiol at each time-point, indicating random cycling and no effect of TBI on 17\u03b2-estradiol levels\nTable 1.\n17\u03b2-Estradiol Levels in Sham and CCI Male and Female Mice\n17\u03b2-estradiol in pg/mL\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM\nSham\n1\u2009dpi\n3\u2009dpi\n7\u2009dpi\nMale\n48.3\u2009\u00b1\u20096.2\n53.4\u2009\u00b1\u20095.3\n53.0\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4\n42.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6\nFemale\n72.3\u2009\u00b1\u200915.3\n72.8\u2009\u00b1\u200913.8\n64.7\u2009\u00b1\u20096.7\n62.03\u2009\u00b1\u200912.2\nOpen in a separate window\n17\u03b2-Estradiol was measured from serum of males and females sham and CCI across each time-point (\nn\n=\u20094 per group). Females mice had significantly higher 17\u03b2-estradiol levels compared with male mice (\np\n<\u20090.05). Levels of 17\u03b2-estradiol in females were the same in the sham and CCI groups across each time-point, indicating no injury effect on plasma 17\u03b2-estradiol levels (\np\n>\u20090.05). 17\u03b2-estradiol levels are expressed in pg/mL (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM).\nCCI, controlled cortical impact; SEM, standard error of the mean; dpi, days post-injury.\n\nControlled cortical impact\nOur custom-designed CCI injury device consists of a microprocessor-controlled pneumatic impactor with a 3.5\u2009mm diameter tip. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane evaporated in a gas mixture containing 70% N\n2\nO and 30% O\n2\nand administered through a nose mask. Mice were placed on a heated pad and core body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C. The head was mounted in a stereotaxic frame, a 10-mm midline incision was made over the skull and the skin and fascia were reflected. A 5-mm craniectomy was made on the central aspect of the left parietal bone. The impounder tip of the injury device was then extended to its full stroke distance (44\u2009mm), positioned to the surface of the exposed dura, and reset to impact the cortical surface. Moderate-level CCI was induced using an impactor velocity of 6\u2009m/sec and deformation depth of 2\u2009mm. After injury, the incision was closed with interrupted 6-0 silk sutures, anesthesia was terminated, and the animal was placed into a heated cage to maintain normal core temperature for 45\u2009min post-injury. Sham animals underwent the same procedure as CCI mice except for craniectomy and cortical impact.\n31\n\nFlow cytometry\nImmediately after mice were euthanized using Euthasol (Virbac Corp., Fort Worth, TX), blood (200\u2009\u03bcL) was drawn by cardiac puncture with heparinized needles and later spun down for plasma analysis. Following transcardial perfusion with 60\u2009mL of ice-cold sterile PBS, the brains were removed and the ipsilateral hemisphere was processed by mechanical disruption on a 70-\u03bcm filter screen and resuspended in a total of 5\u2009mL of RPMI (Lonza Group, Basel, Switzerland). Papain (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), DNase II (Sigma), and Collagenase (Sigma) were added to the brain suspension and incubated on a shaker for 1\u2009h at 37\u00b0C for mechanical and enzymatic digestion of the brain tissue. After incubation, leukocytes were separated from other brain cells by a Percoll gradient (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, U.K.).\nLeukocytes were then washed and blocked with mouse Fc Block (clone 93; eBioscience, San Diego, CA) prior to staining with primary antibody-conjugated fluorophores including CD45-eF450 (30-F11), CD11b-APCeF780 (M1/70), TNF-PE-Cy7 (MP6-XT22), IL-1\u03b2-PerCP-eF710 (NJTEN3; eBioscience), transforming growth factor (TGF) \u03b2-APC (TW7-16B4; Biolegend, San Diego, CA), NOX2-gp91-A647 (BIOSS, Boston, MA), and H2AX pS139-PE, MACS Miltenyi Biotec (130-107-585; Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). For live/dead cell discrimination, a fixable viability dye, Zombie AquaTM (Biolegend), was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) according to the manufacturer's instructions and added to cells in a final concentration of 1:50. Data were acquired on a LSRII using FACsDiva 6.0 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star, San Carlos, CA). A standardized gating strategy was used to identify microglia (CD45\nint\nCD11b+Ly6C-) and infiltrating myeloid (CD45\nhi\nCD11b+Ly6C+) populations as shown (\nSupplementary Fig. 1\n; see online supplementary material at\nhttp://www.liebertpub.com\n). Hereafter, these cells will be abbreviated and referred to as CD45\nint\nmicroglia and CD45\nhi\ninfiltrating myeloid cells. Cell-specific fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls were used to determine the positivity of each antibody. The entirety of each sample are run through the cytometer until there are zero events to obtain an absolute cell count/hemisphere.\nFor intracellular cytokine staining, leukocytes were collected as described above, and 1\u2009\u03bcL of GolgiPlug containing brefeldin A (BD Biosciences) was added to 500\u2009\u03bcL complete RPMI. Cells were resuspended in Fc Block, stained for surface antigens and washed in 100\u2009\u03bcL of fixation/permeabilization solution (BD Biosciences) for 20\u2009min. Cells were then washed twice in 500\u2009\u03bcL Permeabilization/Wash buffer (BD Biosciences) and resuspended in an intracellular antibody cocktail of cytokine antibodies and fixed. To measure reactive oxygen species levels, leukocytes were incubated with dihydrorhodamine (DHR) 123 (5mM; 1:500 in RPMI; Ex/Em: 500/536), a cell-permeable fluorogenic probe (Life Technologies, Invitrogen). DHR123 passively diffuses into cells and is oxidized by peroxide and peroxynitrite, causing a reaction that produces a green fluorescence.\n37\nCells were loaded for 20\u2009min in a 37\u00b0C water bath, washed twice with FACS buffer (without NaAz), then stained for surface markers including viability dye and subsequently fixed in paraformaldehyde (PFA). Phagocytic activity was assessed as described before with minor modification.\n31\nBriefly, Texas-red fluorescent carboxylate-modified polystyrene latex beads (0.5\u2009\u03bcm mean diameter; Sigma) were added to freshly isolated cells in a final dilution of 1:500 (in RPMI). After 1\u2009h incubation in a 37\u00b0C water bath, the cells were washed three times, re-suspended in FACS buffer, stained for surface markers and viability dye, and fixed in PFA.\nEx vivo\nflow cytometry studies were performed by an investigator blinded to sex and surgical condition.\n\nNeurobehavioral testing\nSham and CCI mice underwent a battery of neurological tests, including Rotarod, Cylinder, Open field, and Y-maze tests as outlined below. Investigators were blinded to surgical condition during testing and analysis.\nRotarod\nMotor function was assessed in sham and CCI mice at baseline (day 0), and 1, 2, and 3 days post-injury using an accelerating rotarod test (Ugo-Basile, Collegeville, PA).\n38\n,\n39\nIn brief, in each trial the rotarod accelerated from 4 to 60 RPM over a period of 3\u2009min. Mice were trained on the rotarod test for 2 days prior to sham or CCI surgery, and each mouse had three trials per day. Latency to fall from the rod (or cling to and rotate with the rod for two consecutive rotations) was recorded for three trials on each testing day, allowing 5-10\u2009min of rest with access to food and water between each trial. Scores from the three trials on each testing day were averaged to give a single score for each mouse on each testing day.\nCylinder test\nForearm preference was assessed by the cylinder test on Day 2 post-injury as previously described.\n40\n,\n41\nThis test evaluates forelimb use asymmetry following acute brain injury. The mouse was placed in a clean and transparent 2-liter glass beaker. A mirror was placed behind the beaker and the mouse was videotaped throughout the test. Forelimb use of the first contact against the wall after rearing and during lateral exploration was recorded. Forelimb use was scored using described criteria: 1) the first forelimb to contact the wall during a full rear was recorded as an independent wall placement for that limb; 2) simultaneous use of both the left and right forelimb by contacting the wall of the cylinder during a full rear and for lateral movements along the wall was recorded as \u201cboth\u201d movement; 3) after the first forelimb (for example right forelimb) contacted the wall and then the other forelimb was placed on the wall, but the right forelimb was not removed from the wall, a \u201cright forelimb independent\u201d movement and a \u201cboth\u201d movement were recorded; however, if the other (left forelimb) made several contacting movements on the wall, a \u201cright forelimb independent\u201d movement and only one \u201cboth\u201d movement was recorded; and 4) when the mouse explored the wall laterally, alternating both forelimbs, it was recorded as a \u201cboth\u201d movement.\u201d\n40\nA total of 20 movements were recorded during the 10-min test. The final score\u2009=\u2009(nonimpaired forelimb movement \u2212 impaired forelimb movement)/(nonimpaired forelimb movement + impaired forelimb movement + both movement).\nOpen field\nThe open field test was performed on Day 6 post-injury to assess locomotor activity as previously described.\n42\nSham and CCI mice were individually placed in a corner facing the wall of the open field chamber (22.5\u2009\u00d7\u200922.5\u2009cm), and allowed to freely explore the chamber for 5\u2009min. The distance traveled and average speed was recorded by Any-Maze tracking software (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL).\nY-maze spontaneous alternation\nThe Y-maze spontaneous alternation behavior test, to assess hippocampal-dependent working (short-term) memory, was performed on Day 5 post-injury, as previously described.\n32\nBriefly, the Y-maze (Stoelting Co.) consisted of three identical arms, each arm 35\u2009cm long, 5\u2009cm wide, and 10\u2009cm high, at an angle of 120\u00b0 with respect to the other arms. One arm was randomly selected as the \u201cstart\u201d arm, and the mouse was placed within and allowed to explore the maze freely for 5\u2009min. Arm entries (arms A-C) were recorded by analyzing mouse activity using ANY-maze tracking software (Stoelting Co.). An arm entry was attributed when all four paws of the mouse entered the arm, and an alternation was designated when the mouse entered three different arms consecutively. The percentage of alternation was calculated as follows: total alternations\u2009\u00d7\u2009100/(total arm entries \u22122). If a mouse scored significantly >50% alternations (the chance level for choosing the unfamiliar arm), this was indicative of hippocampal-dependent working memory.\n\nEstradiol measurement\n17\u03b2-estradiol was measured in plasma from sham and CCI mice at each time-point using an ELISA assay (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI). Plasma 17\u03b2-estradiol levels were determined according to the manufacturer's instructions and expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM).\n\nStatistical analyses\nData from individual experiments were analyzed for normal distribution and are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM. Baseline differences in\nex vivo\nmicroglial functional responses were determined by unpaired\nt\n-test. Behavioral differences on Rotarod were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures and a Tukey\npost hoc\nanalysis. Cylinder, Y maze, and Open field tests were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with a Tukey\npost hoc\nfor multiple comparisons. Myeloid and microglial cell functional responses over time were analyzed by a two-way ANOVA with a Tukey\npost hoc\nanalysis. Myeloid versus microglial cell comparisons were analyzed per time-point by one-way ANOVA with Tukey\npost hoc\nanalysis. Raw data (mean fluorescence intensities) were converted into a ratio of CD45\nhi\nmyeloid:CD45\nint\nmicroglial functional responses and are presented in\nFigure 5\n. Sex differences in plasma 17\u03b2-estradiol levels were analyzed by Student's test at each time-point. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism Software v. 6.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA), and a\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 5.\nInfiltrating peripheral myeloid cells produce high levels of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and have high phagocytic activity following controlled cortical impact. Comparison of infiltrating myeloid cells (CD45\nhi\n) versus resident microglial (CD45\nint\n) levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) \u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, transforming growth factor (TGF) \u03b2, NOX2, ROS, and phagocytosis at each post-injury time-point. Males and females MFI values for each marker are represented at each time-point (1, 3, and 7 days post-injury) and are expressed as a relative CD45\nhi\nmyeloid / CD45\nint\nmicroglia levels. After traumatic brain injury (TBI), infiltrating myeloid cells express higher levels of TNF\u03b1, IL1\u03b2, TGF\u03b2, and NOX2 protein, produce more ROS, and have greater phagocytic ability than resident microglia at each time-point.
