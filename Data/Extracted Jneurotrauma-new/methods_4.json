    "Methods": "Patient population and sample collection\nA prospective observational pilot study (December 2015\u2013October 2016) was conducted to obtain blood samples from Level 1 trauma patients (N\u2009=\u2009133,\nSupplementary Fig. S1\n) on admission to Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center's (WFBMC) Emergency Department (ED) and again 24\u2009h post-admission, under delayed consent (IRB#00035364). The Institutional Review Board (IRB) at WFBMC allowed for delayed consent to be obtained for all study participants within 48\u2009h of ED admission. While all patients enrolled in this study (N\u2009=\u2009130) consented to biomarker analysis, only a subset consented to genetic analysis (N\u2009=\u2009100).\nInclusion criteria included all adults receiving care at WFBMC who were \u226518 years with a weight >50\u2009kg and with Level 1 trauma activation. Exclusion criteria included pregnant women, <18 years old, those in police custody, and those who experienced a stroke (N\u2009=\u20093). A TBI was defined initially as a head Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score of \u22653 (n\u2009=\u200939), which is consistent with existing trauma literature.\n32\nWe observed, however, noteworthy patterns in the circulating fatty acid response in subjects who had intracranial bleeds with a head AIS score of 2 (n\u2009=\u20098). Therefore, these additional 8 subjects with a head AIS score of 2 and intracranial bleed were also designated as TBIs (n\u2009=\u200947). All reported analyses were completed using this stratification and further stratified by race.\nSupplementary Fig. S1\nillustrates the enrollment and TBI stratification of patients for this pilot prospective study.\nA total of 20\u201325\u2009mL of blood was collected from each enrolled subject in citrate and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) Vacutainer\n\u00ae\nblood collection tubes (Cat. #363083, #367856, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) at admission and 24\u2009h later. All blood samples were immediately processed: samples were centrifugally separated and aliquoted into plasma, red blood cells, and buffy coat components for storage at -80\u00b0C for future analyses.\n\nClinical data\nPatient demographics and relevant clinical data including admission vital signs (e.g., systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate), clinical laboratory values (e.g., complete blood cell count, base deficit, lactate), blood transfusions and resuscitative fluid products administered, and patient outcomes were extracted from the WFBMC electronic medical record. The trauma registry was used to extract injury score metrics, including Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), AIS scores for all regions (based on AIS 2005\u2013update 2008 version), and Injury Severity Scores (ISS). In addition, patient outcomes such as complications, morbidity, death, and length of stay (LOS) were documented. This also included days in the intensive care unit (ICU) and number of days necessitating ventilator support (VENT).\n\nGenotype at rs174537\nDeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was isolated from the citrated buffy coat samples utilizing standard techniques similar to the process detailed by Hester and associates.\n31\nBriefly, DNA pellets were isolated, washed, and rehydrated in Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer before determination of DNA concentration using a NanoDrop 2000/2000c Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher, Inc., Waltham, MA). After isolation, single SNP genotyping was performed on rs174537. Sequencing was performed using an ABI 7500 real-time polymerase chain reaction machine (ThermoFisher, Inc.).\nThe primers for this assay were 5\u2032 Capture: 5\u2032- ACGTTGGATGAGCACCATGTCTGCTGTGTG-3\u2032; 3\u2032 Capture: 5\u2032- ACGTTGGATGAGCCCTGTCGCCCTGCAGAA-3\u2032; Extend: 5\u2032- ACGTCGCCCTGCAGAAGAGACAG-3\u2032. Given that the allele frequency for SNP rs174537 is known to be significantly different in African ancestry versus European ancestry, we performed all of our analyses stratified by race. We also tested for the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium to ensure that our observed allele frequency was consistent with expected values (see\nSupplementary Table S1\n).\n\nPlasma fatty acid quantification\nPlasma fatty acids from extracted fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were measured by gas chromatography and flame ionization detection (GC-FID). The FAME were prepared in duplicate plasma samples of 100\u2009\u03bcL following a protocol previously outlined by Metcalfe and coworkers.\n33\nand Sergeant.\n34\nTripheptadecanoin (100\u2009\u03bcg; triglyceride of C17:0, NuChek Prep, Elysian, MN) was included in the samples as an internal standard. The FAME were analyzed on an Agilent J&W DB-23 column (30\u2009m\u2009\u00d7\u20090.25\u2009mm ID, film thickness 0.25\u2009\u03bcm) using an HP 7890 GC-FID (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Approximately 28 fatty acids were identified routinely, which accounted for >99% of the fatty acid peaks. For this study, only LC-PUFAs were analyzed; data are reported as the percent of total fatty acids.\n\nPlasma biomarker quantification\nUsing a multiplex assay, plasma collected in EDTA tubes was used for the quantification of various key inflammatory cytokines, neuronal injury, matrix metalloproteinases, and glycocalyx and glycoprotein biomarkers using a customized multiplex Luminex\n\u00ae\nkit from R&D Systems (Cat. No. LXSAHM/QT72619, Minneapolis, MN): levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukins (IL) IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tau, enolase-2, syndecan-1, and syndecan-4. Plasma samples were diluted 1:4 and analyzed using the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Samples that exceeded the detection range of the assay were diluted further and rerun as needed to ensure a coefficient of variability (CV%) of <15%. Samples were analyzed on a Luminex\n\u00ae\n100 plate reader (Austin, TX). Biomarker concentrations (pg/mL) were calculated by comparison with appropriate standard curves.\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to quantify levels of glial-fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) concentrations from plasma (Cat. No. DY008, R&D Systems). Standard manufacturer protocols were followed, and biomarker concentration was measured using a BioTek ELx800 plate reader (Winooski, VT) and a standard curve. Samples were diluted 1:1.\n\nStatistical analysis\nMedians and interquartile ranges (IQR) are reported for all tabular and graphical results. Categorical variables were analyzed using chi square or Fisher exact tests for contingency tables, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were employed for comparison of continuous variables between injury groups. Extreme outliers were winsorized, such that the extreme observation was simply truncated to the next largest value present in the data before analyses. Box-Cox power transformations (e.g., square root, natural logarithm) were used to transform variables as needed to meet distributional assumptions.\nAll statistical analyses were performed by stratifying by race. Given our low numbers within the African American ethnic group, we were limited to our Caucasian population for the investigation of genetic effects. Differences between plasma biomarkers (i.e., fatty acids and biomarkers) at each time point between TBI and non-TBI groups were compared using linear regressions adjusted for age, gender, and race. Injury group and time additive effects on PUFA levels were analyzed using repeated measures general estimating equations (GEE1) models, adjusted for age, gender and race; the model assumed the identity link, autoregressive 1 (AR1) correlation structure, and used the robust variance estimator for statistical tests.\nRelationships between circulating fatty acids and inflammatory cytokines were analyzed using Spearman correlations. Logistic regression models adjusted for age and gender were used to determine effects of TBI and genotype at rs174537 on death. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS (v9.4, Cary, NC) with a significance level set at \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05. Multiple comparisons were analyzed with respect to LC-PUFAs with consideration for Bonferroni adjustment for the number of tests using a\np\nvalue of 0.0125. Given the pilot nature of this study and relatively small sample size, we adopted a principal component analysis method to adjust for multiple comparisons. This method was also chosen because measured inflammatory markers (>22) are potentially related and display some correlations with each other. The principal component analysis identified that the first eight components accounted for 92% of the variance from the measured inflammatory and neuronal biomarkers; thus, a\np\nvalue <0.00625 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "Participants\nThese data are part of a larger study that assessed risk factors for persistent post-traumatic headache.\n8\n,\n13\nThis study explores differences in the outcomes between participants with mild TBI who identified as AA or Caucasian. Mild TBI was defined according to the criteria endorsed by the World Health Organization Task Force,\n18\nwhich included: 1) a Glasgow Coma Scale score between 13 and 15 when assessed at an emergency department; 2) a computed tomography scan of the head that indicates no abnormal findings, to rule out secondary disorders (i.e., cerebral hemorrhage or vein thrombosis, hematoma); and 3) the occurrence of one or more of the following symptoms: post-traumatic amnesia for <24\u2009h, disorientation or confusion, or a loss of consciousness (LOC) for <30\u2009min. Further, symptoms of the mild TBI cannot be caused by other injuries or treatments for other injuries, medications, drugs, alcohol, a penetrating craniocerebral injury, or by other problems such as psychological trauma or coexisting medical conditions. Also, patients with mild TBI and polytrauma (e.g., fractures, sprains, dislocations, but not minor bruises or scrapes) were excluded. All participants with mild TBI enrolled in this study were seen at a Level 1 trauma center for their mild TBI.\nControl participants who had never experienced a TBI were also enrolled in this study. We attempted to match control participants to participants with mild TBI based on age, sex, and race. All participants had to be between 18 and 65 years of age at the time of enrollment. Exclusion criteria for mild TBI and control participants were the following: metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes), uncontrolled hypertension, chronic cardiovascular disease (such as coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, valvular disease), renal disease, serious psychiatric conditions (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) or hospitalization in the previous year for psychiatric illness, neurological disease (e.g., Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy), chronic headaches defined as 15 days or more of headaches per month over a 3-month period (before the mild TBI for mild TBI participants), chronic opioid use (e.g., have a prescription for opioids or have taken them on a regular basis for the past month), current involvement in litigation, and current use of narcotics.\n\nRecruitment\nAdults with mild TBI were recruited from three Level 1 trauma centers located in Indianapolis. Study recruiters screened the electronic medical records of patients with a head injury who were admitted to the emergency department. The recruiters identified whether patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The attending emergency department physician also confirmed the diagnosis of mild TBI via e-mail or verbally. The identification and contact information of potentially eligible patients with mild TBI was put into a secure database. Then, the research staff called or e-mailed the potential participant within 48\u2009h to determine whether the individual was interested in the study and to review the inclusion and exclusion criteria again with the participant. For individuals interested and potentially eligible, the first study visit was scheduled within 2 weeks of the injury. Mild TBI participants had to be enrolled in the study within 2 weeks of their injury. Based on recruitment data from two of the trauma centers, approximately 22% of individuals who were potentially eligible based on their emergency department visit were actually enrolled in the study. The percentage enrolled from the third trauma center is unknown.\nResearch staff directly recruited the control participants based on the demographics of the mild TBI participants. Controls were recruited from the Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis campus and local community with e-mail advertisements and flyers. Individuals interested in the study contacted the research staff via phone or e-mail. The interested individuals then received more information about the study. Individuals who were still interested, potentially eligible, and a match based on race, age, and sex to a participant with mild TBI were then scheduled for a study visit for enrollment.\n\nProcedures\nThis study was approved by the Indiana University and Ascension St. Vincent Indianapolis Hospital Human Subject Review Boards. Participants with mild TBI were asked to complete three study visits, with visit 1 occurring within 2 weeks after the injury, visit 2 occurring approximately 1-month post-injury, and visit 3 occurring 4\u20136 months post-injury. Due to sample size issues, this study focused on the data collected at visits 1 and 2. Control participants completed one study visit. During the first visit, participants reviewed and signed an institutional review board-approved written informed consent. Participants also completed a health history questionnaire, supplemented by interview and blood pressure measurement to verify that participants met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The health history questionnaire also collected demographic information, including asking participants to identify their race. Participants were asked to check one of the following options for race: African American, Asian/Pacific Islander, Caucasian, Hispanic, Native American, or Other. After eligibility was established, participants completed several QST tests and questionnaires. These assessments were also collected in visit 2 for participants with mild TBI, and they are described below. All participants were asked to not consume caffeine or take pain-relief medication on the day of study visits prior to the visit.\n\nOutcome measures\nQuestionnaires\nPain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)\nThe PCS includes 13 items that evaluate respondents' emotional and cognitive responses to actual or anticipated pain.\n19\nParticipants rate on a Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (all the time) the degree to which they have various thoughts and feelings related to pain. A total score (ranging from 0 to 52) and three subscale scores of rumination, magnification, and helplessness can be calculated. Higher scores indicate greater pain catastrophizing.\nHeadache Survey\nParticipants completed a Headache Survey that has been utilized in prior research of post-traumatic headache.\n6\n,\n20\nThe survey included questions regarding the intensity of headaches, frequency of headaches, duration of headaches, medication use and other treatments, headache triggers, pre-injury history of headache, and symptoms of ongoing headache. Participants were asked to rate on a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale (NRS) the average pain intensity of their headaches during the past week, with 0 indicating no headaches at all and 10 indicating the worst pain possible. This pain intensity rating was used in data analysis.\nCenter for Epidemiological Studies\u2014Depression Scale (CES-D)\nThe CES-D includes 20 items that assess symptoms associated with depression. The total score ranges from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicative of increased depression. The CES-D is valid and reliable in the general and clinical populations.\n21\nA cutoff score of \u226516 suggests risk for clinical depression.\n22\nMeasures of pain modulatory function and pain sensitivity\nParticipants were first familiarized with each QST test and taught the 0\u2013100 pain rating system. The temporal summation (TS) of pain test was performed first, followed by pressure pain thresholds of the head, and then the CPM test. At least 10\u2009min separated each QST test.\nMechanical temporal summation (MTS)\nTS of pain is an indirect method of assessing hyperexcitability of the central nervous system (CNS).\n23\nMTS was assessed on the middle of the forehead and the back of the hand with a von Frey filament (Touchtest Sensory Evaluator 6.65) calibrated to bend at 300\ng\nof pressure. TS on the forehead was assessed while the participant was lying down on an exam bed. TS on the hand was assessed while the participant was sitting in a chair with the hand resting on a hard surface. A single pinprick with the von Frey filament was first applied to the body site. Participants rated the perceived pain intensity of the pinprick using the 0 (no pain at all) to 100 (worst pain imaginable) NRS. Then, 10 pinpricks with the same monofilament were administered to the same body site within an area of 1\u2009cm\n2\nand at a rate of 1 prick per sec. Immediately following the 10 pinpricks, participants rated the greatest pain intensity experienced using the 0\u2013100 NRS. The MTS score was calculated by subtracting the pain rating after the first stimulus from the pain rating after the 10 stimuli. The MTS procedure was completed two times at each body site with 60\u2009sec between trials. The two trials at each body site were averaged for a single MTS forehead score and a single MTS hand score.\nPressure pain thresholds (PPTs) of the head/neck area\nAs have been conducted in prior research,\n24\nPPTs were administered on five sites of the head and neck areas including the middle of the forehead, the left temple, the parietal area (top of head), the posterior neck/vertebral level C2, and the left trapezius. Pressure was applied to each body site with a digital, handheld algometer (AlgoMed, Medoc Advanced Medical Systems, Durham, NC, USA) that had a 1.0\u2009cm\n2\nprobe. Pressure was applied gradually and increased at a slow constant rate of pressure (30 kPA/sec). Participants were instructed to verbally identify when they first experienced pain caused by the pressure algometer. Then, the algometer was immediately removed. Two trials were administered at each body site with 20\u2009sec separating each trial. The PPT scores at all the head/neck sites were averaged for a single PPT score (PPT-Head), which was used in the data analysis.\n24\nConditioned pain modulation (CPM)\nThe most commonly used assessment of endogenous pain inhibition in humans is CPM. CPM represents a \u201cpain-inhibition-by-pain\u201d paradigm, in which pain produced by a test stimulus is reduced by a second noxious conditioning stimulus applied at a remote body site.\n25\n,\n26\nTo assess CPM, PPTs (test stimulus) on the left volar forearm were administered before and immediately after the submersion of the right hand in a cold-water bath (conditioning stimulus). Participants sat quietly for 7\u2009min between the administration of the pre-conditioning PPT trials and the start of the conditioning stimulus. This 7-min period was included to prevent within-session adaptation.\n27\nTest stimulus: The test stimulus was administered using the same PPT threshold procedures as described above (except different body location) on the left volar forearm. Two trials were conducted consecutively for each pre- and post-conditioning test. The post-conditioning trials were conducted immediately after participants removed their hand from the cold-water bath (conditioning stimulus). The PPT trials were averaged for a single pre-conditioning and post-conditioning PPT score.\nConditioning stimulus: Participants put their right hand up to the wrist in a cold-water bath (VersaCool 7, Thermo Scientific) for 1\u2009min. The temperature for the water was maintained at 10\u00b0C. Participants were asked to rate the cold pain every 15\u2009sec using the 0 to 100 NRS. The cold-water pain ratings were averaged for a single cold-water pain score for each participant.\nCalculation of CPM: To measure the magnitude of CPM, a percent change score was calculated for the test stimulus using the following formula: [(post-conditioning PPT trial score \u2013 pre-conditioning PPT trial score)/pre-conditioning PPT trial score] * 100. A positive percent change score indicated that PPTs increased following the conditioning stimulus, indicative of pain inhibition.\n\nStatistical analysis\nWe calculated descriptive statistics for all outcome variables. Chi-square tests were used to determine whether groups differed by sex, education, LOC and cause of head injury (mild TBI groups only), and frequency of headaches (mild TBI groups only). A 2 (Group: mild TBI, control)\u2009\u00d7\u20092 (Race: AA, Caucasian) between subjects ANOVA was conducted to determine whether groups differed by age. We conducted 2 (Group: mild TBI, control)\u2009\u00d7\u20092 (Race: AA, Caucasian) between subjects analysis of covariances (ANCOVAs) with sex added as a covariate to determine if the primary outcomes at 1\u20132 weeks post-injury differed as a function of race and mild TBI. Then, to determine whether the outcomes measures varied between races over time in the mild TBI participants, we conducted 2 (Race)\u2009\u00d7\u20092 (Time: Visit 1, Visit 2) mixed model ANCOVAs with repeated measures on time. Sex was added as a covariate. Follow-up tests to significant interactions were performed with Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) test. The\np\n-value for significance was set at\np\n<\u20090.05. Effect sizes were also calculated to determine the magnitude of difference in the outcome measures between races within the control and mild TBI groups separately. Cohen's\nd\nwas defined as the AA group mean minus Caucasian group mean, divided by the pooled within group standard deviation (\nd\n=\u2009[\nX\nAA\n\u2013\nX\nCaucasion\n]/pooled standard deviation). Positive effect sizes indicated a greater value for the AAs compared with Caucasians.\nWe also examined the QST and psychological variables as potential mediators of the race differences in headache pain at 1\u20132 weeks and 1-month post-injury. Only QST and psychological variables that differed by race were tested as mediators. Analyses were conducted separately for the 1\u20132 week variables and the 1-month variables. We used Hayes' PROCESS macro SPSS 37 to examine these mediation models (Model 4). This mediation analysis used bootstrapping to perform inference tests for the indirect effects.\n28\n,\n29\nPath estimates and the indirect effects were produced using 95% bias-corrected bootstrap confidence intervals (CIs) based on 10,000 bootstrap samples. Paths were considered statistically significant when the 95% CIs did not contain zero. Sex was included as a covariate in all mediation analyses."

    "Methods": "Participants\nThis was an archival study that used data extracted from the SOBIK investigation, completed in 2012. Study details have been published elsewhere.\n37\n,\n45\u201349\nBriefly, children with TBI were recruited from three metropolitan children's hospitals: The Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, Canada), Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital (Cleveland, Ohio, USA), and Nationwide Children's Hospital (Columbus, Ohio, USA). Participants were children between eight and 13 years of age who underwent hospitalization for at least 24\u2009h after a TBI.\nIndividuals with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 13 to15 were included only if day-of-injury (DOI) CT was positive for some type of trauma-related abnormality (i.e., fracture, hemorrhage, edema, etc.). Thus, these cases would meet criteria for what is referred to as \u201ccomplicated\u201d mTBI.\n50\nAll other children had a moderate or severe TBI, defined based on a GCS of 3\u201312. Injuries occurred 1 to 4 years prior to study enrollment, and participants were not eligible if the TBI occurred before age four. Detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria have been published previously.\n37\n,\n45\u201348\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the participant's parent or legal guardian, and Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval was obtained from each participating location, including Brigham Young University, where all post-processing of imaging data was performed using de-identified data. Processing speed was assessed using the Processing Speed Index (PSI) from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV Edition.\n51\n\nMRI\nParticipants completed magnetic resonance (MR) scanning during the chronic phase of injury (average\u2009=\u20092.6 years post-injury) using a uniform image acquisition protocol that has been described previously.\n37\n,\n46\nBriefly, MRI studies conducted in Cleveland or Toronto used a 1.5 T GE Signa Excite scanner, whereas a Siemens Symphony MRI scanner was used in Columbus. The T1-weighted (T1), FLAIR, and dual-echo proton density T2-weighted (T2) images were collected at each site (\nFig. 1\n). The current study conducted image analyses using T1 images (repetition time [TR]\u2009=\u20093000\u2009ms; echo time [TE]\u2009=\u20094.0\u2009ms; flip angle\u2009=\u20098; 170 slices at 1.2\u2009mm thick) to collect total WM volumes, FLAIR images (TR\u2009=\u20093000\u2009msec; TE\u2009=\u2009100\u2009msec; flip angle\u2009=\u200990; 24 slices at 5\u2009mm thick) to collect WMH volumes, and T2 images (TR\u2009=\u20093000; TE1\u2009=\u200912\u2009msec; TE2\u2009=\u2009100\u2009msec; flip angle\u2009=\u200990; 3\u2009mm interleaved) to verify WMHs on FLAIR images in manual tracings. All pre-processing procedures are detailed in\nSupplementary Material A\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSummary of white matter neuroimaging methods. Scheltens use unedited fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images for visual ratings of white matter hyperintensities (WMH). Manual tracings use pre-processed FLAIR, T2, and T1 images to obtain WMH volumes. NeuroQuant\n\u00ae\nuses FLAIR and T1 images in the dynamic atlas with a thresholding algorithm to obtain WMH volumes. NeuroQuant and FreeSurfer use T1 images to obtain total WM volumes. FreeSurfer obtains volumes using the recon-all function; NeuroQuant uses the dynamic atlas. *Hyperintensity in right lateral frontal lobe is an old contusion classified previously as gray matter hyperintensity; \u2020Image does not align with remaining images because we are unable to manipulate the provided image from the report.\nTo adjust for variations in head size, the ratio of WMH and total WM volumes to overall total intracranial volume (TICV) were computed and multiplied by 100, so whole numbers could be presented. NeuroQuant and FreeSurfer automatically collect TICV volumes; manual tracings of TICV were performed following methods outlined by Eritaia and associates,\n52\nfor a within-method head size correction.\nFigure 1\nprovides an overall schematic of what was examined in this study. On the left side, three axial views are presented from a child who sustained a severe TBI (GCS\u2009=\u20093). All images, which are in radiological perspective, depict a prominent region of focal left frontal encephalomalacia, with the FLAIR sequence at the top showing a distinct region of surround hyperintense signal on the boundary of the encephalomalacia. The different titled methods to the right depict which sequence was used, and how rated or processed. Additional details are provided in the figure legend.\nScheltens rating scale\nThe Scheltens rating scale\n15\nwas modified slightly to exclude GM hyperintensities, changing the total scale to 0\u201330 (\nTable 1\n). Two independent raters scored all participant images with high interrater reliability (Dice similarity coefficient > .9). An expert rater and author (EDB) reviewed and approved all scan images and ratings before analysis.\nTable 1.\nModified Scheltens Rating Scale for White Matter Hyperintensities\n1\n5\nRegion\nScale\nClassification\nPeriventricular hyperintensities (PVH 0\u20136)\nCaps occipital\n0 to 2\n0\u2009=\u2009absent\nfrontal\n0 to 2\n1\u2009=\u2009\u2264 5\u2009mm\nBands lateral ventricles\n0 to 2\n2\u2009=\u2009>5\u2009mm and <10\u2009mm\nWhite matter hyperintensities (WMH 0\u201324)\nFrontal\n0 to 6\n0\u2009=\u2009absent\nParietal\n0 to 6\n1\u2009=\u2009<3\u2009mm,\nn\n\u2264\u20095\nOccipital\n0 to 6\n2\u2009=\u2009<3\u2009mm,\nn\n>\u20096\nTemporal\n0 to 6\n3\u2009=\u20094\u201310\u2009mm,\nn\n\u2264\u20095\nInternal capsule\n0 to 6\n4\u2009=\u20094\u2009mm,\nn\n>\u20096\n5\u2009=\u2009>11\u2009mm,\nn\n>\u20091\n6\u2009=\u2009confluent\nTotal score\n0 to 36\nOpen in a separate window\nn\n=\u2009number of lesions.\nSemi-quantitative rating of signal hyperintensities by brain region, with the range of the scale, between brackets.\nManual tracing\nAlthough manual tracings are considered the gold standard for volumetric research,\n53\n,\n54\nno standard procedure exists for performing manual tracings of WMHs.\n55\nThis is likely because of the vast heterogeneity of WMHs in size, shape, and locale, as well as differences that may relate to etiology. Other publications that include WMH volumes simply note the use of expert raters to manually trace WMHs.\n53\n,\n54\nIn this study, two independent expert raters, blinded to injury severity, manually traced WMHs on the pre-processed FLAIR images, using the program Analysis of Functional NeuroImaging (AFNI). Our tracing procedures followed the boundaries of the WMHs (\nFig. 1\n). To be identified as a WMH, the hyperintensity had to be located in WM and appear distinctly hyperintense on the T2 image.\nAs a rule, periventricular regions were not traced manually except when they were prominently asymmetrical and extended into deep WM, because certain aspects of normal periventricular regions frequently show as hyperintense on FLAIR images and do not necessarily signify pathological damage from TBI.\n56\u201358\nDisagreements between tracings were adjudicated by an expert rater (EDB) and were retraced until a consensus was reached. All manual tracings were reviewed and approved by EDB.\nNeuroQuant\nNeuroQuant has several available reports that provide volumetric data for various structural areas of the brain. For this study, the Multi Structure Atrophy report provided total WM volumes using T1 images and the LesionQuant report provided WMH volumes using the T1 and FLAIR images (see\nFig. 1\n).\nFreeSurfer\nFreeSurfer's v6.0.0 (\nsurfer.mnr.mgh.harvard.edu\n) recon-all function was used to collect total WM volumes from the T1 images following the procedures from Bigler (\nFig. 1\n).\n21\nVisual inspection of the results ensured the accuracy of the skull strip, image registration, and WM segmentation. Although the focus of the current investigation was on WMHs, total WM volumes were also computed using both FreeSurfer as well as NeuroQuant.\n\nStatistical analyses\nFor analyses comparing methods, both correlation and agreement were assessed.\n30\n,\n59\n,\n60\nA Pearson R or Kendall tau correlation was used, depending on the normality of the data, and considered significant at\np\n\u2264\u20090.05. Normality was assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Absolute agreement between methods was assessed using a two-way mixed intraclass correlation (ICC), where an ICC below 0.40 indicated poor agreement, between 0.40 and 0.59 indicated fair agreement, between 0.60 and 0.74 indicated good agreement, and between 0.75 and 1.00 indicated excellent agreement.\n30\n,\n61\n,\n62\nOutliers were identified as data greater than three standard deviations (SD) from the mean, for each method. Bland-Altman plots with 95% limited agreement (or two SD confidence interval [CI]) were also included to illustrate the agreement between methods.\n63\nNon-normally distributed data were log transformed to meet assumptions for the Bland-Altman plot and ICC, and analyses including Scheltens ratings data were converted to z-scores because of differing metrics (i.e., ratings, volumes).\nTo assess the clinical application of the WM methods, a standard error of the mean (SEM) model was used to assess the association between all WM methods and processing speed. An SEM model comparison was preferred over multiple individual regression analyses to reduce Type 1 error. The maximum likelihood estimate was used to account for missing data. Data were converted to z-scores, and a Benjamini-Hochberg test was used to correct for Type 1 error, with a false discovery rate of 0.05.\n64\nDescriptive statistics were analyzed and reported as means with SDs, or percent as appropriate. A\nt\ntest was used to assess differences between injury severity groups. Correlations, ICC, and SEM were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 24.0.0.0 on an Apple Macintosh computer with OS X \u201cYosemite\u201d 10.10.5 operating system. Bland-Altman plots were created using the batplot command program in STATA 14.2 using a PC computer with Windows 10, version 1703."

    "Methods": "Participants\nData for these analyses were collected as part of an independent Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium (CENC) study (Study 34) investigating functional and neurobiological outcomes to combat veterans of experiencing a blast or explosion in Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, and New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND). Veterans were initially screened by telephone and then completed an in-person assessment visit for full characterization and confirmation of reported eligibility status before being enrolled in a subsequent imaging visit. Data used in the present analyses were collected at the assessment visit. Informed consent was obtained prior to all study activities. All study procedures were approved by the local institutional review board.\nEligibility criteria for the assessment visit included at least one OEF/OIF/OND deployment that involved combat exposure (defined as any positive response [a score of >17] on the Deployment Risk and Resiliency Inventory-2, Module D\n10\n); English fluency; being \u226518 years of age; having the ability to complete study tasks; and having the ability to provide informed consent. Exclusion criteria were a history of moderate or severe TBI; any penetrating brain injury; and presence of neurological disorder, severe mental illness, dementia, current substance abuse, or psychotic symptoms. Because this study involved neuroimaging, participants were additionally excluded if they were pregnant or unable to participate in imaging because of an inability to tolerate being in an enclosed space for brain imaging or the presence of ferrous metal other than fillings, including orthodonture or implanted objects known to generate magnetic fields (e.g., prosthetic devices, pacemakers, neurostimulators).\n\nMMA-TBI interview\nThe MMA-TBI is a semistructured interview providing a comprehensive evaluation of potentially concussive events across the lifespan. The MMA-TBI gathers information for each event, to provide a determination regarding the presence or absence of TBI according to the VA/DoD CPG.\n9\n,\n11\nThe MMA-TBI begins with screening questions to ascertain the presence of any potentially concussive events at any point in the life of the interviewee (see\nAppendix 1\n; text in italics are instructions or reminders and normal text in quotes are what is asked by the interviewer.). Each potentially concussive event is further evaluated using a standard process (see\nAppendix 2\n). First, individuals are asked to provide a narrative description of the event and any effects on functioning. If possible, interviewers make ratings of specific criteria (e.g., loss of consciousness [LOC], alteration of consciousness [AOC]) based on provided information. Structured follow-up questions are then asked to obtain any additional information necessary to complete ratings for all criteria. All potentially concussive events across the lifespan are queried, including the mechanism (e.g., blunt force, blast, acceleration-deceleration) and context (e.g., during military service, during deployment), as well as information on the key VA/DoD CPG for determining the diagnosis of TBI including the presence and duration of LOC, post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), and AOC. Structural neuroimaging and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) results are included in the VA/DoD CPG but are typically unavailable when evaluating TBI in the chronic state, and were not included as criteria evaluated by the MMA-TBI. The presence and duration of post-concussive symptoms (e.g., headache, vision changes, balance problems) immediately following the injury are also evaluated.\nEvaluating potentially concussive events across the lifespan may become problematic when an individual has experienced a particularly high number of events. The MMA-TBI addresses this by characterizing multiple similar events with a single representative\nmultiple exposure rating\n. For example, an individual who routinely participates in boxing matches likely has had many potentially concussive events of a similar nature and outcome. The multiple exposure rating captures details representing a typical event, which can then be applied across all similar events. This process significantly reduces the amount of time required to capture information about many highly similar and repetitive events. For the current study, this process was not used for events involving LOC (i.e., all events involving LOC are evaluated individually, not as part of a multiple exposure rating). Inclusion of this mechanism requires additional training to ensure that this process is applied consistently and accurately across interviewers.\n\nAlgorithm\nAn algorithm was developed to determine whether an event resulted in a TBI as defined by the VA/DoD CPG\n9\n(page 8, Table A-1 in the VA/DoD CPG). These criteria include: (1) any period of LOC, (2) any period of decreased level of consciousness, (3) any alteration in mental state at time of injury (e.g., confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking, AOC), and (4) any period of PTA. The algorithm also provides a determination of TBI severity (mild, moderate, or severe) using the duration of each symptom based on the VA/DoD CPG. The results of this algorithm are used as the outcome variable for the MMA-TBI for all analyses.\n\nEstablishing validity of the MMA-TBI\nClinical TBI evaluations\nValidity was evaluated by comparing results of the MMA-TBI with an independent clinical assessment by a TBI expert. The VA conducts specialized clinical evaluations of individuals who screen positive for a history of TBI and are currently experiencing associated symptoms. These evaluations are typically conducted by a physician or mid-level provider. These evaluations follow a national template for specific data points that are reported, in addition to a full clinical evaluation. Medical records of all study participants were reviewed to determine if such an evaluation had occurred, and if so, if it concluded that the individual had experienced a TBI. The MMA-TBI is the first TBI interview to compare results with\nindependent\nclinical assessments.\nPotentially concussive events for comparison\nFrom all reported potentially concussive events across the 342 participants who completed the interview visit, 64 potentially concussive events were selected by J.A.R. for review by four raters (R.D.S., H.M.M., R.A.H., J.R.B.) and comparison with the OSU-TBI-ID. No rater was involved in obtaining the data used in the current analyses. Events were selected in the order in which the data were obtained, allowing more than one event to be selected per participant. Events were selected to be balanced across outcome (TBI or no TBI according to VA/DoD CPG determined by J.A.R.) as well as those occurring during deployment or outside of deployment.\nOSU-TBI-ID\nOutcomes of the MMA-TBI were compared with those of the OSU-TBI-ID following methods used by Fortier and coworkers to develop the BAT-L.\n8\nThe OSU-TBI-ID is a semistructured interview evaluating TBI and was the first interview considered to be a validated method of assessing TBI.\n4\nFortier and coworkers used information obtained during the BAT-L interview to complete the OSU-TBI-ID and calculate a summary score. BAT-L outcomes were converted to a comparable scale for analyses, and inter-rater agreement between the two summary scores was calculated. The same method was applied to the MMA-TBI. Using the rating scales presented by Fortier and coworkers, a study team member was provided with information obtained from the interview for the 64 potentially concussive events (described previously), including the case report forms and notes. Diagnostic conclusions from the interview were not provided. This information was used to calculate the OSU-TBI-ID summary score. The MMA-TBI outcomes were converted to a comparable scale using the criteria presented in Fortier and coworkers with one exception. The criteria presented by Fortier and coworkers for the BAT-L do not allow classification of events with LOC of <5\u2009min. Therefore, the criterion for a rating of 3 was amended from LOC between 5 and 30\u2009min to LOC present for <30\u2009min.\nClinician ratings\nFollowing methods used by Walker and coworkers\n5\nin the development of the VCI-rCDI, an independent review and interpretation of interview data was conducted by a panel of expert clinicians. Clinician raters were diverse and included two board-certified neuropsychologists (H.M.M, R.D.S.) with 6 and 7 years of TBI experience respectively, a board-certified behavioral neurologist (J.R.B.) with 6 years of TBI experience, and a board-certified neuropsychiatrist (R.A.H.] with >25 years of TBI experience. Each rater was provided with information obtained from the 64 potentially concussive events (described previously), including the case report forms and notes. Diagnostic conclusions from the interview were not provided to raters. Raters were instructed to make two determinations. First, \u201cis this event consistent with a TBI based on the provided VA/DoD CPG?\u201d Second, \u201cis this event consistent with a TBI based on your own clinical judgment?\u201d Each rater was provided a separate data file, and raters were blind to responses from other raters as well as to the algorithm classification.\n\nStatistical analysins\nAnalyses were conducted using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Validity was first assessed by comparing outcomes of the clinical TBI evaluation and the MMA-TBI. Correspondence between a positive clinical TBI evaluation and the MMA-TBI results was calculated. Positive TBI evaluations were selected because the time frame of these evaluations can fluctuate, sometimes reporting only deployment and military events. Therefore, when the clinical evaluation is positive, it is certain that a TBI occurred at some point in the participant's lifetime. However, when the clinical evaluation is negative, it remains possible that a TBI occurred at some point in the individual's life outside of the time frame on which the evaluation focused. It was not possible to contact the evaluating providers for the clinical TBI evaluations to obtain insight into their diagnostic process, as the providers in these positions change over time.\nNext, validity was assessed by comparing the MMA-TBI and OSU-TBI-ID summary scores. Following the methods Fortier and coworkers used for the BAT-L, the Cohen kappa and Kendall tau coefficients were calculated between these summary scores.\nFinally, reliability and validity of the MMA-TBI algorithm was assessed by calculating simple kappa statistics among raters and the algorithm. Kappa was calculated among raters' clinical judgment and the MMA-TBI algorithm, and then among raters' criteria rating (applying the VA/DoD CPG) and the algorithm. Chi-square analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of context on outcomes. For each rater, that person's rating (TBI present/absent) was contrasted against the context of the event (deployment/non-deployment)."

    "Methods": "Cohort\nOver 300 patients have been referred to the Genomics Research Centre (GRC) Diagnostic Clinic for HM diagnostic testing. Twenty-four patients reported episodes of confusional migraine, and other concussion-related symptoms after mild head trauma including loss of consciousness, seizure, amnesia and/or edema noted in their clinical descriptions. Although their presentation was heterogeneous, all individuals were identified to have head trauma or injury prior to the onset of their neurological symptoms. The 24 suspected case patients also had relevant symptoms as described in the International Headache Society (IHS) criteria for HM.\nAs reported in Maksemous and colleagues,\n7\n8 of the 24 case patients presenting with concussion-related symptoms had likely pathogenic variants in\nATP1A2\n.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) libraries for WES were constructed using Ion AmpliSeq\nTM\nExome RDY Library Kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The Ion Chef was used to load sample libraries (barcoded fragments of 200 base pairs [bp]) onto P1 chips using Ion P1\nTM\nHi-Q TM Chef Kit protocols. WES was performed on the Ion Proton (Thermo Fisher Scientific) instrument using default settings for Ion AmpliSeq Exome RDY - IC Kit 4x2.\n\nStatistical analysis\nFollowing WES, the Ion Torrent Server was used to generate quality metrics, align reads to the Human Genome 19 (hg19), and the Ion Torrent Variant Caller (TVC) was used to call sequence variants. Whole exomes of the 16 patients negative for HM gene mutations were analyzed for genes implicated in known head-trauma-related conditions, followed by analysis, then all genes related to ion channels, or neuronal functions. Ion Reporter software (version 5.2) was used to explore and filter variants based on minor allele frequency (MAF), gene ontology, and functional scores. A summary of the filtering process and the corresponding genes and variant numbers is provided in\nFigure 1\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nVariant filtering pipeline to explore relevant variants in patients with severe reaction in trivial head trauma (\nn\n=\u200916) using Ion Reporter software.\nIn silico\nprediction tools were then used to investigate the pathogenicity of the mutations. Two sets of tools were used, training-based algorithms (PolyPhen-2 and Mutation Taster) and non-training-based algorithms (SIFT and Mutation Assessor), to avoid results based solely on machine learning tools, which are prone to over-fitting.\n27\n,\n28\nMutation Assessor, an\nin silico\nprediction tool based on protein function, was used to explore the potential impact of amino acid (AA) changes on protein structure. Mutation Assessor produces functional impact scores (FI), wherein scores below 0.8 have a neutral impact, scores between 0.8 and 1.9 have a low impact, scores between 1.9 and 3.5 have a medium impact, and scores higher than 3.5 have a high impact.\n29\nPredictSNP is a suitable tool for assessing the potential pathogenicity of variants, as it compiles the data of 8 of the top established prediction models and metrics (MAPP, nsSNPAnalyzer, PANTHER, PhD-SNP, PolyPhen-1, PolyPhen-2, SIFT, and SNAP\n30\n) to produce a percentage of predicted deleterious effect or non-pathogenicity as an average of all the tool prediction scores. Whereas PredictSNP incorporates PolyPhen as part of the prediction matrix, the PolyPhen total score is more relevant to this analysis. Consequently, using PolyPhen as a complementary score to SIFT in the first step through Ion Reporter is a stand-alone\na priori\nfiltering process that is not related to the overall score of PredictSNP. Mutation Taster, which predicts how potentially disease-causing a variant is,\n31\nwas used in conjunction with PredictSNP to establish a more detailed understanding of the effects of certain mutations identified as AA sequence changes, frame shifts, and splice sites.\nAll reported mutations were confirmed via Sanger Sequencing. Variant relevance was determined based on: 1) biological relevance, such as the expression of the gene in the brain, as determined by the National Center for Biotechnology Information [NCBI] gene database; 2) the limited number of individuals with the variant in other databases such as dbSNP and gnomAD; 3) existing evidence of the involvement of the variant or the gene in a relevant neurological disorder or pathology; and 4) evidence of involvement of the gene in a relevant biological process (i.e., response to concussion or neuroprotective factors).\nTo increase the robustness of the analysis, the 16 exomes were analyzed using the in-house variant browser pipeline, VCF-DART.\n32\nThe pipeline utilizes predetermined gene tiers (see\nSupplementary Appendix S1\n) as well as scores from various\nin silico\nprediction tools to filter variants of interest. The genes in those tiers were selected from established genetic diagnostic tests for several neurological disorders, with the last tier showing all variants that are not present in previous tiers, thus reducing the likelihood of missing any relevant variants in genes not selected in the tiers. Further, the analysis was conducted with other neurological exomes analyzed from epilepsy, CADASIL syndrome, and mTBI patients with no severe responses to trivial head trauma."

    "Methods": "Participants\nParticipants were recruited for a prospective study of clinical recovery from SRC funded by the United States Department of Defense. American football athletes from four high schools and four colleges in southeastern Wisconsin were enrolled for this study between June 2015 and December 2017. Written informed consent was obtained from all adult athletes and parents of minor athletes prior to their first evaluation; minor participants completed assent. All testing procedures were approved by the institutional review board at the Medical College of Wisconsin.\nA total of 1174 athletes were enrolled at pre-season baseline, and completed clinical assessments; 106 of those subjects sustained concussion and were scanned within the first 48\u2009h (32.47\u2009\u00b1\u200914.19\u2009h), and then at 8 days (8.20\u2009\u00b1\u20090.98 days), 15 days (15.42\u2009\u00b1\u20091.35 days), and 45 days (45.56\u2009\u00b1\u20093.77 days) after injury; 91 control subjects were matched on demographics and baseline neurocognitive test performance and were scanned and assessed at similar time points.\n33\n,\n34\nTen data sets from the concussed group and nine data sets from the control group were discarded after failing image quality controls, leaving a total of 96 athletes with SRC and 82 matched controls. Chi-square tests did not show a significant difference between the SRC and control groups in exclusions caused by subpar image quality (the \u03c7\n2\nstatistic is 0.39,\np\n=\u20090.53). Reason to exclude a data set were either too much head motion, operator error, equipment failure (e.g. radiofrequency [RF] coil channel failure), or a similar problem. Demographic information is shown in\nTable 1\n. Clinical diagnosis of concussion was determined by certified athletic trainers or team physicians trained in sports medicine at each institution; all injuries were screened to ensure compliance with study definition and requirements. The definition of concussion proposed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention HEADS UP educational initiative was used in this study: \u201cAn injury resulting from a forceful bum, blow or jolt to the head that results in rapid movement of the head and causes a change in the athlete's behavior, thinking, physical functioning, or the following symptoms: headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness/balance problems, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, drowsiness, sensitivity to light/noise, blurred vision, memory difficulty, and difficulty concentrating\u201d (\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/headsup/basics/concussion_whatis.html\n). Participants were excluded from the parent study if their additional injuries precluded participation in study procedure, or if they reported their injuries outside the 48-h window, had a current diagnosis of psychotic disorder, had been using prescribed narcotics prior to injury, or had a history of moderate or severe TBI or other medical conditions known to cause cognitive dysfunction (e.g., epilepsy, stroke). Participants were also excluded from the current study if they were not cleared to undergo an MRI scan (e.g. claustrophobia, metal implant).\nTable 1.\nParticipant Characteristics\nConcussed\nControl\n(\nn\n=\u200996)\n(\nn\n=\u200982)\nmean (SD)\nmean (SD)\np\nDemographics\nAge (years)\n18.06 (1.5)\n18.37 (1.7)\n0.24\nRace (\nn\n, %)\nWhite\n74(77%)\n63(76.8%)\nBlack\n20(20.8%)\n18(21.9%)\nAmerican Indian/Alaska Native\n2(2%)\n1(1.2%)\nHeight (in.)\n71.7 (2.77)\n71.02 (2.4)\n0.08\nWeight (lb.)\n217.6 (50.8)\n206.4 (41.5)\n0.11\nADHD diagnosis (\nn\n, %)\n9 (9.4%)\n6 (7.3%)\n0.62\na\nLearning disability (\nn,\n%)\n2 (2.1%)\n0.0 (0.0%)\n0.19\na\nHousehold SES\nb\n46.29 (11.1)\n45.63 (11.05)\n0.69\nTotal number of previous concussions\nc\n102\n59\n0.067\nAcute injury characteristics\nLoss of consciousness\n2 (2.1%)\n-\nPost-traumatic amnesia\n15 (15.6%)\n-\nRetrograde amnesia\n4 (4.2%)\n-\nOpen in a separate window\na\nApproximate significance using Cramer's V.\nb\nHollingshead SES score.\nc\nHistory of previous concussions reported by the players.\nSD, standard deviation; ADHD, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; SES, socioeconomic status.\n\nBaseline and post-injury clinical assessments\nThe clinical battery included the SCAT3, which evaluates somatic, cognitive, and emotional post-concussive symptoms,\n32\nthe Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC) as a cognitive screener,\n35\n,\n36\nand the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) to assess postural stability.\n37\u201339\nAll clinical assessments were administered before the season to establish a baseline, and then they were repeated in each follow-up visit. The number of symptomatic days and the length of RTP was also recorded at each follow-up visit.\n\nMRI acquisition\nAll participants were scanned on a GE MR750 whole body 3T MRI scanner (Waukesha, WI) equipped with a 32-channel head coil. Diffusion weighted images for DKI were obtained using a single-shot spin-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with 3\u2009mm isotropic voxels and b-values of 1000\u2009s/mm\n2\nand 2000\u2009s/mm\n2\n, with 30 diffusion directions for each b-value. The DKI acquisitions covered the whole brain, with an acquisition time of 5\u2009min 30\u2009sec. An additional non-diffusion weighted spin-echo EPI scan was acquired with the phase encode polarity reversed to correct for distortions caused by tissue magnetic susceptibility variations using post-processing software tools.\n\nProcessing of DKI data\nEach diffusion weighted image set was visually inspected for artifacts before any processing was applied. Data sets that cleared quality inspection were further processed using an established pre-processing pipeline. First, spatial distortions caused by magnetic susceptibility variations were corrected using the TOPUP function\n40\nof the FSL software (version 6.0.0,\nhttp://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/\n). Motion- and eddy current-related distortions were corrected using the EDDY function of FSL.\n41\nAfter the pre-processing, images were inspected again to ensure that the processing did not introduce artifacts or distortions.\nDiffusion and kurtosis tensors were estimated using DKE software (\nhttps://www.nitrc.org/projects/dke/\n)\n26\n,\n27\nto derive maps of kurtosis fractional anisotropy (KFA), mean kurtosis (MK), and radial and axial kurtosis (K\nrad\nand K\nax\n, respectively). Similarly, maps of FA, MD, and radial and axial diffusivity (D\nrad\n, and D\nax\n) were calculated from the diffusion tensor estimation. The\nrobust\noption was used, which detects and removes outliers using an iterative algorithm during the model fitting.\n42\nA sample set of diffusion tensor and kurtosis maps from one of the participants is shown in\nFigure 1\n. The test\u2013retest reliability of DKI maps was investigated at the beginning of our concussion studies using the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC)\n43\non repeated scans from control subjects. Average CCC was 0.91 for MD, 0.86 for K\nrad\n, and 0.85 for K\nax\nin non-skeletonized DKI maps.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSample diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) parameter maps from one of the participants.\nA tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) approach\n44\nwas used for analysis of group differences in major WM tracts. Pre-processing of DKI data for TBSS began with registering each subject's FA map to the FMRIB58_FA template (standard space FA map) using linear and non-linear transformations. Then, a WM skeleton was generated for the group. The local FA value was projected onto the skeleton. A threshold of FA >0.2 was applied to include all major WM tracts and exclude superficial WM and gray matter. The skeletonization was repeated for each of the other DTI and DKI metrics.\n\nStatistical analysis\nDemographic and clinical data\nGroup differences in demographic and clinical data were determined using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, version 24.0). Linear mixed effects models with visit as within-subject variable, group as between-subject factor, the group-by-visit interaction, and age and prior concussion included as covariates were used to determine changes in clinical measures across visits. Student's\nt\ntests were used for comparing group differences in demographic data while \u03c7\n2\ntests were used to examine group differences in categorical variables.\nTBSS of the WM tracts\nGroup differences in major WM tracts were tested using the general linear model (GLM) analysis on skeletonized DKI maps obtained from the TBSS approach. Randomise function in FSL, which employs a non-parametric approach to evaluate the GLM using a large number of random permutations among groups to identify statistically significant effects, was used for voxelwise statistical tests.\n45\n,\n46\nRandomise was run with 2000 permutations and the threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) option.\n47\nEach statistical test was corrected for multiple comparisons using a familywise error (FWE) rate, and results were thresholded using\np\n<\u20090.05.\nGroup differences in each of the DTI and DKI metrics were compared at each time point. The concussed group had a higher number of prior concussions (\nTable 1\n) than the control group, and the number of prior concussions was included as a covariate. Likewise, although age was not different between groups, it was included as a covariate in all analyses, because age-dependent changes in diffusion MRI measures are well established.\n48\u201352\nVoxel-based analysis (VBA) of the whole brain\nA whole brain VBA was also conducted on each of the diffusion maps. Because TBSS excludes peripheral WM and gray matter regions, VBA was performed to complement the skeletonized WM analysis with TBSS. The spatially registered parameter maps were compared at a group level using the same GLM model and statistical comparisons using the prior TBSS description, including 1000 iterations and TFCE option. The images were smoothed with 3\u2009mm Gaussian kernel prior to analysis.\nRegion of interest (ROI) data\nAn ROI analysis was used for a subsequent investigation of the effects of time. ROIs were derived from the statistically significant TBSS group effects, which emerged for K\nax\n, K\nrad\n, and KFA. ROIs were created from the largest cluster of voxels with statistically significant group differences, using K\nax\nat the 48-h time point and K\nrad\nand KFA from the day-15 time point, because these time points showed the largest respective group effects. The mean values of each DKI metric for each subject were extracted and used for additional analysis. Linear mixed effects models with visit as within-subject variable, group as between-subject factor, the group-by-visit interaction, and age and prior concussion included as covariates were used to determine changes in metrics across visits. SPSS software version 24 (Armonk, NY USA) was used for the ROI statistics. Post-hoc tests were corrected for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction."

    "Methods": "Experimental ethics\nAll experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Studies Ethical Committee at the Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine (reference no.: 17-0066). All procedures used in the present study were performed in accordance with the Institutional Guidelines for Animal Experimentation and the Guidelines for Proper Conduct of Animal Experiments of the Science Council of Japan.\n\nExperimental animals\nWild-type 8- to 10-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats (CLEA Japan, Inc., Tokyo, Japan), weighing 250\u2013300\u2009g, were used in this study. Female rats were used for better urination management after the SCI. Animals were housed in a controlled environment (25\u00b0C, 50% humidity, and 12-h light-dark cycle) and were allowed free access to food and water. All experimental animals were randomly divided into vehicle-treated (\nn\n=\u200915) and FTY720-treated (1.5\u2009mg/kg;\nn\n=\u200915) groups.\n\nSpinal cord injury model\nThoracic SCI was induced by a 1-min compression using a modified aneurysm clip, which was designed by the authors and manufacturers (Mizuho, Tokyo, Japan) as previously reported, with a slight modification.\n14\u201316\nThe face of the clip blade was smoothened to apply equal pressure on the spinal cord, and the closing force was set to 30\u2009g. Rats were anesthetized using isoflurane at an initial and maintenance concentration of 4.0% and 2.0%, respectively, in 70% N\n2\nO and 30% O\n2\ngas through a facial mask. Rats were placed in the prone position, and using the T2 spinous process as a landmark, laminectomy was performed at the T6 and T7 vertebral segments. The aneurysm clip was then applied extradurally to fully compress the spinal cord at the T6 level for 1\u2009min. After closing the skin, the animals were allowed to recover on heated towels until they were fully awake. Rats with a relatively low motor deficit (Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan [BBB] score of <7) 24\u2009h after the insult were excluded from the subsequent studies. Bladders were manually pressed for urination three times daily until spontaneous reflexive bladder control was regained.\n17\n\nAdministration of FTY720\nFTY720 or saline (vehicle) was injected intraperitoneally 24\u2009h after the SCI. Rats in the FTY720 group received 1.5\u2009mg/kg of FTY720 (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) diluted in saline, whereas the control group received the same volume of plain saline.\n\nNeurological score\nAll neurological assessments were performed in a blinded fashion by two independent observers on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 post-injury. The von Frey monofilament test (Touch Test Sensory Evaluator Kit; Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL) was performed to evaluate mechanical allodynia as previously reported.\n18\n,\n19\nBriefly, rats were placed on a rubber mat, and a set of von Frey hair was used to test the cutaneous pain threshold in response to graded mechanical pressure, ranging from 0.02 to 300\u2009g, on the dorsal surface of the trunk, mainly at the base of the tail. Only stimuli that induced consistent behavior of avoidance and vocalization over a relatively large skin area were considered as the withdrawal thresholds. A single trial consisted of 12 applications of the von Frey filament, applied once every 2\u20133\u2009sec.\nThe BBB (hindlimb locomotor test) score was used to evaluate the neurological motor deficits as previously reported.\n15\n,\n18\u201320\nHindlimb locomotor function was evaluated separately for 5\u2009min in the open field, and values were averaged to obtain individual scores. All data from animals that died during the evaluation period were excluded from the analysis.\n\nEvaluation of blood lymphocytes\nFlow cytometry using fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) was performed on the third day after the SCI to assess systemic inflammation by counting lymphocytes in the peripheral blood during the acute phase of the injury, as previously described.\n21\nApproximately 30 \u03bcL of peripheral blood was collected on the third day of injury from the tail vein, and erythrocytes were lysed using RBC lysis buffer (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Using flow cytometry (FACS Canto; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), dead cells were excluded based on 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole positivity (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan). Next, CD3 positive T cells were identified using an anti-CD3 (PE anti-rat CD3 antibody; BioLegend, San Diego, CA) antibody, and their proportion in the peripheral blood was measured.\n\nEvaluation of the spinal cord injury lesion volume\nThe volume of the SCI-induced lesion was evaluated 42 days after the SCI using hematoxylin eosin (HE) and Luxol fast blue (LFB) staining for the detection of neuronal cells and myelin, respectively.\n15\n,\n22\nRats were deeply anesthetized using 4.0% isoflurane in N\n2\nO/O\n2\n(70:30) to prevent pain and discomfort at the time of euthanization. Animals were perfused transcardially with 50\u2009mL of physiological saline, followed by 150\u2009mL of 4% paraformaldehyde. The thoracic spinal cord (T2\u2013T11) was removed, post-fixed in the same fixative overnight, and immersed in 20% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline at 4\u00b0C for 2\u20133 days. The blocks were then embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (Tissue-Tek; Sakura Finetechnical Co., Tokyo, Japan), and 10-\u03bcm-thick sagittal sections or 4-\u03bcm-thick transverse sections were mounted onto poly-\nl\n-lysine-coated slides (Matsunami, Tokyo, Japan) for subsequent immunostaining.\nLength and volume of the lesions were calculated by the method described previously.\n15\n,\n22\n,\n23\nBriefly, a sagittal section of the spinal cord was used to calculate the lesion length. The distance from the epicenter of the lesion to the most rostral and caudal points determined by the absence of LFB staining was semiautomatically calculated using a BZ-X analyzer (Keyence, Osaka, Japan). Lesion volume was estimated by adding the area of damage from multiple sections determined using LFB staining and calculated using the following equation\n23\n: Lesion volume (mm\n2\n)\u2009=\u2009\u03c0D\n2\n(H1\u2009+\u2009H2)/6, where H1 is the lesion length from the epicenter to the rostral end, H2 is the lesion length from the epicenter to the caudal end, and D is the diameter of the epicenter.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nInflammation and blood\u2013brain barrier integrity were evaluated 7 days after the SCI (\nn\n=\u20095 for each evaluation). Ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) and CD68 expression were evaluated to assess neuroinflammation. Sections were treated for 1\u2009h at room temperature with anti-Iba1 (1:1500, 019-19741; Wako Co., Tokyo, Japan) and anti-CD68 (1:1000, MCA341GA; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) antibodies. After the first antibody incubation, sections were treated with the Histofine\n\u00ae\nSimple StainTM Rat MAX PO (Nichirei Biosciences Inc., Tokyo, Japan) for 1\u2009h. The 3,3\u2019-diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen of the DAB substitute kit (Nichirei Biosciences) was applied for 10\u201330\u2009sec to obtain a chromogenic signal in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Images of the peri-damaged lesions 5\u2009mm caudal and 5\u2009mm rostral from the epicenter of the lesion were obtained. Five non-overlapping lesions were randomly selected, and positive cells were semiquantitatively counted using an automated cell counter (BZ-X Analyzer; Keyence).\nBlood\u2013brain barrier integrity was quantitatively assessed by evaluating the fibrin leakage around blood vessels as described previously.\n24\u201326\nA transverse section 5\u2009mm caudal from the lesion core was used for the evaluation, and five blood vessels of approximately 50\u2009\u03bcm in diameter were randomly selected near the center of the section. Fibrinogen leakage around the selected blood vessels was measured using antifibrinogen gamma chain (1:100; Proteintech Group Inc, Rosemont, IL), followed by DAB staining. The area of fibrinogen leakage was then evaluated using an automated area counter (BZ-X Analyzer; Keyence).\nPost-traumatic glial scar formation was evaluated based on the expression of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Using an anti-GFAP antibody (dilution 1:200; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ), GFAP expression was assessed in sagittal sections. Sensory-related synapse and neurons were evaluated using the anti-\u03bc opioid receptor (MOR)\n27\n(dilution 1:200; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), antihydroxytryptamine transporter (HTT),\n28\nand anticalcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP; C8198; dilution, 1:8000; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) antibodies, as previously reported. Areas of MOR-, HTT-, and CGRP-positive cells in the spinal dorsal horn 1\u2009mm rostral and caudal from the epicenter of the injury were semiautomatically counted in a transverse section.\n29\n\nQuantification of the labeled dorsal corticospinal tract\nTo trace the dorsal corticospinal tract (dCST), animals (3 each from both groups) were anesthetized 42 days after the SCI, as described above. They were fixed in a stereotactic apparatus (Model DKI-900; David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA), and the midline incision wound was reopened. The needle of a 10-\u03bcL Hamilton syringe was positioned 10\u2009mm rostral to the center of injury and inserted 1.5\u2009mm into the spinal cord from the surface of the dura mater. Fluoro-Ruby (FR; 2 \u03bcL; 10,000 molecular weight, D-1817; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), a fluorescent axonal tracer, was injected into the spinal cord 0.5\u2009mm lateral to the midline on both sides over a period of 3\u2009min, using an automatic microinjection pump (Model KDS-310; Muromachi Kikai Co., Tokyo, Japan), as previously reported.\n30\nThe needle was left in place for 3\u2009min and then withdrawn slowly to minimize leakage of the tracer. After the injection, the wound was closed, and animals were housed.\nTo visualize the residual dCST axons, rats were euthanized 5 days after the FR injection, and transverse sections of the spinal cord 10\u2009mm caudal from the injury site were observed. Given that the dCST is known to exist within the ventral one-third of the dorsal funiculus in rats, the number of FR-labeled axons in this area was counted bilaterally.\n30\n,\n31\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll the data were collected and analyzed by investigators in a blinded manner. The data have been presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation. All statistical analyses were performed using JMP Pro software (version 14; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Differences between the two groups were compared using an unpaired\nt\n-test or the Mann Whitney U test, and\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Mouse primary neural cell culture\nMouse primary neural cultures were prepared by using fetal brains obtained from wild type (WT; C57BL/6) mice and GMF-KO (C57BL/6) mice as described previously.\n16\n,\n17\nBrain tissues were harvested and the cells were isolated and used to grow\nin vitro\nmixed cell culture that contains astrocytes, microglia, and neurons. Briefly, brain tissues were obtained from E16 mouse brain. Cells were dissociated by the enzymatic digestion method using a 0.25% trypsin/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution. These mixed neural cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Thermo Scientific),1% 1 penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco Thermo Scientific), 2\u2009mM L-glutamine (Gibco Thermo Scientific), at 37\u00b0C in humidified 5% CO\n2\nand 95% air. Cultures (0.3\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 cells/well) were grown on the top of the poly-D-lysine\u2013coated cover glass (Millipore, Billerica, MA) in six-well tissue culture plates for 2 weeks.\n18\nThese cell cultures represent a mixed neural and glial population based upon morphological observation under a microscope. Cultures prepared according to this culture condition were found to contain 54% neurons and 46% glial cells at maturity as determined by immunofluorescence staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; astrocytes), ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA1; microglia), and microtubule associated protein (MAP2; neurons). The mice used in this study were maintained and the experiments were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines approved by the Animal Care and Use Committees at the University of Missouri (Columbia, MO).\n\nIn vitro\nmodel of traumatic brain injury\nAn\nin vitro\nscratch mixed cellular culture injury model was used in this study. Cellular Injury was induced using 22 size scalpel blade cuts (20-20 times) in differentiated mixed culture 10 times perpendicularly in either direction approximately 2\u2009mm apart as described previously.\n19\nThe scratch model produces an injury in the cells that is clearly separated from the surrounding uninjured cells in the cell culture. Injured cultures and uninjured control cultures were then incubated for 24, 48, and 72\u2009h at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO\n2\nin humidified air. The medium was collected from both the WT and GMF-KO injured cultures at different time-points, centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 10\u2009min at 10,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g to remove any cells and debris, and stored at -80\u00b0C until analyzed. The adherent cells were mechanically removed with a cell lifter and saved separately in low bind Eppendorf tubes after removal of any remaining liquid by centrifugation in 4\u00b0C for 10\u2009min at 10,000\u2009g.\n\nLactate dehydrogenase release assay\nThe amount of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released into the culture medium after the cellular injury was analyzed based on the conversion of a tetrazolium salt into red formazan product according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI; Cat No. 601170). Briefly, cells were subjected to scalpel injury and the effect of treatment on cells was examined by assaying LDH release at different time-points (i.e., 0, 24, 48, and 72\u2009h following scratch injury). The absorbance that is proportional to the number of lysed cells was measured at 490\u2009nm. The blank LDH levels were subtracted from the cellular injury LDH values, and results were expressed as pg/mL. The amount of LDH released by the cells in the presence of 1% Triton X100 was considered as maximal LDH release absorbance.\n20\nThe results were expressed as % cytotoxicity.\n\nGlutathione assay\nGlutathione (GSH) levels were measured in the cell culture medium by using GSH assay kit (Cat No. 703002; Cayman chemical), according to the manufacturer's instruction. The level of GSH was calculated as \u03bcmol DTNB conjugate formed/mg protein using a molar extinction coefficient of 13.6 10\n3\nM\n-\n1\u2009cm\n-\n1 and the results were expressed picomoles of GSH per milligram of protein.\n\nGlutathione peroxidase assay\nThe total activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was measured in the supernatant of cell culture media by using the GPx assay kit (Cat No. 703102; Cayman chemical), as per manufacturer's instructions. GPx catalyzes the reduction of hydroperoxides by reduced glutathione and its activity is determined indirectly with a couple reaction with glutathione reductase in the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). The oxidation of NADPH to NADP\n+\n, followed as a rate of reduction in absorbance at 340\u2009nm (A340) is proportional to the GPX activity. The total activity of GPx is defined as the amount of GPx required to oxidize one mmol of NADPH/min/mg of protein.\n\nNitric oxide assay\nAfter mechanical scratch injury for 0\u2009h, 24\u2009h, 48\u2009h, and 72\u2009h, the accumulation of nitrite in the culture medium was measured as an indicator of nitric oxide (NO) production.\n21\nThe aforementioned cell culture medium-supernatant media also were used to measure the levels of NO. The level of NO was determined colorimetrically using the Griess reagent in a NO assay kit (Cat No. 780001; Cayman Chemical) and calculated as per the manufacturer's instructions. Fresh cell culture medium was used as a blank in every experiment and assayed at 540-550\u2009nm. The total nitrite/nitrate concentrations were calculated as nitrite + nitrate (\u03bcM)\u2009=\u2009(NO) in medium and given as micromolar (\u03bcM) concentrations (means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean. Nitrite/nitrate linear standard curves were determined by triple determinations (\nn\n=\u20093).\n\nProstaglandin E2 assay\nThe mixed cultures were subjected to mechanical injury by the scalpel CUTS. The media were removed from the cultures at 0, 24, 48, and 72\u2009h after the injury was used to measure the level of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection kit (Cat No. 514010; Cayman Chemical) that uses a PGE2-specific monoclonal antibody and calculated as per the manufacturer's instructions. Fresh cell culture medium was used as a blank in every experiment and assayed at 405-420\u2009nm and the amount of PGE2 was expressed as picogram/ml of cell culture supernatant.\n\nImmunofluorescence and confocal microscopy\nThe immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy were performed as we described before.\n17\n,\n22-24\nThe mixed neuronal cells were seeded on Poly-D-Lysine pre-coated glass coverslips (Millipore, Billerica, MA). After the mechanical injury with scalpel, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1\u2009h and permeabilized by incubation in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/ 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15\u2009min. Following three times wash in PBS, blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 30\u2009min and finally incubated for 2\u2009h at room temperature with primary antibody Iba1 (1:500 dilution; Cat No. ab5076, Abcam, Inc), GFAP (1:500 dilution; Cat No. ab7260, Abcam, Inc), MAP2 (1:500 dilution; Cat No. ab32454, Abcam, Inc.), ERM (1:250 dilution; Cat No. 3142, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), phosphorylated ezrin/radixin/moesin (pERM)1:250 dilution; Cat No. 3726, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and 8-hydroxydeguanosine (8-OHdG; 1:200 dilution; Cat No. CAS 75899-68-2, Santa Cruz Biotech, Inc.).\nThen, cells were incubated with appropriate secondary anti-rabbit and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (Cat No. A-11001, ThermoFisher Scientific) and Alexa Fluor 568 (Cat No. A-11011, ThermoFisher Scientific) for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Finally, the cover-slips, VECTASHIELD with Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories), were mounted with Vinol (Sigma) onto microscope slides. Confocal imaging was performed on a Leica TCP SP8 laser scanning confocal microscope using a 63\u2009\u00d7\u2009oil immersion objective (Molecular Cytology Core Facility, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO).\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll the results obtained from the experiments were analyzed by GraphPad InStat 3 software. Results were given as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean. Results were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance followed by\npost hoc\ntest Tukey-Kramer\npost hoc\nmultiple comparison analysis to determine statistically significant differences. A\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant in all the experiments in this study."

    "Methods": "Animal care and anesthesia\nAll procedures and protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania. All animal care complied with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Female Yorkshire swine (\nn\n=\u200923) between 2-3 months of age and weighing 20-30\u2009kg were used. Animals were housed indoors with access to normal feed and water\nad libitum.\nThe housing facility was accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. Prior to the injection and/or injury procedure, animals were fasted for 18-20\u2009h with water remaining\nad libitum.\nAfter induction with a cocktail of ketamine (20-30\u2009mg/kg; Hospira, Lake Forest, IL) and midazolam (0.4-0.6\u2009mg/kg; Hospira, Lake Forest, IL), anesthesia was provided with 5% isoflurane (Akorn Inc., Lake Forest, IL) via a snout mask, and glycopyrrolate (0.01\u2009mg/kg; West-Ward Pharmaceuticals, Eatontown, NJ) was given subcutaneously to reduce secretions. The animal was then intubated, and isoflurane was connected at maintenance levels (1.5-2.0%). Eye lubricant was used to minimize drying. Physiological monitoring allowed titration of anesthesia so that SpO\n2\n, heart rate, and respirations were within acceptable ranges.\n\nDelivery of Lucifer Yellow via intracerebroventricular injections\nAs described previously,\n34\nLucifer Yellow (LY; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)\u2014an aldehyde-fixable, cell-impermeable dye\u2014was delivered into the lateral ventricles of all animals before the rotational or sham injury to label cells permeabilized during the injury. Animals were placed in a stereotactic head frame and a 7\u2009cm incision was made in the scalp. The scalp was reflected from the skull in order to visualize bregma. Two 5\u2009mm craniectomies were made at the following stereotactic coordinates: 1.0\u2009mm posterior to bregma, \u00b16.0\u2009mm lateral. A small incision in the dura was made with a 19-gauge needle. For each site in serial fashion, a Hamilton syringe (Reno, NV) was lowered 18.0\u2009mm from the surface of the dura mater to access the ventricles. The brain was left to stabilize for 2\u2009min before delivering 500\u2009\u03bcL of LY (10\u2009mg/mL in sterile saline) per side over a period of 10\u2009min per injection using an UltraMicroPump III (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). The needle was slowly withdrawn and the burr holes were sealed with bone wax. The incision site was closed with 0-0 sutures. A surgical plane of anesthesia was maintained through the injury/sham procedure and sacrifice. The injury occurred 2\u2009h after the start of the first injection to allow LY to evenly distribute throughout the brain tissue. For animals receiving repetitive injuries separated by 3 or 7 days, LY injection occurred prior to the second injury only.\n\nPorcine closed-head rotational/inertial TBI\nBriefly, animals were anesthetized and subjected to rapid head rotational acceleration in the sagittal plane using a HYGE pneumatic actuator. Angular velocity was recorded using a magneto-hydrodynamic sensor (Applied Technology Associates, Albuquerque, NM) connected to a National Instruments DAQ, controlled by LabVIEW. The anesthetized animal's head was secured to a padded bite plate and mounted to the HYGE device. Head rotation in the sagittal plane occurred at mean peak angular velocities of 102\u2009\u00b1\u200911 radians/sec, with most rotations corresponding to a \u201cmoderate\u201d injury level based on the clinically defined time of neurological recovery.\n27\nAnimals received single rotations (\nn\n=\u20095-7), or repetitive rotations separated by 15\u2009min (\nn\n=\u20094), 3 days (\nn\n=\u20094), or 7 days (\nn\n=\u20093-4). Sham animals (\nn\n=\u20094) received all other procedures absent head rotation.\n\nBrain tissue acquisition and processing\nAll animals were sacrificed within 15\u2009min of head rotational injury (15\u2009min following the second injury for the animals subjected to repetitive head rotations). Animals were transcardially perfused using heparinized saline (4\u00b0C, 2-3\u2009L) followed by chilled 4% paraformaldehyde (4\u00b0C, 8-10\u2009L; Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Brains were blocked in the coronal plane at 5\u2009mm intervals and transferred to 30% sucrose until saturated. The blocks then were placed in OCT, flash frozen in isopentane (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and stored at -80\u00b0C. Twenty micron-thick sections were cut coronally on a cryostat (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL).\nAdditional age-matched, na\u00efve female Yorkshire swine (\nn\n=\u20093) were used for a brain atlas and neuronal phenotype determination. Animals were transcardially perfused using heparinized saline (4\u00b0C, 2-3\u2009L) followed by 10% neutral buffered formalin (8-10\u2009L; Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Brains were blocked in the coronal plane at 5\u2009mm intervals and process through paraffin. Eight-micron thick sections were cut coronally on a microtome (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA).\n\nImmunohistochemistry and imaging\nFlorescent immunohistochemistry on paraformaldehyde-fixed frozen sections was performed with several antibodies against neuronal-type specific markers to aid in anatomical identification, as well as antibodies for pathological assessments: tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; sheep 1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), parvalbumin (PV; rabbit 1:250, Abcam), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT; goat 1:500, Millipore, Burlington, MA), NeuN (mouse 1:500, Millipore), and/or ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1; rabbit 1:1000, Wako, Richmond, VA). Mounted sections were washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and blocked in 4% normal horse serum (NHS; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Slices were incubated with primary antibody in blocking solution overnight at 4\u00b0C. Secondary antibodies were applied at a 1:1000 concentration for 2\u2009h at room temperature in blocking solution: donkey anti-sheep 647 (Jackson Immuno, West Grove, PA), donkey anti-rabbit 568 (Invitrogen), donkey anti-rabbit 647 (Invitrogen), donkey anti-goat 568 (Invitrogen), donkey anti-mouse 647 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) goat anti-mouse IgG1 555 (Invitrogen). Sections were counterstained with Hoechst (Hoechst 33342, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) or Neurotrace 435/455 Blue Fluorescent Nissl stain (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) before being cover-slipped with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL).\nTo counterstain with fluorescent Nissl, tissue was washed in PBS before being permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X for 10\u2009min. Neurotrace 435/455 Blue Fluorescent Nissl stain was applied for 20\u2009min at a concentration of 1:100 in PBS. Slides were washed briefly in PBS +0.1% Triton before incubating in PBS for either 2\u2009h at room temperature or overnight at 4\u00b0C. Sections were cover-slipped with Fluoromount-G.\nBecause injured cells can lose their antigenicity for certain neuronal markers,\n35-37\nformalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from age-matched na\u00efve female Yorkshire swine was used in order to obtain representative fluorescent images of cell phenotypes in the various oculomotor regions examined for a Yorkshire brain atlas. The same antibodies were used as described for paraformaldehyde-fixed frozen sections, with the following concentrations: TH 1:500; PV 1:1000; NeuN 1:1000; ChAT 1:250. Slides were dewaxed in citrosolv (Fisher Scientific) and rehydrated in ethanol and de-ionized water. Antigen retrieval was completed in Tris-EDTA buffer pH 8.0 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) using a microwave pressure cooker. Tissue was blocked in Optimax buffer (Fisher Scientific) plus NHS for 30\u2009min at room temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted in Optimax and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Slides were washed with PBS-Tween (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) before incubation with secondary antibodies (same concentrations as frozen sections) in Optimax plus NHS for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Slides were cover-slipped with Fluoromount-G.\nHematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded-tissue (as well as one block of sham frozen tissue) to contribute to a Yorkshire brain atlas. Slides were dewaxed in xylene (Fisher Scientific) and rehydrated in ethanol and de-ionized water. Nuclei were stained with Mayer's Hematoxylin (Fisher Scientific) and blued with lithium carbonate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Tissue was counterstained with eosin (Fisher Scientific). Eosin was differentiated and slides were dehydrated in ethanol before being cleared in xylene and cover-slipped with Cytoseal (Fisher Scientific).\nFluorescence images used for quantification were acquired with an Eclipse Ni-E (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) upright fluorescent microscope or Keyence BZ-X800 (Keyence, Osaka, Japan) fluorescent microscope. Publication-quality representative images were taken on either a confocal microscope (A1RSI Laser Scanning Confocal; Nikon) using 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009, 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009, or 60\u2009\u00d7\u2009objectives with or without 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009optical zoom, or Keyence microscope using a 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009objective. Examination of H&E sections was performed using light microscopy on an Eclipse E600 (Nikon) and images were acquired using an Aperio Scanscope CS2 (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL).\n\nQuantification\nAll quantification was conducted by a skilled scientist who was blinded as to the tissue experimental group. LY+ cells were manually quantified from slides cut from 2-3 different blocks of tissue per anatomical region of interest (ROI) per animal, except for a few cases when only one block was available.\nTo put the number of permeabilized cells per ROI in context with the total number of neurons per ROI in one tissue section, the number of Nissl+ cells was also quantified for each animal. As the SC and caudate are large regions with many cells, Nissl+ cells in these ROIs were quantified semi-automatically using the Pixel Classification workflow of ilastik software.\n38\nBriefly, the software was trained to recognize Nissl+ cells from background using training images before images of entire ROIs were batch processed. The resulting simple segmentation map was exported as a TIF file and opened in FIJI. A size threshold of 50-1000\u2009\u03bcm\n2\nand circularity range of 0.25-1.00 were used to restrain the particle analysis. Nissl+ cells in SN and oculomotor nuclei were quantified by hand as these regions are either sparsely populated or small in area, respectively.\nThe number of LY+ cells was then put in context with the number of Nissl+ cells per ROI, and is expressed as the percentage of LY+ Nissl cells per hemisphere,\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM).\nThe number of NeuN+ cells in each ROI also was assessed as a marker of neuronal injury. NeuN was quantified as described above for the Nissl staining, though using a size threshold of 80-800\u2009\u03bcm\n2\n. Similar to LY, the number of NeuN+ cells was expressed as a percentage of Nissl cells per hemisphere. Additionally, the number of LY+ cells that were NeuN+ was quantified by hand for each ROI, and expressed at the percentage of NeuN+ LY cells per hemisphere.\nMicroglia reactivity was assessed by examining the density and intensity of Iba1 in each ROI. Density was quantified by semi-automatically using ilastik software to identify microglia cell bodies. The resulting simple segmentation map was opened in FIJI, where particles with a minimum size of 20\u2009\u03bcm\n2\nwere counted, and expressed as the number of Iba1+ cells per mm\n2\n. FIJI also was used to take Iba1 fluorescence intensity measurements of the entire ROI, as well as several background (Iba1-) regions within the ROI. Iba1 intensity is expressed as\nI\nn\nt\ne\nn\ns\ni\nt\ny\n\u2212\nB\na\nc\nk\ng\nr\no\nu\nn\nd\nB\na\nc\nk\ng\nr\no\nu\nn\nd\n. We also noticed large clusters of Iba1+ cells that appeared to contain small LY+ particles. Cells displaying this colocalization were counted by hand and expressed as the number of Iba1+/LY+ cells per mm\n2\n.\n\nStatistical analysis\nPercentage data within a range of 0-20% or data without a normal distribution was log transformed using the equation Y\u2009=\u2009log(Y\u2009+\u20091) before further statistical analyses. To detect statistical differences between groups, one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with Tukey's multiple comparisons tests were performed. When data distribution assumptions for ANOVA were not met, Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric tests with Dunn's multiple comparisons tests were used. The\np\nvalues are reported as follows: non-significant\np\n>\u20090.05, *\np\n\u2264\u20090.05, **\np\n\u2264\u20090.01, ***\np\n\u2264\u20090.001, ****\np\n\u2264\u20090.0001.\nPost hoc\nanalyses revealed that the study was adequately powered to detect permeability differences between groups for each region examined except the oculomotor nuclei in which tissue from fewer animals was available (caudate: power\u2009=\u20090.913, effect size\nf\n=\u20090.983; SNpr: power\u2009=\u20090.874, effect size\nf\n=\u20090.956; SC: power\u2009=\u20090.991, effect size\nf\n=\u20091.247; oculomotor nuclei [CNIII/IV]: power\u2009=\u20090.684, effect size\nf\n=\u20090.799). The study also was adequately powered to detect differences in Iba1 and LY colocalization for each region except the caudate (caudate: power\u2009=\u20090.719, effect size\nf\n=\u20090.753; SNpr: power\u2009=\u20090.930, effect size\nf\n=\u20091.047; SC: power\u2009=\u20090.854, effect size\nf\n=\u20090.931; CNIII/IV: power\u2009=\u20090.997, effect size\nf\n=\u20091.723). It also was adequately powered to detect differences between the percentages of LY+/NeuN- between injury groups in all regions examined except the SNpr (caudate: power\u2009=\u20090.949, effect size\nf\n=\u20090.945; SNpr: power\u2009=\u20090.555, effect size\nf\n=\u20090.677; SC: power\u2009=\u20090.985, effect size\nf\u2009=\n1.233)."

    "Methods": "Study design and procedure\nData were drawn from a larger study of pediatric mild TBI that involved a prospective, concurrent cohort design with longitudinal follow-up. Children with mild TBI or OI between the ages of 8.00 and 16.99 years at the time of injury were recruited during emergency department (ED) visits within 24\u2009h post-injury at Nationwide Children's Hospital (NCH) in Columbus, OH and at Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital (RBCH) in Cleveland, OH. Recruitment occurred over a period of 48 months to accrue the desired sample size.\nInformation regarding the child's injury and acute clinical presentation was obtained at the ED visit, during which parents also provided retrospective ratings of their child's pre-injury symptoms. Acute symptoms were assessed using the Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC).\n15\nParents provided the address of the family residence, and the 2010 Census tract median family income was obtained to help derive estimates of socioeconomic status. Enrolled children returned for three further assessments: post-acute and 3 and 6 months post-injury. At the post-acute visit, which occurred from 3-24 days post-injury, children completed an MRI as well as ratings of current PCS. Parents also rated current PCS. Ratings of current PCS also were obtained from children and parents at 3 and 6 months post-injury using the Health and Behavior Inventory (HBI).\n16\nAs summarized in Ware and colleagues,\n17\na total of 315 children (mild TBI\u2009=\u2009195, OI\u2009=\u2009120) were recruited in the ED for the study at large. All but one of the children who returned for the post-acute MRI completed the MRI. Of the participants with usable post-acute MRI data, 152 (mild TBI\u2009=\u200998, OI\u2009=\u200954) also completed the assessment at 3 months post-injury and 135 (mild TBI\u2009=\u200993, OI\u2009=\u200942) completed the assessment at 6 months post-injury. A comparison of demographic characteristics between the participants who did and did not return for the post-acute and chronic (3- and 6-month) assessments is available elsewhere.\n17\n\nParticipants and recruitment\nParticipants for the current study included children with mild TBI or mild OI who completed an MRI and relevant measures at the post-acute assessment (i.e., within 2 weeks of the injury). A comparison group of children with mild OI not involving the head was included to distinguish the effects of mild TBI from injury in general, account for the stressful experience of suffering a traumatic injury, and control for pre-morbid functioning and demographics.\n9\n,\n18\u201321\nDiagnoses were made by treating physicians during the ED visit. Regardless of physician diagnosis, all children with mild TBI in the current study met the study criteria.\n22\nSpecifically, they had to have experienced a blunt head trauma that resulted in at least one of the following: 1) an observed loss of consciousness (LOC) for less than 30\u2009min; 2) Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13 or greater (GCS was 13 or 14 in cases with no LOC or other signs or symptoms)\n23\n; or 3) at least two acute signs of symptoms of concussion as noted on standard case reports form (e.g., post-traumatic amnesia, focal neurological deficits, skull fracture, vomiting, headache, dizziness, or other mental status changes).\nChildren with OI were included if they experienced an upper or lower extremity fracture with an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score of 4 or less.\n24\nChildren with OI were excluded from the study if they showed any evidence of head trauma or any symptoms of concussion. Children with mild TBI were eligible if they had a co-occurring OI.\nBoth groups were subject to the following exclusion criteria: 1) any other severe injury as defined by an AIS score greater than 4; 2) any upper extremity injury likely to interfere with neuropsychological testing (e.g., dominant or nondominant hand, arm or shoulder injury; 3) hypoxia, hypotension, or shock during or following the injury; 4) alcohol or drug ingestion involved with the injury; 5) history of previous TBI requiring hospitalization; 6) pre-morbid neurological disorder or intellectual disability; 7) injury resulting from abuse or assault; 8) history of severe psychiatric disorder requiring hospitalization; or 9) any contraindication to MRI. Children who were administered analgesic medication, including narcotics, were not excluded from either group. Additionally, children with a history of learning or attention problems were not excluded because they are at increased risk for sustaining traumatic injuries.\n25\n\nDemographic information\nDemographic information was collected during the post-acute assessment. A socioeconomic status (SES) composite index was computed by averaging sample z-scores for years of maternal education, median family income for census tract, and the Duncan Socioeconomic Index,\n26\na measure of occupational prestige. The two-subtest version of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence-Second Edition, which includes the Matrix Reasoning and Vocabulary subtests, was used to estimate children's Full Scale IQ.\n27\n\nPost-concussive symptoms\nParent ratings of pre-morbid symptoms were collected during the ED visit. Post-injury PCS were rated by both the parent and child at each follow-up assessment, using the HBI.\n16\nThe HBI has good internal consistency and inter-rater agreement, and has been adopted as a core measure in the Common Data Elements for Pediatric TBI.\n28\nIt yields separate scores for cognitive and somatic symptom scales. Both parent and child post-injury ratings at each assessment were included in analyses because these can provide different but complementary information about outcomes in pediatric mild TBI.\n29\n\nHead injury history\nHistory of previous head injury was assessed though retrospective parent report. Overall, 24 children with mild TBI and 12 children with OI had a previous head injury. Groups did not differ in number of previous head injuries reported. Most children had only one prior head injury (mild TBI\nn\n=\u200917; OI\nn\n=\u200910), although one child in the TBI group had history of four previous injuries. Of the children with positive head injury histories, 19 children in the mild TBI group and 12 children in the OI group had sought medical treatment. Severity of injuries (including treated injuries) ranged from a minor bump on the head or stitches to a facial region to diagnosed concussion.\n\nMRI\nEach participant completed a 3 Tesla MRI scan as part of the post-acute assessment. Participants were not sedated during MRI acquisition. MRI scans were completed from 3-24 days post-injury (Mean [M]\u2009=\u200910.85, Median\u2009=\u200911.00, Standard Deviation [SD]\u2009=\u20093.28), with most scans (96%) completed between 3-16 days post-injury. Time between injury and MRI scan did not differ by group [F(1, 197) < 1.00,\np\n=\u20090.634] or site [F(1, 197) < 1.00,\np\n=\u20090.892], and there was no group by site interaction [F(1, 197)\u2009=\u20091.47,\np\n=\u20090.227]. The MRI sequences were based on protocols recommended by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Common Data Elements group\n30\nand included: T1- and T2-weighted, axial T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), axial susceptibility weighted, and axial diffusion-weighted sequences.\n31\nCoding of the MRIs for incidental and trauma-related findings is reported elsewhere.\n32\nBriefly, most children had normal MRI (i.e., 51%). Approximately 25\u201335% of the children with mild TBI (\nn\n=\u200937) and OI (\nn\n=\u200925) had positive findings, including intracranial abnormalities of a structural (most commonly ventricular asymmetry), cystic, or vascular nature, and extracranial abnormalities (most commonly mucosal thickening and polyps). Importantly, the rate of positive findings did not differ significantly between the two injury groups and were not related to outcomes.\nMRI at each site was accomplished in about 45\u201360\u2009min. Periodic reliability checks were conducted by having randomly selected protocols from each site reviewed. Quality checks also were initially conducted through regular phantom scans.\nMRI data were obtained at NCH using a Siemens Trio 3T scanner with a 32-channel head coil. High-resolution T1-weighted images were acquired using a three-dimensional (3D) magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo pulse sequence with the following sequence parameters: 192 contiguous sagittal slices with TR (repetition time)\u2009=\u20092200\u2009msec; TE (echo time)\u2009=\u20094.37\u2009msec; in-plane resolution\u2009=\u20090.90\u2009mm\n2\n; slice thickness\u2009=\u20090.90\u2009mm; flip angle\u2009=\u200978\u00b0 field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u2009230\u2009mm\n2\n; and an acquisition matrix of 256\u2009mm\n2\n.\nMRI data were obtained at RBCH using a Philips 3.0T Achieva scanner with an eight-channel head coil. High-resolution T1-weighted images were acquired using a 3D magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (T1 3D TFE) pulse sequence with the following sequence parameters: 170 contiguous sagittal slices with TR/TE\u2009=\u20098.9/4.1\u2009msec; in-plane resolution\u2009=\u20090.90\u2009mm\n2\n; slice thickness\u2009=\u20090.90\u2009mm; flip angle\u2009=\u200988\u00b0; FOV\u2009=\u2009240\u2009mm\n2\n; and an acquisition matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009mm\n2\n.\nQuality assurance and pre-processing\nAll T1- and T2-weighted images were visually inspected for artifact by an expert blind to group membership. Data were excluded from 11 participants who completed the post-acute MRI because of poor anatomical (i.e., T1-weighted) data quality (i.e., severe motion or scanner-related artifact) or incomplete data acquisition (e.g., failure or refusal to complete the MRI).\nBriefly, preprocessing and brain extraction procedures were completed on a remote Linux computing cluster. T1- and T2-weighted DICOM data were converted into NIfTI format using the dcm2niix tool in MRIcron (publicly available software;\nhttps://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix\n). During conversion to NIfTI format, T1-weighted images were automatically reoriented to canonical space and auto-cropped. Using the acpcdetect tool of the Automatic Registration Toolbox (freely available at\nwww.nitrc.org/frs/?group_id=90\n), the T1-weighted images were put into standard alignment. Using the Convert3D Medical Image Processing Tool (freely available at\nwww.itksnap.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Downloads.C3D\n),\n33\nT1-weighted images were resampled with an isotropic voxel resolution of 1\u2009mm\n3\n. Intensity correction was completed on all T1-weighted data using the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) version 2.1.0 N4 Bias Field Correction.\n34\nThe T2-weighted images were subsequently registered to the T1-weighted images for each participant using ANTs registration (antsRegistrationSyNQuick).\nEstimates of cortical thickness\nFreeSurfer v6.0.0 was used to automatically parcellate cortical and segment subcortical brain regions from the co-registered T1- and T2-weighted anatomical images (freely available at\nhttp://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu\n).\n35\nCortical parcellations were identified and labeled within surface-based processing stream according to the Desikan-Kiliany atlas definitions of gyri and sulci for each hemisphere.\n36\nThe current analyses examined the cortical thickness of frontal, cingulum, temporal, parietal, and occipital cortical subregions for each hemisphere. The FreeSurfer labels included in each cortical region are listed in\nTable 1\n.\nTable 1.\nList of FreeSurfer Cortical Regions Included in Each Lobe\nFrontal cortex\nCaudal middle frontal\nLateral orbitofrontal\nMedial orbitofrontal\nPars opercularis\nPars orbitalis\nPars triangularis\nPrecentral\nRostral middle frontal\nSuperior frontal\nFrontal pole\nOpen in a separate window\nCingulate Cortex\nCaudal anterior cingulate\nIsthmus cingulate\nPosterior cingulate\nRostral anterior cingulate\nOpen in a separate window\nTemporal cortex\nBanks superior temporal sulcus\nEntorhinal\nFusiform\nInferior temporal\nMiddle temporal\nParahippocampal\nTemporal pole\nTransverse temporal\nInsula\nOpen in a separate window\nParietal cortex\nInferior parietal\nParacentral\nPostcentral\nSuperior parietal\nSupramarginal\nPrecuneus\nOpen in a separate window\nOccipital cortex\nLateral occipital\nLingual\nCuneus\nOpen in a separate window\n\nStatistical analysis\nDemographic data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables (e.g., age, SES) and chi-square techniques for categorical variables (e.g., sex).\nFor Aim 1, linear mixed effects models were computed using the R lmerTest package\n37\n,\n38\nto investigate the relations between group, brain region, age, sex, and their interactions (fixed effects) as predictors of cortical thickness of the frontal, cingulate, temporal, parietal, and occipital cortices in each hemisphere separately, with site (i.e., NCH, RBCH) and participant entered as random effects. Full factorial models were initially computed to test for interaction effects among group, region, age, and sex, as demonstrated by the following model formula:\nThickness \u223c Group * Region * Age * Sex + (1|Site) + (1|Subject)\nThe full factorial models did not account for a significant increase in model fit compared with main effects models; and the model for left temporal thickness failed to converge at tolerance\u2009=\u20090.003. Therefore, non-significant interaction effects (adjusted for multiple comparisons) were trimmed from final models, resulting in final (main effects) models as demonstrated by the following model formula:\nThickness \u223c Group + Region + Age + Sex + (1|Site) + (1|Subject)\nFor Aim 2, multiple multivariable negative binomial regression analyses were used to examine relations among cortical thickness and post-acute and chronic (3 and 6 months post-injury) somatic and cognitive PCS ratings (separate analyses for each follow-up assessment). Group, average thickness of each cortical region (i.e., mean thickness of frontal, cingulate, temporal, parietal, occipital cortical subregions) for each hemisphere separately, and their interactions were included as predictors to test whether associations between average cortical thickness and somatic or cognitive PCS differed in children with mild TBI versus OI; age, sex, and pre-morbid PCS were included as covariates. Parent and child PCS ratings were used as outcome measures.\nThe false discovery rate (FDR) was used to correct for multiple comparisons for all analyses.\n39\nContinuous predictors in Aim 1 and 2 models were mean centered. Mixed models are generalizations of multiple regression models. A power analysis, conducted using G*Power v3.1,\n40\nindicated that, in a regression analysis, the current sample size (\nn\n=\u2009206) was sufficiently powered (1-\u03b2\u2009=\u2009.80) to detect a change in\nR\n2\nof about 0.038 for a single predictor at \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05, assuming 10 total predictors."

    "Methods": "Patient population\nAll patients from the multi-center CENTER-TBI HR ICU monitoring cohort with parenchymal ICP monitoring, and with archived digital admission CT scans of the brain, were included in this analysis. Patients with external ventricular drain (EVD)-based ICP data were excluded given the interrupted nature of their recordings (i.e., reliable ICP can be recorded only when the drainage is closed). Included patients were prospectively recruited between January 2015 and December 2017 from 21 centers in the European Union (EU). All patients were admitted to the ICU for their TBI during the course of the study, with high-frequency digital signals recorded from their ICU monitors during the course of their ICU stay. All patients suffered predominantly from moderate to severe TBI (moderate\u2009=\u2009Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score 9\u201312, and severe\u2009=\u2009GCS score \u22648). A minority of patients were categorized at the time of admission as suffering from less severe TBI, but experienced subsequent early deterioration leading to ICU admission for care and monitoring. All patients in this cohort had invasive ICP monitoring conducted in accordance with the Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) guidelines.\n22\n\nEthics\nData used in these analyses were collected as part of the CENTER-TBI study, which had individual national or local regulatory approval; the UK Ethics approval is provided as an exemplar (IRAS 150943; REC 14/SC/1370). The CENTER-TBI study (EC grant 602150) has been conducted in accordance with all relevant laws of the EU if directly applicable or of direct effect and all relevant laws of the country where the recruiting sites were located, including but not limited to, the relevant privacy and data protection laws and regulations (the \u201cPrivacy Law\u201d), the relevant laws and regulations on the use of human materials, and all relevant guidance relating to clinical studies from time to time in force including, but not limited to, the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (CPMP/ICH/135/95) (\u201cICH GCP\u201d) and the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki entitled \u201cEthical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects.\u201d Informed consent by the patients and/or the legal representative/next of kin was obtained, according to the local legislations, for all patients recruited in the core data set of CENTER-TBI and documented in the e-CRF.\n\nData collection\nAs part of recruitment to the multi-center HR ICU cohort of CENTER-TBI, all patients had demographics, injury, and imaging data prospectively recorded. Similarly, all patients had high-frequency digital signals from ICU monitoring recorded throughout their ICU stay, with the goal of initiating recording within 24\u2009h of ICU admission. All digital ICU signals were further processed (see sections Signal acquisition and Signal processing). For the purpose of this study, basic admission demographics and centrally reported CT variables for the first available CT of each patient were extracted.\n23\nThey included: age, admission best GCS motor score, and pupillary reactivity (bilateral reactive, unilateral reactive, bilateral unreactive), Marshall CT classification,\n24\nRotterdam CT score,\n25\nHelsinki CT score,\n26\npresence or absence of traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (tSAH), extradural hematoma (EDH), subdural hematoma (SDH), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), basal cistern compression, skull fracture, pre-hospital hypotension, and pre-hospital hypoxia.\nFurther semi-automated segmentation of the admission CT scans was conducted as described below, allowing for volumetric assessment of: contusion core, contusion edema, IVH, and extra-axial hemorrhage (see\nsection Image processing\n). A continuous measure of midline shift (MLS) was manually obtained in millimeters, calculated as the perpendicular distance from the septum pellucidum from a line coplanar with the anterior and posterior attachment of the falx on the inner table of the skull. CENTER-TBI data version 2.0 were accessed for the purpose of this study, via Opal database software.\n27\n\nSignal acquisition\nArterial blood pressure (ABP) was obtained through arterial lines connected to pressure transducers. ICP was acquired from an intra-parenchymal strain gauge probe (Codman ICP MicroSensor; Codman & Shurtleff, Inc., Raynham, MA), parenchymal fiber optic pressure sensor (Camino ICP Monitor; Integra Life Sciences, Plainsboro, NJ;\nhttps://www.integralife.com/\n). ICP monitors, by convention, were placed in the frontal lobe, avoiding areas with traumatic lesions. All signals were recorded using digital data transfer or digitized via an A/D converter (DT9803; Data Translation, Marlboro, MA), where appropriate, sampled at a frequency of 100 Hertz (Hz) or higher, using the ICM+ software (Cambridge Enterprise, Ltd., Cambridge, UK;\nhttp://icmplus.neurosurg.cam.ac.uk\n) or Moberg CNS Monitor (Moberg Research. Inc., Ambler, PA;\nhttps://www.moberg.com\n), or a combination of both. Signal artefacts were removed using both manual and automated methods prior to further processing or analysis.\n\nSignal processing\nPost-acquisition processing of the above signals was conducted using ICM+ (Cambridge Enterprise, Ltd.;\nhttp://icmplus.neurosurg.cam.ac.uk\n). Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) was determined as MAP \u2013 ICP. Ten-second moving averages (updated every 10\u2009sec to avoid data overlap) were calculated for all recorded signals: ICP, ABP (which produced MAP), pulse amplitude of ICP (AMP), and CPP. PRx was calculated as the moving correlation coefficient between 30 consecutive 10-sec mean windows of ICP and MAP, updated every minute.\nData were time-averaged and down-sampled to minute-by-minute resolution for the entire duration of recording for each patient. Grand mean values of all physiological variables were calculated per patient. In addition, the following post-processing of this physiological data occurred in R (R Core Team [2018]. R: A language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria.\nhttps://www.R-project.org/\n):\na.\u2002Mean values over the recording period were calculated, with each patient assessed to see if they were above or below the binary threshold of 0, +0.25, or +0.35.\nb.\u2002Percent (%) time spent with PRx above threshold: For each patient the % of time spent above the following clinically defined thresholds was calculated across the entire recording period: 0, +0.25, +0.35.\n4\n,\n6\nAll of these thresholds for PRx have been defined in previously published literature as statistically significant for association with 6-month global outcome in adult patients with TBI. These three thresholds exist based on the analysis between dichotomized Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) values at 6-months post-TBI in two separate TBI populations. In one study, the threshold of 0 is associated with favorable/unfavorable outcome (i.e., GOS value of 3 or less\u2009=\u2009unfavorable, GOS value of 4 or 5\u2009=\u2009favorable), and the threshold of +0.25 was associated with mortality.\n4\nSimilarly, in another smaller, more select TBI patient population consisting of those not having a decompressive procedure, the threshold of +0.35 existed for both favorable and unfavorable outcome and mortality.\n6\nHence, both sets of thresholds were utilized. This is in keeping with the previously published retrospective study on the relationship between intracranial injury burden and impaired cerebrovascular reactivity in TBI.\n13\nc.\u2002Mean hourly dose above PRx threshold: Using the above mentioned defined PRx thresholds, the mean hourly dose above each was determined.\nData were provided in summary sheets for the patient cohort using data from: 1) the entire recording, and 2) the first 72\u2009h of recording. These two sheets were produced to assess if there was any difference in CT lesion association when focusing on more acute physiology, such as that seen during the first 72\u2009h post-injury. The results of the following analysis displayed similar trends in association for both the entire recording and first 72-h data sheet. As such, the remainder of this article mainly refers to the entire recording data, making reference to the first 72-h data results only when required.\n\nImage processing\nEach CT session was automatically processed using a modified version of DeepMedic, a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) with three parallel pathways that process the images at different resolution scales resulting in a field-of-view of 81\u2009mm. The CNN was trained using 64 previously manually annotated scans and validated on another 34 scans.\n28\nThis step yielded automated lesion predictions corresponding to volumes (in mL) for the lesion sub-types described above (contusion core, peri-contusional edema, extra-axial hemorrhage, and IVH). Too maximize the accuracy of those predictions, each scan was visually inspected and manually corrected by an expert clinician. The clinician was blinded to the recorded physiology and cerebrovascular reactivity data during CT segmentation. False-positive predictions were removed, missed lesions were manually filled in, and lesion margin accuracy was optimized using ITK-SNAP (version 3.8.0-beta).\n29\nThe resulting corrected segmentation maps were then projected to a CT atlas (constructed from 20 normal CTs) aligned to MNI space using affine registration methods to obtain their neuro-anatomical correlates. For the purpose of this analysis we collapsed lesion localization into either lobar/cortical, basal ganglia (basal ganglia), brainstem, or deep (consisting of brainstem, cerebellar, and basal ganglia locations). In total, 25 CT lesion variables were utilized for comparison with the high-frequency physiology.\nSupplementary Appendix A1\nprovides a list of the CT variables.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analysis was conducted using the R and XLSTAT (Addinsoft, New York, NY;\nhttps://www.xlstat.com/en/\n) add-on package to Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Office 15, version 16.0.7369.1323). The following analysis was conducted for both the entire recording period and the first 72\u2009h of recording, with similar results. As such, only the entire recording period will be reported in detail, with intermittent reference made to the results from the first 72\u2009h of recording.\nNormality of continuous variables was assessed via Shapiro-Wilks test, where all variables displayed non-parametric characteristics, and are hence displayed as median (range or interquartile range [IQR]). Admission demographics and CT variables were compared between patients dichotomized for mean PRx above/below the defined thresholds, using Mann-U, or chi-square testing where appropriate. Similarly, mean % time and mean hourly dose above PRx threshold metrics were compared for each admission CT ordinal characteristic, using Mann-U testing, and for admission CT grading systems using Kruskal-Wallis or Jonckheere-Terpstra testing, where appropriate. For all testing described, the alpha was set at 0.002 for significance, after correction using Bonferroni methodology. We corrected for 25 separate imaging characteristics that were tested against each PRx threshold (i.e., each dependent variable). The\np\n-values reported throughout are the raw\np\n-values for the statistical tests performed, which were compared against the Bonferroni-corrected alpha of 0.002 for significance.\nUnivariate logistic regression (ULR) was conducted, comparing each CT variable with the dichotomized mean PRx values for above/below the defined thresholds of 0, +0.25, and +0.35. Area under the receiver operating curve (AUC), Akaike information criterion (AIC), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and\np\n-values for the univariate models are reported. All AUCs and 95% CIs for ULR were determined using bootstrapping techniques with 2000 iterations. Similarly, comparison between continuous CT metrics and PRx metrics was conducted using Pearson correlation and linear regression modeling."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nEqual numbers of male and female C57BL/6 mice aged 8\u201310 weeks were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) for every study. Mice were group-housed (\nn\n=\u20094/group) by sex in The Ohio State University's Wiseman Hall vivarium and maintained at 21\u00b0C under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle (i.e., lights on 7AM\u20147PM) with\nad libitum\naccess to food and water. Each cohort of male and female mice received either sham injury or lateral fluid percussion TBI and then were left undisturbed or received SD for 3 days before sacrifice at 3 or 7 days post-injury (DPI). Following surgical preparation, each subject was randomized to the TBI or sham group as well as undisturbed or SD group, resulting in four experimental groups: sham, TBI, sham SD, and TBI SD. Attention was given to counterbalance males and females in all procedures and analyses. All conditions were in accordance with the principles set forth by the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of The Ohio State University.\n\nSurgical preparation and lateral fluid percussion injury (FPI)\nAll surgical procedures were performed as previously described.\n29\n,\n30\nBriefly, mice aged 8\u201310 weeks were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane gas in an induction chamber for 4\u2009min and then positioned in a stereotaxic frame. Following midline incision, a 3.0-mm craniectomy was trephined midway between bregma and lambda on the right parietal bone, leaving the intact dura mater exposed. A modified portion of a Leur-Loc syringe (3.0-mm inside diameter) was positioned over the craniectomy site and secured with cyanoacrylate adhesive. Following the surgical procedure, mice were placed in their home cages on a heating pad to recover. Twenty-four hours after the surgical procedure, mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane in an induction chamber for 4\u2009min and then connected to the fluid percussion injury (FPI) device (Custom Design & Fabrication, Richmond, VA) using the modified portion of a Leur-Loc syringe. To initiate the impact, a pre-positioned hammer was dropped onto the end of the FPI device, delivering a water pulse onto the exposed dura mater to induce a moderate FPI to mice designated to the TBI group. Sham mice were attached to the FPI device, but the hammer was not released, and they did not receive a fluid pulse. The modified syringe and adhesive were removed following FPI or sham injury and the incision was stapled closed. All animals were placed on a heating pad and injury severity was assessed via the self-righting reflex test. After the subjects demonstrated the righting reflex, they were returned to their cages. Mice were sacrificed at either 3 or 7 DPI.\n\nSleep disruption (SD)\nSD was operationally defined as 3 days of minimally invasive mechanical stimulation from 7\u201311AM beginning the morning after injuries, as adapted from previously published protocols.\n31\u201333\nDuring SD entire home cages were removed from the standard housing rack and room. In a different room, one to two investigators placed the home cages on a table, removed the plastic cage top, and sat quietly observing sleeping behavior from 7\u201311AM. Sleeping behavior was operationally defined as sitting quietly with no movement and eyes closed. If sleeping behavior was observed, investigators would gently pet the mouse or nudge it to move. In addition, investigators would remove the cage lid or wire cage rack to stimulate the mice. On 2 DPI, one cage change was performed between 9 and 9:30AM. On 3 DPI, two cage changes were performed at approximately 8:30AM and 10AM. The cage changes were introduced because mechanical stimulation or removing the cage lid/wire rack was not sufficient to interrupt operationally defined sleeping behavior. Mice had\nad libitum\naccess to food and water throughout the SD procedures. Published data demonstrate that this protocol of 4\u2009h of SD resulted in increased percent sleep and average sleep bout length for up to 4\u2009h after SD ended.\n31\nThis response suggests that the SD protocol is effective in altering sleep/wake behavior resulting in increased sleep after the disruption ends.\n\nElevated zero maze\nThe elevated zero maze was used to examine anxiety-like behavior following exposure to SD or standard housing. The elevated zero maze is equally divided into two open and two closed arms, which were defined as open arm 1, open arm 2, closed arm 1, and closed arm 2. At the beginning of a testing trial, a mouse was placed in open arm 1 next to the entrance to closed arm 1. Thereafter, the mouse could move freely throughout the maze for 5\u2009min. After behavioral testing, each mouse was placed in a clean cage away from cage mates that had not completed behavioral testing. Traces of all feces and urine were removed from the maze before thoroughly cleaning it with 70% alcohol between every testing trial. An aerial view camera and Ethovision tracking software (Noldus) were used to record movement between the open and closed arms. Total time in open and closed arms, as well as total time in each arm, and average time spent in each of the four arms during each minute of the test were primary dependent variables of interest.\n\nImmunohistochemistry and imaging analysis\nMice were euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation. The flow rates and environment of sacrifice were constant across experimental groups and controlled to minimize animal distress.\n34\nMice were then transcardially perfused with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Perfused brains were dissected and post-fixed in 4% PFA for 24\u2009h and then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose for 72\u2009h and stored at 4\u00b0C. Brains were sectioned at 30\u2009\u03bcm using a Leica CM1800 cryostat (Leica Biosystems) and were stored in cryoprotectant (30% ethylene glycol, 30% polyethylene glycol, 40% 0.2\u2009M PBS) at \u221220\u00b0C until labeling. Sections were rinsed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBST) for 10\u2009min and then, for antigen retrieval, placed in a 10-mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and heated at 90\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. For immunofluorescent labeling, tissue was washed with PBST and blocked (5% normal donkey serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 2\u2009h at room temperature. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in primary antibody with constant rotation: rabbit anti-mouse Iba1 (1:500; Wako Chemicals), goat anti-mouse GFAP (1:500; Abcam), rat anti-mouse CD45 (1:500; Abcam), or rabbit anti-mouse aquaporin-4 (AQP4) (1:2000; Sigma-Aldrich).\nNext, tissue was rinsed in PBST and incubated in corresponding fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody for 1\u2009h (1:1000; Alexa Fluor 594, 488, or 647). Sections were then mounted and cover-slipped using Fluoromount-G (Invitrogen). For diaminobenzidine (DAB) labeling, tissue was placed in 0.3% H\n2\nO\n2\nin PBS for 30\u2009min after antigen retrieval and then was blocked (5% normal goat serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) with Mouse IgG Blocking Reagent (1:100; Vector Laboratories) for 2\u2009h. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with mouse anti-mouse AT180 (1:200; Thermo Fisher) with constant rotation. Sections were washed with PBST and incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200, Vector Laboratories) for 1\u2009h. Next, sections were washed with PBST and incubated according to instructions for the ABC Kit for DAB staining (Vector Laboratories). After a PBST wash, sections were placed in DAB solution (Vector Laboratories) for 45\u2009sec with an additional 15\u2009sec for each subsequent tissue set. DAB reaction was stopped with PBS and sections were washed a second time in PBS. Sections were then mounted and dehydrated (1\u2009min 70% ethanol, 1\u2009min 90% ethanol, 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009min 100% ethanol, 2\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u2009min xylenes) and cover-slipped using Permount (Thermo Fisher).\nFor Iba1 and GFAP, slides were imaged using an EVOS FL Auto 2 Imaging System (Thermo Fisher) at 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification. For each animal, 2\u20134 images per area of interest were taken and percent-area was quantified using the National Institutes of Health's ImageJ software. For AQP4 polarization, slides were imaged using a Leica SP8 upright confocal microscope at 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009magnification. Sequential optical sections were captured using the Leica Application Suite X imaging software. Sequential optical sections were analyzed using custom in-house software. AQP4 labeling intensity was calculated at each point along cross-sections of large penetrating cortical vessels. AQP4 polarization was then calculated as the ratio of perivascular (<10\u2009\u03bcm from vessel) to parenchymal (20\u201325\u2009\u03bcm from vessel) AQP4 immunofluorescence. Dysfunction is indicated by a lower polarization because AQP4 should be primarily sequestered to the perivascular astrocytic end feet.\n35\nFor lesion analysis, 30-\u03bcm sections were selected at 10 evenly spaced coordinates covering the entire area under the craniectomy (+0.02\u2009mm through \u22123.16\u2009mm relative to bregma). Sections were stained with DAPI to visualize cytoarchitecture and 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009tile-scan images were taken of each section on an EVOS cell imaging system. Lesion area was measured for each section using ImageJ. Lesion volume was extrapolated by averaging adjacent sections and multiplying by the distance between sections. Investigators were blinded throughout analysis. Brain regions were identified using the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas. For CD45, 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009tile-scan images were taken of each section using the aforementioned EVOS system. Images were then rotated to center on the injury site and cropped to select a 3.65-mm\u2009\u00d7\u20092.01-mm region for quantification using ImageJ. The number of CD45\n+\ncells for each section was counted and averaged for quantification. For AT180, slides were imaged using the aforementioned EVOS system for bright field at 40\u2009\u00d7\u2009. For each animal, 2\u20134 images per ipsilateral temporal cortex were taken and AT180\n+\ncells were counted and averaged for each animal.\n\nQuantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)\nMice were euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation and the brains were immediately removed. The ipsilateral cortex was micro-dissected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen (\u2212196\u00b0C) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. RNA was isolated from cortical homogenate using Tri-zol Reagent (Sigma Aldrich) per manufacturer's protocols. Next, RNA (2.4\u2009ng) was diluted in 40\u2009\u03bcL of RNase-free water and converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (HiCap RT PCR kit; Applied Biosystems). Resulting cDNA was diluted 1:10 in TaqMan Advanced Fast Master Mix (Thermo Fisher) and gene expression was quantified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using validated probes from TaqMan Gene Expression (Applied Biosystems) on a QuantStudio3 PCR machine (Thermo Fisher)for 40 amplification cycles. Samples that amplified in more than 38 cycles were excluded. Genes of interest were normalized to\nGapdh\nand expressed as fold-change from control (\u0394\u0394Ct). Gene targets included: H2-Eb1 (Mm00439221_m1); Aqp4 (Mm00802131_m1); Gfap (Mm01253033_m1); Vim (Mm01333430_m1); Itgam (Mm00434455_m1); S100b (Hs00902901_m1); Il1b (Mm00434228_m1); Ccl2 (Mm00441242_m1); Il6 (Mm00446190_m1); Ccr2 (Mm99999051_gH); Trem2 (Mm04209424_g1); Cxcr2 (Mm99999112_s1); Cxcl1 (Mm04207460_m1); Cx3cr1 (Mm00438354_m1); Tlr4 (Mm00445273_m1); Cd68 (Mm03047340_m1); and Tnf (Mm00443258_m1).\n\nCorticosterone (CORT) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\nBlood samples were collected in 1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes with 20\u2009\u03bcL of 50\u2009mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as an anti-coagulant. Blood was collected via submandibular bleeding immediately after SD or after remaining undisturbed at 11AM, and then was immediately placed on ice. After collection, blood was spun at 6000 rcf for 15\u2009min, after which plasma was extracted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C as previously described.\n36\nPlasma concentration of CORT was evaluated using the Corticosterone EIA Kit (catalog #ADI-900-097; Enzo) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nCollecting blood for CORT measurement is a sensitive and time-dependent procedure. Cheek bleed samples were taken in the same room as SD occurred to minimize movement stress. Order of bleed collection was randomized between days, ensuring no group condition or sex was sampled in the same order. Exclusion criteria included any animal that took longer than 3\u2009min from initial investigator contact to successful sample collection and any animal that had to be scruffed more than once. After blood collection, each mouse was placed in a new clean cage away from littermates that had not yet undergone collection and then was returned to its home cage once collection was completed for that cage. Blood collection was done at 11AM to quantify the CORT response immediately following the stressor of SD. Blood was collected at 11AM 2 DPI in animals aging to 3 DPI. Blood was collected at 11AM at 1 and 3 DPI in mice aging to 7 DPI. The 2 DPI time-point was excluded for the 7 DPI experiments to reduce the number of cheek bleeds required over testing days.\n\nFlow cytometry\nMice were euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation, after which blood was collected via cardiac puncture into Eppendorf tubes with 20\u2009\u03bcL 50\u2009mM EDTA and placed on ice. Brains were then immediately collected and put into PBS on ice. Blood was collected at 3 DPI and processed for flow cytometric analysis as previously described.\n37\nBriefly, red blood cells were lysed and the remaining cells were centrifuged. Supernatant was removed and cell pellets were resuspended in antibody solution: B220 (APC-Cy7), Ly6C (PE-Cy7), CD3 (PE), CD11b (APC), and Ly6G (FITC) for 45\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. All antibodies were diluted 1:50 and from Fisher Scientific. Compensation beads (Abcam) were also incubated for 45\u2009min at 4\u00b0C for each antibody listed.\nBrain tissue was homogenized and pelleted. After supernatants were separated, the cell pellets were resuspended in 70% isotonic Percoll (GE Healthcare). A Percoll density gradient was then applied in three layers of 50%, 35%, and 0% (PBS) isotonic Percoll and then centrifuged. The fat layer was removed from all tubes and the microglial layer between the 70% and 50% layers was separated and washed to remove any remaining Percoll. Cells were pelleted and supernatant was removed. Cells were then incubated in antibody solution as described above: Ly6G (FITC), Ly6C (PE), CD45 (Percp), and CD11b (APC). After antibody incubation, brain, blood, and compensation beads were washed and counting beads (123 count beads; eBiosciences) were added. Surface expression was determined using a FACS Caliberflow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson) and analysis was completed using FlowJo7 software (Tree Star).\n\nExperimental study design\nThe primary objective of this study was to characterize the immediate and delayed effects of transient post-injury SD on behavioral and immunological outcomes after TBI. This resulted in a 2 (sham, TBI)\u2009\u00d7\u20092 (undisturbed, SD) factorial design. To determine post-injury SD effects on CORT responses, submandibular cheek bleeds were taken at 2 DPI (\nn\n=\u20096\u20138 per group). Immediate behavioral effects of post-injury SD were determined through elevated zero maze at 3 DPI immediately before sacrifice (\nn\n=\u200910\u201312 per group). Flow cytometry was used to measure immune cell populations (\nn\n=\u20093\u20134 per group) in both blood and brain. Inflammatory responses were also characterized by immunohistochemistry (\nn\n=\u20094\u20136 per group) and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression (\nn\n=\u20094\u20136 per group). To determine delayed and persistent effects of post-injury SD, separate cohorts of male and female mice were divided as previously described and following 3 days of SD remained undisturbed for 4 additional days until sacrifice at 7 DPI. To determine post-injury SD effects on CORT responses, submandibular cheek bleeds were taken at 1 and 3 DPI (\nn\n=\u20096\u20138 per group). Delayed behavioral effects of post-injury SD were determined through elevated zero maze at 7 DPI immediately before sacrifice (\nn\n=\u200910\u201312 per group). Inflammatory responses were characterized by immunohistochemistry (\nn\n=\u20094\u20136 per group) and mRNA expression (\nn\n=\u20094\u20136 per group). An independent investigator blinded to experimental groups performed subsequent data analysis.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analysis was completed with GraphPad Prism. A mixed model factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) with correction for repeated measures was used to evaluate group differences in elevated zero maze performance and weight change. A mixed model ANOVA was selected because subject numbers varied between experimental groups.\n38\n,\n39\nFor all other analyses, a two-way ANOVA was used with correction for multiple comparisons and with injury (TBI, sham) and sleep (no SD, SD) as independent variables. Main effects of injury and SD, as well as interaction effects, were considered. The Holm-Sidak procedure was used for multiple comparisons following statistically significant main effects. Male and female mice were pooled for all analyses as no sex\u2009\u00d7\u2009injury\u2009\u00d7\u2009SD effects were identified. Statistical significance was determined as\np\n<\u20090.05. All data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM)."

    "Methods": "Animals and treatments\nAll animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Cincinnati (Cincinnati, OH). Male C57BL6/J mice between ages 8 and 10 weeks were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Female mice were excluded from our study given that higher levels of estrogen have been demonstrated to be independently neuroprotective in rodent TBI studies.\n17\n,\n18\nAnimals were housed in controlled conditions with a 12-h light-dark cycle and acclimated for at least 1 week before experiments. To pharmacologically inhibit Asm activity, mice received intraperitoneal injections of 10\u2009mg/kg of amitriptyline (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Amitriptyline was administered in 100\u2009\u03bcL of normal saline 1\u2009h after TBI or sham treatment. Identical volumes of normal saline were used as a vehicle control.\n19\nAsm-deficient mice (Asm\n\u2013/\u2013\n; genetic symbol,\nSmpd1\n\u2013/\u2013\n) were bred in-house on a C57BL/6 background.\n20\nGiven that Asm\n\u2013/\u2013\nmice can be difficult to breed and only have an average life span of 4 months, these mice were used to confirm differences in results when pharmacological inhibition of Asm was observed. Additionally, these mice are not suited to perform neuropsychiatric or motor skill testing at the age of 3 months because of significant motor and cognitive deficits.\n\nModerate traumatic brain injury model\nOur laboratory utilizes a single-impact weight-drop device to achieve a concussive TBI of moderate severity, based on mortality rate and righting reflex response time. This method has previously been described and reliably induces systemic and cerebral inflammation, motor, and cognitive impairment, as well as a mortality rate of 10%.\n21\u201323\nBriefly, mice were anesthetized with 2% inhaled isoflurane for 2\u2009min in 100% oxygen at 1\u2009L/min. Animals were placed in a prone position with the head centered under a 400-g cylindrical weight. The weight was dropped from a height of 1.5\u2009cm above the table surface and centered in both rostral/caudal and lateral directions. Sham mice were anesthetized, handled, and positioned below the impactor weight, but did not undergo TBI. Mice were euthanized after either 24\u2009h or 30 days for immunohistochemistry (IHC). A cohort of mice underwent behavioral studies at 30 days. All experimental groups began with 9 randomly chosen mice. Of these mice, between 5 and 9 survived the TBI. Based on the number of mice that survived, an equal number of sham mice were utilized (see\nSupplementary Material S1\n).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nTo assess hippocampal p-tau aggregation, mice were euthanized 30 days after the TBI. Mice were anesthetized with 0.1\u2009mg/kg of Pentasol (Virbac, Fort Worth, TX) and underwent cardiac perfusion with 10\u2009mL of 4\u00b0C 10% formalin over the course of 4\u2009min. Murine brains were collected and fixed in 10% formalin for 48\u2009h, serially dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin for coronal sectioning at 5\u2009\u03bcm.\nFor p-tau hippocampal IHC, sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and underwent epitope retrieval by pepsin digestion (Pepsin Solution Digest-All; Life Technologies, Frederick, MD). Sections were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and blocked with 5% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) in PBS for 1\u2009h. Next, sections were incubated at room temperature for 45\u2009min with rabbit polyclonal antitau (phosphor S262) antibody (diluted 1:100, ab131354; Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Sections were then washed in PBS/0.5% Tween 20 and incubated again for 45\u2009min at room temperature with Alexa Fluor 555\u2013labeled goat antirabbit antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Finally, sections were washed again in PBS/0.5% Tween 20, washed once more with PBS, and mounted in Vectashield with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) counterstaining. Rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was utilized as a negative isoform control during p-tau staining.\nTo assess hippocampal inflammatory cell and microglial presence, mice were euthanized either 24\u2009h or 30 days after TBI. The microglial markers, ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) and transmembrane protein 119 (Tmem119), were used. Iba1 is a well-described cell marker expressed by activated microglia and central nervous system (CNS) macrophages after TBI. Similarly, Tmem119 is a relatively novel microglial marker that is specific to microglia, but does not differentiate between activated and passive cell types. Mouse brains were fixed and paraffin-embedded as described previously. After deparaffinization and rehydration, sections underwent heat-induced epitope retrieval in sodium citrate buffer (10\u2009mM of sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween 20; pH 6.0). Sections were washed and blocked, as described previously, then incubated at room temperature for 45\u2009min with monoclonal mouse antimouse Iba1 (diluted 1:100, sc-32725; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) or monoclonal rabbit antimouse Tmem119 (diluted 1:500, ab209064; Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Sections were washed as described previously and incubated for 45\u2009min at room temperature with either Alexa Fluor 488\u2013labeled goat antirabbit or Alexa Fluor 594\u2013labeled goat antimouse antibodies (at 1:1000 dilution; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). After a final wash, sections were mounted in Vectashield with DAPI. Mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories) and rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories) were used for negative isoform controls during Iba1 and Tmem119 staining, respectively.\nAll IHC was imaged with a Nikon AIR GaAsP inverted microscope (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Phosphorylated tau aggregation was assessed using the 60\u2009\u00d7\u2009water immersion objection. Microglial markers were assessed using the 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009objections. Five separate hippocampal sections with five different fields per section were counted by a blinded investigator. Results are expressed as either a percentage or the total number of positive-stained cells per high-power field (hpf).\n\nNeuropsychiatric studies\nNeuropsychiatric testing was performed between 9:00\nam\nand 4:00\npm\nwith different tests performed on different days. The forced swim test was utilized to assess depressive symptoms whereas the dark-light test was chosen to determine symptoms of anxiety.\n28\u201333\nThe forced swim test was performed by placing mice in a clear cylindrical container measuring 55\u2009cm in height and 20\u2009cm in diameter that was approximately 75% full with room-temperature water. Mice spent a total of 6\u2009min in the water, and the total amount of time the animal spent immobile in the water was recorded. The first 2\u2009min were not recorded to allow for acclimation to the testing environment. The light-dark test consisted of a dark compartment and a brightly illuminated and open, and thus aversive, area. An aperture of 5\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009cm led from the dark box to the dark area. Each mouse was released in the dark compartment and observed for 5\u2009min. Total amount of time spent in the dark was recorded and compared among experimental groups.\nThe Rotarod (IITC Life Science, Woodland Hills, CA) was used to assess changes in motor deficits. Mice were evaluated for 4 consecutive days with the same settings each day. Mice began at an initial speed of 5 revolutions per minute (rpm) and were accelerated to 36\u2009rpm over 180\u2009sec. Each animal performed the task three times per day. Each trial ended when the mouse fell off the rod, held onto the rod and completed three complete revolutions, or remained on the rod for 180\u2009sec. Mean time to trial termination per day was recorded and expressed as a ratio of daily performance to initial performance.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was undertaken using the statistical software package, Prism (version 7; GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). Continuous data are reported as means with standard error. Two-tailed Student's\nt\n-tests were used to make comparisons between two groups, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's post-test was used to make comparisons between three or more groups. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used when comparing results from the Rotarod motor skills experiments. Categorical and discrete data are reported as percentages and rates with comparisons performed using chi-square analysis. A\np\nvalue of <0.05 was considered significant."

    "Methods": "Study design and population\nThe University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board approved this research. Informed consent was provided by next-of-kin for participants with TBI. TBI participants whose cognitive status improved sufficiently during the study period were later given the opportunity to self-consent. Healthy volunteers self-consented to provide blood samples.\nThe study cohorts presented here build on previous cohorts reported\n9\n,\n13\nand represent a prospective, longitudinal, observational study. We prospectively recruited individuals who were not on testosterone therapy from two cohorts. The first cohort presented to our university hospital level 1 trauma center with severe TBI, defined by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score \u22648 at presentation and confirmed computed tomographic findings, survived to acute care discharge, and agreed to be followed for 1 year (\u223c 12\u201315 months) post-injury. The second cohort presented with moderate or severe TBI (GCS <13), were admitted to acute inpatient rehabilitation after acute hospital discharge, and agreed to be followed for 1 year (\u223c 12\u201315 months) post-injury. This analysis included men 17\u201378 years of age, in whom we were able to collect at least two blood samples beginning at least 2 weeks after injury. Individuals were excluded if they had a history of hypothalamic or pituitary tumors, orchiectomy, luteinizing hormone (LH) therapy, untreated thyroid disease prior to injury, or hormone levels consistent with primary hypogonadism. Individuals were excluded in cases of primary hypogonadism, wherein hormone values for T were lower than our medical center pathology laboratory minimum normal T level while LH values were higher than the maximum cutoff across multiple sample points per subject.\nDemographic and injury information were obtained from patient records, including age, body mass index (BMI), education level, race, GCS score (best in 24\u2009h).\n35\ninjury severity score,\n36\nlength of hospital stay, mechanism of injury, and neuroradiology results from acute admission. Neuroimaging reports for computed tomography (CT) and MRI during acute hospital stay were available and analyzed for 128 men. Initial CT imaging reports were not available for those not presenting to our medical center for acute care.\nAs psychotropic medication use can impact neuroendocrine function,\n37\u201341\nwe assessed psychotropic medication use in our cohort based on guidelines and medication groups outlined by the National Alliance on Mental Illness.\n42\nAntipsychotics, mood stabilizers, antidepressants, anti-panic/anti-obsessive/anti-anxiety agents, stimulants, and opioid analgesics were reviewed (see\nSupplementary Table S1\n). The reported cohort (\nn\n=\u2009143) spanned two different data collection periods, which recorded medication data differently. For 64 individuals, medication use data were obtained during monthly collections over the 1 year study period. Medication data for 60 individuals were obtained at 6 and 12 months post-TBI only. Across both collection periods, there were 19 individuals for whom medication data collection was attempted but was unobtainable.\nFor the entire cohort with medication data available (\nn\n=\u2009124), individual research records were reviewed for medication usage in the categories presented in Table S1 at any time in the 1st year and by PHH status. Thus, in the total group (\nn\n=\u2009124), we explored associations between frequency of psychotropic medication use (ever reported at any time during the 1 year study period) and neuroendocrine dysfunction post-TBI. When possible, individuals (\nn\n=\u200964) were assessed for monthly use (yes/no) for each medication category based on\nSupplementary Table S1\n. Also, in the subgroup with monthly data, a cumulative psychotropic medication burden was assigned to individuals to account for number of medications used in addition to the duration of use (in months) for each medication. This psychotropic medication burden score was tabulated by taking medications reported multiplied by the number of months used for each medication (i.e., medication months). For example, if one medication was reported for 3 months, then a burden score of 3 was assigned. Similarly, if three medications were reported for 3 months each, then a medication burden score of 9 was assigned.\n\nDerivation of the cohorts used for analysis\nFigure 1\nshows how our cohort was derived based on the data available for analysis. 143 men (\nn\n=\u20091225 samples) had T and LH data generated that were used to clinically adjudicate PHH status over the course of 1 year post-injury. Of these men, 137 had autoantibody data (\nn\n=\u2009592 samples), and 138 (\nn\n=\u2009930 samples) had inflammation data measured up to 6 months post-TBI. Furthermore, 132 men out of this cohort had both autoantibody and inflammatory data for analysis. Of the 137 men with autoantibody data, 124 had at least two samples at time points over the course of the first 6 months post-TBI, meeting our criteria for group-based trajectory analysis (TRAJ).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nConsolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) flow chart. Out of the 143 men adjudicated for persistent hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (PHH), 137 had autoantibody data and 138 had inflammation data, and 132 participants had both autoantibody and inflammation data. Out of the 137 with autoantibody data, 124 individuals received trajectory group assignments. AAb, autoantibody; TRAJ, group-based trajectory analysis.\nUpon collection, samples were centrifuged, aliquoted in polypropylene cryovials, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until analysis. Healthy male volunteers provided blood samples to serve as a reference/control. Controls were 18\u201368 years of age and had no history of brain injury, neurological disorder, or endocrine disorder. Autoantibody levels were measured in 39 male volunteers (median age, 31 years; range 18\u201368 years). T and LH levels were measured in a subset of 11 male volunteers (median age, 21 years; range, 19\u201357 years).\n\nT and LH assays and PHH adjudication\nOf the 1225 samples utilized for this analysis, a portion of these serum samples (\nn\n=\u2009786 samples) were assayed for T and LH levels as described previously\n9\nusing a radioimmunoassay with the Coat-A-Count\n\u00ae\nIn-vitro Diagnostic Test Kit (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics). Kits included a solid-phase\n125\nI radioimmunoassay (RIA) designed for direct, quantitative measurements. T and LH inter-assay and intra-assays percent coefficients of variation (%CV) were all <10%. Samples with undetectable levels were assigned the minimum detection limit of the assay. The remaining samples (\nn\n=\u2009439 samples) were assayed for T (Monobind Inc.) and LH (BioVendor) levels using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The inter-assay and intra-assay %CV for both ELISAs were <10%, and any samples that fell below the detection limit were assigned the value of the detection limit for the respective assay. We measured T and LH for a subset of samples (\nn\n=\u200947 for T and\nn\n=\u200944 for LH) using both RIA and ELISA in order to determine a correlation between the two assay methodologies. Linear regression equations were generated for both T and LH data to fit the correlation between hormone measurements by RIA and ELISA. [(RIA T\u2009=\u20091.0023 x (ELISA T) +0.2451)] and [(RIA LH\u2009=\u20091.3248 x (ELISA LH) \u2013 0.2183)]. ELISA sample values were converted using these linear regression equations, and the measurements for the two assay types were pooled into one data set.\nPHH status was determined as reported in our prior work.\n9\nBriefly, individuals with at least two blood samples collected between 1 and 12 months post-injury were dichotomized into PHH or non-PHH groups. The average number of T and LH samples used per participant to adjudicate our cohort for PHH status was 8.57 samples. As per our previous reports,\n9\nthose with at least 50% of samples meeting criteria for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (T\u2009<\u200910\u2009nmol/L [minimum normal range level] with LH <5.6 IU/L [maximum normal range level]) were categorized as having PHH. Individuals with <50% of samples meeting these criteria were categorized in the non-PHH group.\n\nPituitary, hypothalamus, and GFAP autoantibody ELISA protocols\nAutoantibody levels were measured in serum (\nn\n=\u2009592 samples;\nn\n=\u2009137 subjects) using a customized direct ELISA approach. Briefly, custom 96-well ELISA plates were coated with antigens from bovine hypothalamic lysate (Science Cell Research, cat#0613) or bovine pituitary extract lysate (Sigma, cat#P1476) (2\u2009\u03bcg/well) or 50\u2009ng/well purified human full length GFAP protein (#DXAG-001, Dx-Sys, CA). After plate preparation, 1\u2009\u03bcL of human serum sample was mixed with 99\u2009\u03bcL of Start-Block buffer and transferred to each well (1:100 dilution) with incubation at 4\u00b0C overnight with shaking. Plates were washed again 4 times with Tris-Buffered Saline and Tween 20 (TBST) wash buffer. Anti-Human IgG/IgM HRP-conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch, as 1:10,000 in TBST Start-block blocking buffer) was added as a 100\u2009\u03bcL aliquot to each well. These secondary antibodies are specific to either human IgM or human IgG that distinguish subjects' titer for AGA, APA, or AHA IgG and IgM, respectively. Plates were incubated at 25\u00b0C, with shaking for 45\u2009min. After plate washing with 4x TBST, 100\u2009\u03bcL tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate was added to develop color for 15\u2009min. Stop Solution (100\u2009\u03bcL) was then added, and plates were read at 450\u2009nm for yellow color of final product.\nAs a part of assay development, two standard curves were constructed: one for human IgG, and one for human IgM using their respective antibody isotype (see\nFig. 2\n). It is important to note that these standard curves were not APA, AHA, or AGA specific, but rather, IgM or IgG specific. They were used on the same plate when assaying APA, AHA or AGA levels for our serum samples. Standard curves were introduced by adding 0, 17, 26, 39, 58.5, 88, 131.5, 198, 296, 444, 666, and 1000\u2009ng/mL (50\u2009\u03bcL) of either purified human IgG (Sigma Co. cat# I4506) or human IgM (Sigma Co. cat#I8260) to the first rows of the ELISA plate (see\nFig. 2\n). Upon blocking and washing as described, anti-human IgG or IgM HRP conjugate (1:10,000 in TBST Startblock blocking buffer) was added to these wells followed by TMB substrate addition. Thus, optical density readings reflect the presence of human APA, AHA, or AGA, IgG or IgM. These readings were converted to IgG or IgM concentration in \u03bcg/mL, and 50\u2009\u03bcL of standards were used, while 1\u2009\u03bcL of human serum per sample was loaded per assay; thus, a dilution factor of 50 was applied to determine the actual human subject APA, AHA, and AGA serum concentrations. Intra-assay %CV was 5\u201310%, and inter-assay %CV was 15\u201320%.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nImmunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG autoantibody standard curves. IgM and IgG class autoantibodies enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) standard curves used to calculate the anti-pituitary autoantibodies (APA), anti-hypothalamus autoantibodies (AHA), and anti- glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) autoantibody concentrations (titers) in human subject serum.\n(A)\nIgM standard curves,\n(B)\nIgG standard curves. Calculated IgG or IgM concentrations\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (STD) from four independent runs were shown. Linear regression fitting results are shown.\n\nPituitary and hypothalamic tissue immunohistochemical staining with APA and AHA in human TBI serum\nImmunocytochemistry (IHC) analysis was performed on human pituitary and human hypothalamus paraffin sections per vendor instructions (Zyagen, CA). Slides were first de-paraffinized through Trilogy solution (Cell Marque, CA) by incubating for 10\u2009min at 95\u00b0C and then blocked for endogenous peroxides with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Then routine staining was performed after a 1-h blocking step in 10% goat serum. TBI and control participants' serum, at a dilution of 1:200, was used and incubated over night at 4\u00b0C. Alexa 555-conjugated goat\u2013anti-human IgG or IgM secondary antibody (Invitrogen, CA) was added at a dilution of 1:1000 and incubated for 1\u2009h at room temperature. The tissues were counterstained with 4,6-diamidine-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 5\u2009min (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Fluorescent images were captured with an x40 objective on the OLYMPUS DP71 fluorescent microscope (Olympus America Inc., Center Valley, PA).\n\nInflammatory marker Luminex\u2122 bead assay\nCytokine levels were measured in serum (\nn\n=\u2009930 samples) using a Luminex bead array assay (Millipore, Billerica, MA). These multiplex assays used microsphere technology in which assay beads were tagged with various fluorescent-labeled markers. The binding for each protein onto the multiplex bead was analyzed with a fluorescence detection laser optic system. The human high sensitivity T cell magnetic bead panel included interleukin (IL)-10, IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-21, IL-4, IL-23, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, fractalkine (CX3CL1), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon (IFN)-inducible T-cell alpha chemoattractant (ITAC), and IFN-\u03b3. The intra-assay %CV was <5%. The inter-assay %CV was <20%. The human neurodegenerative disease magnetic bead included soluble intracellular adhesion molecule (sICAM)-1, regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), and soluble vascular adhesion molecule (sVCAM)-1. Intra-assay %CV was <6%, and inter-assay %CV was <13%. The human soluble cytokine receptor magnetic bead panel included soluble (s) sCD30, soluble glycoprotein (sgp)130, soluble IL-1 receptor (sIL-1R)-I, sIL-1RII, sIL-2\u03b1, sIL-4R, sIL-6R, sTNFRI, and sTNFRII. The intra-assay %CV was <10% while inter-assay %CV was <15%.\n\nGroup-based trajectory analysis\nTo assess temporal serum APA and AHA profiles over the first 6 months post-injury, we applied TRAJ\n43\nas previously reported.\n44\u201349\nTRAJ analysis is a data-driven technique that leverages longitudinal patterns of a time-varying variable in order to identify distinct subgroups within the population expressing similar temporal levels over time. Data from samples collected 1\u20136 months post-injury were binned to create monthly values. TRAJ analysis was conducted after rank transformation of the monthly autoantibody data and yielded two TRAJ groups (\nhigh\nand\nlow\n) for IgM APA and AHA autoantibodies. The two-group model output for each autoantibody marker had an optimal Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and excellent posterior probabilities (> 90%) were achieved for all TRAJ group assignments. We used TRAJ group membership to classify individuals and identify individuals with discordant APA versus AHA autoantibody profiles over time for which to conduct the fluorescent immune-histochemical staining analysis to assess the specificity of APA and AHA for pituitary and hypothalamic tissues respectively. APA and AHA TRAJ group membership were also tested for concordance and for associations with T levels over time.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed with SAS (Statistical Analysis Software) version 9.4 (Cary, NC). Reported variables were assessed for normality using Shapiro\u2013Wilk tests. Age, autoantibody levels (APA, AHA, AGA), hormone levels, BMI, GCS score, length of hospital stay, and medications (use duration and cumulative medication burden) were reported as a median with interquartile range (IQR). Mann\u2013Whitney\nU\ntests were used to assess differences among PHH and non-PHH groups. Group differences for categorical data, including education level, race, mechanism of injury, radiographic injury type, and psychotropic medication use (yes/no) were assessed using \u03c7\n2\nor Fisher's exact tests as appropriate.\nAutoantibody and inflammatory marker levels from multiple serum samples over the 1\u20136-month period were averaged for each individual. Between-group differences with autoantibodies and inflammatory markers and PHH were examined using Mann\u2013Whitney\nU\ntests or Kruskal\u2013Wallis tests. Because repeated measurements were taken on participants over a longitudinal time course, we also used a mixed effects regression model with an unstructured covariance pattern to assess APA and AHA TRAJ group differences in T levels over time. Spearman correlations were used to assess associations between age and 1\u20136\u2013month mean T, LH, autoantibody, and inflammatory marker levels.\nBinary logistical regression models were generated to assess associations between independent variables and a dichotomous dependent variable such as PHH status or autoantibody TRAJ group membership. Multivariable regression was used to test associations between APA and AHA IgM and PHH while adjusting for injury severity (GCS). Additionally, the association between age and PHH was investigated for potential associations with AHA IgM levels as biomarker mediating this relationship. A four-step process was used to test mediation effects outlined by Baron and Kenny.\n50\nCovariate (GCS score) adjusted models were run to test associations between age and PHH directly and after adjustment for AHA IgM, to assess a potential role for this AAb as a mediator. The percent mediation was calculated using Y-standardization method appropriate for logistical regressions with binary outcome as suggested in a recent article by Rijnhart and coworkers.\n51\nP\nvalues <0.05 were considered significant."

    "Methods": "Participants\nParticipants were drawn from a prospective, longitudinal study evaluating outcomes of children who were hospitalized overnight for a mild to severe TBI or OI between the ages of 3 and 7 years.\n64\n,\n65\nRecruitment occurred at three tertiary care children's hospitals and one tertiary care, general hospital in Ohio. Participants in both injury groups (TBI and OI) completed a total of six research assessments across multiple visits, including a baseline assessment during the immediate post-acute period (0\u20133 months after injury); assessments at 6, 12, and 18 months and \u223c3.5 years post-injury; and a final long-term follow-up assessment an average of 6.8 (\u00b11.1) years post-injury. Outcome data presented herein are from the final long-term follow-up assessment.\nInclusion criteria were hospitalization overnight for traumatic injury (TBI or OI), no evidence of child abuse as the cause of the injury, no history of documented neurological problems or developmental delays pre-injury, and English as the primary language spoken in the home. TBI severity was determined using the lowest post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score.\n66\nMild TBI was defined as a GCS score \u226513 without abnormal neuroimaging. Moderate TBI was defined as a GCS score of 9\u201312 with or without abnormal neuroimaging or a higher GCS score with abnormal neuroimaging as defined by an intracranial or parenchymal injury or depressed skull fracture. Severe TBI was defined as a GCS score \u22648. The OI group included children who sustained a bone fracture (not including skull fractures), had an overnight stay in the hospital, and did not exhibit alterations in consciousness or other signs or symptoms of head trauma or brain injury. The study was approved by the institutional review boards at each of the participating medical centers, and informed consent was obtained from participating caregivers.\n\nOutcome measures\nParticipants in both injury groups and their parents completed a range of outcome measures at each research assessment, including performance-based neuropsychological measures,\n4\n,\n67\nobservational measures of the home environment,\n65\n,\n68\n,\n69\nparent\u2013child interactions,\n70\u201372\nand classroom functioning,\n5\n,\n69\nand parent-report measures of the family environment\n65\n,\n73\n,\n74\nand child functioning.\n64\n,\n75\nIn the present report, we selected parent-report measures of child behavioral adjustment and executive functioning as the primary measures of interest because these domains are among the most commonly affected by pediatric TBI\n76\u201378\nand are persistent\n79\n,\n80\nand associated with significant functional impairment.\n4\n,\n81\n,\n82\nIn addition, these measures could be completed by parents remotely, thereby providing the largest sample size among the various outcomes measures collected.\nParents completed the age-appropriate forms of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL\n83\n) at each timepoint, with the baseline assessment based on the child's function prior to injury and used as a covariate in analyses to control for pre-morbid differences in child functioning. The BRIEF is a parent-report measure of child executive function as evident in everyday behavior.\n84\nWe analyzed the age-standardized global executive composite\nT\nscore (BRIEF GEC) to assess global executive function behaviors. Higher scores reflect poorer executive functioning. The CBCL is a parent-report measure of child behavioral adjustment and possesses high test\u2013retest reliability and criterion-related validity. We analyzed the age- and sex-standardized Total Problems\nT\nscore to assess child behavioral adjustment. Higher scores reflect poorer behavioral adjustment. Both outcome measures are National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)-recommended common data elements for pediatric TBI and are well validated for the pediatric TBI population.\n85\n\nDNA Collection, Genotyping, and Quality Control\nDNA was collected from saliva samples and purified using Oragene OG-500 self-collection tubes (DNA Genotek, Ottawa, Canada). Oragene allows the collection, stabilization, and long-term storage of DNA from saliva at ambient temperature. Salivary DNA is a valid and reliable alternative to blood DNA for high-throughput genotyping. The HumanExome v1.1 Bead Chip (Illumina, San Diego, CA) was used to perform genotyping using the Illumina iScan system. SNPs from the sex chromosome, mitochondria, and indels were excluded. Quality of SNP calls from the chip were also evaluated. SNPs that failed Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium (\np\n<\u20090.0001) or had minor allele frequencies <10% were excluded. Thresholds for quality control for call rates at individual and SNP levels were 99% and 90%, respectively.\n\nCandidate gene selection and SNPs available for analysis\nBased on results of our prior systematic literature search,\n8\nwe identified candidate genes that met three criteria: (1) previously associated with TBI outcomes in clinical studies, (2) available on the HumanExome v1.1 Bead Chip, and (3) passed quality control. Because our interest was in inflammatory-related genes, we focused on genes associated with inflammatory-related biologic pathways based upon a systems-biology analysis.\n8\nInflammatory genes identified from the prior systematic literature search included ACE, ADORA1, BDNF, IL1\u03b2, IL1RN, IL6, NT5E, and TNF. Of these, ACE, ADORA1, BDNF, IL1RN, and NT5E were available for analysis on the HumanExome v1.1 Bead Chip. Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) was used to annotate SNPs with respect to associated gene and type of variant (\nhttps://cadd.gs.washington.edu/\n).\n86\nSNPs located in intergenic regions and not associated with a specific gene according to CADD annotation were excluded prior to analysis.

Prior to analyses, child outcome data were reviewed for plausibility according to the following rules to reduce the potential influence of outliers: (1) participants with changes in outcome scores between 6 months post-injury and the long-term time point that exceeded three standard deviations of change were excluded from respective analyses (\nn\n=\u20092 from BRIEF analysis;\nn\n=\u20090 from CBCL analysis); and (2) outcome scores of\nT\n>\u200990 (4 standard deviations above the normative mean) were winsorized to 90 (\nn\n=\u20095 from BRIEF analysis;\nn\n=\u20091 from CBCL analysis).\nCryptic relatedness was checked using Graphical Representation of Relationships (GRR)\n87\n(\nhttp://csg.sph.umich.edu/abecasis/GRR\n). Principal component analysis was employed to confirm European and African continental ancestry, which aligns with self-reported white and black race, using 200 validated ancestry informative markers and HapMap genotypic data from individuals of known ancestry as referent groups. Concordance with self-reported race was >95%. The first principal component was used as a covariate in regression models to adjust for racial variability.\nTo select SNPs for inclusion in our PRS, we employed general linear regression models to examine associations between available individual SNPs in each of the five inflammatory response genes and each outcome (executive function and behavioral adjustment) in the TBI group only. In all association tests, we used an additive genetic model in which major homozygotes were coded as 0, heterozygotes were coded as 1, and minor homozygotes were coded as 2. We chose a nominal threshold of\np\n\u2264\u20090.20 for inclusion of SNPs into our PRS. A less stringent threshold for inclusion into PRS, relative to thresholds used in testing individual SNP associations, is considered appropriate to achieve a balance between the number of false-positive and true-positive risk alleles.\n56\n,\n88\nConsistent with prior PRS studies, we considered two PRS approaches: unweighted and weighted. Unweighted PRS for each outcome were computed as a summation of risk alleles meeting the inclusion threshold. Weighted PRS for each outcome were computed as a summation of risk alleles meeting the inclusion threshold multiplied by their respective \u03b2 values extracted from general linear regression models. Finally, to test the differential effect of the inflammatory response PRS on neurobehavioral recovery in children with TBI relative to children with OI, we employed linear regression models using data for all participants for each outcome and tested the PRS\u2009\u00d7\u2009injury group (TBI vs. OI) interaction term. Covariates initially included in regression models and then trimmed if non-significant were continental ancestry principal component 1, the child's pre-morbid functioning on the measure of interest, and socioeconomic status (SES), defined by averaging sample\nz\nscores for maternal education and median income.\n65\nPost-hoc exploration of significant PRS\u2009\u00d7\u2009injury group interaction terms used linear regression to examine the effect of PRS over and above significant covariates within each injury group."

    "Methods": "Participants\nThe analysis cohort consisted of 433 children between the ages of 31 months and 15 years of age who were enrolled in a longitudinal, prospective cohort recruited from two level 1 pediatric trauma centers: Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah and the University of Texas Health Science Center between January 2013 and September 2016 (\nFig. S1\n). Methods of recruitment and follow-up have been previously reported.\n20\nIn brief, families of children were approached in the ED or inpatient units of the two participating hospitals. Children were recruited according to age group and TBI severity strata defined by ED GCS score and imaging. Families completed a pre-injury survey as soon as possible after injury to establish children's baseline function and then completed 6- and 12-month interviews online or by telephone to establish outcomes. Online and phone surveys achieve similar results in pediatric TBI,\n21\nas do interviews and self-administered questionnaires in adult TBI.\n22\nChildren who died in hospital were not included, as the goal of the study was to establish longer-term outcomes. The institutional review boards of both institutions approved the study.\n\nMeasures\nClinical variables\nThree trained study coordinators abstracted data about children's clinical condition and history from the medical and transport records using a standardized form. Clinical variables included children's blood pressure (lowest measured in the ED), sedation at the time of GCS, whether they had a pre-hospital or ED seizure or loss of consciousness, and intubation status. Hypotension was classified as yes/no according to Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) age-based guidelines.\n23\nGCS\nThe lowest ED post-resuscitation pediatric GCS was abstracted from the medical record. If more than one GCS score was available, study coordinators used a pre-specified hierarchy to choose the score starting with the trauma attending. The GCS scores eye opening (1\u20134), verbal (1\u20135), and motor (1\u20136) responses separately and is summed for a total score that ranges from 3 to 15. Injury severity was originally defined based on ED GCS and was grouped as severe (GCS \u22648), moderate (GCS 9\u201312), and mild (GCS 13\u201315). Mild was subcategorized as complicated mild TBI if a child had a GCS of 13\u201315 and the presence of intracranial injury on CT scan. GCS was collected also at 24 and 48\u2009h post-admission for hospitalized children and more frequently for children in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Because prior studies have reported that the motor GCS is equally predictive as the total GCS,\n15\n,\n16\nthe time to return of the GCS motor score of 6 was recorded for hospitalized children and categorized into <12\u2009h, 12 to <24\u2009h, 24 to <48\u2009h, and \u226548\u2009h. GCS was assumed to be 15 (motor component of 6) at 12\u2009h for children who were discharged home from the ED.\nAIS\nThe AIS is an anatomically based injury scale that is scored for six body regions including the head. The scale ranges from 1 (minor injury) to 6 (maximal injury).\n12\nThe AIS score was assigned by trauma registrars at each institution. AIS scores of \u22653 are commonly grouped as severe injury.\n24\nWe grouped AIS scores in a more granular fashion (0\u20132, 3\u20134, 5\u20136) reflecting the comparison of AIS to GCS in a study by Rogers and Trickey.\n25\nRotterdam score\nThe Rotterdam score was chosen as an imaging measure because it has been validated as a predictive score in children.\n10\n,\n11\nThe Rotterdam score ranges from 1 to 6: elements include status of the basilar cisterns, presence/degree of midline shift, epidural mass lesion, and intraventricular or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Low Rotterdam scores predict better outcomes. The initial CT scan was read and scored by a neuroradiologist at each institution.\nFamily environment\nThe Social Capital Index measures people's connection to their community including perceptions of personal, family, neighborhood, and spiritual community support on a scale of 1\u20135, with higher scores indicating better social capital.\n26\nFamily function was assessed using the McMaster Family Assessment Device (FAD) \u2013 General Functioning Scale.\n27\nThe FAD includes 12 items scored 1 to 4, with higher scores representing worse functioning. Families self-reported their income category by family size, from which their poverty level was calculated using federal norms. Family environment covariates are used for external validation of the LCA model.\n\nOutcomes\nParent-reported outcomes, available for 376 children, included one functional outcome assessed at 6 and 12 months, and one behavioral measure assessed retrospectively at study entry to characterize pre-injury functioning, and prospectively at 12 months. Functional outcome was measured with the Pediatric Injury Functional Outcome Scale (PIFOS).\n28\nThe PIFOS, an injury-specific measure that quantifies motor, cognitive, communication, social-emotional, self-care, physical, and academic function among children 3\u201315 years of age, has been used in prior TBI studies.\n29\nThe PIFOS has good internal consistency (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.90\u20130.93) and inter-rater reliability (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.9), and is correlated significantly with multiple measures including the Glasgow Outcome Scale.\n30\nHigher PIFOS scores represent worse function. The behavioral outcomes were the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) working memory and emotional control T-scores.\n31\n,\n32\nThe BRIEF is a parent rating scale of everyday executive skills involved in behavioral regulation and metacognition with high test\u2013retest reliability (0.82\u20130.88). The BRIEF pre-school version (BRIEF-P) was used for children <5 years of age.\n33\nT-scores are based on normative data for age and sex with higher T-scores representing more difficulties. BRIEF outcomes were evaluated as the difference in T-score from pre-injury to 12 months.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe goal of LCA is to identify clinically meaningful and distinct subgroups based on patterns in observed variables. Two sets of parameters are estimated from the LCA model: class membership probabilities (i.e., the proportion of a population expected to belong to each class) and item-response probabilities (i.e., the probability of an indicator variable being endorsed given the latent class).\n34\nWe\na priori\nidentified key clinical indicators available in the first 48\u2009h following injury to identify latent classes of TBI severity: pre-hospital loss of consciousness, lowest ED GCS score, Head AIS, Rotterdam score, and hours to motor GCS of 6. With this core set of variables, we considered models with up to five latent classes. The final number of latent classes, as well as appropriate cut-points for indicator variables, were selected based on clinical judgment and statistical measures of model fit. Measures of model fit included: Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), entropy (summarizing how well the classes separate), and likelihood ratio tests comparing models with different numbers of classes. After the core model was finalized, we evaluated whether any of the following variables would improve separation between latent classes: intubation, sedation at time of GCS, seizure, hypotension, and other bodily injury (non-head AIS \u22653). Of these measures, only hypotension improved model fit and was retained. Latent class models were implemented in Mplus.\n35\nWe then assessed whether the latent class membership was predictive of clinically meaningful outcomes. Based on each individual's assigned latent class (defined as the class with the highest model-predicted probability of membership), we analyzed the association between latent class and outcomes at 6 and 12 months following injury. Mean outcomes and standard deviations were described by latent class, and, for comparison, by the original GCS assigned severity classification, and as a secondary comparison, by grouped AIS scores. Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) was used to compare model fit for the three severity measures. We also calculated pairwise differences in mean outcomes between groups with 95% confidence intervals. Standard errors were based on analysis of variance for BRIEF outcomes, and a mixed model framework allowing for different variances across groups for the PIFOS outcomes. Statistical significance of paired outcome differences was assessed using the Tukey\u2013Kramer method with a familywise error rate of \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05. These analyses were implemented in SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC)."

    "Methods": "Participants\nParticipants were enrolled in the pediatric branch of the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in TBI (TRACK-TBI) study from March of 2014 to March of 2018. Inclusion criteria for TRACK-TBI were presentation to a study emergency department (ED) within 24\u2009h after sustaining at least a mild TBI per the American College of Rehabilitation Medicine definition,\n29\nfor which neuroimaging was required on clinical grounds. As part of standard clinical practice, computed tomography (CT) scan use was generally guided by clinical decision rules aimed at reducing unnecessary radiation.\n30\nHowever, some children underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans that were available in the ED, which had no risk of radiation.\n30\nChildren with significant polytrauma or spinal cord injury or significant baseline neurodevelopmental deficits were not enrolled. Children in state custody were not enrolled because of the complexities of obtaining consent within 24\u2009h of injury and the need for caregivers with intimate knowledge of the child's pre-injury history and availability for longitudinal follow-up. This study included TRACK-TBI participants 3\u201316 years of age with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 13\u201315 in the ED, and with no need for neurosurgical intervention. Informed consent was obtained from parents/guardians and, when not precluded by the severity of the injury, directly from adolescents 14\u201316 years of age, with assent obtained for children 7\u201313 years of age All data were collected in agreement with local institutional review boards.\nA total of 76 subjects met study criteria, of which 50 (66%) had complete GOSE-P and Health and Behavior Inventory (HBI) data 2 weeks and 3 months following injury and were included in the analyses. There were no differences in age (\np\n=\u20090.52) or the proportion of subjects with GCS of 13\u201314 (\np\n=\u20091.00) between those with and without complete outcome data. A higher proportion of subjects with incomplete data were Hispanic and/or non-white (\np\n<\u20090.01), female (\np\n=\u20090.02), had multi-system versus single-system extracranial injuries (\np\n<\u20090.01), or had motor vehicle-related injuries (\np\n<\u20090.01).

A history of attention-deficit disorder (ADD) or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was reported in 20% of subjects. Falls were the most common mechanism of injury (56%), followed by motor vehicle accidents (22%), and sports injuries (16%). Loss of consciousness (LOC) was reported in 46% of the subjects, and 76% had a worst GCS of 15 in the ED. Extracranial injuries were observed in 16% of the sample.

Demographic information and medical history were collected via participant or parent interview.\n\nMeasures\nGOSE-P\nThe GOSE-P includes a structured interview of parents and/or guardians regarding changes in function following injury across seven areas: consciousness, independence in the home, independence outside the home, school/work, social and leisure activities, family and friendships, and return to normal life.\n10\nChildren are scored into one of eight disability categories based on parental responses to the structured interview prompts; overall disability categories are described in\nTable 2\n.\nTable 2.\nCollapsed GOSE-P Categories with Sample Behaviors\nGOSE-P categories\nStudy group\nRestriction examples\n1) Upper Good Recovery\nNo functional deficit\nNo problems relating to the injury affecting daily life\n2) Lower Good Recovery\nMild functional deficit\nSchool: reduced capacity\nSocial/Leisure: Participates a bit or much less\nFamily/Friendships: occasional problems or frequent but tolerable problems\n3) Upper Moderate Disability\n4) Lower Moderate Disability\nSignificant functional deficit\nSchool: attends school for severely injured children, tutored at home, unable to attend school\nSocial/Leisure: rarely engages or is unable to participate\nFamily/Friendships: constant problems or intolerable problems\nHome: increased dependence on caregivers\n5) Upper Severe Disability\n6) Lower Severe Disability\n7) Vegetative state\na\n8) Death\na\nOpen in a separate window\na\nNo subjects scored a 7 or 8 on the GOSE-P.\nGiven the focus of the study on mild TBI, in which it would be expected that few children would have severe post-injury deficits,\n33\n,\n34\nand given our sample size, we elected to collapse the GOSE-P disability categories from eight to three categories based on the descriptions of behaviors in the GOSE-P structured interview prompts. We conceptualized three functional deficit groups that included children with \u201cNo Functional Deficits,\u201d \u201cMild Functional Deficits,\u201d and \u201cSignificant Functional Deficits.\u201d The \u201cUpper Good Recovery\u201d category (GOSE-P score of 1) was considered the \u201cNo Functional Deficit\u201d group.\n35\nThe \u201cLower Good Recovery\u201d and \u201cUpper Moderate Disability\u201d groups (GOSE-P scores of 2 and 3) were collapsed into a \u201cMild Functional Deficit\u201d group, reflecting continued participation in activities but with some limitations. The \u201cLower Moderate Disability\u201d or worse groups (GOSE-P scores of 4\u20138) were collapsed into a \u201cSignificant Functional Deficit\u201d group reflecting severely limited participation in activities, disabling disruptive behavior, or decreased independence with activities of daily living (ADLs). The collapsed categories and sample behaviors from the structured interview prompts are described in\nTable 2\n.\nTo examine the level of agreement between the GOSE-P and the HBI in identifying children with post-injury deficits, the GOSE-P scores were collapsed into two groups. Participants rated as GOSE-P 1 (\u201cUpper Good Recovery\u201d) were considered to have \u201cno deficits,\u201d whereas those scored as GOSE-P 2-8 (\u201cLower Good Recovery\u201d or worse) were considered to have \u201cdeficits.\u201d To examine agreement between the GOSE-P and the HBI in identifying children who improved from 2 weeks to 3 months, children who improved by at least one GOSE-P category were considered \u201cimproved,\u201d whereas those scoring the same or worse were \u201cnot improved.\u201d\nHBI\nThe HBI is a 20-item scale used to assess the severity of cognitive and somatic TBI-related symptoms in children.\n23\n,\n24\nThe HBI has demonstrated adequate construct validity, internal consistency reliability, and the ability to monitor children's symptoms longitudinally, and is used clinically as part of the Child Sport Concussion Assessment Tool-5.\n24\n,\n28\n,\n36\n,\n37\nThe HBI includes a child-rated version and a parent-rated version; the latter was used for this analysis. In the parent-rated version, parents rate the frequency that their child experienced specific somatic and cognitive symptoms during the previous week and the 4 weeks before injury via the HBI.\n24\nThe severity of somatic, cognitive, and total symptoms is then calculated by summing the frequency scores in the respective domain. To examine agreement with the GOSE-P, HBI scores were dichotomized. At 2 weeks, those exhibiting a reliable\nincrease\nin symptoms compared with pre-injury ratings were considered to have deficits. At 3 months, children exhibiting a reliable\ndecrease\nin symptoms since the 2 week time point were considered to have improved.\n38\nOur reliable change methodology is described further below.\nThe GOSE-P and HBI were completed at 2 weeks (\u00b1 4 days) and 3 months (\u00b1 7 days) post-injury. At 2 weeks, assessments were typically completed in person, but 3 (6%) participants were unable to attend in person, so they completed the assessments via phone. At 3 months, all assessments were completed via phone.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 (SPSS Inc., Armonk, NY). Medians, interquartile ranges (IQR), means, SDs, and percentages were used to describe the sample. Fisher's exact and Mann\u2013Whitney\nU\ntests were used to examine differences between children included versus those excluded because of missing outcome data. Kruskal\u2013Wallis tests were used to determine differences in cognitive, somatic, and total symptom severity between the three collapsed GOSE-P categories at each time point (2 weeks and 3 months) and any differences in pre-injury symptom severity among the GOSE-P categories. For significant group differences, post-hoc analyses were performed using Dunn's test with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.\n39\nFor each analysis, the E\n2\nestimate of effect size was calculated.\n40\nAgreement between the HBI and the GOSE-P for identifying both deficit and improvement was assessed using Cohen's \u03ba. Values of <0.20 were considered to have \u201cpoor,\u201d those of 0.21\u20130.40 were considered to have \u201cfair,\u201d those of 0.41\u20130.60 were considered to have \u201cmoderate,\u201d those of 0.61\u20130.80 were considered to have \u201cgood,\u201d and those of >0.81 were considered to have \u201cvery good\u201d agreement.\n41\nEach analysis was completed, both including and excluding those with extracranial injuries, and differences in effect sizes were compared.\nReliable change confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to determine if each child showed a statistically reliable increase or decrease in symptoms. Reliable change CI are used to determine if changes in psychological test scores represent change beyond measurement error.\n42\u201351\nA CI is created by multiplying the standard error of the difference (SE\ndiff\n) by the z score associated with the desired level of confidence to create an estimate of measurement error surrounding the difference score between repeated measurements. When test\u2013retest data are available, the SE\ndiff\nis calculated using the standard error of measurement (SEM) calculated for each time point as follows: SEM\u2009=\nS\nD\n1\n\u2212\nr\n12\n(where SD is standard deviation for the respective time point and\nr\n12\nis the test\u2013retest reliability coefficient). SE\ndiff\nis calculated as follows: SE\ndiff\n=\nS\nE\nM\n1\n2\n+\nS\nE\nM\n2\n2\nIf retest data are not available, an \u201cestimated\u201d SE\ndiff\nhas been recommended by multiplying the squared SEM for time 1 by 2, and taking the square root (i.e.,\n2\nS\nE\nM\n1\n2\n).\n45\n,\n52\n,\n53\nFor the HBI, test\u2013retest data have not been published for a sample that would be appropriate to calculate reliable change estimates for the present study. Therefore, we used the estimated SE\ndiff\nformula calculated from the parent ratings of the 50 subjects in the present study obtained 2 weeks post-injury."

    "Methods": "The design, patient inclusion and exclusion criteria, procedures, assessments, outcome measures, study oversight, and statistical analysis of the DECRA trial have been previously described.12The surgical procedure was a modification of the Kjellberg method,16which had tested favorably in a cohort study.17The only surgical modification entailed not dividing the sagittal sinus and falx, to minimize complications, decrease anterior herniation of the frontal lobes, and increase generalizability.18Randomization occurred after ICU admission, when ICP had increased sufficiently to satisfy the enrollment criteria.12Patients in the intensive medical control group could receive barbiturate infusions to control ICP, but not hypothermia. Baseline variables were well matched except for pupil reactivity at hospital admission, and outcomes at 6 months favored the intensive medical control group.\n\nFunctional outcome assessments were conducted by trained assessors, blind to treatment group, using standardized questionnaires.15,19Functional outcome assessments at 12 months after injury, and among survivors at 6 and 12 months, were pre-planned14and measured by the score on the GOS-E, which is scored from 1 (dead) to 8 (pre-injury function).20Among survivors, favorable outcomes were calculated as the ratio of GOS-E scores 5\u20138 over 2\u20138, and good outcomes as GOS-E scores of 7\u20138 over 2\u20138.\n\nFunctional (GOS-E) outcomes were dichotomized asunfavorable(1\u20134 vs. 5\u20138), and analyzed using logistic regression. Outcomes (GOS-E) on a 1\u20138 scale were analyzed using ordinal logistic regression. Among survivors at 6 and 12 months after injury, GOS-E outcomes were analyzed using logistic regression for favorable outcomes, and for three additional dichotomies:vegetative(2 vs. 3\u20138),poor outcomes(2\u20134 vs. 5\u20138), andgood outcomes(7\u20138 vs. 2\u20136). The last three were post hoc exploratory analyses.\n\nMultiple covariates influence patient outcomes after TBI, but there were too many to reliably adjust for in a medium-sized randomized trial. We therefore adjusted using a single summary measure of brain injury severity\u2014the estimated probability of unfavorable outcome from the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI (IMPACT) core and extended algorithms.21IMPACT outcome probabilities are derived from large databases of patients with TBI, and include the relevant covariates, that is, IMPACTcoreincluding age, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) motor score, pupil reactivity; and IMPACTextended,which also includes CT score, and hypoxic and hypotensive events. The single IMPACT outcome probability value provides an overall summary measure of TBI severity in both study groups (Table 1). TBI severity can be difficult to assess when covariates are many, or move in different directions. We used pupil reactivity at trial randomization for these calculations, as this measure best reflects a patient's post-resuscitation neurology, more so than does pupil reactivity at hospital admission, which we had used previously.12Patient outcomes at 6 and 12 months post-injury were adjusted for the probability of an unfavorable outcome by using the IMPACT value as a continuous variable in the linear predictor of the appropriate regression model. The IMPACT extended model provided maximal adjustment but included missing data on hypoxia/hypertension for seven patients who were hence excluded; the IMPACT core probability of unfavorable outcome could be calculated for all 155 patients, and was the primary adjustment covariate.\n\nAn unplanned exploratory as-treated analysis was also conducted of all patients who received a decompressive craniectomy at any time after randomization compared with all those who did not, regardless of randomized group. We wished to explore the effect on our results of the 18% of standard care patients who had received a late craniectomy as permitted in the protocol as a life-saving intervention. Owing to likely imbalance in severity, all these analyses were adjusted for the IMPACT core probability of unfavorable outcome."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll animal studies were conducted in accordance with the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and were approved by the University of Iowa and Iowa City Veterans Affairs Institutional Animal Care and Use committee. Studies were conducted on male C57BL/6J mice purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) aged 2\u20134 months, with an average weight of 26.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3\u2009g. A total of 125 mice were used for this study, and all were assigned randomly to injury conditions and treatment groups. Some mice were utilized to validate the retinal response to repetitive bTBI, while others were used to test the effects of anakinra (\nSupplementary Table S1\n). Mice were housed under a 12-h light-dark cycle with\nad libitum\naccess to food and water.\n\nBlast injury induction\nAn enclosed blast chamber was used, one half of which was pressurized, as described previously.\n36\nA plastic Mylar membrane (Mylar A, 0.00142 gauge; Vountry Plastics, Ames, IA) was placed over a 13-cm opening that separates the sides of the chamber. The unpressurized side of the tank contained a padded polyvinyl chloride (PVC) protective restraint in which to place an anesthetized mouse 30\u2009cm from the Mylar membrane. Compressed air was pumped into the pressurized side of the chamber until the membrane ruptured at 20 \u00b1 0.2 psi (137.8 \u00b1 1.3\u2009kPa, mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean [SEM]), creating a blast wave. Because many veterans are exposed to multiple blast exposures, we administered three injuries to each mouse to mimic human injuries.\n10\n,\n37\u201339\nMice were oriented within the chamber with the left side of the head positioned toward the blast wave (direct exposure) and the right side facing away from the direction of the blast wave (indirect exposure) and then exposed to three blast injuries, each 1\u2009h apart (\nFig. 1\n). The mouse's body was shielded via the PVC restraint to limit blast wave pressure exposure primarily to the head; the head was allowed to move freely and was not in a fixed position. All analysis was conducted on the left (ipsilateral) side that was exposed directly to the blast wave, because we cannot discount potential interaction of the contralateral eye with the padded holder, or potential confounding, rebounding blast waves from the surface of the animal holder.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSchematic representation of blast exposure. Exposure to blast wave pressure was conducted as described previously.\n23\nAnimals were placed lateral to the shock tube axis, 30\u2009cm from the origin of the blast wave (Mylar membrane), with the left (L) side of the head (ipsilateral eye) facing the blast wave. (\nA\n) Control mice were restrained the same way, but were not exposed to the blast wave. (\nB\n) A representative tracing of a 20\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2 psi (137.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3\u2009kPa, mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM) blast wave.\nMice were anesthetized with a combination of ketamine (30\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneal [IP]) and xylazine (5\u2009mg/kg, IP) before each blast or sham-blast and were placed on a heating pad immediately after blast injury to prevent hypothermia and facilitate recovery from general anesthesia. Xylazine anesthesia was reversed with yohimbine chloride (0.001\u2009mg/g, IP) to aid in recovery from anesthesia. Control mice underwent an identical process in all respects except that they did not receive a blast exposure when placed in the chamber. Both blasted and sham mice were given an IP injection (0.1\u2009mL/20g body weight) of buprenorphine (0.003\u2009mg/mL) immediately after the blast or sham-blast, respectively.\n\nRegional brain dissection\nBrains from sham and blast mice were isolated and regionally dissected to generally separate major portions of the brain. The cerebellum (CB) and brainstem (BS; includes the midbrain and hindbrain) were isolated. Standard dissection of the hippocampus (HIPP) was then performed,\n40\nfollowed by separation of the cortex (CTX). What remained was the extra forebrain (XFB) tissue block containing striatum, thalamus, hypothalamus, and visual white matter tracts. The samples harvested were used to determine the effects of blast injury on cytokine expression in the brain via real time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR, described below).\n\nRibonucleic acid (RNA) isolation, complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) preparation, and RT-qPCR\nTotal RNA was extracted from retinas at 4 and 24\u2009h post-blast. Retinas were lysed with a homogenizing pestle and filtered through QiaShredder columns (Qiagen, Chatsworth, MD). The RNA was then extracted with an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Brains from sham and blast mice were isolated and regionally dissected as described above. Total RNA was extracted from brain regions using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as per the manufacturer's instructions.\nFor cDNA preparation of retinas and brain regions, respectively, 1000\u2009ng or 2000\u2009ng of total RNA was reversed transcribed using random hexamers and SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Amplified cDNAs were diluted 1:10 and 1:15 for retina and brain samples, respectively, in ultrapure water and subjected to RT-PCR using an Applied Biosystems Model 7900HT with TaqMan Universal PCR Mastermix (Applied Biosystems) with the following probes:\nIL-1\u03b2\n(Mm00434228_m1),\nIL-1\u03b1\n(Mm00439620_m1),\nIL-6\n(Mm00446190_m1),\ntumor necrosis factor\n(\nTNF)-\u03b1\n(Mm00443258_m1), and\nGAPDH\n(4308313). Biological samples were run in triplicate. Relative messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of target genes were normalized to the endogenous control,\nGAPDH\n, using the comparative cycle threshold method.\nResults were expressed as fold difference from sham controls. Column statistics were run to determine whether values were distributed normally. For those with normal distribution, a Student\nt\ntest was used; otherwise, a Mann-Whitney\nU\ntest was utilized.\n\nImmunohistochemistry (IHC)\nFor sample preparation for IHC experiments, blast-exposed and sham mice were anesthetized deeply with ketamine 200\u2009mg/kg and xylazine 20\u2009mg/kg and perfused transcardially with 0.01\u2009mol/L phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.01\u2009mol/L PBS. Ipsilateral globes were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1\u2009h at room temperature.\nRetinal cross sections were prepared for examining glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunostaining. To this end, the lens and cornea were removed and posterior eyecups were subjected to a sucrose gradient (10%, 20%, and 30% in 0.01\u2009mol/L PBS), embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound, and frozen using dry ice. Sagittal sections (8\u2009\u03bcm thick) of the ipsilateral retina were collected onto superfrost plus glass slides. The OCT-embedded sections were hydrated for 15\u2009min with tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20, followed by 45\u2009min of permeabilization with 0.3% triton in PBS. Sections were blocked for 1\u2009h with 3% goat serum/0.1% Triton X-100 (cat. no. T8532; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in PBS.\nPrimary antibodies against GFAP (1:400; cat. no. Mab360; Millipore, Burlington, MA) were diluted in blocking solution and costained with fluoresceinated Griffonia simplicifolia type 1 Isolectin B4 (Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated, 1:100, cat. no. 121413; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) in 1\u2009mM CaCl2 in PBS overnight at 4\u00b0C. Tissues were washed with PBS (3\n\u00d7\n5\u2009min) and incubated with corresponding secondary antibody GAM647 (1:300; cat. no. A-32728; Thermo Fisher Scientific) with Isolectin B4 (1:100) in 3% goat serum/0.1% triton in PBS for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Samples were washed with PBS (3\n\u00d7\n5\u2009min), incubated with DAPI (4\u2009\u03bcg/mL; cat. no. D9564; Sigma-Aldrich) for 10\u2009min at room temperature, and washed with PBS (3\n\u00d7\n5\u2009min).\nFor ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA-1-) and GFAP-stained whole-mounted retinas, retinal dissection was followed by permeabilization with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1\u2009h at room temperature and antigen retrieval treatment (10\u2009mM sodium citrate, pH\u2009=\u20096 with 0.05% Tween 20) at 90\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. Retinas were blocked overnight with 3% goat serum/0.1% triton in PBS at 4\u00b0C, and then incubated for 1.5\u2009h with Background Buster (cat. no. NB306; Innovex Biosciences Inc., Richmond, CA).\nRetinas were incubated with GFAP antibodies as described above and with the primary antibody for IBA-1 (1:500; cat. no. 019-1941; Wako Chemicals USA, Inc., Richmond, VA) overnight at 4\u00b0C, washed with PBS (3\n\u00d7\n5\u2009min), and incubated with the corresponding secondary antibody GAR488 (1:300; cat. no. A11070; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for 1\u2009h at room temperature. All slides were mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (cat. no. P36934; Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed by imaging with confocal microscopy (SP8 confocal, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany).\n\nQuantification of IBA-1 and GFAP IHC staining\nWhole-mounted retinas were stained as described above. Two non-overlapping images were collected for each of four retinal petals, yielding a total of eight images per retina, and were taken midway between the outer edge of the petal and the optic nerve head (\nFig. 2A\n). Images were taken using a X25 water-immersion objective with consistent microscope settings to eliminate variation from one sample to the next. Quantitative analysis of fluorescent area for IBA-1+ staining was performed using ImageJ Imaging Software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD),\n41\nand microglial cell counts were completed manually by an observer masked to the origin of the samples. As a reference, the masked observer utilized Z-stack images of the areas below and above the image being quantified to assist in determining what was an IBA-1+ microglia cell body that colocalized with the nuclear marker, DAPI.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nIncreased immunoreactivity and distribution of IBA-1-positive microglia are found in retinas exposed to blast. Eight regions were sampled per ipsilateral retina (\nA\n). Quantification shows an increase in total fluorescence area (\nD, J\n) and cell body counts (\nG, M\n) after blast in the retinal nerve-fiber layer (RNFL) and retinal ganglion-cell layer of whole-mounted retinas at 24\u2009h and one week, respectively. Representative images (\nB, C\n) and mask overlays of area are quantified (\nE, H, K, M\nand\nF, I, L, O\n) for sham and blast-injured mice, respectively. Arrowheads indicate cell bodies (\nH, I, N, O\n). Student\nt\ntest or Mann-Whitney\nU\ntest are based on distribution of data. *\np\n<\u20090.05; **\np\n<\u20090.01.

Scale bar: 50\u2009\u03bcm unless otherwise noted.\nThe process was performed systematically for all of the images. Overlay masks were hand drawn, and any clear artifacts or debris was removed. Values from the eight images were averaged, producing one value per retina.\nTo compare GFAP expression between sham and blast mice at one week post-injury, ImageJ was used to generate plot profiles reflective of pixel intensity and to quantify the percent fluorescent area. A two-dimensional side facing view of a reconstructed Z-stack acquired repeatedly in 0.5\u2009\u03bcm confocal sections along the z-axis of retinal whole mounts was used, and total area selected was consistent for all images (\nFig. 3\n;\nn\n=\u20093 per condition). For GFAP analysis after anakinra treatment, ImageJ was also used to generate plot profiles reflective of pixel intensity of retinal cross sections and quantitative analysis of the fluorescent area (\nFig. 4\n,\n\u200b\n,5;\n5\n;\nn\n=\u20093 per condition).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nExtended distribution of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in M\u00fcller glia in retinas ipsilateral to blast exposure suggests increased damage. The GFAP localizes to the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) of retinas of sham and blast mice 24\u2009h after injury (\nA, B,\nrespectively). One week after blast exposure, the distribution of GFAP immunoreactivity remains in the RNFL of sham mice (\nC\n), but increases in M\u00fcller glia spanning the retina from the RNFL to the outer nuclear layer (ONL) in blast mice (\nD\n) in retinal cross sections. A two-dimensional side facing view of a reconstructed z-stack acquired repeatedly in 0.5\u2009\u03bcm confocal sections along the z-axis of retinal whole mounts demonstrates GFAP reactivity limited to the RNFL of sham mice (\nE\n) and spanning throughout the retina in blast mice (\nF\n).

Anakinra (67\u2009mg/mL; Sobi) was diluted in sterile 0.9% saline. Treatment was initiated one week before blast injury and continued for three weeks post-injury (\nFig. 6\n). Researchers were blinded to the treatments for the entirety of the study including drug administration, data acquisition, and data analysis.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 6.\nExperimental design of anakinra treatment. Mice were given daily intraperitoneal injections of either saline or anakinra beginning one week before injury and continuing three weeks after. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and pattern electroretinogram (PERG) were conducted before injury as a pre-blast baseline and four weeks after, followed by euthanasia and tissue collection for histological analysis of retinal and optic nerve tissue.\n\nPattern-evoked electroretinography (PERG)\nThe PERG was used to objectively measure the function of RGCs by recording the amplitude of the PERG waveform after TBI. Mice were anesthetized with a combination of ketamine (0.05\u20130.06\u2009mg/g, IP), xylazine (0.008\u20130.01\u2009mg/g, IP), and acepromazine (0.004\u20130.005\u2009mg/g, IP), and then placed on a heated recording table to maintain body temperature. Neutral position PERG responses were evoked using alternating, reversing, and black and white vertical stimuli delivered on a monitor with a Roland Consult ERG system (Roland Consult, Brandenburg, Germany).\nTo record the PERG response, commercially available stainless steel subdermal electrodes (Ambu, Ballerup, Denmark) were placed in the snout. A reference needle electrode was placed medially at the base of the head, and a ground electrode was placed at the base of the tail to complete the circuit. Each animal was placed at the same fixed position in front of the monitor to prevent recording variability because of animal placement.\nStimuli (18 degree radius visual angle subtended on full field pattern, two reversals per second, 372 averaged signals with cutoff filter frequencies of 1 to 30\u2009Hz, 98% contrast, 80 cd/m\n2\naverage monitor illumination intensity (Jorvec, Miami, FL) were delivered under mesopic conditions without dark adaptation to exclude the possible effect of direct photoreceptor-derived evoked responses. A diffuser placed over the pattern on the monitor also did not elicit a measurable evoked potential, further ensuring that the electrical responses were elicited from RGCs.\nThe PERG response was evaluated by measuring the amplitude (peak to trough) of the waveform, as we have described previously.\n8\n,\n36\nThe PERG response was recorded at pre-blast baseline, and four weeks after blast injury. Significance was determined comparing means of all groups using Kruskal-Wallis test with the Dunn post-test. Exclusions were made for mice that were breathing too heavily or if their temperature dropped during acquisition, which was monitored constantly throughout the experiment. Changes in each of these parameters can cause interference in signal acquisition. Exclusion criteria were decided before data acquisition for an individual mouse.\n\nSpectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT)\nThe SD-OCT analysis was performed at pre-blast baseline and four weeks post-injury using a Spectralis SD-OCT (Heidelberg Engineering, Vista, CA) imaging system and a 25 dipoter (D) lens for mouse ocular imaging (Heidelberg Engineering). Mice were anesthetized with a combination of ketamine (0.03\u2009mg/g, IP) and xylazine (0.005\u2009mg/g, IP) and placed on a heating pad to maintain body temperature. Pupils were dilated using a 1% tropicamide solution, and the cornea was moisturized with saline. Volume scans (49 line dense array) positioned directly over the optic nerve head were performed to quantify the RGC complex thickness, which includes RGC bodies, axons, and dendrites.\nScans approximately 100 um from the edge of the optic nerve head were analyzed by a masked observer, excluding blood vessels from the RGC complex thickness calculation. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA with the Dunnett post-test for multiple comparisons.\n\nHistology and microscopy of optic nerves\nBlast-exposed and sham-blast mice were anesthetized deeply with carbon dioxide, lightly perfused with normal saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde and euthanized by decapitation. Optic nerves were collected and processed as described previously.\n42\nIn brief, optic nerves were dissected from heads and drop fixed in half-strength Karnovsky fixative (2% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1\u2009M sodium cacodylate) at 4\u00b0C for 16\u2009h. Nerves were rinsed in 0.1\u2009M Na cacodylate buffer, post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in graded acetone (30\u2013100%), infiltrated in graded resin (33%, 66%, and 100%; Eponate-12; Ted Pella, Redding, CA) diluted in propylene oxide, embedded in fresh 100% resin, and then polymerized in a 65\u00b0C oven.\nSemithin (1-\u03bcm) cross sections were cut, transferred to glass slides, stained with 1% paraphenylenediamine (PPD), and mounted to glass slides (Permount, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Light micrograph images were obtained with an Olympus BX-52 microscope (Cedar Valley, PA) at total magnifications of 100X and 1000X.\n\nGrading of optic nerve damage\nAssessing levels of damage in optic nerves was performed using a three-level grading scale (1-none to mild damage, 2-moderate, or 3-severe). This method has been described previously (grading scale, grading criteria, estimated axon counts for each damage grade) and validated extensively.\n43\u201347\nMicroscopy slides containing mounted optic nerve cross sections stained with PPD were assessed by two independent investigators who were blinded to both the identity of the nerves and the scores given by the other investigator. Investigators assigned the same score for 91% of the nerves. In the cases of damage grade disagreement, a third investigator, blinded to both the identity of nerves and scores given by the first two investigators, assigned a third damage grade, and the most common grade (among all three investigators) was used in the final grading for each nerve specimen. Representative light micrographs were obtained from slides using a light microscope (BX-52, Olympus) at total magnifications of 100X and 1000X.\n\nExperimental design and statistical analysis\nSupplementary Table S1\nprovides information concerning all mice utilized in this study. The experimental design of the anakinra study is depicted in\nFigure 6\n. Column statistics were run to determine whether values were distributed normally for all quantitative experiments. For the RT-qPCR data and quantification of immunohistochemistry at 4\u2009h, 24\u2009h, and one week, a Student\nt\ntest was used if data were distributed normally; otherwise, a Mann-Whitney\nU\ntest was utilized. Statistical significance for the PERG and OCT analysis was determined by Kruskal-Wallis test with a Dunn post-test and by one-way ANOVA followed by the Dunnett post-test for multiple comparisons, respectively, determined by the distribution of the data. Statistical significance for the IBA-1 quantification of drug treated mice was determined by a one-way ANOVA. A value of\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered significant. All the statistical data were presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM and were performed using GraphPad Prism 7 for Macintosh (La Jolla, CA)."

    "Methods": "Human subjects\nAll human studies were approved by the VA Puget Sound Health Care System Human Subjects Committee. All participants provided written informed consent before study. The study conformed to institutional regulatory guidelines and principles of human subject protection in the Declaration of Helsinki. Veterans were determined to have chronic mTBI by results of physical and neurological examinations, behavioral assessments including the PTSD Checklist-Military version (PCL-M) Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 for depression symptom assessment, and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test Consumption items (AUDIT-C).\n30\n,\n31\nTwo separate control groups, veterans deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan, but with no lifetime history of TBI (DC); and age-matched civilian controls (Community Controls [CC]) with no history of TBI, were included. Lifetime history of both blast-related and impact-related TBI was obtained using a semistructured interview with two expert clinicians as described.\n5\nAll participants were male. Females were eligible for study inclusion, but no female with blast-related mTBI was enrolled. For this reason, only males were included in the control groups. Where appropriate, inclusion criteria for all participants included documented hazardous duty in Iraq and/or Afghanistan with the United States Armed Forces during Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and/or Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). For inclusion, veterans with mTBI had at least one blast exposure with acute symptoms that met VA/Department of Defense (DoD)/American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine criteria for mTBI. For all study participants (veterans and civilian controls), exclusion criteria included moderate-severe TBI, seizure disorder, insulin-dependent diabetes, current\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\n, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis of alcohol abuse or other substance abuse, schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder, or dementia, or taking medications likely to affect cognitive function. See\nTables S1\nand\nS2\nfor full details on the participants of this study.\n\nStatistical analysis of subject characteristics\nApolipoprotein E (APOE4) positivity was determined by previously described polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conditions,\n32\nand the HhaI restriction digest method.\n33\nCategorical data (APOE4 positivity, race, and Hispanic ethnicity) were analyzed by \u03c7\n2\ntests. Between-group differences in age were determined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests. PCL-M score, PHQ-9, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and AUDIT-C measures were evaluated using between subject\nt\ntests where all reported\np\nvalues denote two-tailed critical value outcomes. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software (IBM, Armonk, NY).\n\nPlasma preparation and EV isolation\nBlood samples were collected via an intravenous catheter placed in an antecubital vein into polypropylene tubes containing sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Blood cells were removed by low speed centrifugation at 1000\ng\nfor 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was centrifuged again at 2000\ng\nfor 15\u2009min at 4\u00b0C to remove cell debris. Following centrifugation, the supernatant (plasma) was transferred into a clean polypropylene tube and stored at -80\u00b0C. Blood processing occurred within 1\u2009h of collection. Before RNA isolation, the plasma samples were spun at 10,000\ng\nat 4\u00b0C for 10\u2009min to remove cell debris and platelets. EVs were enriched from plasma using the Total Exosome Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nmiRNA isolation and library construction\nRNA was isolated from plasma and plasma derived EVs using the miRNeasy kit (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was eluted in nuclease-free water followed by quantity and quality assessment using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). To profile miRNA in plasma and EVs, the NEBNext Small RNA Library Prep kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) was used and the library concentrations were assessed by NEBNext Library Quant Kit (New England Biolabs). The libraries were pooled (2\u2009nM final concentration) and then run on a NextSeq500 sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA).\n\nData analysis\nSequence files were processed and analyzed using an in-house small RNA analysis pipeline\u2014sRNAnalyzer,\n34\nBriefly, the adapters were trimmed, and low complexity (such as homopolymer and simple repeat sequences), low quality and short reads (< 15 nucleotides) were removed. The processed reads were then mapped against various sequence databases. For miRNA, miRBase (\nwww.mirbase.org\n) v21 was used. The miRNA mapping results (based on no mismatch allowed) were normalized using read count per million of processed read and log2 transformed. The miRTarbase (\nmirtarbase.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/\n) was used to obtain validated mRNA targets by at least three different experimental techniques to identify biological processes that may be regulated by specific miRNAs. Gene enrichment analysis was performed with Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (\nhttps://david.ncifcrf.gov/\n). After mapping against the miRNA database, remaining unmapped reads from samples were run through mirdeep2\n35\nto identify putative novel miRNAs (\nFig. S1A\n).\n\nQuantitative Reverse Transcription (qRT)-PCR verification\nTaqMan Advanced miRNA assays (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) were used to confirm the miRNA concentration changes. The level of miR-16-5p was used as a normalizer, because it was identified as a miRNA with low concentration variation (low coefficient of variance across samples) based on the miRNA mapping results. Relative miRNA concentrations are presented by \u0394\u0394C\nt\nvalues (Ct\nreference\n\u2013 Ct\ntarget\n).\n36\n\nPlasma proteomics\nThe impact of chronic mTBI on blood proteome was analyzed by isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ). For iTRAQ analysis, plasma samples were pooled and two pools from each group with a total of six samples were analyzed (see\nTable S3\n,\nFig. S2\n). The labeling and sample preparation methods follow manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the top 14 high abundant blood proteins were removed with a human Mars14 LC column (4.6\u2009\u00d7\u2009100\u2009mm, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). The flowthrough of each sample was collected and concentrated, and the protein concentrations were determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The proteins were digested with trypsin following a 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE)-denaturation and Oasis C18 cartridges (Waters, Milford, MA) desalting before iTRAQ labeling. Approximately 60\u2009\u03bcg of tryptic peptides from each pooled sample were labeled with one of the eight isobaric tags (AB SCIEX, Framingham, MA) on N-termini and lysine residues. Samples were combined and fractionated into 96 fractions by a high-pH reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractionation before being combined into 12 fractions and analyzed on a Q Exactive\u2122 Plus Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Acquired data were processed in Trans Proteomic Pipeline TPP (V4.8) including PeptideProphet and ProteinProphet. Protein identifications were filtered with a threshold of false discovery rate (FDR) <0.01 at protein level. Libra, an in-house script, was used to extract ratios of isobaric tags in MS/MS spectra. Only proteins with more than two independent peptides identified and quantified in all channels were included.\n37\n,\n38\nRatios for each protein were reported as significantly different if they passed a fold change criterion of 50% or more. Besides iTRAQ- based global profiling, the Proximity Extension Assay (PEA) (Olink Proteomics, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to measure the concentrations of 92 neurological function related proteins (\nTable S4\n) from plasma samples, as per the manufacturer's instructions."

    "Methods": "The included patients were part of a prospective observational study27undertaken at the NCCU at Karolinska University Hospital (Stockholm, Sweden) between January 1, 2010 and March 1, 2013. Written, informed consent was acquired from next-of-kin. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Swedish law. Ethical approval was provided by the Stockholm County branch of the Central Ethical Review Board (#2009/1112-31/3), now called the Swedish Ethical Review Authority.\n\nSample size calculation\nSample size estimation\na priori\nusing power analysis was unfeasible because to our knowledge, no assumptions on effect size have been described in the literature using the same approach as in our study. However, using data from our group,\n26\nwe could estimate our sample sizes for a cross-sectional rather than a longitudinal data set. Aiming for a correlation coefficient\nr\n=\u20090.60 between S100B\nCSF\nand S100B\nblood\n, we found the estimated sample size needed to reach 80% power on the 0.05 significance level (one-sided test) using the R\n28\npackage pwr\n29\nto be 15 patients. The effect size estimate was larger than the one previously reported from our group (\nr\n=\u20090.45),\n26\nbut smaller than what has more recently been reported\n30\n(\nr\n=\u20090.79), leading us to believe that this was a valid effect size assumption. We therefore set out to include >15 study subjects.\n\nPatient inclusion\nBecause of the sporadic availability of research personnel, recruitment was made periodically. Patients were not randomized, because no group-specific interventions were conducted. Inclusion criteria for the patients were as follows: (1) age 18\u201375 years, (2) Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score 3\u20138 (unconscious at admission), and (3) computerized tomography (CT) verified structural intraparenchymal intracranial injury. Exclusion criteria comprised: (1) GCS 3 and bilaterally non-responsive pupils, (2) slit ventricles (because that would preclude the planned patient study management by making external ventricular drain (EVD) insertion impossible), (3) unsurvivable injury, (4) unconsciousness of etiology other than TBI, (5) absence of CT-verified intraparenchymal intracranial injury, (6) other concurrent systemic terminal disorder, and (7) impossibility of follow-up (e.g., being foreign citizens).\n\nPatient management and sample acquisition\nThe detailed study setup has been described previously.\n27\nBriefly, upon admission, patients received an EVD (Medtronic, Eatontown, NJ). The drain was connected to a four-way stopcock (Multiflo 3, BD, Connecta, Franklin Lakes, NJ), connected to a LiquoGuard\n\u00ae\nCSF-pump (M\u00f6ller Medical GmbH, Fulda, Germany) set to a constant drainage velocity of 2\u2009mL CSF per hour. CSF was collected in, and samples were obtained from, the drainage bag in the LiquoGuard system in order to minimize the risk for infections, and freeze blocks were used to keep the CSF cold in order to limit protein degradation. The collected pool of CSF and readily acquired arterial blood were analyzed at 6-and 12-h intervals, for both S100B and NSE. Albumin (plasma and CSF) was analyzed once to twice daily. S100B\nblood\nwas analyzed by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), albumin\nplasma\nwas analyzed by colorometric bromocresol purple (BCP)-binding assay and albumin\nCSF\nwas analyzed by immunoturbitity on a Roche Cobas/Modular platform (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). NSE\nblood\n, NSE\nCSF\n, and S100B\nCSF\nwere analyzed by immunoluminometric assay on a LIAISON XL system (DiaSorin, Saluggia, Italy). S100B\nblood\nand S100B\nCSF\nwere analyzed on different platforms because of local procurements and inability to run CSF samples on the more modern Cobas/Elecsys platforms. Each individual assay has shown robust within- and between-run similarity,\n31\nthus enabling longitudinal sampling as employed in this study. Some claim that the different platforms are not entirely interchangeable,\n32\nwhereas others have found excellent associations between the methods (\nr\n=\u20090.932).\n31\nIt is noteworthy that, to our knowledge, no studies have examined bicompartmental similarities (i.e., between CSF and blood). This is of importance, because absolute between-assay agreement is of greater importance when identical samples from the same compartment are examined on multiple platforms. However, for the scope of this study, the relative relationship was of greater interest. All laboratory assays were performed at the Karolinska University Laboratory in accordance with local guidelines. Aside from this, patients were treated in accordance with local routine at the NCCU, as previously described.\n8\n\nClinical parameters\nBaseline clinical data were defined and acquired as follows. Clinical variables comprised GCS,\n33\n(head and non-head) Abbreviated Injury Scale\n34\n(AIS), Injury Severity Score\n35\n(ISS), and significant multitrauma,\n36\nall of which were acquired upon hospital admission. It is of note that an AIS of 6 at admission is impossible, as it denotes an unsurvivable injury. CT variables upon admission were graded using the Marshall CT Classification,\n37\n,\n38\nin which classifications V and VI were collapsed into one category (\u201cmass lesion\u201d), as we used only the admission CT. For comparison, we also assessed the Rotterdam\n39\nand Stockholm CT scores.\n40\nRadiological brain injury progression upon subsequent examination was evaluated employing a similar strategy as in previous work.\n8\n,\n41\nGlasgow Outcome Scale\n42\n(GOS) was assessed as described previously.\n27\nIn short, a neurorehabilitation board-certified physician (P.H.G.) examined patients 6 months following the TBI. GOS comprises 5 categories: (1) dead, (2) persistent vegetative state, (3) severe disability, (4) moderate disability, and (5) low disability.\n\nDefinitions\nWe used \u201cBBBD\u201d as a comprehensive term to denote all types of barrier disruption that can be discerned following TBI, including disruption of the anatomical BBB as well as of the blood\u2013CSF barrier.\n43\nBBBD was defined as the quotient between CSF and blood albumin (Equation 1), because that constitutes the literature gold standard.\n19\n,\n24\n,\n43\nThe reference intervals used for all proteins in the current study were defined using reference intervals stipulated by the Karolinska University Laboratory during the time of patient inclusion or at present (\nTable 1\n).\n44-47\nTable 1.\nReference Intervals Used\nVariable\nReference interval\nAlbumin\nCSF\n(mg/L)\n15-29 years: <260\n\u2265 50 years: <400\nAlbumin\nblood\n(g/L)\n< 41 years: 36-48\n\u2265 71 years: 34-45\nQ\nA\n(no unit)\n15-29 years: <0.006\n\u2265 50 years: <0.009\nS100B\nCSF\n(\u03bcg/L)\n< 5\nS100B\nblood\n(\u03bcg/L)\n< 0.11\nNSE\nCSF\n(\u03bcg/L)\n< 13\nNSE\nblood\n(\u03bcg/L)\n< 18\nOpen in a separate window\nReference intervals were defined as the reference intervals used by the Karolinska University Laboratory during the time of patient inclusion in the study or at present.\n44\u201347\nQ\nA\n=\na\nl\nb\nu\nm\ni\nn\nC\nS\nF\na\nl\nb\nu\nm\ni\nn\np\nl\na\ns\nm\na\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were conducted using R,\n28\nthrough the interface RStudio\n\u00ae\n. Continuous data were presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD) if normally distributed, or else median (interquartile range [IQR]). Categorical data were presented as count (%). In graphical depictions and calculations, biomarker values were converted to log10-transformed values, unless otherwise stated. A\np\nvalue \u22640.05 or a 95% confidence interval (CI), where the range of the CI did not contain the value 0, was considered significant.\nSeveral variables were sampled at different time intervals, resulting in time points without sample overlap. This is demonstrated graphically\n48\n(\nFig. S1\n). Following a comparison between linear and locally weighted scatterplot smoother interpolation (\nFig. S2\n), this was compensated for by linear interpolation. Data rows that still retained \u201cmissing\u201d values for a certain time point because of consecutive non-overlapping sampling time points were handled by complete case analysis.\nCorrelations (regular correlations are here referred to as \u201cmomentary\u201d correlations) between biomarkers in different compartments and Q\nA\nwere assessed using repeated measures correlation\n49\non log10-transformed variables in order to obtain linear relationships. Each model was examined with regard to relevant assumptions. The R packages rmcorr\n50\nand tidyverse\n51\nwere used for calculations and graphical depictions. Because biomarker levels in different body compartments might correlate in a time-delayed fashion, we also cross-correlated the original data. We abstained from de-trending or differencing the data because the relationship we examined was the underlying shared time trend. For all, the biomarker sampling time points were subdivided into defined time intervals (\u201clags\u201d) of 0.5 days (12\u2009h). Multiple measurements occurring within one lag were averaged. Last, cross-correlation was conducted per patient, whereupon results were pooled for all patients and lags. For all cross correlations, original data (i.e., not log10-transformed) were used.\nFor inferential analysis, we compared a general linear model with correlated errors (general least square estimation, a so-called \u201cmarginal model\u201d), and a linear mixed model. For both, the nlme package in R was used.\n52\nIndependent of analysis type, we modelled a within-patient variance-covariance matrix, because we used repeated-measures data. The variance-covariance matrix was constructed as a time series model, for which we determined stationarity, autocorrelation, and partial autocorrelation. We deemed that the data were stationary using the Kwiatkowski\u2013Phillips\u2013Schmidt\u2013Shin test, and therefore abstained from autoregressive integrated moving average modeling.\n53\nThe variance-covariance matrix hence consisted of an autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) model. We tested 25 different ARMA combinations of varying complexity, and then chose the optimal ARMA structure based on Akaike Information Criterion. For both S100B and NSE we used a first order autoregressive model with a moving average of 1; that is, ARMA(\np\n=\u20091, q\u2009=\u20091). The resulting models were validated graphically.\n54\nFor general linear as well as linear mixed-model selection we employed both a step-up\n55\nand a top-down strategy.\n56\nRandom effect structures were evaluated using restricted maximum likelihood-based estimations and fixed effects structure using maximum-likelihood estimations. Model selection was conducted by likelihood ratio tests between nested models and type I\nF\ntests.\nP\nvalues of the final models were generated using Satterthwaite approximations in the R package lmerTest.\n56\n,\n57\nIn all analyses, the dependent variable was the biomarker\nblood\nvalue (log10 transformed). For S100B, the first 12\u2009h were excluded from analysis, because these time points have been associated with an \u201cextracranial peak.\u201d\n8\n,\n9\nIn general, Akaike Information Criterion was lower for the mixed-model design in the top-down strategy, whereas they were equal in the step-up strategy. For S100B, the variance-covariance matrix generated in the linear mixed model was not positive-definite, which is why we chose to use the equivalent marginal model for S100B.\n56\nFor NSE, we had no such issues, which is why we present results from the linear mixed model. It is noteworthy that results were highly similar independent of linear mixed or marginal model design for each biomarker. Model assumptions were examined graphically with regard to homogeneity of variances, normality of variances, correlation between fitted and observed values, and individual assessment of residual autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation. For NSE, one patient (pat #17) followed a markedly different trajectory than the other patients and also constituted an outlier using the model diagnostics previously described. For validation, the results for NSE were run both including and excluding pat #17, and the results were to a large extent similar, leading us to conclude that the outlier pat #17 did not imply any major alterations with regard to overall conclusions."

    "Methods": "Details of the Delphi-method consensus development process are contained in theSupplementary Text. A brief description follows.\n\nForty-three intensivists and neurosurgeons with extensive experience managing sTBI without ICP monitoring comprised the consensus working group (CWG). It included investigators from the ongoing protocol research study (4 from protocol sites and 11 from no-protocol sites), plus a group from outside the study. Four CWG members attended by videoconference, but for technical reasons, did not vote. All contributors are currently involved in routinely managing sTBI patients in the absence of ICP monitoring, and have \u22655 years' experience doing so. Study investigators participated in the conference, but did not vote, as they lacked clinical experience managing unmonitored TBI patients.\n\nWeb-based polling cycles prior to the meeting determined discussion topics and some initial voting questions. The actual meeting occurred in November 2015.Table 1lists the topics addressed. Anonymous electronic voting was used. Unless specifically modified by the group, the voting cycle was limited to three iterations, interspersed with discussion intervals. An element formed part of the final recommendations only if 80% approval was attained. We used small group sessions to address complex issues, with the whole CWG modifying and voting on small-group recommendations.\n\nOne special small group session (Treatment-Tapering Exercise) addressed tendencies surrounding tapering therapy in commonly encountered categories of non-deteriorating patients. Four groups each rated their likelihood of initiating weaning of ongoing SICH therapy for specified combinations of clinical, imaging, and injury evolution parameters (Table 2). They rated these tendencies using a traffic light rating scheme, green favoring tapering, red opposing it, and yellow representing caution/uncertainty. Individual groups' recommendations were combined, and the whole CBG group refined and ratified the composite.\n\nAll recommendations were incorporated verbatim into the final protocol, which was submitted for approval to all voting members. Details of the Delphi-method consensus development process are contained in thesupplementary section."

    "Methods": "Once missingness has been diagnosed, a number of methods exist to mitigate the impact of missing values (Table 1). Richter and coworkers put together a practical decision tree helping researchers handle missing data.8OurTable 1provides recommondations that align with this decision tree; however, we extend this prior work with examples of additional methods reviewed subsequently in detail.\n\nComplete-case analysis\nThe simplest way to analyze data that have missing values is to drop any patients who do not have the complete set of variables collected, and test the patterns of the raw data. This approach, known as \u201clistwise deletion,\u201d is the default for most statistical packages when researchers apply traditional analytics including regression approaches, analysis of variance,\nt\ntests, and odds-ratios tests among others. Although this type of analysis appears straightforward, it creates a biased sampling of the population based on potential latent variables or patterns that could explain the source/cause for the missing data, if the data are MAR or NMAR. Because listwise deletion is the default for most statistical analyses, it is likely that researchers are often unaware of biases introduced by complete-case analyses. This method of data analysis is not recommended for TBI clinical research, and can lead to biased and unreliable findings.\n\nPartial deletion\nPartial deletion approaches may be useful to maximize the raw data by only including variables that have the most complete data across the study population. Most statistical software packages have an option for most types of statistical tests to delete cases in either a listwise or a pairwise fashion. Listwise deletion will automatically drop patients from the analysis if they are missing one or more data points from the list of variables included in the model, whereas pairwise deletion will still include patients who may have some missing data points in the included variables. The analysis will exclude those variables when the data are missing, while still completing analysis of other variables and cases with complete data. However, partial deletion approaches make the assumption that the data are either MCAR or MAR and does not apply for data that are NMAR.\n\nMean and mode substitution\nOther methods involve replacing missing values based on observed values; for example, using mean or mode substitution. The reliability of these methods to accurately model the missing data is questionable, as they may skew the data if the values that are missing do not truly fall within the same distribution of the group mean or mode of the variable. This type of method does not rely on the relationships in the covariance matrix of the existing data patterns, but rather replaces any missing values within each variable with either the mean or mode value for that variable. This is problematic for the following reasons.\nHere, we ask readers to imagine that there are data missing on the same 6-month outcome measure\u2014the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)\u2014from two different patients for different reasons. One of the patients may not have data because that individual was so low functioning as to be unable to perform the WAIS assessment, and, therefore, no data were collected. The other patient may have been so high functioning that the individual had no interest in returning for follow-up assessment and therefore also does not have WAIS data collected. If only the data within WAIS are taken into account when filling in the missing data, either based on the mean or the mode, both patients would get the same score, despite that had their data been collected, they would have scored very differently from each other.\n\nMultiple imputation (MI)\nWhen it is determined that the data are MCAR or MAR, EM can be used for a partial imputation of the data. The benefit of a more rigorous approach, known as MI, is that missing values are replaced with data based on the known relationships that exist in the completed data. These relationships are then used to make assumptions about how specific patients would score on the missing measures, compared with how the patient population performed collectively.\nAs noted, EM is a method that iterates through the data to find the maximum likelihood estimation that can estimate the parameters of a statistical model, given specific observations in the data. This method assumes that unobserved latent variables are in the model, and the combination of expectation and maximization of the log-likelihood is used to derive the latent variable distribution (e.g., the missing data). However, if a complete imputation is desired, MI can be performed to fill in missing information in order to boost the analytical sample size. Investigators may then potentially infer what value the missing data may have.\nPrevious recommendations for multiple imputation originally described by Rubin\n4\nsuggested that approximately three to five imputations are sufficient in order to fill in missing data. Although imputing data with only three to five iterations may not change the sample mean or standard error and the general inferences that can be drawn from the imputed results, others have suggested that if effect sizes in the data set are low, having fewer total imputations runs the risk of decreasing the statistical power of the analyses, and therefore reducing the ability to detect statistical significance between groups.\n17\nAdditionally, the proportion of missing data is a factor in deciding how many imputations to use to maximize efficiency and yield accurate inferences for power and effect sizes. Monte Carlo simulations were performed by Graham and colleagues\n17\nto estimate the appropriate number of imputations needed, based on the proportion of missing data, to yield results approaching the power that the study would have were there no missing data (\nFig. 1\n). Theoretically, it is possible to include data that are missing at high percentages of the total data, but in order to maximize power, the number of necessary imputations increases according to the amount of data missing. Multi-level modeling approaches such as modern linear mixed-effect models provide mechanisms to extend imputation to multi-level nested designs, in which missingness may occur in the pattern of higher-order interactions. A full review of these methods is beyond the scope of the present review, but we refer interested readers to prior work by Goldstein and colleagues.\n18\nSimilarly, advanced methods exist to assess latent trajectory classes in time series data that apply mixture modeling to missingness in time series data, and these approaches have recently been applied to TBI outcomes.\n19\nExtended discussion of these approaches is beyond the scope of the current review, but we refer interested readers to prior work.\n20\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nMonte Carlo simulations for number of imputations needed to maximize effect sizes based on percentages of missing data (adapted from Graham and coworkers\n17\n). Color image is available online.\n\nSensitivity analyses\nSensitivity analysis is an\nin silico\nmethod used in clinical trials to assess whether certain aspects of the study results can be altered simply by arbitrarily changing a single parameter of the experimental design.\n15\nFor example, here we ask readers to consider a hypothetical TBI study that finds that hyperthermia produces worse outcome, while controlling for common covariates such as sex. Sensitivity analysis may involve statistically correcting for sex, and assessing whether this dramatically alters the pattern of significance. If sensitivity analysis reveals that the sex covariate dramatically changes the observed relationship, this would suggest that the results are highly sensitive to the sex variable and may not generalize to another population with a different distribution of males versus females.\nA similar method is useful when there may be biases as to why data are missing. Here, sensitivity analysis involves using a mixture modeling approach to compare data distributions when data are missing and non-missing. First, variables are imputed using the MAR assumption by applying machine learning tools such as EM or regression modeling to estimate and fill in missing data points.\n3\nThen, the data distributions and descriptive statistics for significant differences between the raw, unimputed data set and the imputed data set\n2\u20134\nare tested. Significant differences between imputed and non-imputed data sets indicate that missing data cannot be ignored, establishing that they are NMAR. This analysis can be expanded by introducing variables affected by imputation as covariates to test their impact as candidate NMAR mechanisms and establish the threshold at which data cannot be imputed. In TBI, for example, if blood pressure has a significant impact on functional recovery, but blood pressure data are known to be NMAR, a model can be developed to determine the threshold at which blood pressure data can be imputed that both doesn't significantly change the data distributions and maintains precision in outcome prediction. The Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) package in R can be used for these purposes, where mulitiple imputation can be nested within a sensitivity analysis to test for these sensitivity thresholds when performing MI.\n21\n,\n22\nUnfortunately, the results of these types of analyses are not prominently reported in medical journals in general, and even less so in randomized controlled clinical trials.\n15\nHowever, multiple experts in the field of MVA agree that when data are NMAR, which is the case in most clinical trials and research, performing sensitivity analysis is crucial to reduce unintended bias.\n23\nThis procedure can be implemented in combination with MI, provided that the influence of the missing data and its source can be accurately modeled.\n24\n,\n25\n\nInverse probability weighting\nInverse probability weighting allows inverse weighting to be applied to certain patients in the data set who are skewing results because of missingness and/or dropout. If the source of the missing or confounding data is known, it can be used to weight the data similarly to regression analyses to remove the influence on the study results.\n26\n,\n27\nThis is also similar to sensitivity analysis. These approaches look at confounding when comparing groups that differ in incidence of missingness, and the missingness is related to both group assignment and outcome (i.e., NMAR)."

    "Methods": "Study design\nThis study was approved by the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Institutional Review Board. Analysis was conducted on data from the interventional COBRIT (NCT00545662;\nn\n=\u20091213 subjects) trial and the observational TRACK-TBI (NCT01565551;\nn\n=\u2009599 subjects) study.\n17\u201319\nThe data sets were sourced from the Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research Informatics Systems.\n20\nBecause experimental treatment was concluded to be ineffective over placebo in the COBRIT trial, subjects from both treatment and placebo study arms were pooled into one cohort for our study. Inclusion criteria for the COBRIT study specified that all patients be between the ages of 18 and 70 years old, been diagnosed with a non-penetrating TBI, and have a positive baseline computed tomography (CT) scan. Subjects enrolled in the TRACK-TBI Pilot study were \u226516 years of age, with an external force head trauma, and a positive baseline CT scan taken within 24\u2009h of injury.\n\nData cleaning\nCOBRIT baseline data were acquired prior to injury or within 24\u2009h of injury. All available baseline data were included for analysis unless otherwise indicated (\nTable S1\n). Baseline data consisted of both numerical and categorical variables (i.e., features) and included pre-injury data such as subject demographics and medical history 3 months prior to injury, and acute (< 24\u2009h after injury) data such as mechanism of injury, CT radiology assessments, laboratory tests, physiological measurements, physician intervention, and toxicology screens. Where only the highest and lowest values were reported for physiological measurements (e.g., heart rate and blood pressure) within 24\u2009h of injury, values were averaged into a single baseline value. All categorical features were consolidated into a maximum of three categories, based on frequency to reduce data sparsity. These categorical variables were then dummy coded into binary representations (i.e., assigned \u201c1\u201d if feature was present or \u201c0\u201d if it was absent) to allow input into the categorical hinge loss functions used in training our generalized low-rank model. The cleaned baseline data set consisted of 156 features.\nMissing data were handled according to the mechanism of missingness: missing at random (MAR), missing completely at random (MCAR), or missing not at random (MNAR).\n21\n,\n22\nThe values of data that are MCAR are independent of observed and unobserved features. Values are considered MAR if their missingness is conditional on the value of another observed feature (e.g., CT lesion volumes are conditionally reported based on the reported presence of a lesion). Features were considered MNAR if their values are suspected as missing in a biased manner because of unobserved data, as determined from the original trial case report form and trial metadata. Data considered to be MNAR were excluded from further analysis. For the remaining MAR and MCAR data, features that were missing <10% of values were imputed and used as input features for clustering analysis. Features missing 10\u201330% of values were imputed but not used as clustering input features. Lastly, MAR and MCAR features missing >30% of values were excluded. Number of missing values per feature is provided in\nTable S1\n. For features where missing values were imputed, we used multiple imputation with random forest completion method (multivariate imputation by chained equations [MICE] algorithm implemented in \u201cmice\u201d R package version 3.6).\n23\nFor each feature with missing values, we generated five completed data sets (\nm\n=\u20095), each with slightly different missing value estimates. Each imputed data set was individually run through the unsupervised GLRM framework for feature selection (described subsequently), leading to\nm\u2009=\u20095\nsets of selected features. In the final clustering schema, the intersection of the\nm\nfeature sets was used for the final clustering analysis performed on a single data set pooled by averaging the\nm\npoint estimates for each missing value.\nTo calculate the baseline GCS scores for subjects in the COBRIT study, we averaged the best and worst GCS values reported during the acute injury period, as these were the only GCS values reported in the raw data. GCS scores were then used to assign injury severity groups: complicated mild (GCS 13\u201315 with positive CT scan), moderate (GCS 8\u201312), and severe (GCS <8). Only one subject was missing baseline GCS scores and was dropped from the analysis. Patient outcomes were assessed using the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) primary study outcome measure, collected at 90 and 180 days after injury. The COBRIT study primary outcomes data contained missing GOS-E values at 90 (\nn\n=\u2009263) and 180 days (\nn\n=\u2009383) because of subjects lost to follow-up, missed follow-up visits, and death.\n18\nSubjects whose study termination was the result of death (\nn\n=\u200967 at 90 days, n\u2009=\u200973 at 180 days, cumulatively) were assigned the GOS-E score of 1, according to the GOS-E scale.\n24\nThere was no difference in the baseline GCS scores of subjects with missing and non-missing GOS-E scores (\u03c7\n2\n=\u20098.11,\ndf\n=\u20096,\np\n=\u20090.43).\n\nFeature selection and unsupervised clustering\nBaseline data were run through an unsupervised learning framework to simultaneously select the subset of features and tuning parameters that produced the best clusters in an iterative process (\nFig. 1\n). To avoid overfitting, we utilized a sparse GLRM framework to select the most relevant features during our clustering analysis (GLRM implemented using R package\nh2o\nversion 3.26). GLRMs can represent high-dimensional data of\nmixed\ndata types (e.g., numerical and categorical) in a transformed lower-dimensional space (i.e., low-rank).\n25\nEssentially, the GLRM decomposes an\nm x n\nmatrix,\nA,\ninto matrices\nX\nand\nY\nsuch that\nXY\nis approximately equal to\nA\nunder the constraint that the number of linearly independent columns (i.e., the rank),\nk\n, in\nXY\n\u2264\nn.\nIn our approach, we used a GLRM to decompose our baseline data matrix,\nA\n, composed of\nm\nrows of patients and\nn\ncolumns of clinical features, into matrices\nX\nand\nY\n. The\nY\nmatrix can be viewed as a set of new features derived from the original\nn.\nThe\nX\nmatrix can be viewed as a lower dimensional representation of the patients composed of features represented by columns in Y. Hyperparameter\nk\nwas selected to be the minimum\nk\nthat captured the majority of variance in\nA\n(i.e., >50% of the total variance), balancing the sparsity of matrix\nY\n\u2014and in turn reducing the number of selected features to create a more parsimonious model\u2014against fidelity. Quadratic and hinge loss functions were used to approximate numerical and binary features, respectively.\n25\nWe applied an L1-norm regularization parameter to\nY\nto reduce the size of the feature set contributing to the low rank decomposition of our data. Thus, the GLRM approximated the input data matrix\nA\n, with the following loss functions:\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nDiagram of the hybrid generalized low-rank model and clustering approach implemented for unsupervised learning. The full feature set with n features and m observations (i.e., traumatic brain injury [TBI] patients) is decomposed into two matrices of lower rank (i.e., dimensions), k. An L1-regularization parameter, \u03b3, is applied to the second low-rank matrix to create a feature subset n\n\u2019\n, of the original matrix. The n\u2019 x m feature subset is used to calculate an m x m dissimilarity matrix of the observations and clustered using the partitioning around medoids (PAM) algorithm. The average silhouette width of the clusters is calculated for a range of 3\u201310 clusters in PAM. The \u03b3 parameter is increased if the average silhouette width is higher than the previous iteration and stopped when n\u2019 is zero. The final feature subset n\u2019 and clustering schema is selected using the \u03b3 value that yields the highest cluster silhouette width.\nL\nA\n,\nX\nY\n=\nm\ni\nn\ni\nm\ni\nz\ne\n\u03a3\ni\n=\n1\nm\n\u03a3\nj\n=\n1\nn\nA\ni\nj\n\u2212\nX\ni\nY\nj\n2\n\u2215\n\u03c3\nj\n2\n+\n\u03b3\n\u03a3\nj\n=\n1\nn\n\u2225\nY\nj\n\u2225\n1\n,\ni\nf\nA\ni\nj\n\u2208\nR\n\u03a3\ni\n=\n1\nm\n\u03a3\nj\n=\n1\nn\nmax\n1\n\u2212\nA\ni\nj\n\u22c5\nX\ni\nY\nj\n2\n+\n\u03b3\n\u03a3\nj\n=\n1\nn\n\u2225\nY\nj\n\u2225\n1\n,\ni\nf\nA\ni\nj\n\u2208\n0\n,\n1\n.\nwhere the L1-regularization parameter \u03b3 > zero. Instead of scaling the numeric features prior to the GLRM, the quadratic loss function was scaled by dividing by e variance,\n\u03c3\nj\n2\n,\nof each feature\nj\n, to compensate for unequal feature scaling. The regularization parameter, \u03b3, produces a column-sparse matrix,\nY\n, where the number of non-zero columns,\nd\n, is small relative to the total column number,\nn.\nA column,\ny\nj\nof\nY\n, which is all zero, signifies that feature\nj\nwas uninformative in approximating matrix\nA\n, and therefore not selected for clustering analysis.\n26\u201328\nTo select the smallest feature subset capable of generating well-defined patient clusters, we utilized a wrapper approach wherein features were selected by optimizing the GLRM regularization parameter, \u03b3, based on the performance of the clustering algorithm. For a given value of \u03b3, matrix\nY\nin the GLRM contained\nd\nnon-zero feature columns. The\nd\nfeatures found in the GLRM, were then used to cluster patient observations. Clustering performance was assessed by calculating the average silhouette width for a given number of clusters.\n29\nThe value of \u03b3 was increased until maximal silhouette width was achieved for which\nd >\n0. For each GLRM-produced feature subset, the pairwise dissimilarities (i.e., distances) between observations in the data set were computed in a Gower's dissimilarity matrix.\n30\nGower's dissimilarity was chosen because it can accommodate mixed feature types (i.e., continuous and categorical). The resulting dissimilarity matrix was clustered using the partitioning around medoids (PAM) clustering algorithm (PAM implemented using R package\ncluster\n, version 2.0.6).\n31\n,\n32\nOptimal number of clusters,\nk\n, was determined by selecting the average cluster silhouette width for\nk\nbetween 3 and 10. The range of values for\nk\nwas chosen to consider both clinical utility and capture the maximum average silhouette width between the clusters. Specifically, we set the lower limit of k to three clusters, because that would be at least as granular as the number of injury severity groups based on GCS score (i.e., mild, moderate, severe). The upper limit was set to k\u2009=\u200910 from empirical demonstration that cluster silhouette width scores reached a minimum by this point. Clusters were visualized in two-dimensional space using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (T-SNE) with a perplexity set at 50.\n33\nTo ensure the reproducibility of the feature selection and stability of the clustering result, we ran a fivefold cross-validation of the data. Each fold, consisting of \u223c20% of the total number of samples, was left out as a test set while the remaining observations comprised a training set used to select \u03b3 and subsequently determine the selected feature subset for each fold. The training feature subset was then used to cluster the observations in the test set, and the maximum average silhouette width score and optimal\nk\nclusters were recorded. The intersection of the features identified in each fold was used to cluster the full data set. Stability of both the training and test clusters was assessed by comparing the similarity of cluster membership between pairs of observations in the training and test sets, respectively, with their cluster membership in the full data set using the Pairwise Similarity Index (PSI). PSI was defined for two sets of clustering labels of equal length\u2014Set A and Set B\u2014as the number of observation pairs that belong to the same cluster in both Set A and Set B divided by the total number of observation pairs:\nPairwise\u2009Similarity\u2009Index\n(\n%\n)\n=\n(\nSame\u00a0Cluster\u00a0in\u00a0Set\u00a0A\n\u2229\nSame\u00a0Cluster\u00a0in\u00a0Set\u00a0B\n)\nTotal\u00a0numer\u00a0of\u00a0observation\u00a0pairs\n*\n1\n00\nIn determining the necessity of the final feature subset, both the PSI and the Jaccard similarity coefficient were calculated.\n34\nTwo clustering results were considered similar if the PSI was >90%, such that 90% of observation pairs had the same relationship (i.e., belonged to the same cluster in both cluster schemas, or belonged to different clusters in both cluster schemas) and had a Jaccard coefficient >0.75, indicating that 75% of each cluster was recovered in the alternate cluster schema.\n35\nTo ensure none of the selected features were redundant or non-informative to cluster formation, we tested the necessity of each feature in achieving the same clustering result. Individual features were \u201cnullified\u201d by randomly shuffling values among patients, essentially transforming that feature into noise. This shuffling procedure was repeated 500 times to generate a series of null feature distributions. Clustering was performed on the feature subset with the null-shuffled feature, and the likeness of the new clusters to the clusters of the full feature set was compared by measuring the mean Jaccard similarity coefficients and pairwise similarity indices, respectively (\nFig. 2A, B\n). Features that exceeded the PSI and Jaccard similarity thresholds were excluded from the final feature set used to generate clusters.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nDetermining the necessity of each feature in contributing to the final cluster assignment. Feature necessity: Each feature was individually replaced with a null distribution of randomly shuffled values. The remaining features plus the null feature were then clustered upon and the similarity of the clustering result was compared with the original feature set clustering solution using two different measures: (\nA\n) the Jaccard similarity coefficient and (\nB\n) the pairwise similarity index. Any feature with a Jaccard similarity coefficient >0.75 and pairwise similarity index >90% (dotted lines) when nullified was considered unnecessary. Color image is available online.\n\nReproducibility of clusters in external validation data set\nTo assess cluster generalizability in an external validation data set, we developed a supervised K-NN classifier to determine the cluster assignments of subjects in the TRACK-TBI Pilot data set using the GLRM-selected features. Briefly, K-NN is a nonparametric algorithm in which the target class of a new observation is determined by the majority target class of the\nK\nneighboring observations used to train the model. COBRIT data were split into a training data set (80%,\nn\n=\u2009970 subjects) and a holdout data set (20%,\nn\n=\u2009243 subjects). Model hyperparameter\nK\nwas tuned using 10-fold cross-validation on the training data for values of\nK\nbetween 1 and 20 (K-NN implemented using\ncaret\npackage in R, version 6.0-78).\n36\nThe performance of the trained K-NN model was evaluated by measuring the accuracy of labeling the correct cluster in the holdout data set. The trained K-NN model was then used to predict the subtypes (i.e., cluster membership) of TRACK-TBI Pilot subjects with predictor feature data available (\nn\n=\u2009385). To determine the resemblance of TRACK-TBI-predicted clusters to the original COBRIT-derived clusters, the pairwise Gower's dissimilarities between TRACK-TBI and COBRIT patients in the same clusters were calculated and compared between the two data sets using the cross-match test.\n37\nThe cross-match statistical test is a distribution-free permutation test that compares two multivariate distributions of different sample sizes by using distances between observations. Observations are divided into pairs with the goal of minimizing the distance between observations. The cross-match statistic is defined as the number of times a subject from one group was paired with a subject from another group; small values of the statistic (i.e., fewer pairs with observations from both groups) reject the hypothesis that the observations come from the same distribution. Lastly, to determine if TRACK-TBI clusters had similar long-term recovery outcomes to COBRIT clusters, 90- and 180-day GOS-E scores for TRACK-TBI subjects were examined for inter-phenotype differences.\n\nStatistical analysis\nWe assessed differences in the multivariate predictors (i.e., the GLRM-selected baseline features) of cluster membership and GCS severity group by conducting multinomial logistical regression analyses in which cluster membership was modeled as the dependent variable. The adjusted odds ratios with associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) and\np\nvalues calculated from Wald tests are reported to demonstrate the magnitude of influence that each predictor feature had on cluster membership. Non-predictor numerical variables were univariately assessed for differences between clusters using the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test with Holm's correction for multiple comparisons. Pearson's \u03c7\n2\ntest was used to compare the distribution of categorical variables by cluster. Numerical data are presented as the median and interquartile range (IQR). Statistical comparisons were considered significant when corresponding\np\nvalues were <0.05 or as determined by the Holm's test statistic after correcting for multiple comparisons. All data were processed and analyzed using the R statistical programming language (R version 3.4.0) and RStudio software (version 1.0.143).

    "Methods": "Participants\nPatients admitted to the emergency department (ED) or inpatient trauma service at a Level 1 trauma center in Milwaukee, WI between May 2017 and August 2018 were identified through the Epic medical record system. Screening and recruitment flow charts are available in the online\nSupplementary Material S1\n. Patients who had been involved in a potential TBI-related event based on cause of injury (i.e., motor vehicle-traffic crash, fall, etc.) were screened for study inclusion in the TBI group. Participants in the TBI group also were required to meet the study definition of TBI (see below) and to be enrolled within 2 weeks of injury. Of the 677 patients who appeared eligible based on record review, 162 remained eligible following additional screening and consented to participate. A smaller group of TCs also were enrolled between July 2017 and April 2018. Prospective TC participants were contacted before 3 months post-injury and were selected to broadly match the TBI group in demographics and level of care. Of the 130 TC patients who appeared eligible, 28 patients remained eligible and chose to enroll in the study. Inclusion criteria for all participants were 18+ years old, English speaking, and able to give informed consent. Prisoners and participants unable to consent (e.g., activated power of attorney) were excluded. This study was approved by the institutional review board at the principal investigator's institution.\nOf the consenting patients, 101 returned for follow-up at 3 months post-injury. One subject did not complete any HRQoL measures and was thus excluded, resulting in a final sample of 100 participants (77 TBI and 23 TC participants). A comparison of enrolled participants who did versus those who did not return for 3-month follow-up revealed no significant difference in gender, race, initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, or the proportion of participants who experienced a work-related injury or who were involved in litigation related to their injury. There was a small but statistically significant difference in age (\nt\n(188)\u2009=\u20092.11,\np\n=\u20090.036), such that participants who returned were older than those who did not (mean [\nM\n] difference\u2009=\u20094.92 years). Of note, 99 of the 100 participants in the current study sample were included in another recent study focused on different outcome measures.\n30\n\nDefinition of TBI\nThe definition of TBI was adapted from the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine's definition of mild TBI (mTBI)\n31\n\u2014a traumatically induced physiological disruption of brain function, as manifested by at least one of the following: 1) any period of loss of loss of consciousness (LOC); 2) any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the injury; 3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the accident (e.g., feeling dazed, disoriented, or confused); or 4) focal neurologic deficits that may or may not be transient. Participants could have sustained TBIs of any severity (i.e., we did not apply exclusions based on GCS scores or duration of LOC/post-traumatic amnesia). However, given that the majority of enrollment occurred in the ED and given the typical characteristics of the TBI population, a majority of the sample would be classified as having mTBI given historical TBI severity grading systems. Specifically, of the 77 TBI participants, 56 met criteria for an uncomplicated mild TBI, 18 had a complicated mild TBI, and three had a severe TBI based on GCS scores and computed tomography findings. The TBI group had a prevalence of witnessed loss of consciousness of 27.3% (88.9%\u2009\u2264\u200930\u2009min duration, 11.1% 60\u201370\u2009min), and 62.3% endorsed posttraumatic amnesia (82.1\u2009\u2264\u200924\u2009h duration, 15.4% 1\u20137 days, 2.5%\u2009\u2265\u20098 days).\n\nStudy protocol\nParticipants completed an in-person clinical outcome assessment (roughly 90-120\u2009min in duration) at about 3 months post-injury (\nM\n=\u200992 days, standard deviation [SD]\u2009=\u20095, range\u2009=\u200985-111). The assessment measures administered were selected to cover the major domains of patient-reported outcomes: symptoms, day-to-day functioning, and quality of life. Relevant measures from the assessment battery that are included in analyses for this study are described below.\nQuality of life measures\nTo obtain information within the domain of quality of life, we administered the SWLS,\n8\nSF-36 (version 1),\n9\nTQoL,\n26\nand QOLIBRI.\n15\nThe SWLS is a 5-item measure which provides a single general life satisfaction score (range 5-35). The SF-36, a measure of generic health status, provides subscale scores for eight domains: Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Role-Emotional, Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, and Mental Health (range 0-100). Subscale scores are also combined to create two aggregate T scores, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores (\nM\n=\u200950, SD\u2009=\u200910). These component summary scores were computed using a standardized scoring procedure in which domain scores are first transformed into linear z-scores based on US population norms prior to calculating PCS and MCS T scores.\n32\nThe TQoL is a 43-item measure assessing trauma-specific HRQoL and provides summary scores in five domains: Emotional Well-Being, Functional Engagement, Recovery/Resilience, Peri-Traumatic Experience, and Physical Well-Being. The QOLIBRI contains 37-items and consists of four subscales assessing satisfaction with one's Cognition, Self, Daily Life and Autonomy, and Social Relationships, and two subscales assessing how bothered one is by Emotions and Physical Problems (range 0-100). Responses on the Emotions and Physical Problems items were reverse coded so all QOLIBRI scales are keyed in the same direction (i.e., higher scores reflect better QoL). Finally, TC participants were verbally instructed to consider their \u201cinjury\u201d for any QOLIBRI items asking about \u201cbrain injury.\u201d\nTable 1\nprovides an overview of the content evaluated through the four HRQoL instruments used in the current study. The SWLS provides a single generic score of overall life satisfaction. The SF-36, TQoL, and QOLIBRI all assess psychiatric and physical functioning, as well as level of or satisfaction with autonomy/independence. The TQoL is unique in assessing a patient's peri-traumatic experience and level of resiliency, whereas cognitive factors and the patient's self-perception are assessed by only the QOLIBRI.\nTable 1.\nSummary of Quality of Life Scales Evaluated and their Content\nContent domain represented\nSWLS\nSF-36\nTQOL\nQOLIBRI\nLife satisfaction\n+\nPsychiatric\n+\n+\n+\nPhysical\n+\n+\n+\nAutonomy/independence\n+\n+\n+\nSocial\n+\n+\nPeri-traumatic experience\n+\nRecovery/resilience\n+\nCognitive\n+\nSelf-perception/satisfaction\n+\nOpen in a separate window\nSWLS, Satisfaction With Life Scale; SF-36, 36-item Short Form Survey; TQOL, Trauma Quality of Life Scale; QOLIBRI, Quality of Life After Brain Injury\nPost-injury symptoms\nThe Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ)\n33\nwas used to assess the severity of post-injury symptoms. Participants rate the degree to which they have experienced, in the last 24\u2009h, 16 symptoms more so than at pre-injury baseline. Ratings of 0 (\u201cnot experienced at all\u201d), 2 (\u201cmild problem\u201d), 3 (\u201cmoderate problem\u201d), and 4 (\u201csevere problem\u201d) are summed to achieve a total symptom severity score (range 0\u201364)\nDay-to-day functioning\nTo assess the domain of overall functioning, we administered the GOSE,\n34\nan interview-based index of the impact of one's injury on day-to-day functioning (e.g., work, home independence, travel/shopping, social/interpersonal functioning; range 1-8 where 1\u2009=\u2009Death, 8\u2009=\u2009Upper Good Recovery)\nOther measures\nThe Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF)\n35\nwas administered to collect a measure of acquiescence response bias (TRIN-r scale). We used the following measures to assess for general distress/psychiatric symptoms: Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18),\n36\nPost-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5),\n37\nPersonality Inventory for DSM-5 Brief Form (PID-5-BF),\n38\nDepression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21),\n39\nand the MMPI-2-RF Somatic Complaints (RC1) scale. A word reading test (WRAT-4)\n40\nwas administered at the beginning of each visit to establish that participants had sufficient reading ability to independently complete the questionnaires. If performance on the WRAT-4 suggested less than a 6th grade reading level, or if requested, the questionnaires were read to the participant by research staff\n\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics including skewness and kurtosis of continuous variables and cell counts of categorical variables were first evaluated to develop the analysis plan. Independent samples\nt\n-tests and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare the TBI and TC groups on demographic, history, and injury variables. Among the primary QoL-related variables and criterion clinical assessment variables only the PCL-5, and TQoL Functional Engagement fell outside the recommended bounds for skewness and kurtosis (\u00b1 2) to employ parametric statistics.\n41\nBecause of our desire to leverage well-known effect size measures (Cohen's\nd, r\n) and because parametric statistics are reasonably robust to violations of distributional assumptions\n42\nwe present the primary analyses of the QoL measures as parametric statistics but also performed sensitivity analyses using nonparametric alternatives for non-normal measures to ensure that this decision did not bias the results. In particular, descriptive statistics for the four HRQoL measures were computed as means and standard deviations. Independent samples\nt\n-tests were used to examine group differences on the four HRQoL instruments (SWLS, SF-36, TQoL, and QOLIBRI). Cohen's\nd\neffect sizes were computed to facilitate interpretation of group differences. Finally, Pearson's\nr\ncorrelations were calculated to examine the linear relationships between the scales assessed by the HRQoL instruments, as well as between QOL scales and other outcome measures of interest. Although effect sizes (\nr, d\n) were of primary interest rather than statistical significance, we adopted\n\u03b1\n=\u20090.01 to accommodate the large number of statistical comparisons.\nTo identify item content on the QOLIBRI and TQoL that was not present on the SF-36, items were coded by two independent raters for their degree of uniqueness or overlap with the SF-36. Discrepancies were examined by a third rater in order to reach a consensus. TQoL items assessing positive sequela were reverse coded per scoring instructions such that all items were scaled in the same direction (with endorsement reflecting more problems). QOLIBRI \u201csatisfied\u201d items were dichotomized such that responses of \u201cnot at all\u201d and \u201cslightly\u201d satisfied were considered indicative of dissatisfaction, whereas \u201cmoderately,\u201d \u201cquite,\u201d and \u201cvery\u201d satisfied were considered indicative of satisfaction. Likewise, responses of \u201cmoderately,\u201d \u201cquite,\u201d and \u201cvery\u201d bothered were grouped for \u201cbothered\u201d items, whereas \u201cnot at all\u201d and \u201cslightly\u201d bothered were labeled \u201cnot bothered.\u201d For the TQoL, responses were dichotomized with \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d and \u201cmoderately disagree\u201d classified as disagreement and \u201cstrongly agree\u201d and \u201cmoderately agree\u201d classified as agreement. Prevalence of endorsement of unique items from the QOLIBRI and TQoL were computed as percentages (95% confidence intervals) in the TBI group. Data analysis was carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll experiments were conducted at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) are accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. The experimental procedures were approved by the WRAIR Animal Care and Use Committee. Research was conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and other federal statutes and regulations relating to animals and experiments involving animals and adhered to principles stated in the\nGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\n, 2011 edition, published by the National Research Council. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250\u2013300\u2009g (Charles River Labs, Raleigh, VA) were housed individually under a normal 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at 6:00 am).\n\nRat model of craniotomy and penetrating ballistic-like brain injury (PBBI)\nAnimals (\nn\n=\u20096\u201310 per group) were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane delivered in oxygen for surgery while body temperature was maintained at 37.0\u00b0C using a heating blanket (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). The craniotomy and PBBI models have been extensively characterized and produce a cavity in the brain mimicking the ballistic nature of a high-velocity bullet wound.\n25\n,\n26\nFor craniotomy alone, the scalp was incised along the midline and a 4-mm-diameter burr hole was created to expose the right frontal pole of the brain (+4.5\u2009mm anteroposterior and +2\u2009mm mediolateral from bregma). Induction of a 10% unilateral frontal PBBI was performed after conducting a craniotomy followed by stereotaxic insertion of a specially designed probe into the right hemisphere of the brain (Mitre Corporation, McLean, VA). The probe was inserted through the cranial space through the FC and rapid inflation/deflation of a water-filled balloon was used to create a temporary cavity in the cerebrum. For biological sample collection at each time-point, animals were anesthetized with 70\u2009mg/kg ketamine and 6\u2009mg/kg xylaxine. All cohorts were controlled to accommodate for the potential influence of isoflurane or ketamine treatment.\n\nRat neuroscore assessment\nNeurological scores (NS) (\nn\n=\u20096\u201310 per group) were determined as described and performed blinded.\n26\nThe experimental design is displayed (\nFig. 1A\n). The NS was taken 30\u2009min and prior to each terminal end-point at 1, 3, or 7 days post-injury. Neurological deficits were evaluated at 30\u2009min, then again at 1, 3, or 7 days after PBBI using a modified battery of tests. NS were based on a 12-point sliding scale ranging from 0 (normal) to 12 (severely impaired) comprised from the following four neurological tests: 1) contralateral forelimb flexion during tail suspension; 2) shoulder adduction (body upward curling behavior) during tail suspension; 3) open-field circling behavior; and 4) impaired resistance to lateral push. The maximum score for each component\u2009=\u20093. The maximum composite score indicating the most severe deficit\u2009=\u200912.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nStudy design.\n(A)\nTimeline of experimental TBI in rats. Individual cohorts (\nn\n=\u20096\u201310 rats per group and time-point) were subjected to either craniotomy or PBBI. The composite neuroscore was determined at acute (30\u2009min) and at terminal (1, 3, or 7 days) end-points after injury.\n(B)\nSchema of biochemical outcome metrics studied after experimental TBI in rats. Biological samples were derived from individual cohorts of rats subjected to craniotomy or PBBI as described in (A) or from na\u00efve animals (\nn\n=\u20096) without surgical procedures or neuroscore assessment. Frontal cortex, hippocampus, and CSF was collected and analyzed for cathepsin B content using western blotting. Cysteine protease enzyme activity was determined in the absence or presence of CA-074 (cathepsin B-specific inhibitor).\n(C)\nStudy design for reporting of demographic information, assessment of the Marshall CT Scale and Glasgow Coma Scale scores, and collection of CSF from patients with severe TBI compared with controls. Cathepsin B protein levels were measured in CSF using western blotting. CT, computed tomography; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; PBBI, penetrating ballistic-like brain injury; TBI, traumatic brain injury.\n\nPreparation of rat brain tissues and CSF\nBrain tissue and CSF were collected 1, 3, or 7 days after either craniotomy or PBBI procedures (\nn\n=\u20096\u201310 per group) in the absence of protease inhibitors for western blotting or protease assay analysis (\nFig. 1B\n). CSF isolation was conducted as previously described.\n27\n,\n28\nThe atlanto-occipital dura mater was exposed by separating the nuchal muscles. CSF was collected with a 30-gauge syringe needle through the meninges into the cisterna magna, briefly transferred to pre-chilled heparin-coated tubes to prevent clotting of any blood cells present, and centrifuged at 1200\ng\nfor 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. The resulting cell-free CSF was immediately transferred into pre-chilled Eppendorf tubes without protease/phosphatase inhibitors, and then immediately stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. Samples with hemolysis were rejected from the study. Upon first thaw, samples were maintained at 0\u20134\u00b0C on ice, then split into single-use micro-aliquots to ensure activity was preserved. For ipsilateral brain tissue isolation, animals were decapitated. After removal of the brain from the skull, tissues were washed briefly with ice-cold 0.9% saline, then were placed onto a sterile, ice-cooled platform. The FC, \u223c0\u20132\u2009mm bregma and the HC were dissected from the ipsilateral hemisphere. After removal of excess saline, each brain region was immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, then stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use.\n\nWestern blotting of rat brain tissues and CSF\nBrain tissues\nBrain tissues were thawed on ice in the presence of 200\u2009\u03bcL of pre-chilled Cytobuster reagent (Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA), gently sonicated for 1 X 10\u2009sec, stored on ice for 10\u2009min, then centrifuged at 10\u2009kg, 4\u00b0C, for 10\u2009min. Clarified supernatant was retained at 4\u00b0C and prepared as micro-aliquots and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. A single aliquot was thawed for protein concentration measurement using the MicroBCA protein assay kit (Thermo/Pierce, Rockford, IL). All samples were normalized based on total protein. Five micrograms of total protein from brain tissue supernatant were prepared in lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) sample buffer (final 2X LDS, 250\u2009mM dithiothreitol [DTT], pH 8.4), heated to 95\u00b0C for 5\u2009min, then briefly centrifuged at room temperature (RT) and was separated by one-dimensional 4\u201312% polyacrylamide electrophoresis (1D-PAGE) using Bis-Tris Protein NuPAGE Gels (catalog # NP0329PK2; Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher, Carlsbad, CA), followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA). Protein was transferred to PVDF membranes, which were blocked in 4% non-fat dry milk +0.01% Tween-20/1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.8, washed 3 times in 1X PBS, then incubated in goat anti-mouse CatB antibody (1/500) (catalog # AF965; R and D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) in blocking solution at 4\u00b0C, overnight. Membranes were washed, incubated in donkey anti-goat-HRP secondary (catalog # sc-2020; Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX), washed, and then incubated with SuperSignal West Femtomole Reagent (Thermo/Pierce). Images were captured using the ImageQuant LAS 4000 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA).\nCSF\nA 15-\u03bcL aliquot of CSF was diluted with an equal volume of activation buffer for 1\u2009h at 37\u00b0C. The reaction was halted by placing samples on ice for 10\u2009min, then supplementing with 5-\u03bcL 4X LDS sample buffer, pH 8.4, containing 250\u2009mM DTT. Samples were denatured at 95\u00b0C for 5\u2009min, then briefly centrifuged at RT. Thereafter, 10\u2009\u03bcL was separated at RT by 4\u201312% Bis-Tris gels, then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BioRad, Hercules, CA), blocked with LiCOR Odyssey buffer (LiCOR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) for 2\u2009h at RT, then incubated with the same goat anti-mouse CatB antibody (1/500) in LiCOR blocking buffer overnight. After washing 3 times in 0.02% Tween in 1X PBS, membranes were incubated with IRDye\n\u00ae\n800CW donkey Anti-Goat IgG Secondary Antibody (catalog # 926-32214; Li-COR Biosciences) for 1\u2009h at RT. After washing, images were captured using the Odyssey CLx near-infrared fluorescence imaging system (Li-COR Biosciences). Recombinant 2.5- to 5-\u03bcg rat CatB was used as a loading control in each gel (catalog # 80545-R08H; Sino Biological Inc., Wayne, PA) was used as a control. For brain tissues CatB and quantitation and molecular weight estimation were conducted with ImageQuant TL software version 7.0 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Densitometry of CSF was conducted using Image Studio version 5.0 (Li-COR Biosciences).\n\nProtease assays for rat brain tissues and CSF\nAll solutions were prepared fresh daily and stored chilled until use. A stock solution of substrate, z-Phe-Arg-amino-methyl coumarin (FR-AMC), was prepared at 1\u2009mM in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/H\n2\nO and stored in micro-aliquots at \u221280\u00b0C until use per assay, per day. Protease assays were performed at 37\u00b0C unless otherwise noted. For brain tissue samples, supernatants were prepared in ice-cold Cytobuster reagent for a final concentration of 10\u2009\u03bcg/50\u2009\u03bcL/well. CSF samples were diluted directly into 1X assay buffer (v/v\u2009=\u20091/40), for a final volume of 50\u2009\u03bcL/well. Brain tissue or CSF samples were mixed with 50\u2009\u03bcL of 2X Assay Buffer (100\u2009mM Na-acetate, 2\u2009mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA], 200\u2009mM NaCl, pH 5.5) for 5\u2009min and warmed to 37\u00b0C. The mixtures were supplemented with 25\u2009\u03bcL of 2X Activation Buffer (assay buffer supplemented with 8\u2009mM DTT) for 10\u2009min without (0\u2009nM) or supplemented with CA-074 (2S)-1-[(2S,3S)-3-methyl-2-[[(3S)-3-(propylcarbamoyl)oxirane-2-carbonyl]amino]pentanoyl]pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid) inhibitor. Thereafter, 25\u2009\u03bcL of 25 \u03bcM FR-AMC (catalog # C9521; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in 1X Assay Buffer was added to the reaction mixture.\nGeneration of the AMC product was monitored every 5\u2009min up to 30\u2009min (brain tissue) or 60\u2009min (CSF) (excitation\u2009=\u2009370\u2009nm, emission\u2009=\u2009450\u2009nm) acquired with Gen5 using the Synergy plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT). All samples and standards were tested in triplicate. Fluorescent units were converted to concentration (\u03bcM) based on comparison to the standard curve generated by free AMC (range: 0\u201320\u2009\u03bcM). Recombinant human CatB (catalog # 953-CY; R and D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was used as a positive control in all assays. Baseline values of AMC were derived from the assay performed in the absence of cathepsin B. The resulting value is used as a \u201cblank,\u201d which is subtracted from all values prior to extrapolation from the AMC standard curve.\n\nWestern blotting of human CSF\nCSF samples were derived from patients diagnosed with blunt trauma to the head, who presented to the emergency department of Ben Taub General Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX (study protocol, Baylor College of Medicine, IRB Protocol # H-13606) (\nn\n=\u200920) and were compared with non-TBI controls (\nn\n=\u200910). CSF was collected until a ventriculostomy catheter was no longer clinically indicated. CSF samples were diverted to 15-mL conical polypropylene centrifuge tubes (BD Falcon, Bedford, MA) and centrifuged at 4000\ng\nat RT for 5\u2009min to remove cellular debris. Clarified CSF was transferred into cryogenic tubes, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. Control CSF samples were purchased from BioreclamationIVT (Baltimore, MD).\nWestern blotting was conducted as follows. Recombinant human CatB (100\u2009ng/lane) was loaded as a positive control. Twenty microliters of human CSF was mixed with a sample loading buffer (final, 8X sodium dodecyl sufate [SDS] sample buffer, 25\u2009mM DTT), then centrifuged for 1\u2009min, and resolved using 1D-PAGE (4\u201320% Tris-glycine; Invitrogen). Samples were then transferred onto PVDF membranes, blocked with 5% non-fat milk in TBST (50\u2009mM Tris, 138\u2009mM NaCl, 2.7\u2009mM KCl, pH 8.0, 0.05% Tween-20) for 1\u2009h at RT. After washing in 3X TBST, membranes were incubated with goat anti-mouse CatB antibody (1/500) (Catalog # AF965, R and D Systems) in blocking solution at 4\u00b0C overnight, washed, then incubated for 1\u2009h at RT with anti-goat alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies at 1/5000 (Millipore Sigma). Images were captured using a high-resolution flatbed scanner (Epson, Long Beach, CA) using UN-SCAN-IT software (version 6.1, Silk Scientific Software, Orem, UT). Band quantitation of original non-manipulated images was conducted with ImageJ (version 1.5, Research Services Branch, National Institutes of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD). For representative western blot images, contrast was enhanced for visualization purposes only.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data were analyzed using Prism (version 6; GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). Outliers were removed by the ROUT method prior to statistical analysis (rat Q\u2009=\u20091%, human Q\u2009=\u20095%).\nRat brain tissue and CSF normalization\nFor brain tissue, subsets of na\u00efve, craniotomy, or PBBI samples were analyzed on the same gel to allow for direct comparison and normalization. For brain tissue, samples were normalized for total protein prior to loading. CSF was normalized to the intensity of proCatB in the 5-\u03bcg loading control per gel. Thereafter, proCatB and matCatB data were normalized to the average value of proCatB (37\u2009kDa) detected in na\u00efve controls. All values shown were derived based on proCatB derived from na\u00efve controls, such that the normalized average level of proCatB mean\u2009=\u20091 for each brain region studied.\nBrain tissue and CSF western blotting\nData were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Tukey multiple comparisons post-test (#\np\n\u2264\u20090.05 injury vs. na\u00efve control, *\np\n\u2264\u20090.05 craniotomy vs. PBBI).\nProtease assays\nThe rate AMC generation ([\u03bcM]/min) was determined to be linear for brain tissue within 0\u201330\u2009min and for CSF between 20 and 120\u2009min. Therefore the reaction rate was extrapolated from data derived from the 10-min (brain tissue) or 60-min (CSF) reaction times. For protease activity assays conducted with CA-074, activity is displayed compared with samples tested without inhibitor (0% inhibition). Assays were compared using ANOVA and Tukey post-test (#\np\n\u2264\u20090.05, injury vs. na\u00efve control; *\np\n\u2264\u20090.05, craniotomy vs. PBBI).\nHuman CSF western blotting\nResults were analyzed using the two-tailed\nt\n-test with Welch's correction (*\np\n\u2264\u20090.05). Correlations between protein levels and time were determined using the one-tailed, Pearson test."

    "Methods": "Patient population\nPatients from the multi-center CENTER-TBI HR ICU cohort were included in this study. Only patients who underwent a secondary DC and had the following high-frequency physiology recording parameters were included: 1) at least 24\u2009h of recording prior to DC, and 2) more than 48\u2009h of recording post-DC. These patients were prospectively recruited between January 2015 and December 2017, from across 21 centers in the European Union (EU). All patients were admitted to an ICU for their TBI during the course of the study, and had high-frequency digital signals recorded from their ICU monitors during the course of their ICU stay. All patients suffered predominantly from moderate to severe TBI (moderate\u2009=\u2009Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score 9\u201312, and severe\u2009=\u2009GCS \u22648). A minority of patients suffered from non-severe TBI, with subsequent early deterioration leading to ICU admission for care and monitoring. All patients in this cohort had invasive ICP monitoring conducted in accordance with Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) guidelines.\n18\n\nEthics\nData used in these analyses were collected as part of the CENTER-TBI study, which had individual national or local regulatory approval; the U.K. ethics approval is provided as an exemplar (IRAS No: 150943; REC 14/SC/1370). The CENTER-TBI study has been conducted in accordance with all relevant laws of the EU if directly applicable or of direct effect and all relevant laws of the country where the recruiting sites were located, including but not limited to, the relevant privacy and data protection laws and regulations (the \u201cPrivacy Law\u201d), the relevant laws and regulations on the use of human materials, and all relevant guidance relating to clinical studies from time to time in force including, but not limited to, the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (CPMP/ICH/135/95) (ICH GCP) and the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki entitled \u201cEthical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects.\u201d Informed consent by the patients and/or the legal representative/next of kin was obtained, accordingly to the local legislations, for all patients recruited in the core data set of CENTER-TBI and documented in the electronic case report form (e-CRF).\n\nData collection\nAs part of recruitment to the multi-center high-resolution ICU cohort of CENTER-TBI,\n17\ndemographics and clinical data were prospectively collected, and patients had high-frequency digital signals from ICU monitoring recorded throughout their ICU stay, with the goal of initiating recording within 24\u2009h of injury. All digital ICU signals were further processed (see sections on Signal Acquisition and Signal Processing). For the purpose of this study, the following admission demographic variables were collected: age, sex, and admission Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS total and motor), admission pupillary response, admission Marshall computed tomography (CT) grade, presence of subarachnoid hemorrhage on admission CT, presence of epidural hematoma on admission CT, history of pre-hospital hypoxia, history of pre-hospital hypotension, and admission glucose and hemoglobin values. CENTER-TBI data version 1.0 was accessed for the purpose of this study, using the Opal datamart software.\n19\n\nSignal acquisition\nArterial blood pressure (ABP) was obtained through either radial or femoral arterial lines connected to pressure transducers. ICP was acquired via an intra-parenchymal strain gauge probe (Codman ICP MicroSensor; Codman & Shurtleff Inc., Raynham, MA), parenchymal fiber optic pressure sensor (Camino ICP Monitor, Integra Life Sciences, Plainsboro, NJ;\nhttps://www.integralife.com/\n), or external ventricular drain. All signals were recorded using digital data transfer or were digitized via an A/D converter (DT9801; Data Translation, Marlboro, MA) where appropriate, sampled at a frequency of 100\u2009Hz or higher, using the ICM+ software (Cambridge Enterprise Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom;\nhttp://icmplus.neurosurg.cam.ac.uk\n) or Moberg CNS Monitor (Moberg Research Inc., Ambler, PA), or a combination of both. Signal artifacts were removed using automated methods prior to further processing or analysis.\n\nSignal processing\nPost-acquisition processing of the above signals was conducted using ICM+. Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) was calculated as MAP \u2013 ICP. Ten-second moving averages (updated every 10\u2009sec to avoid data overlap) were calculated for all recorded signals: ICP and ABP (which produced MAP). Data sheets with the 10-sec mean values were created per patient for the purpose of the ICP and MAP slow-wave analysis.\nPRx was derived using the Pearson correlation between 30 consecutive, 10-sec mean values for ICP and MAP, updated every minute. Data for PRx were provided in minute-by-minute comma-separated variable sheets.\nFinally, both the 10-sec by 10-sec data (ICP and MAP), and the minute-by-minute data (for PRx) were divided for each patient into the following: 1) 24\u2009h pre-DC, 2) first 48\u2009h post-DC, and 3) beyond 48\u2009h post-DC to the end of recording.\n\nData processing\nPost-ICM+ processing was undertaken using R (R Core Team [2016]. R: a language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria.\nhttps://www.R-project.org/\n). General summary data for the duration of each time period was produced per patient and included: proportion (%) time with ICP above both 20\u2009mm Hg and 22\u2009mm Hg, proportion (%) time with PRx above 0, proportion (%) time with PRx above +0.25, and proportion (%) time with PRx above +0.35. These thresholds were utilized based on previous publications suggesting their association with global outcome in adult TBI.\n4\n,\n8\n,\n18\nGrand mean values of the physiological variables were also generated for each patient during the above-described three time periods around DC. Differences in these values between the three time periods were assessed using box plots and Mann-U testing, with alpha set at 0.05.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analysis was conducted using the R and XLSTAT (Addinsoft, New York, NY;\nhttps://www.xlstat.com/en/\n) add-on package to Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Office 15, version 16.0.7369.1323). Normality of continuous variables was assessed via Shapiro-Wilks test, confirming non-parametric distribution. Differences in the general summary values for the physiological measures (as described in the\nData Processing\nsection) between the three time periods were assessed using box plots and Mann-U testing, with alpha set at 0.05.\nFor time-series modeling, transformed data were utilized. ICP and MAP were transformed using a logarithmic transform, whereas PRx was transformed using a Fisher transform.\n20\n\nPRx analysis\nUsing minute-by-minute Fisher transformed PRx data, the following analysis was conducted for each of the three time periods around DC, for each patient. For each patient, the optimal autoregressive integrative moving average (ARIMA) time-series structure was determined for PRx using the following methodology, similar to that reported in other articles from our group.\n21\n,\n22\nFirst, autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plots were produced, and both Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) testing were conducted, for PRx measures, confirming non-stationarity. First-order differencing was then undertaken to remove all trend components, confirming stationarity by repeating the above mentioned plots and testing. Next, ARIMA models were built for PRx, keeping the differencing order of 1 (i,e., d\u2009=\u20091), and varying both the autoregressive and moving average orders (i.e., p and q, respectively) from 0 to 4, through all respective permutations. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and log-likelihood (LL) were then tabulated for each of these models, for every patient, during each time period around DC. Using the AIC and LL, the optimal ARIMA structures for PRx were compared in each patient across the three time periods, with the lowest AIC and highest LL values indicating superior models. More details surrounding ARIMA modeling of time-series data can be found in the reference literature.\n21\u201324\nThe general Box-Jenkin's autoregressive moving average (ARMA) structure for PRx can be expressed as follows:\nwhere c\u2009=\u2009constant, t\u2009=\u2009time \u201ct\u201d, i\u2009=\u2009integer, j\u2009=\u2009integer, p\u2009=\u2009autoregressive order, PRx\u2009=\u2009pressure reactivity index, q\u2009=\u2009moving average order, \u03c6\u2009=\u2009autoregressive coefficient at time \u201ct-i\u201d, \u03b8\u2009=\u2009moving average coefficient at time \u201ct-j\u201d, and \u025b\u2009=\u2009error term.\n\nICP and MAP slow-wave analysis\nTransformed ICP and MAP slow waves were analyzed in the 10-sec by 10-sec data sheets, per patient. The time-series characteristics of ICP and MAP were first independently evaluated in each patient to determine then general ARIMA structure across the population for each. Then the co-variance of ICP and MAP slow waves were evaluated using multi-variate vector ARIMA (VARIMA) models. Such models explore the behavior of two time-series recorded simultaneously over time, and are derived via extending the standard Box-Jenkin's ARIMA models to multi-variate systems. Further description on this technique can be found in the References section.\n21\u201324\nThe vector autoregressive moving average model (VARMA) of first-order difference ICP and MAP can be represented by the following formula:\nY\nt\n=\nC\n+\nE\nt\n+\n\u2211\ni\n=\n1\np\nA\nt\n-\ni\nY\nt\n-\ni\n+\n\u2211\nj\n=\n1\nq\nB\nt\n-\nj\nE\nt\n-\nj\nwhere C\u2009=\u2009constant vector, t\u2009=\u2009time \u201ct\u201d, i\u2009=\u2009integer, j\u2009=\u2009integer, p\u2009=\u2009VARMA autoregressive order, Y\nt\n=\u2009ICP or MAP at time\nt\n, q\u2009=\u2009VARMA moving average order, A\u2009=\u2009autoregressive coefficient matrix at \u201ct-i\u201d, B\u2009=\u2009moving average coefficient matrix at time \u201ct-j\u201d, E\u2009=\u2009error term vector.\nWe utilized first-order differenced and transformed ICP and MAP signals, to eliminate trend and seasonality, and employed basic VARMA models with an autoregressive order of 4 and a moving average order of 4, based on the findings from individual-patient ARIMA models of the transformed ICP and MAP, for each patient, confirming that such VARMA orders would encompass the variation seen in optimal ARIMA structure for ICP and MAP across the population. The coefficients derived from these VARMA models were then employed to derive impulse response function (IRF) plots between ICP and MAP. The IRF plots provide a descriptive graphical representation of the impact of ICP on MAP, and MAP on ICP, by using the generated VARIMA model and modeling a one standard deviation orthogonal impulse of one variable on the other, and vice versa. The plots depict how much from baseline the standard error of one variable fluctuates in response to the orthogonal impulse of the other variable, and how many lags in time it takes to recover back to baseline. The above was conducted for each individual patient, during each of the three time periods around DC (described previously).\nFinally, the influence of slow waves of ICP and MAP on one another over time was assessed via Granger causality using stationary first-order differenced ICP and MAP data, with testing of both the impact of ICP on MAP, and the impact of MAP on ICP.\n25\nThis was tested in every patient, in all three time periods around DC. Both F-test statistic value and\np\n-values were recorded, with alpha set at 0.05. We did not correct for multiple comparisons."

    "Methods": "Participants\nChildren with pmTBI (12\u201318 years of age) were consecutively recruited from local ED and urgent care settings between July 2016 and April 2019 for this prospective cohort study. Participants were subsequently evaluated in an outpatient setting at subacute (SA; approximately 1 week post-injury) and early chronic (EC; approximately 4 months) injury phases, corresponding to typical follow-up windows for patient care. Inclusion criteria were based on American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and Zurich Concussion in Sport Group\n25\nguidelines. Specifically, all pmTBI patients experienced head trauma resulting in Glasgow Coma Scale scores \u226513, an alteration in mental status or at least two new symptoms, loss of consciousness (if present) <30\u2009min, and post-traumatic amnesia (if present) limited to 24\u2009hours. HC were recruited from the local community through fliers and word of mouth, and were evaluated at equivalent time-points.\nExclusion criteria were the same for both pmTBI patients and HC: 1) a history of a) neurological diagnosis, b) previous moderate or severe TBI with >30\u2009min loss of consciousness, c) developmental disorder [autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability], d) any psychiatric disorders other than adjustment disorder, or e) substance abuse/dependence; or 2) a non-English-speaking child or guardian. HC were also excluded if diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or a learning disability. Urine-based drug screens were conducted for all participants at both visits. Any positive result was exclusionary for HC. Children with pmTBI were not excluded if they tested positive for marijuana use (\nn\n=\u20094) due to concerns about the use of this substance for treatment of symptoms (self-medication or otherwise). With the exception of one measure (see\nSupplementary Appendix\n), overall group-wise results were fundamentally unchanged when marijuana users were removed from principal analyses. All participants provided informed consent or assent according to institutional guidelines at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine.\n\nProcedures\nParticipants rated symptom severity retrospectively (i.e., for the month prior to injury) and at the SA and EC assessments using a modified version of the Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI; see\nSupplementary Appendix S1\n). The total PCSI score was the primary outcome variable, whereas subscale (Physical, Cognitive, Emotional, and Fatigue) ratings were secondary. Additional secondary self-report symptom inventories included Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scales for sleep, anxiety, and depression, and the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6). For all symptom inventories, retrospective ratings were collected only at the SA assessment in the current study to minimize reporting bias.\n10\nAll participants also completed a semi-structured questionnaire about history of previous head injuries and a self-reported Tanner stage of development to ensure equivalent sexual development across groups.\n\nPPCS definitions\nA brief synopsis of the methods used to calculate symptom burden at both the SA and EC assessments is provided in the following section, with full mathematical details in\nSupplementary Table S1\n. Symptoms at the SA time-point were operationally defined as post-concussive symptoms (PCS), whereas symptoms still present at the EC phase were operationally defined as PPCS. Simple Change methods included the ICD-10 (i.e., at least 1-point increase in at least three symptoms)\n6\nand algorithms as reported by Smyth and colleagues (i.e., \u22652-point increase in at least one symptom),\n13\nand were based solely on change from retrospective ratings. Four Standardized Change methods utilized HC ratings as a reference in calculating both PCS and PPCS burden in conjunction with a standardized cutoff (\nz\n=\u20091.64). RCI was calculated based on the original Jacobson and Traux formula\n17\nas practice effects were not anticipated.\n26\nFor the second method, SA/EC were regressed separately on reported retrospective ratings within HC, with the derived coefficients used to determine significant deviations between observed and predicted SA/EC ratings for both groups.\n16\nSymptom burden was also estimated by summing PCSI ratings, calculating the common logarithm (Log\n10\n) to reduce skew, standardizing (\nz\n-scores) based on HC ratings (classification cutoff,\nz\n\u2248\u20091.64) and adjusting for distributional bias.\n27\nFinally, the difference between SA/EC and retrospective ratings were also summed, standardized (\nz\n-scores), and corrected for distributional bias. Based on cutoffs derived within each of the published methods, every individual from both the pmTBI and HC groups was then operationally classified as being either symptomatic (PCS or PPCS depending on time-point) or normal/\u201crecovered.\u201d\n\nStatistical analysis\nWithin-subject analyses were performed with generalized estimating equations (GEE) using negative binomial or gamma distributions. Between group comparisons were performed with either generalized estimating equations and/or generalized linear models using the same distributions to better characterize recovery from injury in the pmTBI group. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC)\n28\nwere used to examine both test-retest reliability (ICC[2,1]) and inter-rater reliability (ICC[2,k]; self vs. parent). Gwet's AC1 estimation\n29\nevaluated agreement among non-independent PCS/PPCS classification methods. All reliability estimates were categorized as poor (\u22640.39), fair (0.40\u20130.59), good (0.60\u20130.74), or excellent (\u22650.75) based on previous guidelines.\n30\nFinally, confidence intervals were calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method\n31\nbased on an assumed false-positive rate (i.e., misclassification; operationally defined as 5%) within HC."

    "Methods": "Included studies\nData elements of Case Report Forms (CRFs) and imaging data repositories were extracted from three large multi-center observational studies conducted under the umbrella of InTBIR:\nCollaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI:\nwww.center-tbi.eu\n).\n7\n,\n8\nCENTER-TBI recruited and analyzed 4509 patients (4254 adults and 255 pediatric) with TBI of all severities in Europe and Israel. The analysis is in two directions: Improved characterization in the context of developing precision medicine approaches, and identification of best practices using a comparative effectiveness design.\nTransforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI:\nhttps://tracktbi.ucsf.edu\n).\n9\nTRACK-TBI recruited 2698 patients (2553 adults, 145 pediatric) with TBI of all severities in the U.S. and 299 orthopedic trauma controls. The main focus is on improved characterization of TBI to inform precision medicine (biomarkers, classification, prognosis, systems of care, management, and interventions) approaches to both research and clinical management.\nApproaches and Decisions in Acute Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury (ADAPT:\nwww.adapttrial.org\n).\n10\nADAPT recruited 1000 pediatric patients with severe TBI across five continents. The main aims are identification of best practices for six first-tier therapies for intracranial hypertension and basic clinical care using statistical approaches commonly employed in comparative effectiveness research.\n\nTBI CDEs and indexing process\nWe extracted TBI-CDE v2 from the NINDS Common Data Elements Web site (\nhttps://commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov\n) on August 20, 2015, which was close to the times of initiation of the three studies. We focused on the domains \u201cAcute Hospitalized (AH)\u201d and \u201cModerate/Severe TBI: Rehabilitation (Rehab),\u201d as these were considered most relevant to the three studies. \u201cCore\u201d and \u201cBasic\u201d level CDEs were extracted into an Excel overview and listed by respective TBI CDE v2 identification codes. An overview of all Core and Basic CDEs for the AH and Rehab domains and CRF modules can be found on the Data Standards tab of the NINDS CDE Traumatic Brain Injury Web site. General Core CDEs are defined as data elements considered mandatory for all NINDS funded studies on neurological diseases (e.g., epilepsy, stroke). Disease Core CDEs are required data elements for disease specific studies, such as traumatic brain injury. Basic CDEs are defined as elements that should be included in studies related to the section of interest. \u201cSupplemental\u201d level CDEs were not included in the current analysis.\nMany Core and Basic CDEs required re-formatting in preparation of analyses for this study. Various elements could relate to a single variable. For example, the Craig Handicap Assessment Reporting Technique Short Form (CHART-SF), an outcome instrument, was represented by a total of 29 CDEs. All such closely related elements were reduced to one variable in order to prevent over-representation and allow fair comparison. Variables that consisted of separate categorical and text elements were likewise merged to one element for analysis. In the approach we undertook, driving factors for considering an element \u201charmonizable\u201d were \u201cglobal applicability\u201d and intended use in a general setting. Consequently, elements that were not globally applicable (for example Race and Ethnicity\u2014USA category) were excluded, as were elements solely applicable to specific sub-populations, such as the pediatric population or military setting. Pediatric elements were retained for analysis of ADAPT and pediatric versions of the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) were considered compatible with the adult versions. The CDE indexing process for the current analysis was performed by two coauthors (S.M.; J.K.Y.). When consensus was equivocal, the senior author (A.I.R.M.) was queried for adjudication.\n\nData extraction and analysis\nData elements from the e-CRFs of the three studies were indexed and matched in an Excel (\nSupplementary File S1\n) to the TBI-CDEs v2 (\nhttp://www.commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov\n). For TRACK-TBI and ADAPT, imaging elements were derived from the imaging repositories, as these had been scored separately at central review and no results of imaging studies directly entered by site study staff in the e-CRF. We restricted our analysis of imaging elements to those listed in AH and Rehab domains of the NINDS CDEs.\nThe TBI-CDE v2 retained following the reduction and exclusion processes described above were considered \u201charmonizable.\u201d Each CDE for the three studies was scored dichotomously (yes/no) for its presence and compatibility with TBI-CDE v2 codings. Compatibility was defined as either an identical coding format, or a coding format that included the essential elements of coding found on the NINDS Web site. We calculated both the number and percentage of CDEs present in each study and their compatibility with the TBI-CDE v2, and the harmonization of data elements between studies were calculated. Sensitivity analysis was performed on basic CDEs common or unique to the AH and Rehab domains, as many of these basic elements overlapped. Descriptive statistics were used to present data in tabular formats."

    "Methods": "Six PMHS head-neck specimens were tested using the methodology described by Alshareef and colleagues.37A comprehensive description of the methodology used to measure brain motion, including the test device, specimen preparation, and use of sonomicrometry can be found in the referenced study. A concise explanation of the methods that includes any changes relevant to the full dataset of six specimens is presented below.\n\nSpecimen acquisition and information\nAll tissue donation, testing, and handling procedures were approved by the University of Virginia Institutional Review Board \u2013 Human Surrogate Use (IRB-HSU) Committee. Exclusion criteria for the acquisition of the PMHS included any factors that may have compromised the anatomy or material properties of the skull and/or brain tissue, and included any diagnosed skull lesions or trauma, neurological disease, or neurological lesions. PMHS were also screened for blood-borne pathogens (HIV, hepatitis B and C). The donated PMHS (\nTables 1\nand\n\u200b\nand2)\n2\n) were acquired unembalmed and never frozen, 10\u201324\u2009h post-mortem. Pre-test radiographs of the PMHS confirmed no abnormalities of the skull. T1-weighted MRI scans of the brain were obtained for four of the PMHS.

The specimen were perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF)\n39\nthroughout preparation and testing. The perfusion was applied through the carotid arteries and ports at the sagittal sinus and occiput and was allowed to drain through the jugular veins and the spinal canal. A recirculation pump was used to maintain continuous perfusion with a hydrostatic pressure of approximately 78\u2009mm Hg.\nSonomicrometry crystals (Sonometrics Corporation, London, Ontario, Canada) were implanted to quantify 3D brain motion during the tests. A total of 40 crystals were utilized for each specimen. Ten crystals were affixed to the inner surface of the skull (epidural) to serve as transmitters with a fixed-location reference frame. The transmitters were fixed in locations that were designed to ensure that all receivers within the brain measured at least four transmitting signals. Only 8 of the 10 transmitters were used during testing, with the remaining 2 transmitters used as backups in the case of improperly placed or non-functioning crystals.\nThirty receiving crystals were inserted into the brain tissue using a stereotactic cannula system. The positions of the crystals were controlled by a guide plate that was fixed to the posterior surface of the skull. Only 24 of the 30 receivers were activated during the tests (dictated by the data acquisition system channel capacity), with the additional 6 serving as backups in case of noisy or non-functioning crystals. The chosen crystal positions were designed to avoid skull boundaries and ventricles while maximizing dispersion throughout the brain. Slack was intentionally introduced to the ultra-fine wires attached to each crystal during insertion to ensure they did not snag or pull taught during the testing.\nAfter the installation of the sonomicrometry sensors, computed tomography (CT) images were acquired at a resolution of 0.625\u2009mm to determine the initial coordinates of each receiver and transmitter relative to the head CG (\nFig. 1\n). Perfusion was applied during CT scans to ensure that the intracranial space was fully filled and to obtain an accurate measurement of the initial position of all implanted sensors.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nRepresentative computed tomography images following the specimen preparation and crystal insertion procedure. Specimen 903 (left) includes the mounting plates and instrumentation plate. Specimen 904 (right) shows the transmitters affixed to the skull, the receivers in the brain (note that slack is intentionally introduced in the wires during insertion), and the perfusion ports in the carotid arteries and occipital skull. Color image is available online.\n\nTest fixture and matrix\nA custom-built rotational test device (RTD) was designed to apply repeatable, controlled dynamic rotations (CDR) to the head in the sagittal (posterior to anterior rotation), coronal (right to left rotation), or axial directions, depending on how the specimen was mounted to the RTD. For all test cases, the specimen was mounted with the head inverted at the beginning of every test to allow for consistent perfusion and brain geometry for each test. The dynamic rotation was applied through the head CG, and the specimen was returned to its initial position after every test.\nThe rotation severities were selected to simulate a representative spectrum of automotive and sports head impacts.\n25\nFour severities were chosen and consisted of half-sine pulses with a nominal peak angular velocity of 20 or 40\u2009rad/sec and a nominal duration of 30 or 60\u2009msec. Peak angular accelerations ranged from 600 to 5600\u2009rad/sec\n2\n. The four severities were applied in each of the three anatomical axes for a total of 12 tests per specimen.\n\nHead kinematics\nThe six degree-of-freedom (DOF) kinematics of the head were measured using an array consisting of three Endevco 7264B-500 linear accelerometers (Meggit Sensing Systems, Irvine, CA) and three angular rate sensors (ARS) (ARS PRO-8k angular rate sensors; Diversified Technical Systems Inc., Seal Beach, CA). The sensor array was rigidly mounted to the head mounting plates. The array kinematics were transformed to the head coordinate system according to SAE J211 definitions.\n40\nA SlicePRO data acquisition system (Diversified Technical Systems Inc.) was used to acquire the data at a sampling rate of 10\u2009kHz with an anti-aliasing filter of 2900\u2009Hz. The linear acceleration data were filtered with a CFC 180 filter, and the angular velocity was filtered with a CFC 60 filter. Angular acceleration was calculated by forward differentiating the filtered angular velocity data. The peak angular velocity and duration of every test for each specimen was calculated from the measured head kinematics.\n\nSonomicrometry acquisition and data processing\nSonomicrometry data were recorded using a 32-channel TRX-USB Acquisition System (Sonometrics Corporation, London, Ontario, Canada). Unfiltered data were collected at a sampling rate of 600\u2009Hz for all tests, which was sufficient for capturing the dynamic displacements of the sonomicrometry crystals. There were a total of 192 distance traces for each test. Before and after each test, static sonomicrometry data were collected to confirm that all receivers had returned to their original position. Sonomicrometry data were processed according to the manufacturer's recommended practice to remove any data artifacts (obvious point outliers and level shifts) that may appear in sonomicrometry signals. Excessively noisy sonomicrometry signals were removed and not included in subsequent analyses. All sonomicrometry analyses were performed using an acoustic speed of sound of 1540\u2009m/sec for brain tissue, which was calibrated based on the static sonomicrometry data and the crystal positions measured from the pre-test CT images.\n\nSonomicrometry trilateration\nTrilateration was utilized to determine the 3D coordinate time-history of each receiver crystal relative to the reference frame defined by the transmitting crystals affixed to the skull. This method uses the geometry of spheres to determine the absolute location of a point based on multiple redundant distance measurements from fixed reference points (the transmitters). A custom script was written in MATLAB (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA) to trilaterate the displacement of each crystal using Kalman filtering. Kalman filtering iteratively estimates the position of receivers based on the distances at the next time-step, assuming errors in the measured distances, allowing for a more accurate and reliable solution in the presence of redundant measurement information.\n41\n\nBrain displacement statistics\nFor every receiver crystal (\ni\n) embedded in the brain, the peak displacement (\n\u03b4\ni\n) of that crystal from its initial position was recorded for each test and specimen. For each test and specimen, two metrics were calculated to summarize the overall brain displacement response: the maximum displacement metric [\n\u03b4\nm\na\nx\n=\nm\na\nx\n\u03b4\ni\n] represents the largest displacement of any one crystal within the brain during a test, and the average displacement metric [\n\u03b4\nm\ne\na\nn\n=\nm\ne\na\nn\n\u03b4\ni\n] represents the average displacement of all crystals within the brain during a test. The relationship between the brain displacement metrics and head kinematics was then examined using linear regression analysis with the maximum angular velocity and angular velocity duration as independent variables. A separate regression model was fit for each axis of rotation (sagittal, coronal, and axial), using the 24 measurements for each loading condition (four tests, six specimens) in that direction. The linear regression model for\n\u03b4\nm\na\nx\nis shown in Equation 1 and includes an interaction term.\nwhere\n\u03c9\np\ne\na\nk\ndenotes the measured peak angular velocity (rad/sec),\n\u0394\nt\ndenotes the measured duration (msec), and A, B, C, and D are the regression coefficients. A regression model for\n\u03b4\nm\ne\na\nn\nwas developed using the same form as in Equation 1."

A schematic drawing of the surgical procedures is shown inFigure 1.\n\nSCI surgery\nEleven adult (\u223c300\u2009g), male Wistar rats (Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) were used in this study. Six rats received SCI and were euthanized at 1 month post-injury. Five rats received no SCI and served as age-matched uninjured controls.\nSurgical procedures and post-operative care were performed as described previously.\n24\n,\n25\nBeginning 3 days prior to SCI, rats received a daily subcutaneous injection of prophylactic enrofloxacin (Baytril, 10\u2009mg/kg; Associated Veterinary Purchasing [AVP], Langley, BC, Canada). On the day of the surgery, animals were anesthetized using 5% isoflurane mixed with oxygen (2\u2009L/min) and maintained under surgical plane at 1.5\u20132% isoflurane. Subcutaneous injections of enrofloxacin (10\u2009mg/kg), buprenorphine (Temgesic\n\u00ae\n, 0.02\u2009mg/kg; McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada), and ketoprofen (Anafen\n\u00ae\n, 5\u2009mg/kg; AVP) were administered prior to SCI and continued for 3 days post-SCI.\nA dorsal midline skin incision was made followed by incisions through the muscles overlying vertebrae C8 to T4. A laminectomy was performed at the T2 vertebra to expose the T3 spinal cord segment. The dura mater was incised using a 30-guage needle and a complete transection was made using micro-scissors and gentle vacuum aspiration.\n26\nLesion completeness was confirmed using visual inspection and a pledget of Gelfoam (Pharmacia & Upjohn Company, Pfizer Inc., New York, NY) was transiently placed between the stumps to achieve hemostasis. The dura was closed using 9\u20130 Prolene sutures.\n27\nThe muscle and skin were closed with 4\u20130 Vicryl and 4\u20130 Prolene sutures, respectively. Following surgery, animals received 5-mL subcutaneous injections of warm Lactated Ringer's solution (Baxter Corp., Mississauga, ON, Canada) and were allowed to recover in a temperature-controlled environment (Animal Intensive Care Unit, Lyon Technologies, Los Angeles, CA) before returning to home cages. Urinary bladders were manually expressed two to three times daily until spontaneous voiding returned (\u223c10 days post-injury).\n\nImplantation of VNS cuff\nSurgical procedure for VNS cuff implantation was performed as previously described.\n11\n,\n14\n,\n17\nAt 30 days post-SCI, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus. An incision was made down the midline of the head to expose the skull. Three bone screws were inserted into parietal bones of the skull along the sagittal suture to act as an anchor for a two-channel head connector that was mounted to the screws using acrylic. The rat was transferred from the stereotaxic apparatus into a supine position. An incision was made on the left side of the neck and the overlying musculature was blunt dissected to expose the left cervical segment of the vagus nerve. The nerve was gently isolated from the carotid artery and placed into a bipolar cuff electrode.\n28\nThe two electrode leads were tunneled subcutaneously and connected to the two-channel connector mounted on the skull. Cuff functionality was visually confirmed by a cessation of breathing in response to a stimulation train of VNS consisting of 0.8\u2009mA, 0.1-msec biphasic pulses at 30 pulses/sec. Once cuff efficacy was confirmed, head and neck incisions were sutured close with 4\u20130 Prolene sutures and the animals were advanced toward telemeter implantation surgery.\n\nImplantation of wireless telemeter\nImmediately following the VNS cuff implantation, the rats were implanted with a wireless solid-state pressure sensing telemeter (TRM54P; Kaha Sciences, Auckland, New Zealand). Prior to implantation, the telemeters were washed in Tergazyme (MilliporeSigma Canada Co., Toronto, ON, Canada) and were gas-sterilized with ethylene oxide. With the rat placed in the supine position, a skin incision was made in the inguinal region. Blunt dissection was performed to separate the connective tissue and expose the femoral artery and vein. The femoral artery was elevated using silk ligatures and punctured using a curved needle. The pressure sensing tip was inserted and advanced medially toward the abdominal aorta. The catheter wire was secured within the artery using a silk ligature. The abdominal region rostral to the incision was blunt dissected under the skin and the body of the telemeter was placed subcutaneously prior to suturing the skin using 4\u20130 sutures. The rat was allowed to recover at least 1\u2009h prior to physiological experiments.\n\nHemodynamic monitoring and VNS delivery\nAll experiments were performed in conscious, freely moving animals without any restraint. Animals implanted with a VNS cuff and wireless telemeter were placed on a telemetry SmartPad (TR181; Kaha Sciences, Auckland, New Zealand). Beat-by-beat BP and HR were recorded at rest for 1\u2009h. Prior to initiation of VNS, the severity of autonomic dysreflexia was tested. Autonomic dysreflexia was induced by colorectal distension (CRD) using a 2-mm latex balloon-tipped catheter, as described previously.\n29\n,\n30\nFollowing a baseline recording, the balloon was inflated with 2\u2009mL of air over 10\u2009sec, and maintained for 60\u2009sec. Hemodynamic parameters were recorded before (baseline), during (distension), and after (recovery) balloon inflation.\nVNS was delivered using an isolated current-controlled stimulator (Model 2100; A-M Systems Inc., Sequim, WA) via the two-channel connecter mounted on the animal's head. Voltage traces were confirmed using a digital oscilloscope (PicoScope\n\u00ae\n2204A; Pico Technology, Tyler, TX). Dose-response curves of HR and BP changes in response to VNS were created by delivering 10-sec trains of continuous biphasic 0.1-msec pulses at 30\u2009Hz and multiple intensities ranging from 0.2\u2009mA to 2\u2009mA in steps of 0.2\u2009mA. After each train, the animal was allowed to recover. Following continuous VNS, the animals were subjected to an intermittent VNS protocol. Short 0.5-sec trains consisting of biphasic 0.1-msec pulses at 30\u2009Hz and 0.8\u2009mA were delivered either every 5\u2009sec or every 15\u2009sec. Intermittent stimulation was delivered until at least 240 stimulation trains were delivered (i.e., 1\u2009h of stimulation). To assess the impact of VNS on an accidental autonomic dysreflexia in patients, episodes of experimental autonomic dysreflexia were triggered in rats using CRD during the intermittent VNS as well as after cessation of the VNS protocol.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe magnitude of the change in hemodynamic parameters in response to continuous 10-sec VNS was calculated as the difference between the baseline values and the lowest peak obtained during stimulation. For intermittent 0.5-sec VNS, HR during each stimulation was calculated by counting the number of pulses in a 1-sec window centered on the negative peak (identified using the peak finder function in MATLAB [MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA]). BP values at baseline and in response to VNS were calculated by taking the mean value within the same windows. For severity of autonomic dysreflexia, the difference in systolic BP (SBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), diastolic BP (DBP), and HR from baseline and the peak value during distension was calculated.\nData are reported as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM). Dose-response curves between SCI and uninjured animals were compared using a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Paired\nt\n-tests were performed to determine a significant change in hemodynamic parameters in response to VNS. A one-way ANOVA was performed to compare the severity of autonomic dysreflexia before, during, and after cessation of VNS."

    "Methods": "Patient population\nAll patients enrolled in the CENTER-TBI high-resolution ICU cohort were screened for inclusion in this study. These patients were recruited between January 2015 and December 2017 in a total of 21 centers across Europe. All patients included in this cohort were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of acute TBI and had high-frequency physiological and intracranial recordings performed during their ICU stay. Decisions regarding the need for invasive ICP monitoring and ICP-directed therapies were made in accordance with the Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines.\n8\nAn additional inclusion criterion specific to our analysis was the availability of an admission computed tomography (CT) scan and repeat scan performed during the acute period, defined as within 7 days of injury. Patients who underwent craniotomy for hemorrhage evacuation or a decompressive craniectomy were excluded unless two CT scans had been performed before surgical decompression. This decision was based on our inability to perform reliable serial lesion measurements in this subgroup and considering evidence that decompressive craniectomy contributes to iatrogenic expansion of intraparenchymal lesions, introducing a source of confounding bias.\n9\n,\n10\n\nEthics approval\nData collected as part of CENTER-TBI were subject to national and local ethics review processes. UK ethics approval is outlined in IRAS No: 150943; REC 14/SC/1370. In addition, the CENTER-TBI study (EC grant 602150) was conducted in accordance with all relevant laws of the European Union, if directly applicable, and all relevant laws of the country where the recruiting sites were located, including, but not limited to, the relevant privacy and data protection laws and regulations, the relevant laws and regulations on the use of human materials, and all relevant guidance relating to clinical studies, including, but not limited to, the ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (CPMP/ICH/135/95) and the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki entitled \u201cEthical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects.\u201d Informed consent by the patients and/or the legal representative/next of kin was obtained, accordingly to the local legislations, for all patients recruited in the Core Dataset of CENTER-TBI and documented in the electronic case report form.\n\nData collection\nPatient demographics and baseline clinical variables, including age, sex, injury mechanism, and admission laboratory values, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and pupillary responses, were prospectively recorded at the treatment site. A first CT scan was performed on the day of admission, and at least one repeat imaging study was obtained in the first week after injury, with the specific timing and frequency of follow-ups dictated by clinical indication. Defaced imaging data files were made available to investigators for further analysis. High-frequency neurophysiological monitoring was started after admission to the ICU and maintained throughout the ICU stay, with the goal of initiating recordings within 24\u2009h of injury. Global patient functional outcome, including Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) scores, was obtained 6 months post-injury by in-person interview or postal questionnaires. Data were extracted from version 2.0 of the centralized core CENTER-TBI registry by the Neurobot platform.\n\nNeurophysiological signal acquisition and processing\nInvasive arterial blood pressure readings were obtained in all patients. ICP was measured by an intraparenchymal probe (Codman ICP MicroSensor; Codman & Shurtleff Inc., Raynham, MA or Camino ICP Monitor; Integra Life Sciences, Plainsboro, NJ). Signals were recorded using digital data transfer or digitized by an A/D converter (DT9800 series; Data Translation, Marlboro, MA) and sampled at a frequency of 100\u2009Hz or higher using ICM+ software (Cambridge Enterprise Ltd, Cambridge, UK;\nhttps://icmplus.neurosurg.cam.ac.uk\n) or Moberg CNS Monitor (Moberg Research Inc., Ambler, PA). Signal artefacts were removed through a combination of manual curation by experts and automated methods. Flat lines, data related to monitor disconnection, mislabeled data (e.g., period of electrocardiography data found in ICP signal), and non-sensical data were manually removed by experts. Automated filters were subsequently applied to exclude values clearly outside the modality-specific physiological ranges not removed during the manual curation step. Processing of the acquired signal was then performed using ICM+ software as previously described.\n3\n,\n11\nContinuous cerebrovascular reactivity indices were derived by calculating the moving correlation coefficient between slow-wave fluctuations in ICP and MAP (PRx), pulse amplitude of ICP and MAP (PAx), and pulse amplitude of ICP and CPP (RAC). These three indices range from \u22121.0, which indicates intact autoregulation, and +1.0, which typically corresponds to severely impaired autoregulation. Minute-by-minute data were obtained for each patient for the entire recording period, with a median total duration of 135\u2009h (interquartile range [IQR], 92\u2013184).\n\nSemiautomated volumetric lesion analyses\nAll CT scans performed within 7 days of injury for each participant were downloaded from the CENTER-TBI core database and automatically segmented using an adaptation of DeepMedic,\n12\na three-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN). This CNN was trained and validated on a set of 98 CT scans derived from a separate cohort of 27 TBI patients and consists of three parallel pathways processing image patches at different resolution. This step yielded automated lesion segmentations divided into three lesion types: extra-axial hemorrhage (EAH), intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH), and perilesional edema (\nFig. 1\n). Each of these automated predictions was then visually inspected by a clinician expert, and any false positive or false negative was manually corrected using an open-source segmentation software (ITK-snap\n\u00a9\n, version 3.8.0-beta).\n13\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSemiautomated lesion segmentations. (\nA\n) Original image. (\nB\n) Automatic lesion prediction. (\nC\n) Semiautomated lesion map after manual corrections by expert. Green label: extra-axial hemorrhage. Red label: intraparenchymal hemorrhage (contusion core). Blue label: pericontusional edema. Color image is available online.\nFinal lesion volumes (milliliters [mL] of blood or edema) were extracted from these corrected lesion maps. We calculated intra- and inter-rater reliability (IRR) using the intraclass coefficient calculated on a random subset of 25 scans segmented by a second (inter-RR) or the same (intra-RR) expert. We applied corrections for rater bias and rater-scan interactions. We achieved satisfactory agreement with inter-rater intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of 0.98, 0.90, 0.98, and 0.92 for IPH, edema, EAH, and intraventricular hemorrhage, respectively, and intra-rater ICCs of 0.98, 0.97, 0.98, and 0.96, respectively.\nThe corrected volumes were also projected to an atlas template using affine registration methods to obtain their specific neuroanatomical correlates. We used a customized version of the multi-atlas label propagation with expectation-maximization\u2013based refinement method with alignment to the patients' images in native space.\n14\nThis parcellated the brain into 134 regions for gray matter regions with propagation to white matter structures using the technique described by Schiffer and colleagues.\n15\n,\n16\nFor the purpose of this study, these localized segmentation maps were collapsed into larger groupings to classify intraparenchymal lesions as either deep (brainstem, thalami, basal ganglia, or cerebellum) or superficial (frontal, temporal, insular, parietal, or occipital lobes).\n\nOutcome measures\nThe primary outcome of interest was the relationship between autoregulatory status and radiological lesion progression in the acute TBI phase. For each lesion subtype, we calculated a continuous measure of lesion progression by subtracting the absolute lesion volume on the initial scan from the repeat scan (represented as \u201cdelta\u201d volumes [\u0394], measured in mL). For each patient, the early repeat CT scan with the highest total lesion load was included in the final analyses in an attempt to capture peak hemorrhage and edema formation in the acute period. We adjusted for timing to first and repeat CT scan in the multi-variate models described below to control for the different time points between participants.\nWe also calculated mean PRx, PAx, and RAC values for each patient for the period between the initial and repeat scan, as well as the percentage of time spent above previously identified clinical threshold for each index (PRx >0, PAx >0, and RAC >\u22120.10) and mean hourly dose above these same thresholds. These specific thresholds were chosen based on the fact that they have shown similar associations with functional outcome in this patient population compared to the more conservative values of 0.25 and 0.35 for PRx and PAx and \u22120.05 for RAC.\n3\nFunctional outcomes were mortality (dichotomized into alive, GOSE 2\u20138; dead, GOSE 1) and global patient outcome at 6 months (dichotomized into favorable: GOSE 5\u20138 and unfavourable outcome: GOSE 1\u20134).\n\nStatistical analysis\nData were analyzed using R (version 3.5.3;\nhttps://www.R-project.org/\n) and JMP Pro software (1989\u20132019, version 14; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Normality of continuous variables was assessed using normal quantile plots and the Shapiro-Wilk test. The alpha was set at 0.05 for significance, with adjustment for multiple comparisons within individual analyses using the Holm-Bonferroni method.\nDescriptive statistics are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation or median (IQR) for continuous variables and proportion of the total sample for categorical variables. Univariate associations between physiological variables, and lesion progression data were assessed using a mixed-effect regression model to account for repeated within-subject measurements at different time points. We opted to analyze absolute, rather than relative, changes in lesion volumes because the latter tend to accentuate expansion rates for small lesions, which may not be as clinically significant.\n35\nIn a separate univariate analysis, we looked at the non-neurophysiological parameters which have previously shown the strongest associations with traumatic lesion progression to evaluate their predicted value in our sample: initial lesion volume, timing of initial and repeat CT relative to injury, and presence of a coagulopathy on admission or between the two imaging studies.\n17\u201325\nWe also included mean CPP as a potential confounding factor, based on the concern that clinicians may tend to target a higher CPP in patients with more severe intracranial injuries\u2014which could potentially contribute to hemorrhage or edema expansion.\n26\n,\n27\nIndependent variables showing significant associations in the univariate analysis after correcting for multiple comparisons were entered in a multi-variate mixed-effect model. The goal was to determine whether cerebrovascular reactivity metrics added predictive value over previously identified risk factors. Multi-variate regressions were adjusted for age, sex, and baseline GCS score, because these covariates have shown strong associations with a range of outcomes in TBI (see Iaccarino, prognostic paper model). The models were successively reduced and compared using the corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) score. To account for the skewed nature of some of the lesion progression distributions (small proportion of patients with large delta volumes), we also performed a sensitivity analysis in which the regression coefficients were bootstrapped using non-parametric techniques (\nn\n=\u20091000 repetitions). Difference in lesion volumes between dichotomized outcome groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Impact of lesion burden on mortality was assessed using univariate logistic regression."

    "Methods": "Head kinematics data sets\nIn this study, we included human male injury and non-injury data sets from multiple loading regimes, as listed in\nTable 1\n. We adopted an inclusion criterion in which for each data point either (1) all 6 DOF head kinematics were available, or (2) the head motion protocol was mainly constrained to a single plane and the kinematical measurements in that plane were available. For case 2, all head motion outside of the single recorded plane was set to random noise with magnitude <10% of the peak value in the recorded plane of motion to account for small out of plane movements. Using these criteria, we included data from the following experiments. Wu and coworkers measured head impact kinematics during football practice and game events with instrumented mouthguards (n\ninjury\n=\u20090, n\nnoninjury\n=\u2009139).\n23\nHernandez and coworkers measured head impact kinematics during athletic events using instrumented mouthguards (n\ninjury\n=\u20092, n\nnoninjury\n=\u2009535).\n24\nMore recently, a single concussive impact was recorded using the Stanford Mouthguard (MG)in high school football using the same measurement protocols as described by Hernandez and coworkers\n24\n(n\ninjury\n=\u20091, n\nnoninjury\n=\u20090). Together, these three data sets constitute the Stanford MG. Hernandez and coworkers measured head kinematics during rapid voluntary head rotations using instrumented mouthguards (n\ninjury\n=\u20090, n\nnoninjury\n=\u200929).\n28\nO'Keeffe and coworkers measured head kinematics from four mixed martial arts (MMA) fighters who received clinically diagnosed concussions (n\ninjury\n=\u20094, n\nnoninjury\n=\u20090).\n29\nPellman and coworkers reconstructed injury and non-injury National Football League (NFL) head impacts by video analysis and dummy models.\n36\nHowever, the data from this original publication were found to be erroneous because of a faulty accelerometer, and have since been reanalyzed and corrected by Sanchez and coworkers (n\ninjury\n=\u200920, n\nnoninjury\n=\u200933).\n25\nAll the 6 DOF measurements for the head kinematic data mentioned so far were available. In addition, we included the following three studies, in which the head motion was mainly constrained to a single plane. Ewing and coworkers performed non-injury sled tests on Navy volunteers in the coronal and sagittal directions (n\ninjury\n=\u20090, n\nnoninjury\n=\u2009151).\n26\n,\n27\n,\n40\nIn total, we have 27 injury data points and 887 non-injury data points. Injury cases were defined to be cases in which there was a clinical diagnosis of concussion from a physician. For more information on head kinematics measurements, refer to\nSupplementary Materials\n.\nAll the previously described data sets contain measurements of translational acceleration and rotational velocity. The Wu and Hernandez athletic data were recorded at 1000\u2009Hz for a duration of 100\u2009ms. The Hernandez voluntary motion data were recorded at 1000\u2009Hz for 500\u2009ms. The O'Keefe data were recorded at 1000\u2009Hz for a duration of 200\u2009ms. The sampling frequency of the Navy volunteer data and NFL reconstruction data were not reported, and the duration varied between 50 and 300\u2009ms. All the data were projected to the center of gravity of the head and rotated to anatomical axes (x - anterior/posterior translation and coronal rotation, y - left/right translation and sagittal rotation, z - inferior/superior translation and axial rotation). The translational acceleration data were filtered at the CFC180 filter of 300\u2009Hz, and the angular velocity data were filtered at the lowest sensor bandwidth of 184\u2009Hz.\n41\n\nBrain FE modeling\nTo calculate local brain tissue deformations resulting from head impacts, we simulated head impacts using a validated FE head model developed at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Stockholm, Sweden), which represents an average adult male human head\n42\n(\nFig. 1A\n). Because of the computational cost of running FE simulations, we only simulated a subset of the American football head impacts with higher kinematics. All impacts from the NFL data set were simulated. Within the Stanford MG data set, we simulated a total of 188 cases using our FE model, including all the impacts resulting in a clinically diagnosed concussion. Further, all impacts in which the peak value of at least one translational or rotational component exceeded that of any of the three clinically diagnosed concussions recorded by the Stanford MG were simulated, along with a random sample of 10% of the remaining impacts. The FE-simulated impacts were thus biased toward higher severity impacts that would be most difficult to classify for a machine learning classifier. For these simulations, we used the measurements of skull translational accelerations and rotational velocities as input to the model and simulated the entire duration of the impact. From the simulations, we computed two commonly used deformation metrics: peak principal strain in the brain and 15% cumulative strain damage metric (CSDM). Peak principal strain is the maximum strain among any element over the entire time trace. CSDM represents the cumulative volume of the brain matter experiencing strains over a critical level of 15%. Lastly, we calculated the peak axonal strain in the corpus callosum, as it has been suggested that the strain along the axonal fiber tracts may correlate well with injury risk (\nFig. 1B\n).\n43\nTo do this, we projected the tissue strain in the brain along the fiber tract directions,\n43\nand took the maximum value experienced within the corpus callosum.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\n(A)\nSchematic view of the isotropic KTH finite element (FE) model,\n(B)\nFE strain can be projected along axonal fiber tracts taken from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI),\n(C)\nSchematic of lumped model with discrete elements connecting the brain to the skull. Color image is available online.\n\nLumped parameter brain model\nAlthough brain tissue and the brain\u2013skull interface exhibit non-linear viscoelastic behavior,\n21\n,\n42\n,\n44\u201346\nmany studies have simplified this complex relationship through linear mechanical elements.\n31\u201335\n,\n39\n,\n47\n,\n48\nHere, we developed a new lumped parameter brain model by creating a 3 DOF mechanical analog of the brain as follows: we assumed a rigid-body behavior for the brain's motion\n47\n,\n48\nin three anatomical directions and therefore used three separate spring-damper systems attached to the mass of the brain (\nFig. 1C\n). This mechanical mass-spring-damper system models the rotational deformation of the brain from skull loading. To model accelerations of the skull, an input was applied as an excitation to the base of the system. The equations of motion for this system are as follows:\nI\n\u03b8\n\u00a8\nb\nr\na\ni\nn\n+\n\u03b8\n\u00a8\ns\nk\nu\nl\nl\n=\n\u2212\nk\n\u03b8\nb\nr\na\ni\nn\n\u2212\nc\n\u03b8\n\u02d9\nb\nr\na\ni\nn\nwhere\nI\nis the moment of inertia of the mass,\nk\nand\nc\nare the stiffness and damping values of the system, and\n\u03b8\nb\nr\na\ni\nn\nand\n\u03b8\ns\nk\nu\nl\nl\nrepresent the angles of the brain (the mass) and the skull (the base). We assigned previously reported moments of inertia and dynamics parameters (dominant frequency [\n\u03c9\nx\n,\n\u03c9\ny\n,\n\u03c9\nz\n] and decay rate [\n\u03bb\nx\n,\n\u03bb\ny\n,\n\u03bb\nz\n]) in each anatomical direction.\n38\nWe used inertia values for a 50th percentile male brain of\nI\n=\u2009(0.016, 0.024, 0.022) kg\n2\nfor coronal, sagittal, and axial directions, respectively,\n24\nand derived the corresponding spring and damper coefficients using the following relationships:\n\u03c9\nn\n=\nk\nI\n,\n\u03bb\nx\n,\ny\n,\nz\n=\n\u2212\nc\nx\n,\ny\n,\nz\n\u03c9\nn\n2\nk\nx\n,\ny\n,\nz\nI\nx\n,\ny\n,\nz\n,\n\u03c9\nx\n,\ny\n,\nz\n=\n\u03c9\nn\n1\n\u2212\n\u03bb\nx\n,\ny\n,\nz\n\u03c9\nn\n2\nTable 2\nlists model parameters in each anatomical direction. We simulated each impact using the lumped parameter model by applying the angular skull kinematics to the base of the mass spring damper system. For each impact, measured time traces in each anatomical direction were applied to the corresponding mass-spring-damper model. This resulted in a vector of the three peak relative brain angle values in each direction (\n\u03b8\n\u2192\nb\nr\na\ni\nn\n).\nTable 2.\nParameters Used in Mass-Spring-Damper Brain Model\nAnatomical direction\nx\ny\nz\nMoment of inertia (kg\n2\n)\n0.016\n0.024\n0.022\nDecay rate (1\n/\ns)\n\u221232\n\u221238\n\u221230\nNatural frequency (Hz)\n22\n22\n25\nSpring stiffness (Nm/rad)\n322.1\n493.2\n562.6\nDamper viscosity (Nms/rad)\n1.024\n1.824\n1.320\nOpen in a separate window\nWith the tissue deformation metrics calculated from the FE simulations of the KTH model brain, we ran a linear regression between the maximum resultant brain angle (\n\u03b8\nb\nr\na\ni\nn\nr\n) and peak principal strain, and between\n\u03b8\nb\nr\na\ni\nn\nr\nand CSDM. Additionally, we ran a multi-dimensional linear regression of maximum\n\u03b8\n\u2192\nb\nr\na\ni\nn\nin each direction with tract-oriented corpus callosum strain.\n\nStatistical analyses\nHaving shown the correlation of the brain angle measures with local tissue and axon deformations, we used the maximum brain angle (\n\u03b8\n\u2192\nb\nr\na\ni\nn\n) in each anatomical direction as a new brain injury metric, the BAM. Further, we compared our BAM metric's performance against other existing injury criteria. Using the kinematics data, we computed the following rotational kinematics-based injury criteria: peak rotational acceleration in each direction (\n\u03b1\n\u2192\n), peak resultant rotational acceleration (\n\u03b1\nr\n), peak change in rotational velocity in each direction (\n\u0394\n\u03c9\n\u2192\n), peak resultant change in rotational velocity (\n\u0394\n\u03c9\nr\n), brain injury criterion (BrIC), and rotational injury criterion (RIC). We also computed translational kinematics-based injury criteria: peak translational acceleration in each direction (\na\n\u2192\n), peak resultant translational acceleration (\na\nr\n),\nHIC\n15\n,\nHIC\n36\n, and Gadd SI. Lastly, we included injury criteria that take into account both rotation and translation: the 6 DOF HIP, HIP separated into each direction (\nHIP\n3D\n), GAMBIT, and the Virginia Tech combined probability metric (VTCP). For more detailed information about each criterion, refer to the\nSupplementary Materials\n.\nBecause the injury and non-injury data likely fall in a binomial distribution, we fit a logistical regression model for each kinematic injury criteria on our full data set of injuries and non-injuries. In order to understand the ability of the BAM metric to predict injuries compared with the FE results, we also fit a logistical regression model on a smaller subset of just the football head impacts for strain-based criteria. We fit the logistical model to each injury criterion using the following equation,\np\ni\nn\nj\nu\nr\ny\n=\n1\n+\ne\n\u2212\n\u03b2\n0\n\u2212\n\u2211\n\u03b2\ni\nx\ni\n\u2212\n1\n, where\np\ninjury\nis the probability of injury,\nx\ni\nare the components of the injury criterion, and\n\u03b2\ni\nare the fitted coefficients, with\ni\n=\u20091, 2, 3 representing the anatomical directions. The following performance measures were computed and compared to assess the predictive value of each injury criterion.

The receiver operating curve (ROC) is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR, sensitivity) against the false positive rate (FPR, 1 precision) at various threshold settings. The area under the ROC curve (AUC\nROC\n) is a measure of how well a binary classifier, based on the logistical fit, separates the two classes of events, with an AUC\nROC\nof <0.5 being worse than random guessing. In addition, we computed the area under the precision recall (PR) curve (AUC\nPR\n), which plots precision over recall (sensitivity). Precision is the percentage of true positive detections in all positive detections and is a good measure of the classifier's performance in highly imbalanced data sets, as it is not affected by the imbalanced sample proportions. Confidence intervals on AUC metrics were computed empirically with 1000 bootstrap replicas. Using the method outlined by Delong and coworkers,\n50\nwe compared the AUC\nROC\nfor each metric against the\n\u03b8\n\u2192\nb\nr\na\ni\nn\ncriteria to test for statistical significance. In all statistical analyses, we accounted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni\n51\ncorrection method. In this method, the standard significance value of 0.05 is divided by the total number of comparisons, setting our cutoff value to be\np\n<\u20090.004.\nIn classifying rare events, in which the rate of incidence in a certain class is disproportionally smaller than the other class or classes, the maximum likelihood estimation of the logistical model suffers from small sample bias. The degree of bias is strongly dependent on the number of cases in the less frequent of the two categories. Reported concussions in sports occur at a rate of close to 5.5 cases per 1000 head impacts,\n52\nwhich is by definition a rare event. This needs to be taken into account when performing statistical analysis such as logistical regression. In addition, a majority of previously published injury criteria from injury and non-injury events have been based on severely skewed data sources, meaning that in such analysis, the percentage of injury-inducing head impacts is much greater than the actual incidence rate.\n52\nWe used a formal approach to address these two challenges. We applied prior correction and bias correction methods proposed by King and Zeng for logistical regression analysis, using the ReLogit package in R.\n53"

    "Methods": "Animals and treatment\nMale Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (\nn\n=\u200916; 23\u201324 days of age; weighing 60\u201380\u2009g) were procured from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) and housed in pairs under controlled conditions. All experimental on animals were carried out in accordance with the protocol approved by a local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences\u2013New Jersey Medical School (Newark, NJ) and Yale University School of Medicine (New Haven, CT). Kaempferol used in the current study was of commercial grade (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and freshly prepared into working solution using sterile saline. Routes of administration for vehicle (10% dimethyl sulfoxide in saline) and Kaempferol were through i.p. injection.\n\nLateral fluid percussion injury\nRats (age, P31) were subjected to lateral fluid percussion injury (FPI) as previously described.\n18\n,\n19\nThe developmental rat age at P31 approximately corresponds to between 2 and 4 years of human age,\n20\nThe FPI method produced diffuse moderate TBI, very similar to that observed in humans. Briefly, animals were anesthetized with ketamine (80\u2009mg/kg, i.p.)/xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) and positioned on a stereotaxic frame after confirming surgical plane anesthesia. A 3-mm craniotomy was performed on the left side of the skull \u22125\u2009mm posterior to the bregma and 3\u2009mm lateral to the sagittal suture while retaining the dura. A Luer\u2013Lock syringe hub was attached surrounding the exposed dura using cyanoacrylate adhesive. Twenty-four hours after the Luer\u2013Lock placement, TBI was induced by attaching the Luer\u2013Lock hub of each isoflurane-anesthetized animal to the FPI device (Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA). A pendulum drop delivered a brief 20-ms impact on the intact dura. Impact pressure was measured by an extracranial transducer and controlled between 1.8 and 2.0 atmospheres.\nAll surgical and experimental conditions in the current treatment groups were kept similar to our previous sham and untreated TBI study for consistency and which has been published recently.\n13\nImmediate neurological parameter observation after injury did not lead to any seizure-like behavior in all injured animals. Vehicle- and Kaempferol-treated TBI animals were monitored within their cage environment on a daily basis. Mortality was observed in 2 vehicle-treated animals and 1 Kaempferol-treated animal within 3 days post-injury. Surviving animal groups, that is, TBI + vehicle (\nn\n=\u20095) and TBI + Kaempferol treatment (\nn\n=\u20098) underwent fMRI and DTI measurements for the present study.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging\nMRI experiments were performed at adolescence (2 months after TBI), translating to approximately 12\u201314 years of human age.\n20\n,\n21\nAnimals were anesthetized using i.p. injection of urethane (1.3\u2009mg/kg body weight). A tracheostomy was performed on animals to administer a mixture of O\n2\nand N\n2\nO (30%/70%) through a breathing tube. Animals were then placed into a custom-built frame and fixed to ear bars to minimize motion and produce consistent spatial positioning within the radiofrequency coil. Body temperature was monitored throughout the procedure using a rectal probe and maintained within 35\u201337\u00b0C using a warm-water\u2013circulated pad. Chronology of anatomical MRI, fMRI, and diffusion MRI measures were randomly varied across animal subjects, except the hypercapnic (CO\n2\n) stimulation experiments, which were always performed last.\n\nAnatomical magnetic resonance imaging\nMRI scanning was performed on a modified 9.4 Tesla system with a Bruker spectrometer and custom-built\n1\nH ellipsoidal surface coil (5\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009cm; Bruker, Billerica, MA). MR images were acquired over 12 contiguous coronal slices (thickness\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm), covering the parenchyma between the olfactory bulb and cerebellum, with an in-plane field of view of 3.2\u2009\u00d7\u20092.4\u2009cm. Anatomical reference images (TR/TE\u2009=\u20094000/30\u2009ms, 2 averages) were acquired in a 128\u2009\u00d7\u200996 matrix, using a rapid imaging with refocused echoes sequence providing an in-plane resolution of 250\u2009\u00d7\u2009250\u2009\u03bcm. Additionally, a fast three-dimensional (3D) anatomical scan (TR/TE\u2009=\u200950/5.6\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200920 degrees, 2 averages) was acquired with an isotropic resolution of 250\u2009\u03bcm, for image registration purposes.\n\nDiffusion magnetic resonance imaging\nDiffusion-sensitive images for DTI (TR/TE\u2009=\u20094000/20\u2009ms, 4 averages) was acquired as a four-segment echo planar imaging (EPI) in a 64\u2009\u00d7\u200948 matrix (in-plane resolution\u2009=\u2009500\u2009\u00d7\u2009500\u2009\u03bcm), with 5\u2009A\n0\nimages, 15 diffusion directions, and a b-value of 1000\u2009s/mm\n2\n.\n\nResting state and cerebrovascular reactivity functional magnetic resonance imaging\nResting-state and cerebrovascular reactivity fMRI were performed using the gradient echo (GE) EPI sequence (TR/TE\u2009=\u20091000/15\u2009ms, preceded by eight dummy scans) using the same geometry as diffusion scans (64\u2009\u00d7\u200948 matrix, 500\u2009\u00d7\u2009500\u2009\u03bcm in-plane resolution), with the GE-EPI sequence producing image contrast sensitive to blood oxygenation changes (blood oxygen level dependent; BOLD).\n22\nThe resting-state fMRI paradigm consisted of a 5-min scan (300 repetitions), acquired in four experimental trials per animal. Cerebrovascular reactivity fMRI scans were obtained using similar GE-EPI parameters as the resting-state fMRI, which lasted for 12\u2009min (720 repetitions). A 10% carbon dioxide gas (CO\n2\n) was added to the breathing gas mixture of O\n2\nand N\n2\nO (30%/70%) between minutes 3 and 6 of the acquisition and repeated twice per animal.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll EPI images were linearly registered to the subject's native anatomical space before further processing. BioImage Suite software (\nhttp://bioimagesuite.yale.edu/\n) was used for the tensor model fitting on a voxel-wise basis using the diffusion-sensitive images. Parametric maps of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity value maps were obtain as described in our earlier studies.\n23\nBOLD fMRI temporal EPI data sets obtained during the resting-state and CO\n2\nchallenge experiments were analyzed using AFNI software.\n24\nEPIs were corrected for slice time using 3dTshift and motion using 3dvolreg with the fifth subbrick as the base. EPIs were subsequently spatially smoothed using a Gaussian filter (full width at half maximum\u2009=\u20091.5\u2009mm) and linearly detrended to remove temporal signal drifts for resting-state scans only. No detrending was performed on the CO\n2\nscans to avoid biasing the BOLD response curve to the single-event CO\n2\nchallenge. Our previous quality-control scans with the same sequence showed no significant linear drift within 12\u2009min, the typical length of one CO\n2\nchallenge acquisition. Parametric maps of CO\n2\nchallenge-induced cerebrovascular reactivity were generated from a voxel-level linear model based on the \u201cON\u201d and \u201cOFF\u201d timing of CO\n2\ngas delivery and expressed as the\nt-\nstatistical value of the contrast between baseline (frames 1\u2013180) and CO\n2\nchallenge (frames 210\u2013360).\nFor resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis, preprocessed EPIs were band-pass filtered (0.01\u20130.15\u2009Hz). Six seed voxels were chosen from each region of interest (ROI) from the right hemisphere (contralateral to the injury). ROIs were somatosensory cortex, hippocampus, and thalamic regions, ensuring that the seed voxels randomly identified always lie within these respective ROIs identified using the rat brain atlas.\n25\nSignal time series from each selected seed voxel was cross-correlated with the entire brain, producing six cross-correlation maps for each experimental trial. As demonstrated in our earlier studies in normal\n26\nand TBI animals,\n13\nthe average RSFC map obtained from the six different cross-correlation maps represented a more accurate topology of the RSFC network. In a similar manner, the six correlation maps obtained using six random seed voxels within each respective ROI (somatosensory cortical, hippocampus, and thalamus) were obtained for each resting-state scan leading to 18 correlation maps for three experimental trials performed on each animal. Subsequently, all correlation maps were averaged across trials and animals in each group. Fisher's z-transformation was used to convert the correlation coefficients to z-scores before averaging. After averaging, an inverse transform was subsequently used to obtain voxel-wise average correlation coefficient values in the group RSFC maps.\nFor group statistical comparisons, 3D anatomical images were used to generate a non-linear transform from each animal subject's native space to a common space, consisting of an averaged brain from 8 sham animals obtained from our earlier analysis of sham animals.\n13\nGiven that a small ipsilateral distortion occurred along the skull and parenchymal area (injury epicenter) where a fluid percussion Luer\u2013Lock existed to enable the fluid percussion TBI, a non-linear registration was used for the final statistical parameters. Registered anatomy from each animal subject was visually inspected for alignment by overlaying the registered images on the average-sham anatomical MRI template. Subsequently, the respective transforms were applied to all parametric maps of FA, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), and RSFC networks obtained from all TBI animals (both vehicle- and Kaempferol-treated).\nRegions of interest (ROIs) included the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, and white matter areas such as the corpus callosum, internal capsule, and cingulum. ROIs were drawn on the coregistered average sham brain using the rat brain atlas\n25\nand used across each coregistered individual brain (\nSupplementary Fig. S1\n). Similar to our earlier analyses of the sham and untreated-TBI groups,\n13\ncortical ROIs encompassed motor, somatosensory, parietal, auditory, visual, perirhinal, and entorhinal areas for consistent comparisons (\nSupplementary Fig. S1\n). For each modality, group differences were calculated using a voxel-level general linear model (\nt\ndistribution), with treatment as the contrast and standard deviation calculated at each voxel. Significance was defined as a threshold of\np\n<\u20090.05 after correcting for multiple comparisons using a random field theory approach, accounting for the cluster size of contiguous significant voxels.\n27"

    "Methods": "Extracellular vesicle isolation\nHuman embryonic H9 cells were differentiated into NSCs using standard procedures previously published.\n9\nMedium was harvested from NSC cultures every 24\u2009h from a single passage. Media was filtered through a 0.22-\u03bcm filter and then further enriched by ultrafiltration using a Tangential Flow Filtration (TFF) system (all from Spectrum Laboratories, Rancho Dominguez, CA) and filtrate was subsequently washed with 10 X HyCloneTM DPBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific). NSC EV size and concentration were verified using nanoparticle tracking analysis via a NanoSight NS300 instrument (Malvern Panalytical, Malvern, UK). NSC EVs were diluted 1:100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), mixed thoroughly via trituration, and advanced through the microfluidic detection chamber at a controlled rate using a syringe pump. Analysis was performed using NTA software (Malvern), and reported values are average values from five individual 60-sec recordings (\nSupplementary Fig. S1\n). The resulting concentrated extracellular vesicles were aliquoted and stored at -20\u00b0C until needed for treatments.\n\nIn vitro\nscratch wound assay\nA scratch wound assay was performed using procedures adapted from previously published methods.\n17\nBriefly, human neural progenitor cells (hNP1; ArunA Biomedical, Inc., Athens, GA) were cultured and expanded as described above and passaged onto 24-well plates (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) coated with Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY). When confluent, a vertical scratch was made through the center of each well using a P200 pipette tip (Mettler Toledo, Columbus, OH). Culture media was replaced with fresh media either with or without the addition of NSC EVs (approximately 2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n8\nEVs/well), and wells were imaged immediately and at the same locations 48\u2009h later. The area of the \u201cscratch wound\u201d was calculated using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health [NIH], Bethesda, MD) by outlining the area without cells and using the \u201cMeasure\u201d function on all images, and closure was calculated by dividing the area at T0 by the area at T48. Experiment was repeated thrice (\nn\n=\u200910).\n\nCCI induced TBI of the rat motor cortex\nAll animal work and procedures were approved by the University of Georgia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were in accordance with the NIH. Power analysis on preliminary animal behavior and tissue changes indicated that\nn\n=\u20097 per group would be sufficient to reach a cut off of 1 - \u00df\u2009=\u20090.8. We then included\nn\n=\u20098 rats per group to account for optimal reduction of effect size and for additional variability in our assays. Twenty-four male and 24 female adult Sprague-Dawley rats (250\u2009\u223c\u2009270\u2009g; Envigo) were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: 1) CCI (sham) control (male\u2009=\u20098, female\u2009=\u20098); 2) vehicle (isotonic PBS)-treated (male\u2009=\u20098, female\u2009=\u20098); and 3) NSC EV-treated group (male\u2009=\u20098, female\u2009=\u20098). A focal CCI injury was induced using a custom-built pneumatic impactor that has been characterized by us previously.\n18\nBriefly, the animal was anesthetized with 2-3% isoflurane, and received a craniotomy to expose the left hindlimb motor cortex region in the right hemisphere (bregma 0, 1.5\u2009mm lateral from the midline as the center of the impact).\n19\nA 3mm diameter tip was pneumatically actuated at an average velocity of 2.17m/sec with the average cortical dwell time of 250\u2009msec to create an injury depth of 2\u2009mm. Excess blood was removed and the craniotomy site was covered with 0.5% sterile seakem agarose (Lonza, NH). The incision was closed using nylon fiber sutures (ACE, MA). NSC EV-treated and vehicle-treated rats received three doses of either NSC EV (4e10EVs/kg in 1.6\u2009mL) or vehicle (isotonic PBS; 1.6\u2009mL) via tail vein using a 3\u2009mL syringe attached to a 26 G needle at 4-6\u2009h, 24-26\u2009h, and 48-50\u2009h post-CCI. The volume injected was necessary (given our TFF system EV concentration efficiency) to achieve the desired dose of 4e10 EVs/kg, which was chosen based on our previous\nin vivo\nEV studies.\n8\n,\n9\n\nMotor function assessments\nThe animal's fine motor coordination and ability to maintain balance were assessed via a beam walk test. All animals were trained for 3 consecutive days prior to CCI, and the performance was measured on 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days post-CCI. The animal was placed at the bottom of a 1-m long beam tilted at 30 degrees angle and allowed to climb up the beam into a black box located at the end of the beam. The number of foot faults, falls, as well as the time to complete the task and final distance climbed were documented. Data was analyzed by the primary experimenter and confirmed by a second experimenter via video recording. All experimenters and animal handlers were blinded to treatment groups. One outlier in each male group (NSC EV-treated, vehicle and control) was detected using univariate approach (RStudio Inc., MA), confirmed using expected behavioral impact of TBI and excluded from analysis.\n\nTissue collection\nFour weeks post-CCI, animals were euthanized via transcardial perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde. Once the perfusion was completed, the brain was extracted and incubated in PBS with 30% sucrose at 4\u00b0C until saturated. It was embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature compound (Thermo Fisher, NH) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Extracted brains were sectioned at 15-\u03bcm thickness using a cryostat (Leica Biosystems, IL).\n\nHematoxylin and eosin staining\nHematoxylin and eosin staining was used to determine the lesion area of the coronal sections between bregma +0.5\u2009mm and -0.5\u2009mm. The \u201cMeasure\u201d function in ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD) was used to calculate the area of the lesion by overlaying the contralateral hemisphere to the injured hemisphere, and outlining the missing tissue (\nN\n=\u200996; 48 animals, two sections per animal). Remaining tissue was estimated as a lost tissue area in mm\n2\nand percentage of remaining intact cortex. An outlier in male NSC EV\u2013treated animal cohort was detected using the univariate approach (Rstudio Inc., MA) and excluded from analysis.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nNon-consecutive sections were rinsed with PBS three times and incubated in blocking buffer (PBS with 0.5% Triton-X100 containing 4% bovine serum albumin or 4% goat serum) for an hour. Sections were then incubated in blocking buffer containing primary antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; Z0334; 1:500), NeuN (ABN91; 1:500), CD68 (MCA341R; 1:100), RECA-1 (MCA970R; 1:200), COL IV, nestin (AF2736; 1:1000), Sox1 (ab87775; 1:500), and Flk-1 (sc-315; 1:250) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The next day, sections were rinsed with washing buffer (PBS with 0.5% Triton-X100) three times followed by an hour of blocking. Sections were incubated in blocking buffer containing AlexaFluor 488 (Life Technologies, CA), AlexaFluor 555 (Life Technologies, CA), and AlexaFluor 647 (Life Technologies, CA) for secondary binding. The sections were rinsed again with washing buffer, counterstained with NucBlue (Life Technologies, CA), and mounted with fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech, AL). Images were obtained using the Leica DM microscopy system (Leica Microsystems Inc., IL). Volocity Software (PerkinElmer, MA) was used to process the raw images obtained for fluorescence expression. GFAP line intensity values were obtained using the MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox (Mathworks, MA)\n20\n;\nn\n=\u20095 (two slides/animal, total 30 animals\u2009\u00d7\u20092 slides\u2009=\u200960 slides) was used for GFAP intensity analysis.\n\nComposite scores\nFor all groups, a total of 11 variables were obtained from behavioral assessments at Day 28 (Beam walk completion time, distance, number of falls, left hindlimb faults, right hindlimb faults, left forelimb faults and right forelimb faults) and histological data (Lesion volume, nestin, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 [VEGFR2], and GFAP expression). We then computed composite scores summarizing the overall recovery of the animals using two popular dimensionality reduction methods (R-package): The Fisher linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and principal component analysis (PCA). Using a linear classifier (multi-variate normal density fitting with a pooled estimate of covariance; Mathworks, Inc.) and a leave-one-out cross-validation approach, we computed the accuracy (true positive over total sample in percentage) and the sensitivity (true positive over the sum of true positive and false negative, in percentage) to assess the best separating variable combination. The dimensionality reduction approaches used the first two components with the highest explained variance for both LDA and PCA. Classification results were computed separately for male and female data.\n\nStatistical analysis\nFor all group comparisons, Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Levene's tests were performed to test for normality and equality of variance, respectively. When sample size and normality were verified, parametric tests were performed for two or three sample comparisons (Student's t-test, one-way analysis of variance [ANOVA]), and non-parametric tests were used otherwise (i.e., Wilcoxon rank sum test, ANOVA on ranks). For multiple factor conditions, two-way ANOVA and repeated measure ANOVA (rmANOVA) were performed.\nPost hoc\nmultiple comparisons were performed using Holm-Sidak test, which adjusts the significance level for multiple comparisons and provides tighter bounds. Holm-Sidak test can be used for both pairwise comparisons and comparisons versus a control group. Tukey nonparametric comparison was used as a post-hoc test in ANOVA on ranks. Pearson's correlation was used for correlations between VEGFR2 percentage expression area and nestin percentage expression area. A\np\nvalue lower than 0.05 was considered significant and all statistical tests were performed using Sigmaplot (Systat Software, Inc., CA) and R-studio (RStudio Inc., MA). All values are reported as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean and\nn\n=\u20098 per group unless otherwise specified."

    "Methods": "Animal model\nAll procedures were approved by the Institutional Care and Use Committees of the Clemet J. Zablocki VA Medical Center and the Medical College of Wisconsin (Milwaukee, WI). Forty 8-week old female Sprague\u2013Dawley rats received graded thoracic spinal cord contusion injuries. Rats were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane induction and 2.5% maintenance during the surgical procedure. Corneal reflex and leg-flexion withdrawal were ensured before and periodically during the procedure. Animals' backs were shaved and sterilized with a betadine solution. Using an aseptic technique, the surgical site was incised, and the muscle was separated from the thoracic spinal column. A dorsal laminectomy was performed at T10, exposing the spinal cord but keeping the dura matter intact. An NYU impactor was used to induce a contusion injury of varying severities. A 10-g rod was dropped from heights of 50, 25, or 12.5\u2009mm, producing severe, moderate, and mild injuries (\nn\n=\u200910 each). Velocity, trajectory, cord compression distance, time, and rate were recorded and compared to expected values for each injury severity.\n28\n,\n29\nTen sham animals underwent a laminectomy, but did not receive a weight drop. Once the contusion injury was completed, the surgical site was sutured closed.\nAnimals were monitored and given fluid therapy and carprofen for up to 3 days post-injury (dpi). Animals without bladder function underwent bladder expression twice-daily until micturition reflexes returned. Several animals died or were euthanized before the chronic time point based on humane endpoints. Acute data from these animals was included in analysis, and the animals that survived the full experimental paradigm were:\nn\n=\u20097 severe,\nn\n=\u20098 moderate,\nn\n=\u20099 mild, and\nn\n=\u200910 sham.\nAnimals underwent locomotor assessments 48\u2009h post-injury and weekly for 12 weeks. Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scoring was used to determine hindlimb mobility. Animals were placed in an open field and were observed for up to 4\u2009min or for three complete passes of the open field; subjects were scored (non-blinded) during the procedure.\n30\nLatency (days) to return of reflexive micturition was also recorded as a measure of neurological function.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging\nAnimals underwent MRI in a 9.4 Tesla small animal system (Bruker Biospin, Billerica, MA) at 24\u2009h, 30 days, and 90 days post-injury. Animals were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane and maintained between 1.5% and 2.5% during the scan. Animals were placed supine with the T10 vertebral segment centered over a commercially available four-channel surface coil for signal reception and within a 72-mm-diameter volume coil for signal transmission. Respiratory rate, core temperature, and expiration oxygen percentage were measured and recorded every 10\u2009min during scans to ensure animals' well-being. T\n1\n-weighted sagittal images were used to localize the injury site at the center of the T10 laminectomy for later scans.\nAxial, multi-echo T\n2\n-weighted rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement images were centered on the injury site with 1-mm slice thickness, 30\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u2009mm field of view (FOV), 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256 matrix, and with a repetition time (TR) of 6\u2009sec and echo times (TEs) of 17, 50, and 80\u2009ms. DWI consisted of axial slices matching the locations of T\n2\n-weighted images and were obtained with reduced FOV (rFOV) excitation and a four-segment echo planar imaging readout with 30\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u2009mm FOV, 96\u2009\u00d7\u200996 matrix (6/8 partial Fourier), number of excitations (NEX) of 4, TR of 3\u2009sec, and TE of 42\u2009ms. DWI and spectroscopy were acquired with diffusion directions tailored to the long axis of the spinal cord, as previously described,\n15\nand were measured parallel to the spinal cord with nine b-values (0\u20132000\u2009s/mm\n2\n) combined with a high, constant b-value (2000\u2009s/mm\n2\n) perpendicular to the cord (\nSupplementary Table S1\n). The acquisition was respiratory gated, and total acquisition time was approximately 20\u2009min, varying slightly because of respiratory rate. For diffusion-weighted spectroscopy, a conventional point-resolved single-voxel spectroscopy (PRESS) was modified to include two pairs of diffusion-encoding gradients across each of the refocusing pulses. A single 10\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009\u00d7\u20096\u2009mm voxel was centered at the injury site with sweep width\u2009=\u20094960\u2009Hz, number of points\u2009=\u2009256, NEX of 1, TR\u2009=\u20093\u2009sec, and TE\u2009=\u200937\u2009ms. Diffusion-encoding directions were identical to those of the DWI acquisition, except that only parallel diffusivity measurements were included (\nSupplementary Table S2\n). Joint respiratory and cardiac gating were used with a total acquisition time of approximately 2\u2009min, varying slightly depending on respiratory rate.\n\nData analysis\nT\n2\nmaps were derived by fitting the log-transformed T\n2\n-weighted signal intensity to a monoexponential decay using linear least squares. For DWI, maps of the parallel and perpendicular diffusivities were derived using linear least squares by fitting the log-transformed signal to a monoexponential decay to derive perpendicular (ADC\n\u22a5\n) and \u201cfiltered\u201d parallel diffusivity from imaged-based DDE (\nf\nADC\n||\n). For qualitative visualization, color-coded maps were derived by combining and scaling\nf\nADC\n||\n(0.0\u20131.2) and perpendicular-weighted signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maps (0\u201330) as red and green channels, respectively.

A non-linear fitting routine was implemented in Matlab (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA) and for each voxel\nS\n0\n,\nD\nF\nand\nAWF\nwere estimated with a maximum value of\nD\nF\nof 3.1\u2009\u03bcm\n2\n/ms and\nAWF\nbetween 0 and 1. The DDE-PRESS value of\nf\nADC\n||\nwas quantified, as previously described,\n15\nby integrating the signal from the water peak magnitude spectra (\u00b1400\u2009Hz) and fitting to a monoexponential decay.\nA single slice centered at the injury epicenter was used for MRI analysis. A region of interest (ROI) analysis was conducted using a semiautomated procedure to derive metrics of spinal cord CSA (mm\n2\n), T\n2\n(ms), hemorrhagic area (mm\n2\n), and\nf\nADC\n||\n(\u03bcm\n2\n/ms). First, the spinal cord was manually outlined in the T\n2\n-weighted images along its outermost contour. To exclude voxels with high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) partial volume, voxels with T\n2\nvalues >130\u2009ms were thresholded and excluded based on empirical measurements in pure CSF. Similarly, voxels with hemorrhage were thresholded at T\n2\nvalues <30\u2009ms based on measurements of the healthy whole-cord T\n2\n. Hemorrhagic area was defined as tissue with T\n2\nvalues <30\u2009ms. DWI used a separate set of ROIs based on previous implementation\n13\nin which the cord contour was manually placed and only voxels in the perpendicular-weighted images with SNRs >15 were included in the mask. The DDE-PRESS whole-cord analysis was fully automated.\nTo perform voxel-wise statistical analysis, single-slice images at the lesion epicenter were spatially registered to a common space. Only images from the acute time point (1\u2009dpi) were used because of substantial atrophy at later time points providing a poor basis for accurate registration. A study-specific template was first derived by aligning the spinal cord masks using three iterations of rigid-body translations. Subsequently, quantitative maps (T\n2\nor\nf\nADC\n||\n) were aligned to the initial templates using three iterations of rigid-body and one iteration of non-linear warping. Maps were resampled using a single interpolation step using the final transformation.\n\nHistological analysis\nAt 90\u2009dpi, all animals were euthanized with phenobarbital followed by transcardial perfusion with phosphate-buffered saline and 10% formalin. Spinal columns were excised and fixed for an additional 48\u2009h in 10% formalin, and cords were removed from spinal columns before processing. The injury epicenter of each cord was embedded in paraffin and sliced on a microtome in 5-\u03bcm sections. Tissue samples were stained with phosphorylated anti\u2013neurofilament H (SMI-31; BioLegend, San Diego, CA) for healthy axons, followed by an Alexa 488 fluorescent secondary antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA).\nHistological analysis was based on the techniques described in previous works.\n15\nA single 5-\u03bcm slice was analyzed from the injury epicenter for each animal at the 90-dpi time point. Fluorescent images of each section were acquired using a 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009objective with a resolution of 567\u2009nm/pixel. Image analysis was completed with ImageJ software (v38; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), using the\nanalyze particles\nplugin. For each sample, an ROI was manually placed around the entire spinal cord cross-section to derive tissue volume. Background staining was removed using an intensity-based percentile cutoff (ranging from 95% to 98%), and positively stained cells were identified with a minimum size threshold of 1100\u2009\u03bcm and circularity constraints >0.1. Percentile cutoffs and thresholds were manually defined to visually include stained axons and exclude background staining. Total counts of positively stained cells for SMI-31 were then used for analysis.\n15\n\nStatistical analysis\nA Pearson's product moment correlation was used to compare MRI metrics with BBB scores. Separate analyses were performed by correlating MRI metrics with BBB scores at the same time point and final BBB score at 90\u2009dpi. Metrics with significant pair-wise correlations (\np\n<\u20090.05) with BBB scores were evaluated in a multiple linear regression, including BBB score and time-matched significant MRI metrics. The best performing metrics were compared for strength of correlation with functional outcome with Steiger's test.\n33\nVoxel-wise correlations between T\n2\nor\nf\nADC\n||\nmaps and either BBB or micturition utilized the randomize command of FSL to perform a linear regression using non-parametric permutation-based corrections for multiple comparisons."

    "Methods": "Animals\nAll experiments were conducted in accordance with National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California, San Francisco (AN170302). Male and female C57B6/J wild-type mice were received from Jackson Laboratories. Male animals were 8\u201310 weeks of age at the time of surgeries. Female animals were 10 weeks of age at the time of surgery to ensure full sexual maturity. Animal shipments were received at least one week before the start of experimentation to allow animals to habituate to the new surroundings. Mice were group housed in environmentally controlled conditions with a reverse light cycle (12:12\u2009h light: dark cycle at 21\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0C; \u223c50% humidity) and provided food and water\nad libitum.\n\nSurgical procedure\nAll animals were assigned randomly to either TBI or sham surgery groups. Animals were anesthetized and maintained at 2\u20132.5% isoflurane.\n\nSham with sutures\nSham with sutures was performed as previously described\n37\n. Briefly, animals were secured to a stereotaxic frame with non-traumatic ear bars. A midline incision was made to expose the skull and the scalp was sutured.\n\nSham with no sutures\nSham without sutures was performed as described previously.\n36\n\nRepetitive mild TBI\nThe rTBI animals underwent multiple mild closed head injuries using the CHIMERA (Closed-Head Impact Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration) device as reported previously.\n36\n,\n38\n,\n39\nBriefly, mice were placed supine into an angled holding platform to ensure the head was level with the piston target hole and that the impact was centered at the midline dorsal convexity of the skull, targeting bregma. A nose cone delivering isoflurane was removed just before impact. The impact was administered with a velocity range of \u223c3.9\u20134.5\u2009m/sec, resulting in an impact energy of 0.5\u2009J from the 5\u2009mm, 50\u2009g piston. The rTBI animals received an injury once per day for five days with \u223c24\u2009h interval in between impacts.\n\nFocal TBI\nControlled cortical impact (CCI) surgery was performed as described previously.\n19\n,\n37\n,\n40\nBriefly, animals were secured to a stereotaxic frame with non-traumatic ear bars. A midline incision was made to expose the skull followed by a \u223c3.5-mm diameter craniectomy, a removal of part of the skull, using an electric microdrill. The coordinates of the craniectomy were: anteroposterior, \u22122.00\u2009mm and mediolateral, +2.00\u2009mm with respect to bregma. Any animal that experienced excessive bleeding because of disruption of the dura was removed from the study.\nAfter the craniectomy, the contusion was induced using a 3-mm convex tip attached to an electromagnetic impactor (Leica). The contusion depth was set to 0.95\u2009mm from dura with a velocity of 4.0\u2009m/sec sustained for 300\u2009msec. After impact, the scalp was sutured. These injury parameters were chosen to target, but not penetrate, the hippocampus.\n\nConcussive TBI\nClosed head injury (CHI) surgery was performed as described previously.\n19\nBriefly, animals were secured to a stereotaxic frame with non-traumatic ear bars, and the head of the animal was supported with foam before injury. Contusion was induced using a 5-mm convex tip attached to an electromagnetic impactor (Leica) at the following coordinates: anteroposterior, \u22121.50\u2009mm and mediolateral, 0\u2009mm with respect to bregma. The contusion was produced with an impact depth of 1\u2009mm from the surface of the skull with a velocity of 5.0\u2009m/sec sustained for 300\u2009msec. Any animals that had a fractured skull after injury were excluded from the study. After impact, the scalp was sutured.\nThe approximate isoflurane exposure for each procedure is as follows: \u223c20\u201325\u2009min for CCI and CHI, \u223c15\u201325\u2009min for rTBI (3\u20135\u2009min per exposure and five exposures total), \u223c20\u2009min for sham with sutures, \u223c15\u201325\u2009min for sham without sutures (3\u20135\u2009min per exposure and five exposures total). After all surgeries, the animal recovered in an incubation chamber set to 37\u00b0C. Animals were returned to their home cage after showing normal walking and grooming behavior. All animals fully recovered from the surgical procedures as exhibited by normal behavior and weight maintenance monitored throughout the duration of the experiments.\n\nDrug administration\nThe ISRIB solution was made by dissolving 5\u2009mg ISRIB in 1\u2009mL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (PanReac AppliChem, 191954.1611). The solution was heated gently in a 40\u00b0C water bath and vortexed every 30\u2009sec until the solution became clear. Next, 1\u2009mL of Tween 80 (Sigma Aldrich, P8074) was added, solution was heated gently in a 40\u00b0C water bath and vortexed every 30\u2009sec until the solution became clear. Next, 10\u2009mL of polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG400) (PanReac AppliChem, 142436.1611) solution was added, heated gently in a 40\u00b0C water bath and vortexed every 30\u2009sec until the solution became clear. Finally, 36.5\u2009mL of 5% dextrose (Hospira, RL-3040) was added. The solution was kept at room temperature throughout the experiment. Each solution was used for injections up to 7 days maximum. The vehicle solution consisted of the same chemical composition and concentration (DMSO, Tween 80, PEG400, and 5% dextrose).\nStock ISRIB solution was at 0.1\u2009mg/mL, but injections were at 2.5\u2009mg/kg. We reported previously that a dose of 2.5\u2009mg/kg reversed trauma-induced cognitive decline\n19\nand improved memory function in healthy animals.\n33\nIn addition, we identified that a minimal dosing paradigm (3\u20134 treatments) was sufficient for learning and memory rescue.\n19\n\nRisk-taking behavioral test\nFor all behavioral assays, the experimenters were blinded to surgery and drug intervention. Before behavioral analysis, animals were inspected for gross motor impairments. Animals were inspected for suture healing, whisker loss, limb immobility (including grip strength), and eye occlusions. If animals displayed\nany\nof these impairments, they were eliminated from the study. Behavioral tests were recorded and scored using a video tracking and analysis setup (Ethovision XT 8.5, Noldus Information Technology). If tracking was unsuccessful, videos were scored by two individuals blinded to surgery and treatment group.\nRisk-taking behavioral phenotype was evaluated using the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) between 21\u201331 days (\u223cone month) post-injury (counted from the day of the first injury) as described previously.\n36\nThe EPM consists of two exposed, open arms (35\u2009cm) opposite each other and two enclosed arms (30.5\u2009cm) also across from each other. The four arms are attached to a center platform (4.5\u2009cm square), and the entire maze is elevated 40\u2009cm off the floor. Bright white lights illuminated both ends of the open arm. Mice were placed individually onto the center of the maze and allowed to explore the maze for 5\u2009min, and their activity was recorded. The maze was cleaned with 70% ethanol between animals. Risk-taking behavior was measured by changes in time spent in the open arms + center.\nNo difference in time spent exploring the open arms was observed when comparing the sham animals\u2009\u00b1\u2009sutures and animals\u2009\u00b1\u2009vehicle injections (\nSupplementary Table 1\n); therefore, sham groups were combined for analysis. No differences in time spent exploring the open arms were observed when comparing the rTBI\u2009\u00b1\u2009vehicle injections (\nSupplementary Table 2\n); thus, rTBI groups were combined for analysis. Finally, no differences were observed when comparing animals that were exposed to the EPM once or twice (with three months in between exposures,\nSupplementary Table 3\n).\n\nWestern blot analysis\nAt the end of the behavioral test, animals were sacrificed, and the hemibrains were extracted and snap frozen on dry ice and then stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Hemibrains were used for protein analysis because preliminary analysis found insufficient protein amounts (ATF4, BACE-1) in isolated brain regions. The frozen samples were then homogenized with a T 10 basic ULTRA-TURRAX (IKa) in ice-cold buffer lysis (Cell Signaling 9803) and protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche). Lysates were sonicated for 3\u2009min and centrifuged at 13,000\u2009rpm for 20\u2009min at 4\u00b0C.\nProtein concentration in supernatants was determined using BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Equal amount of proteins (30\u2009\u03bcg) was loaded on SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred onto 0.2\u2009\u03bcm PVDF membranes (BioRad) and probed with primary antibodies diluted in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 and 3% bovine serum albumin.\nPhospho-eIF2\u03b1 (Cell Signaling), eIF2\u03b1 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), BACE-1 (Cell Signaling), ATF4 (Abcam), and \u03b2-actin (Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies were used as primary antibodies. The horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Rockland) were employed to detect immune-reactive bands using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Western Blotting Substrate, Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantification of protein bands was performed by densitometry using ImageJ software.\nPhospho-eIF2\u03b1 was normalized to total eIF2 protein levels. The ATF4 and BACE-1 levels were normalized to \u03b2-actin expression, and fold change is calculated as the levels relative to the expression in sham + vehicle-treated derived samples.\n\nElectrophysiology\nCoronal brain slices (250\u2009\u03bcm) including the mPFC were prepared from mice that underwent rTBI or a sham procedure, 35\u201360 days prior, as well as mice that underwent rTBI and received an ISRIB injection at \u223c30 days post-injury. To conserve mice, a sham group that received an ISRIB injection was not included, because there was no difference in EPM behavior at 1 month after injury between sham mice alone compared with sham + ISRIB mice.\nMice were anesthetized with Euthasol (0.1\u2009mL/25\u2009g, Virbac, Fort Worth, TX, NDC-051311-050-01), and transcardially perfused with an ice-cold sucrose solution containing (in mM): 210 sucrose, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 25 NaHCO\n3\n, 2.5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl\n2\n, 7 MgCl\n2\n, 7 dextrose, 1.3 ascorbic acid, 3 sodium pyruvate (bubbled with 95% O\n2\n\u22125% CO\n2\n, pH \u223c7.4) (see\nSupplementary Table 4\nfor reagent information). Mice were then decapitated, and the brain was isolated in the same sucrose solution and cut on a slicing vibratome (Leica, VT1200S, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Slices were incubated in a holding solution (composed of (in mM) 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 25 NaHCO\n3\n, 2 CaCl\n2\n, 2 MgCl\n2\n, 10 dextrose, 1.3 ascorbic acid, 3 sodium pyruvate, bubbled with 95% O\n2\n\u22125% CO\n2\n, pH \u223c7.4) at 36\u00b0C for 30\u2009min and then at room temperature for at least 30\u2009min until recording.\nWhole cell recordings were obtained from these slices in a submersion chamber with a heated (32\u201334\u00b0C) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.25 NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 25 NaHCO\n3\n, 2 CaCl\n2\n, 1 MgCl\n2\n, 10 dextrose (bubbled with 95% O\n2\n/5% CO\n2\n, pH \u223c7.4). Patch pipettes (3\u20136M\u03a9) were manufactured from filamented borosilicate glass capillaries (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA, BF100-58-10) and filled with an intracellular solution containing (in mM): 135 KGluconate, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 4 NaCl, 4 MgATP, 0.3 Na3GTP, 7 2K-phosphcreatine, and 1\u20132% biocytin. Layer V pyramidal neurons were identified using infrared microscopy with a 40\u2009\u00d7\u2009water-immersion objective (Olympus, Burlingame, CA).\nRecordings were made using a Multiclamp 700B (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA) amplifier, which was connected to the computer with a Digidata 1440A ADC (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA), and recorded at a sampling rate of 20 kHz with pClamp software (Molecular Devices). We did not correct for the junction potential, but access resistance and pipette capacitance were appropriately compensated before each recording.\nThe passive membrane and active action potential (AP) spiking characteristics were assessed by injection of a series of hyperpolarizing and depolarizing current steps with a duration of 250\u2009msec from \u2212250 pA to 700 pA (in increments of 50 pA). The resting membrane potential was the measured voltage of the cell 5\u2009min after obtaining whole cell configuration without current injection; this value thus represents the resting potential of the cell after internal dialysis with the intracellular solution reported above. A holding current was then applied to maintain the neuron at \u223c-67\u2009mV before/after current injections. The membrane resistance was determined from the steady-state voltage reached during the -50 pA current injection. The time constant was the time required to reach 63% of the maximum change in voltage for the -50 pA current injection.\nThe AP parameters including the half width, threshold, amplitude, and spike afterhyperpolarization (AHP) were measured from the current injection that was 100 pA above the first current injection that elicited spiking. The AP times were detected by recording the time at which the positive slope of the membrane potential crossed 0\u2009mV. From the AP times, the instantaneous frequency for each AP was determined (1/inter spike interval). The AP rate as a function of current injection was examined by plotting the first instantaneous AP frequency versus current injection amplitude. The F/I slope was then determined from the best linear fit of the positive values of this plot.\nThe AP or spike threshold was defined as the voltage at which the third derivative of V (d\n3\nV/dt) was maximal just before the AP peak. The AP amplitude was calculated by measuring the voltage difference between the peak voltage of the AP and the spike threshold. The half width of the AP was determined as the duration of the AP at half the amplitude. The spike AHP was the voltage difference between the AP threshold and the minimum voltage before the next AP. The rising and falling slopes of the AP were the maximum of the first derivative of V between the threshold to the peak amplitude, and the peak amplitude to the minimum voltage before the next AP, respectively. The adaptation index of each cell was the ratio of the last over the first instantaneous firing frequency, calculated at 250 pA above the current step that first elicited spiking.\nSubthreshold properties indicative of the degree of I\nH\ncurrent were assessed with two parameters: (1) the voltage sag\u2014defined as the change in voltage between the maximum hyperpolarization and the steady state potential for the \u2212200 pA current injection; (2) the rebound afterdepolarization (ADP)\u2014defined as the change in voltage between the maximum depolarization and the steady state potential achieved immediately after ending the \u2212200 pA current injection. Finally, the rebound AHP was measured as the change in voltage between the maximum hyperpolarization and the steady state potential achieved immediately after ending the +250 pA current injection. The sum of these three variables was used as described previously to categorize pyramidal neurons as type A (> 6,5 mv) or type B (<6.5\u2009mV)\n41\n.\nTo measure the spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs), cells were recorded in voltage clamp at a holding potential of -75\u2009mV for 4\u2009min, a holding potential that should have little inhibitory component given the reversal potential of chloride with these solutions. Analysis of sEPSCs was performed using a template matching algorithm in ClampFit 10.7 (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA). The template was created using recordings from multiple pyramidal cells and included several hundred synaptic events.\nAccess resistance (Ra) was monitored during recordings, and recordings were terminated if Ra exceeded 30 megaohms. Only stable recordings (< 50 pA baseline change) with a low baseline noise (< 8 pA root mean square) were included. The first 250 synaptic events or all the events measured in the 4\u2009min interval from each cell were included for analysis. The median frequency and amplitude for these events was calculated for each cell to compare between groups.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 8 statistical software. Statistical significance between groups for most variables was determined using a two-tailed\nt\ntest, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), or two-way ANOVA. If data were outside of the normal distribution as indicated by an alpha <0.01 for both D'Agostino-Pearson omnibus and Shapiro-Wilk tests, a non-parametric test was used\u2014specifically, a Kruskal-Wallis test was used for the electrophysiology parameters. The firing responses to increasing current injections were analyzed as a repeated measures two-way ANOVA. The\np\nvalues below 0.05 were considered significant."

    "Methods": "Study design\nThis study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Texas Medical Branch, and registered as a clinical trial before starting subject enrollment (\nwww.clinicaltrials.gov\n; NCT02114775). We studied the effect of GH replacement on male and female subjects between the ages of 21 and 70 with a history of mild TBI, insufficient GH secretion, and fatigue in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. TBI-related eligibility included being at least 6 months post-injury following civilian, non-blast-related mild TBI defined as head trauma followed by <30\u2009min of disorientation, confusion, loss of memory, or loss of consciousness. Participants also met fatigue-related eligibility criteria by scoring \u22653 on any of the three initial fatigue severity questions in the Brief Fatigue Inventory questionnaire.\n17\nIndividuals who met the initial inclusionary criteria were further screened for eligibility by measuring peak stimulated growth hormone levels using a glucagon stimulation test by administering 1\u2009mg glucagon to subjects <90\u2009kg and 1.5\u2009mg glucagon to subjects \u226590\u2009kg. This study was powered to select subjects based on symptom manifestation independent of the exact level of GH abnormality. Consistent with our previous studies, subjects were enrolled if peak stimulated GH levels indicated either GH deficiency (< 3 mg*dL\n\u22121\n) or insufficiency (< 8 mg*dL\n\u22121\n),\n6\nand were not stratified based on the degree of their abnormal GH secretion.\nThirty-seven individuals with a history of mild TBI inquired about participation in the study. Two did not meet the fatigue criteria, and 35 individuals with qualifying history of mild TBI and fatigue were assessed for peak stimulated GH level (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials [CONSORT] diagram,\nFig. 1\n). Six otherwise eligible subjects did not qualify to continue in the study because of normal GH stimulation levels, five declined to participate, and one was deemed medically ineligible. Of the 23 qualifying individuals enrolled in the study, 3 subjects dropped out of the study after baseline measures and were not included in the analysis. Twenty subjects completed at least 3 months of study and were included in the analysis. These subjects included 7 males and 13 females with an average age of 48.0\u2009\u00b1\u20099.2 and 21.2\u2009\u00b1\u200917.9 years post-injury and an average BMI of 30.0\u2009\u00b1\u20094.9. Of those subjects, 19 completed 6 months, and 18 completed the entire 12 month study.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nConsolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram depicting subject participation from screening through analysis. Subjects between the ages of 21 and 70 were recruited based on a history of mild traumatic brain injury and complaints of fatigue. Subjects were eligible for participation if peak stimulated growth hormone level tested below 8 mg*dL\n\u22121\nand they were otherwise medically eligible.\n\nDrug administration\nThe University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) Investigational Drug Service research pharmacy managed study group random assignment and drug dispensing, while the subjects and study personnel remained blinded. The active recombinant human GH and visually identical placebo (Genotropin; Pfizer Inc, New York, NY) were supplied as multi-use cartridges for daily self-administered subcutaneous injections using a Genotropin Pen 5 injection device. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either recombinant human GH first (GH months 1\u20133, placebo months 4\u20136, GH months 7\u201312) or placebo first (placebo months 1\u20133, GH months 4\u20136, GH months 7\u201312) (\nFig. 2\n) so that all subjects experienced both GH and placebo periods. Similarly to previous studies, subjects underwent a progressive dose increase for each dosing interval.\n6\n,\n11\nIn the first month of each treatment period, subjects injected the volume equivalent of 0.4\u2009mg of GH or placebo daily and increased to a volume equivalent dose of 0.6\u2009mg of GH for the remainder of the treatment period. There were no reported adverse events associated with the study intervention. Subjects were monitored monthly in person or by phone for clinical changes suggestive of excess GH, including numbness and tingling in the hands. Blood tests were used to confirm that insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 serum levels were maintained <400 ng*mL\n\u22121\nat months 1, 3, 4, 6, and 12. There was no need to reduce GH dose in any subjects, as IGF-1 levels stayed within the normal range and there were no subject complaints of GH side effects.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nStudy timeline for traumatic brain injury patients enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover-designed growth hormone (GH) replacement study. Subjects were clustered into one of two groups receiving either GH first (GH months 1\u20133, placebo months 4\u20136, GH months 7\u201312) or placebo first (placebo months 1\u20133, GH months 4\u20136, GH months 7\u201312). At baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months, assessments included:\n(a)\nbody composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry [DXA]), physical performance and fatigue, resting energy expenditure, brain morphometry and connectivity (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]). At baseline and again at 12 months, assessments included:\n(b)\nneuropsychological tests, and questionnaires evaluating mood, sleep, and fatigue.\n\nPhysical and cognitive assessments\nA series of physical, cognitive, and fatigue-related assessments were conducted to evaluate the effect of GH replacement throughout the study (\nFig. 2\n). At baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months, assessments included body composition, physical performance and fatigue, resting energy expenditure, and brain morphometry and connectivity. Additional extensive batteries of neuropsychological tests and questionnaires evaluating mood, sleep, and fatigue were administered at baseline and again at 12 months. Raw test scores were used to assess the change from baseline using paired\nt\ntests. Given the large number of neuropsychological tests; questionnaires on mood, sleep, and fatigue; and measures of physical performance, each of these analyses underwent additional correction for multiple comparison using the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg false discovery rate correction value of 0.1.\n18\nA battery of neuropsychological tests was performed on subjects to assess aspects of cognitive function at baseline and again at the end of the 12 month study. These tests included the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test,\n19\nBrief Visuospatial Memory Test,\n20\nGrooved Peg Board Test,\n21\nColor-Word Interference Test,\n22\nVerbal Fluency Test,\n22\nDigit Span Test,\n23\nBeck Depression Inventory-II (BDI),\n24\nand Processing Speed Index\n25\n(for a more detailed description of individual tests see Supplementary Text 1).\nQuestionnaires evaluating aspects of mood, sleep, and fatigue were administered at baseline and again at the end of the 12 month study for 10 subjects. Average overall scores and individual subtest scores were determined for the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI),\n26\nthe Profile of Mood States Standard Form (Multi-Health Systems Inc., North Tonawanda, NY), The Brief Fatigue Inventory,\n17\nand the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)\n27\n(for more detailed description of the individual tests see supplementary text 2).\nDual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was used to assess bone mineral content, fat mass, lean mass, and total body mass at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months using a GE Lunar iDXA (GE Healthcare; Chicago, IL). Body composition measures were collected at all time points for 18 subjects. GH-first and placebo-first groups were assessed separately to demonstrate longitudinal change from baseline of body mass, lean mass, and fat mass. Because of variability in body mass, longitudinal changes in body composition were depicted graphically as percent change.\nPhysical performance and fatigue were assessed at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months using leg extension exercises, hand grip strength, and a modified 6\u2009min walk test. Data from 17 subjects were used in the analysis, as one subject sustained a back injury prior to the final time point and was unable to perform the final physical performance measures. Three and 6 month time point values are depicted graphically but not included in the statistical analysis.\nA Biodex System 4 Pro dynamometer (Biodex Medical Systems; Shirley, NY) was used to measure isometric and isokinetic leg extension torque at baseline and again at 12 months. Before beginning torque measures, the subject performed a warm-up set consisting of 30 isokinetic leg extensions with maximum angular velocity set to 500 degrees/sec to provide minimal resistance. Isometric leg extension torque was measured over three contractions of 5\u2009sec each against a fixed angle of 90 degrees. The three contractions were performed at subject-determined estimates of 25%, 50%, and 100% effort respectively with a 15\u2009sec rest period between each contraction. The set of three isometric contractions was performed in triplicate, and torque for each contraction was measured as the average over a 3\u2009sec window centered on peak torque. Following a 2\u2009min rest period, peak isokinetic torque was similarly measured over three contractions at an angular velocity of 120 degrees/sec. The three contractions were performed at subject-determined 25%, 50%, and 100% efforts respectively with \u223c5\u2009sec between contractions. The set of three isokinetic contractions was performed in triplicate with a rest period of 15\u2009sec between sets. Torque for each contraction was measured as the average over a 100\u2009ms window centered on peak torque. The first set of contractions for each set was used to anchor perceived effort and the second and third sets were used to determine average torque measures for 25%, 50%, and 100% effort.\nFollowing torque measures, subjects performed a fatigue protocol consisting of a series of 50 maximum effort isokinetic leg extensions with a cadence of one extension every second at a maximum angular velocity of 120 degrees/sec. Torque was assessed for each contraction, as the average over a 100\u2009ms window centered on peak torque. Immediately after completing the 50 contraction fatigue protocol, subjects repeated a set of isometric contractions at 100%, 50%, and 25% subject-perceived effort. This series of recovery isometric contractions was then repeated after 3\u2009min and again after 5\u2009min of recovery. A best-fit power line was fitted to the declining torque and power output over the 50 contraction protocol to estimate the contraction number that declined to 50% of protocol maximum. The estimated 50% contraction number was compared for baseline and 12 months using paired\nt\ntests. Isometric torque at 0, 3, and 5\u2009min of post-fatigue recovery were assessed as the percent of pre-fatigue torque, and recovery was compared between baseline and 12 months using paired\nt\ntests. Subjects were asked to subjectively rank their whole-body overall fatigue level on a scale of 0\u201310 both before and again immediately after leg extension testing, as a measure of fatigue.\nHand-grip strength and fatigue were assessed using a set of two Smedley hand dynamometers (model 56380; Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL) calibrated before each use. The dynamometers were connected via a bridge amp (model FE221, ADInstruments, Bella Vista, NSW, Australia) and data acquisition hardware (PowerLab 16/35, ADInstruments) to a laptop computer for data collection and processing (LabChart 7 Pro V 7.3.8, ADInstruments). To assess the maximum grip strength and perceived force production, subjects were asked to squeeze three times with their dominant hand for \u223c5\u2009sec each at perceived efforts of 25%, 50%, and then 100% exertion. After the first set with the dominant hand, the subject repeated the same procedure with the non-dominant hand. The set of three grip measures was recorded in triplicate for both dominant and non-dominant hands, with the average of each repeated measure used for analysis.\nA modified 6\u2009min walk incorporating self-pacing based on perceived effort was conducted at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months as a measure of performance and fatigue during a routine activity. During the modified 6\u2009min walk test, subjects walked for 2\u2009min at a perceived effort of 25%, 2\u2009min at a perceived effort of 50%, and the last two min at 100% effort walking pace. Total distance and distance traversed for each 2\u2009min interval was recorded and compared with baseline.\nResting energy expenditure (REE) was measured at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months using indirect calorimetry. Following overnight fasting, subjects were asked to rest quietly for 15\u2009min in a supine position. Using a draped acrylic gas collection canopy, oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production were monitored for 30\u2009min using a metabolic cart (Vmax Encore 29, CareFusion, San Diego, CA) calibrated prior to use. The final 25\u2009min of data collection were used to calculate REE. REE was collected at all time points for 18 subjects. To demonstrate the longitudinal change in REE among the two crossover groups, the average REE was assessed separately for the GH-first and placebo-first groups over the duration of the study.\n\nMRI: Image acquisition\nMRIs were acquired using a Siemens Magnetom Skyra 3-Tesla MRI at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. MRI was conducted as the first measure on each study day (6:00\u20137:00 a.m. start time) following overnight fasting. High-resolution anatomical images covering the whole brain including the cerebellum were acquired using a T1-weighted gradient-echo (GRE) pulse sequence with the following parameters: 3D T1 axial (repetition time [TR]\u2009=\u20091900\u2009ms, echo time [TE]\u2009=\u20092.49\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u20099 degrees, field of view [FOV]\u2009=\u2009270 x 270\u2009mm, voxel size\u2009=\u20090.9 x 0.9 x 0.9\u2009mm, 192 slices, matrix\u2009=\u2009288\u2009\u00d7\u2009288). Resting state functional connectivity MRI data were collected for 10\u2009min using a single-shot GRE planar imaging sequence to acquire 164 T2-weighted blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) images (TR\u2009=\u20093660\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u200939\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200990 degrees, FOV\u2009=\u2009240 x 240\u2009mm, voxel size\u2009=\u20092.6 x 2.6 x 4\u2009mm, 36 axial slices, matrix\u2009=\u200994 x 94). Participants were instructed to keep their eyes open and to not think about anything in particular during the resting state scan.\n\nMRI: Pre-processing\nStructural and functional images were preprocessed in the CONN functional connectivity toolbox (17.f)\n28\nusing the default volume-based pre-processing pipeline. Functional images underwent realignment and unwarping for motion correction, slice-timing correction, registration and normalization to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) 152 space, outlier detection, band-pass filtration between 0.008 and 0.09\u2009Hz, and spatial smoothing using an 8\u2009mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. Additionally, structural images underwent realignment; segmentation of gray matter (GM), white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid; bias correction; and normalization to MNI space.\n\nMRI: Assessing longitudinal changes\nA flexible factorial model was established to assess functional and morphological brain changes throughout the study, including crossover periods on and off GH replacement (\nFig. 3\n). Subjects were grouped based on the order in which they received treatment into GH-first or placebo-first groups for analysis. The modeled contrast timeline was based on our clinical experience of adult patients receiving GH administration. In our experience, patients typically experience modest symptom reduction after \u223c3 months of treatment, with more pronounced symptom reduction following 6 months to 1 year of treatment. After discontinuing GH treatment, patients tend to exhibit a gradual return of symptoms over \u223c3 months. The weighted contrasts tested fit to a model of brain changes while on GH and return to baseline while on placebo. The GH-first and placebo-first group-weighted models were defined for each time point as (\nsee study design\nand\nFig. 2\nfor timing) -1.25, 0.75, -1.25, 1.75 and -1.05, -1.05, 0.1, 2, respectively to test for longitudinal increases in brain morphology or connectivity with GH treatment (\nFig. 3\n). The inverse of those model weights (1.25, -0.75, 1.25, -1.75 and 1.05, 1.05, -0.1, -2 respectively) were used to assess longitudinal decreases in morphology or connectivity with GH treatment.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 3.\nThis placebo-controlled crossover designed study assessed the effects of growth hormone (GH) replacement on mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. Weighted contrast models were used to test fit to a model of changes in brain connectivity and morphometry while subjects were on GH, with no change or reversal of GH-induced changes while on placebo. Separately weighted contrasts were created to test for increased (+) or decreased (\u2212) cortical thickness, gray matter volume, or functional connectivity with GH replacement in both the GH-first and placebo-first groups.\n\nMRI: Functional connectivity\nUsing SPM12 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, London, UK) we implemented the flexible factorial model described previously to conduct a hypothesis-free intrinsic connectivity (IC) analysis to assess voxelwise whole-brain changes in connectivity over the course of the study. First-level voxel to voxel beta files were calculated for each subject at each time point with interacting factors of group assignment and session. In addition, 10\na priori\nselected regions of interest (ROI) were chosen for similar analysis based on the current literature as regions associated with altered connectivity following TBI or associated with fatigue (\nTable S1\n). The selected ROIs include: the posterior cingulate cortex as a region representing the default mode network,\n29\n,\n30\nthe right frontal eye field as a region representing the dorsal attention network (as contrast to default mode network), left and right thalamus,\n14\n,\n15\nthe left post-central gyrus as somatosensory cortex,\n14\nthe left pre-central gyrus as primary motor cortex,\n14\nthe right cerebellar lobules IV/V (lobules IV and V were unified in pre-processing using CONN) and lobule VIII,\n31\nthe left nucleus accumbens as a region linked to motivation and fatigue,\n32\n,\n33\nand the left supplementary motor area (SMA).\n34\nFirst-level voxelwise seed ROI-specific beta files were calculated for each subject at each time point with interacting factors of group assignment and session for each ROI. Significantly altered connectivity was determined by peak-level familywise error corrected\np\nFWE\n< 0.05; clusters \u22658 contiguous voxels are reported.\n\nMRI: Correlations with altered connectivity\nAn exploratory analysis was conducted to identify potential associations between physical and behavioral measures of interest (MOI) and changes in brain connectivity and morphology. Five MOIs were selected\na posteriori\nthat were both significantly altered over the course of the study and deemed by the research team as being the most relevant unique measures. The five selected MOIs for correlation analysis included MFSI total score, PSQI, Beck Depression Inventory score, lean mass, and 50% effort modified walk distance. Pre- and post-treatment measures of MFSI and PSQI were complete for 10 subjects. Pre- and post-treatment measures of 50% effort modified walk and Beck Depression Inventory were available for 17 subjects. Change in lean mass was available for 18 subjects.\nWe tested for potential correlations between regional changes in connectivity and changes in MOIs from baseline to 12 months. The change in connectivity from baseline to post-study was plotted by generating a delta image (post-study beta image minus baseline beta image) using the SPM IMcalc function for whole-brain IC analysis and separately for the 10 pre-selected ROIs. The resulting delta images were used to examine correlations between regional changes in connectivity and changes in MOIs. Correlations were evaluated with SPM using single-sample\nt\ntests of delta connectivity with the change in score for each MOI as a covariate. Separate contrasts were used to determine negative and positive correlations. For this exploratory analysis, the threshold for significance was set as a peak voxel uncorrected\np\n<\u20090.00001; clusters >8 voxels are reported. Plots were generated to assess the correlative relationship between changes in connectivity and changes in MOIs. For clusters with significant correlations, the change in connectivity (post-study beta value \u2013 pre-study beta value) at the peak coordinates were recorded and plotted against the change in MOI.\n\nMRI: Brain morphometry\nVoxel-based morphometry was used to assess changes in regional brain volumes and to estimate changes in cortical thickness using the SPM CAT12 toolbox\n35\nrunning on Matlab. Structural images were pre-processed using the CAT12 processing pipeline for segmenting longitudinal data. These protocols compensate for non-linear registration by performing intra-subject realignment, bias correction, segmentation, and normalization. Within this protocol, individual images were Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra (DARTEL) registered to MNI space and intra-subject mean segmented images were generated to apply intra-subject deformations for assessing volume changes. During pre-processing, additional cortical thickness (CT) estimation was performed for later CT analysis and total intracranial volume was estimated for each subject as a nuisance covariate for GM analysis.\n\nMRI: GM volume\nThe change in GM volume from baseline to post-study was assessed using the previously described flexible factorial model. Modulated GM volumes were smoothed with a spherical FWHM Gaussian smoothing kernel of 8\u2009mm using CAT12 and assigned for flexible factorial analysis with interacting factors of group assignment and session. Total intracranial volume was assigned as a nuisance covariate to remove the confounding factor of total brain size. Significant changes in GM volume were determined using peak-level\np\nFWE\n< 0.05; clusters \u22658 voxels are reported.\n\nMRI: Correlations with altered GM volume\nAn exploratory analysis was conducted to assess correlations between changes in GM volume and changes in selected MOIs from baseline to post-study. Delta images were generated for each subject using the extracted GM volumes from morphometry analysis (post-study GM map minus baseline GM map) using the SPM IMcalc function. Correlations were assessed with SPM using single-sample\nt\ntests of delta GM volume, with the change in score for each MOI as a covariate. Separate contrasts were used to determine negative and positive correlations. Using small volume correction, an additional focused correlative analysis was applied for the four\na posteriori\nregions shown by the longitudinal flexible factorial analysis to have significant change in GM volume (\nTable S4\n). These regions were explored using a 10\u2009mm sphere centered on the peak of each of the four significant clusters. Separate contrasts were used to determine negative and positive correlations. For this exploratory analysis, the threshold for significance was set as a peak uncorrected\np\n<\u20090.00001; clusters >8 voxels are reported. Plots were generated to assess the correlative relationship between changes in GM volume and changes in MOIs. For clusters with significant correlations, the change in GM volume (post-study value \u2013 pre-study value) at the peak cluster coordinates were recorded and plotted against the change in MOI.\n\nMRI: Cortical thickness\nDuring initial CAT12 voxel-based morphometry longitudinal segmentation, surface and thickness estimation were performed using projection-based thickness for cortical thickness estimation\n36\nfor left and right hemispheres. Cortical thickness estimates were resampled to a 32 k mesh and smoothed with a 15\u2009mm filter size. Changes in regional cortical thickness throughout the study were assessed using CAT12 with the previously described flexible factorial model using merged left and right hemisphere cortical thickness estimates for each subject. The model was then estimated using CAT12 surface model estimation. Significant change in cortical thickness was determined using peak-level\np\nFWE\n< 0.05; clusters \u22658 voxels are reported.\n\nMRI: Correlations with altered cortical thickness\nThe correlation between changes in cortical thickness and selected MOIs from baseline to post-study were examined using CAT12. Pre- and post-study smoothed cortical thickness images were assessed using a paired\nt\ntest with selected measures of interest from each time point as a covariate. For this exploratory analysis, the threshold for significance was set as a peak uncorrected\np\n<\u20090.00001; clusters with >8 voxels are reported."

    "Methods": "Patient population\nAll patients from the multi-center CENTER-TBI high-resolution intensive care unit (ICU) monitoring cohort with parenchymal ICP monitoring were included in this analysis. Patients with external ventricular drain\u2013based ICP data were excluded given the interrupted nature of their recordings (i.e., reliable ICP can be recorded only when the drainage is closed). These patients were prospectively recruited between January 2015 and December 2017 from 21 centers in the European Union (EU). All patients were admitted to the ICU for their TBI during the course of the study, with high-frequency digital signals recorded from their ICU monitors during the course of their ICU stay. All patients suffered predominantly from moderate-to-severe TBI (moderate\u2009=\u2009Glasgow Coma Score [GCS] 9\u201312; severe\u2009=\u2009GCS of \u22648). A minority of patients (\nn\n=\u200931) were categorized at the time of admission as suffering from less-severe TBI, but experienced subsequent early deterioration leading to ICU admission for care and monitoring. All patients in this cohort had invasive ICP monitoring conducted in accord with the BTF guidelines.\n4\n\nEthics\nData used in these analyses were collected as part of the CENTER-TBI study, which had individual national or local regulatory approval; the UK Ethics approval is provided as an exemplar: (IRAS No: 150943; REC 14/SC/1370). The CENTER-TBI study (EC grant 602150) has been conducted in accord with all relevant laws of the EU, if directly applicable or of direct effect, and all relevant laws of the country where the Recruiting sites were located, including, but not limited to, the relevant privacy and data protection laws and regulations (the \u201cPrivacy Law\u201d), the relevant laws and regulations on the use of human materials, and all relevant guidance relating to clinical studies from time to time in force, including, but not limited to, the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (CPMP/ICH/135/95; \u201cICH GCP\u201d) and the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki entitled \u201cEthical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects.\u201d Informed consent by the patients and/or the legal representative/next of kin was obtained, accordingly to the local legislations, for all patients recruited in the Core Dataset of CENTER-TBI and documented in the e-CRF.\n\nData collection\nAs part of recruitment to the multi-center high-resolution ICU cohort of CENTER-TBI, all patients had demographics, injury, and imaging data prospectively recorded. Similarly, all patients had high-frequency digital signals from ICU monitoring recorded throughout their ICU stay, with the goal of initiating recording within 24\u2009h of ICU admission. All digital ICU signals were further processed (see Signal Acquisition/Signal Processing). For the purpose of this study, the IMPACT Core and CT variables were extracted from the central study database. They included: age, admission best GCS motor score, and pupillary reactivity (bilaterally reactive, unilateral reactive, bilateral unreactive), Marshall CT classification,\n15\npresence of traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (yes, no), presence of an extradural hematoma (yes, no), presence of pre-hospital hypotension (yes, no), and the presence of pre-hospital hypoxia (yes, no). Patient outcomes were assessed at 6 months using the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale\u2013Extended (GOSE). Outcome assessors in TBI and the researchers involved in analysis of high-resolution data were blinded to each other's work. Finally, we used version 2.0 of the CENTER-TBI data set, where missing GOSE measures at 6 months were imputed. As such, CENTER-TBI data version 2.0 was accessed for the purpose of this study, by Opal database software.\n16\n\nSignal acquisition\nArterial blood pressure (ABP) was obtained through either radial or femoral arterial lines connected to pressure transducers. ICP was acquired from an intraparenchymal strain gauge probe (Codman ICP MicroSensor; Codman & Shurtleff Inc., Raynham, MA), parenchymal fibre optic pressure sensor (Camino ICP Monitor; Integra Life Sciences, Plainsboro, NJ;\nhttps://www.integralife.com/\n). All signals were recorded using digital data transfer or digitized by an analog-to-digital converter (DT9803; Data Translation, Marlboro, MA), where appropriate; sampled at frequency of 100\u2009Hz or higher, using the ICM+ software (Cambridge Enterprise Ltd, Cambridge, UK;\nhttp://icmplus.neurosurg.cam.ac.uk\n) or Moberg CNS Monitor (Moberg Research Inc, Ambler, PA;\nhttps://www.moberg.com\n) or a combination of both. Signal artefacts were removed using both manual and automated methods before further processing or analysis.\n\nSignal processing\nPost-acquisition processing of the above signals was conducted using ICM+ (Cambridge Enterprise Ltd;\nhttp://icmplus.neurosurg.cam.ac.uk\n). Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) was determined as mean arterial pressure (MAP) \u2013 ICP. Ten-second moving averages (updated every 10\u2009sec to avoid data overlap) were calculated for all recorded signals: ICP, ABP (which produced MAP), pulse amplitude of ICP, and CPP. PRx was calculated as the moving correlation coefficient between 30 consecutive 10-sec mean windows of ICP and MAP, updated every minute.\nData were downsampled to minute-by-minute resolution for the entire duration of recording for each patient. Grand mean values of all physiological variables were calculated per patient. In addition, the following post-processing of this physiological data occurred in R (R Core Team [2018]; R: A language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria;\nhttps://www.R-project.org/\n):\n1.\nICP: For each patient, the % of time spent above ICP of 20\u2009mm Hg and 22\u2009mm Hg were calculated for the entire recording period.\n4\n,\n11\n2.\nPRx: For each patient, the % of time spent above the following clinically defined thresholds were calculated across the entire recording period: 0, +0.25, and +0.35.\n11\n,\n17\nAll of these thresholds for PRx have been defined in previous published literature as statistically significant for association with 6-month global outcome in adult TBI patients.\nData were provided in summary sheets for the patient cohort using data from: 1) entire recording and 2) the first 72\u2009h of recording. These two sheets were produced to assess whether there was any difference in outcome association when focusing on more acute physiology, such as that observed during the first 72\u2009h post-injury.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analysis was conducted using R and XLSTAT (Addinsoft, New York, NY;\nhttps://www.xlstat.com/en/\n) add-on package to Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Office 15, Version 16.0.7369.1323; Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). The following analysis was conducted for both the entire recording period and the first 72\u2009h of recording, with similar results. As such, only the entire recording period will be reported in detail, with intermittent reference made to the results from the first 72\u2009h of recording.\nNormality of continuous variables was assessed by the Shapiro-Wilks test, where all variables displayed non-parametric characteristics and are hence displayed as median (range) or median (interquartile range; IQR). For all testing described, the alpha was set at 0.05 for significance. GOSE was then dichotomized into the following categories: 1) alive (GOSE 2\u20138) versus dead (GOSE 1) and 2) favorable (GOSE 5\u20138) versus unfavorable (GOSE \u22644). IMPACT Core and CT variables, along with physiological variables, were compared between each dichotomized group, using the Mann-Whitney U test or chi-square testing, where appropriate.\nUnivariate logistic regression (ULR) was first conducted, comparing each IMPACT model variable, and the continuous physiologic variables to the dichotomized outcomes. AUC, 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and\np\nvalues for the univariate models are reported.\nNext, IMPACT Core/Core + CT multi-variable models were created. Using multi-variable logistic regression (MLR) analysis, these models and their association with dichotomized GOSE were assessed. AUC, 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and\np\nvalues were reported for each model. Finally, the % time spent above threshold for ICP and PRx were sequentially added to the IMPACT Core/Core + CT models. Similar to the IMPACT Core/Core + CT baseline models, AUC,\np\nvalues, and model Akaike information criteria (AIC) were reported for each dichotomized outcome, with highest AUC, lowest AIC indicating model superiority. Additional accounted variance in association with outcome over the IMPACT Core/Core + CT models was assessed using the relative difference in Nagelkerke's pseudo-R\n2\n(termed delta pseudo-R\n2\n). All AUCs and 95% CIs for both ULR and MLR were determined using bootstrapping techniques with 2000 iterations."

    "Methods": "Traumatic brain injury measurements and brain tissue deformation estimations\nWe deployed the Stanford Instrumented Mouthguard (MiG2.0) to 5 professional MMA fighters during regular matches (\nn\n=\u20095 subjects, six fights). The human subject protocol was approved by the Stanford, Trinity College and Institute of Technology Tallaght Panel for the Protection of Human Subjects. We conducted data collection in accord with the institutional review boards' guidelines and regulations. Both video analysis and instrumented mouthguard data were used to validate each impact.\nThe MiG2.0 senses 6 degrees of freedom (6DOF) kinematics by a triaxial accelerometer and a triaxial gyroscope. The sensory board is completely sealed between three layers of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) material, and communication occurs by blue-tooth. A tight fit to the dentition is achieved by forming the EVA material around a dental model.\n19\nIn this study, we recorded events with linear acceleration exceeding 10\u2009g in agreement with previously published systems.\n20\nThe acquisition window was 50\u2009ms pre-trigger and 150\u2009ms post-trigger. Linear acceleration and angular velocity were filtered using a fourth-order Butterworth low-pass filter with cut-off frequency of 300\u2009Hz. Angular acceleration was estimated using a 5-point stencil derivative of the measured angular velocity. The instrumented mouthguard is well validated in football applications.\n19\n,\n20\nTo validate it in MMA applications, we reproduced a similar loading (peak of \u223c150\u2009g and duration of \u223c5\u2009ms) on a hybrid III dummy head in the lab, and the kinematics measured matched well with the sensors at center of gravity of the head. The mouthguard will give high linear and angular acceleration when the sensors are directly impacted or the mouthguard is not rigidly fit to the teeth.\nEstimates of brain tissue deformation for all TBIs were obtained from simulations using the KTH finite element (FE) model (KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden).\n21\n,\n22\nThis model includes the brain, skull, scalp, meninges, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and 11 pairs of bridging veins. Skull acceleration measured from the MiG2.0 was prescribed to follow the measured 6DOF head accelerations, and ensuing brain deformation was observed. The brain was modeled as an Ogden hyperelastic constitutive material to account for large deformations of the tissue, with additional linear viscoelastic terms to account for the rate dependence of the tissue. The boundary condition between the dura and skull was tied. Between the brain and dura, a sliding interface was implemented that allowed tangential, and not radial, movement between the structures (given the incompressibility of the mostly water CSF). The determined brain geometry and material properties were validated against displacement data from cadaver TBI experiments where neutral density targets were inserted inside cadaver brains and tracked using high-speed biplane X-ray during impacts.\n23\n,\n24\nTo locally compare brain deformation to BBB disruption from dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI images, we implemented a protocol involving FE mesh voxelization and an affine registration between the DCE brain mask and the voxelized FE brain mask. First, the FE brain mesh was voxelized to obtain a reference volume (MATLAB R2018a; The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA); subsequently, a spatial transformation was used to align the DCE-MRI brain to the model. The volume resampling was performed with the three-dimensional (3D) SLICER 4.10.0 BRAIN registration package. Based on spatial coordinates, the mechanical deformation was assigned to the DCE-MRI voxels belonging to the corresponding element, and the mask of BBB disruption was selected using the threshold of slope reported in previous study.\n37\nOnly the voxels with BBB disruption were considered in the linear regression.\nThe mechanical fields of the 1st principal strain (\n\u03b5\n), the 1st principal strain rate (\n\u03b5\n\u02d9\n), the 1st principal stress (\n\u03c3\n) and the energy absorption (\n\u03c9\n) are based on 5 variables (time, impact, 3-dimensional space in the brain). Different methods were used to calculate parameters to represent the severity of brain deformation during the game. As examples of\n\u03b5\nshown in\nEqs. 1\n\u20136, the peak (superscript P) and the integration (superscript I) over history (\nt\n) of\n\u03b5\n(\nt, im, x, y, z\n) were calculated for every voxel in the brain for each impact. Then, to take into account the effect of the multiple impacts, the maximum values over all impacts (\nim\n) were calculated by\nEq.7\nfor every voxel in the brain to plot the maps in\nFig. 1e\n(only the mask of BBB disruption is plotted). For the linear regression, statistical parameters are calculated as Total (subscript \u03a3), Average (subscript A) and 95% (subscript 95) over the voxels (\nx, y, z\n) in the mask of BBB disruption in the brain (above the threshold). The following equations describe the calculation for the 1\nst\nprincipal strain scalar parameters; the strain rate, principal stress, and energy absorbed are calculated using the same methods.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\n(\nA1\u2013A6\n) Peak linear acceleration magnitude of the head measured by Stanford instrumented mouthguards (MiG 2.0) in professional mixed martial arts (MMA) fights 1\u20136 (\nn\n=\u20095 individual fighters).

For each impact, at each voxel in the FEM model, we calculated the Integration (I) and Peak (P) of the mechanical parameters over time. Then, we took the maximum of these values over all recorded impacts for a given match. Lastly, over all 3-dimensional space, we computed the Total (), Average (A), 95% (95) over the mask of BBB disruption (the voxels where the slope is higher than the reported threshold [37] are selected) to represent the impact exposure as a single scalar value. The equations are given in\nMethods\nsection (Eqs.\n1\n\u2013\n6\n). In DCE-MRI images, the average slope and volume fraction in the mask of BBB disruption were used to represent BBB disruption. For example, 0.81 is the R\n2\nbetween and the average slope, and the linear regression is plotted in Fig.1J.

Initially, 22 participants were recruited pre-season for the schoolboy study; however, only 11 returned for post-season evaluation. All participants underwent a pre-season scan before the start of the competitive rugby season and underwent a post-season scan within 2 months of the end of the season in the case of the schoolboy team (\nn\n=\u200911). In addition, the university-based team participants (initially\nn\n=\u200910 recruited, but only\nn\n=\u20098 were scanned post-match) underwent a scan within 2\u2009h of playing a full contact competitive rugby match. BBB permeability maps were created using the slope of contrast agent concentration in each voxel over time, calculated by a linear fit model as previously described. Thresholds of high permeability was defined by the 95th percentile of all slopes in a previously examined control group.\n25\nSuprathreshold values of individuals were then normalized to pre-season values to determine relative change over the course of play. MMA fighters were scanned pre-fight and again within 120\u2009h post\u2013competitive fight using identical parameters as that used in the university-based rugby players.\nAll imaging was performed using a 3T Philips Achieva scanner (Philips, Best, The Netherlands) and included a T1-weighted (T1w) anatomical scan (3D gradient echo, echo time [TE]/repetition time [TR]\u2009=\u20093/6.7\u2009ms, acquisition matrix 268\u2009\u00d7\u2009244, voxel size: 0.9\u2009\u00d7\u20090.9\u2009\u00d7\u20090.9\u2009mm), T2-weighted (T2w) imaging (TE/TR\u2009=\u200980/3000\u2009ms, voxel size: 0.45 x 0.45 x 0.4\u2009mm), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR; TE/TR\u2009=\u2009125/11000\u2009ms, voxel size: 0.45\u2009\u00d7\u20090.45\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u2009mm).\nIn the first cohort, the calculation of pre-contrast longitudinal relaxation time (T\n10\n), the variable flip angle (VFA) method was used (3D T1w-FFE [fast field echo], TE/TR\u2009=\u20092.78/5.67\u2009ms, acquisition matrix: 240\u2009\u00d7\u2009184, voxel size: 0.68\u2009\u00d7\u20090.68\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009mm, flip angles: 2, 10, 16, and 24 degrees). DCE sequence was then acquired (axial, 3D T1w-FFE, TE/TR\u2009=\u20092.8/5.7\u2009ms, acquisition matrix: 240\u2009\u00d7\u2009123, voxel size: 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091.3\u2009\u00d7\u20095.0\u2009mm, flip angle: 6 degrees, \u0394t\u2009=\u20096.4\u2009sec, temporal repetitions: 70, total scan length: 7.43\u2009min). An intravenous bolus injection of the contrast agent, gadobentate dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA; Bracco Diagnostics Inc., Milan, Italy), was administered using an automatical injector after the first three DCE repetitions.\nFor the second, older cohort, T1w, T2w, and FLAIR imaging parameters were kept the same. For the calculation of pre-contrast longitudinal relaxation time (T\n10\n), the VFA method was used (3D T1w-FFE, TE/TR\u2009=\u20093.1/6.5\u2009ms, acquisition matrix: 268\u2009\u00d7\u2009244, voxel size: 0.896\u2009\u00d7\u20090.896\u2009\u00d7\u20090.96\u2009mm, flip angles: 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees). DCE sequence was then acquired (axial, 3D T1w-FFE, TE/TR\u2009=\u20091.8/5.0\u2009ms, acquisition matrix: 208\u2009\u00d7\u2009144, voxel size: 1.06\u2009\u00d7\u20091.17\u2009\u00d7\u20096.0\u2009mm, flip angle: 20 degrees, \u0394t\u2009=\u200920.2\u2009sec, temporal repetitions: 61, total scan length: 20.30\u2009min). Intravenous bolus injection of the contrast agent, Gd-BOPTA, was administered using an automatic injector after the first five DCE repetitions.\nTo obtain permeability values in healthy individuals, we (co-author, Prof. Alon Friedman's group) first scanned a cohort of 27 non-contact-sport athletes (\nn\n=\u200927 males; range, 18\u201336 years; median, 28). Each registered brain voxel was assigned a value corresponding to a\nnormalized permeability\n. Based on a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of normalized permeability values, we defined an upper limit for \u201cnormal\u201d permeability as the 95th percentile of the mean CDF. Brain voxels with higher values were considered as having \u201c\nabnormally high permeability\n.\u201d An additional control group (healthy, non-athlete controls) recruited at a later stage (\nn\n=\u200926; range, 18\u201340 years; median, 30) as a test group. No differences in permeability maps were found between the two separate control groups.\nChanges in DCE scan length were made given that the shorter scan time can sometimes inflate the laser Doppler microphone signal, because the length of time allowed for the contrast signal to decay following bolus injection until scan completion is less. To align scans with a previous study,\n20\na longer scan time was utilized in the university rugby cohort and the MMA cohort. The values measured were normalized to an internal region of interest, and therefore relative values are used to generate % voxels. Also, there was no significant difference between the values generated using the shortened scan time and the longer scan time.\n\nHuman plasma analyses\nImmediately before undergoing an MRI scan, 16\u2009mL of whole blood was withdrawn in K\n2\nethylenedimainetetraacetic acid\u2013coated tubes. Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) fractions were separated by density fractionation. Briefly, whole-blood samples were diluted 1:1 with phosphate-buffered saline before being layered on to 10\u2009mL of Lymphoprep (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). Samples were centrifuged at 400\ng\nfor 45\u2009min with 0 acceleration and deceleration to separate blood into plasma and PBMC fractions and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use.\nPlasma brain-derived neurotropic factor BDNF, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1/chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (MCP1/CCL2), and S100 calcium binding protein B (S100B) levels were measured using the Xmap (Luminex) method (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), per the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, the Luminex platform (consisting of the following analytes: BDNF, MCP-1/CCL2, S100B, interleukin [IL]-6, IL-18, IL-1beta, IL-33, IL-17A, IL-12 p70, IL-23, transforming growth factor-alpha, T-Tau, interferon-gamma, and glial fibrillary acidic protein) involved incubating diluted plasma samples (50\u2009\u03bcL) in a 96-well plate containing antibody-coated magnetic beads for 2\u2009h at room temperature with gentle orbital agitation. After incubation, the beads were washed with the provided wash buffer and signal developed using the provided biotin antibody cocktail and streptavidin-peroxidase. Signal was determined using a Luminex 200 plate reader. Importantly, only levels of BDNF, MCP-1/CCL2, and S100B could be detected at sufficiently high levels and were subsequently chosen to confirm levels of expression using ELISA analysis.\nFor samples analysed using ELISA, plasma samples were incubated in individual 96-well plates coated with capture antibodies to human BDNF, MCP-1/CCL2, and S100B for 2\u2009h at room temperature with gentle horizontal agitation. After incubation, plates were washed with the wash buffer and signal developed using the provided biotin-labeled antibody and streptavidin-peroxidase. Signal was determined using an ELISA plate reader. Levels of BDNF, MCP-1/CCL2, and S100B were calculated by a standard curve for each analyte. In two samples collected, hemolysis was present during collection and these were excluded from analysis.\n\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical analysis was performed using Student's\nt\n-test, with significance represented by a\np\nvalue of \u22640.05. For multiple comparisons, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used with a Tukey-Kramer post-test and significance represented by a\np\nvalue of \u22640.05. ANOVA, followed by a Bonferroni post-test, was used for multiple comparisons with\np\n\u2264\u20090.05 representing significance. G*Power was used\na priori\nto calculate an appropriate sample size to ensure adequate power for experiments. For biomechanical regression with DCE-MRI results, multiple comparisons were made to look for correlations. Therefore, statistical significance is not considered in this analysis."

    "Methods": "Experimental design\nAll animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals and were approved by the University of Florida, the Malcom Randall Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC), and the Robley Rex VAMC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Three groups of purpose-bred, female, adult, specific-pathogen free cats were used in this study: normal controls (\nn\n=\u20099), acute thoracic hemisections (\nn\n=\u20097), and chronic thoracic hemisections (\nn\n=\u20096). Bilateral tracer injections were performed at T11 and animals survived for 13 days following injections. In the acute injury group, tracer injections were made at the time of injury. For the chronic injury group, injections were made 16 weeks post-injury. Cats received daily exercise on weekdays by walking on a treadmill and/or a variety of runways pre-injury and, for the chronic injury group, resumed exercise beginning 1-2 weeks post-injury.\n\nSurgical procedures\nAll spinal hemisection procedures were performed as previously described.\n53\n,\n54\nIn summary, animals received 0.1 cc of both atropine sulfate (0.04-0.06\u2009mg/kg) and acetylpromazine (0.4-0.5\u2009mg/kg) subcutaneously (SQ). Next, they were anesthetized with a combination of isoflurane (2-5%) and oxygen (1-2 LO\n2\n) and then intubated and maintained at a surgical plane of anesthesia (no peripheral reflexes) throughout the procedure. Bilateral laminectomies were performed to expose the spinal cord followed by a left lateral hemisection made at spinal T9 with iridectomy scissors. Any fibers adhering to the ventral or lateral dura were gently lifted with suction and cut. The dura was sutured, then durafilm (Codman-Shurtleff, Inc., Randolf, MA) and gelfoam (Pharmacia and Upjohn, Inc., Peapack, NJ) were placed over the sutures. Muscle and skin were closed in layers. Throughout the duration of the surgical procedure temperature, electrocardiography, respiratory rate, and expired CO\n2\nwere monitored and maintained within normal physiological limits. Cats recovered in temperature-controlled incubators and buprenorphine (0.01\u2009mg/kg, SQ) was delivered after injury (on the surgical table during incision closure), as well as every 6-12\u2009h for the next 48\u2009h. Cats were housed singly or in pairs on thick beds of shredded newspaper or egg-crate foam. Bladders were emptied using the Cred\u00e9 maneuver for several days after surgery and the cats\u2019 health closely monitored throughout the study.\nFluoro-Gold (FG, 0.5% in sterile water, Fluorochrome, LLC, Denver, CO) was used to examine PSN and rubrospinal tract (RST) neurons with terminations caudal to the injury. Fluoro-Gold robustly labels the cell bodies of descending axons and using immunohistochemistry, provides a permanent marker, which facilitates cell counts.\n54-56\nAs above, animals received 0.1 cc of both atropine sulfate (0.04-0.06\u2009mg/kg) and acetylpromazine (0.4-0.5\u2009mg/kg, SQ), were intubated, and maintained at a surgical plane of anesthesia with a mixture of isoflurane and oxygen. All cats received bilateral laminectomies at the injection site. Injections were performed using a 33-gauge Hamilton syringe (Hamilton Company, Reno, NV), held in a stereotaxic device, at spinal T11 (normals) or 13-14\u2009mm (\u223cT11) below the lesion at the time of injury (acute) or 16 weeks post-injury (chronic). Four needle tracks were made (\nFig. 1A\n,\n\u200b\n,1B).\n1B\n). Within each track 0.25\u2009\u03bcl was injected ventrally, the needle partially retracted, and \u223c3\u2009min later 0.25\u2009\u03bcl injected dorsally. A total of 2\u2009\u03bcl (eight injections) were distributed across the spinal cord. In order to determine normal ipsilateral versus contralateral projections of these neuronal populations, four of the nine normal cats received injections of FG on the left side of the spinal cord (four injections, totaling 1\u2009\u03bcl). Following these procedures, Buprenorphine was given, bladders emptied and cats' health closely monitored as described above following hemisection.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSpinal injection site and retrograde labeling. A three-dimensional rendering of a typical injection site shows the areal extent of tracer spread and four injection locations from a dorsal view (*;\nA\n). Most cats showed tracer coverage throughout the cross-sectional extent of the spinal cord with the exception of varying degrees of labeling in the dorsal columns as shown in this example (\nB\n; dorsal orientation is up). This composite image (B1) is simplified to a single coronal slice (B2) showing that tracer is present across the entire spinal cord cross-section (black) with the exception of an area in the right dorsal column (white). Propriospinal neurons\n(C)\nand red nuclei neurons\n(D)\nwere counted only if Fluoro-Gold was seen in the somas (scale bars\u2009=\u2009100\u2009\u03bcm). The inset in C is a higher magnification (scale bar\u2009=\u200920\u2009\u03bcm) of a labeled neuron identified by the arrow (white) at lower magnification. CC, central canal.\n\nImmunohistochemistry and neuron counts\nAll cats were transcardially perfused with saline (0.9%), followed by 4% buffered paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4) at 13 days post-injections. Spinal cords and brains were removed and blocked into segments. Three spinal segments, C5, T6, and T8, along with the red nuclei and lesion site (T9), were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4) and sectioned on a cryostat (25\u2009\u03bcm). Every 40th section (1000\u2009\u03bcm) through each spinal segment and every 8th section (200\u2009\u03bcm) through the red nuclei was processed for Fluoro-Gold immunoreactivity. The distance between sections assured that neurons would not be double counted (present in two sections) and allowed representative counts of the entire T6 and T8 spinal segments and red nuclei. The greater distance between spinal sections was chosen based upon the relatively long lengths of the spinal segments. Immunohistochemistry was performed using a rabbit anti-FG (1:10,000 for midbrain sections and 1:40,000 for spinal cord sections; Fluorochrome, LLC, Denver, CO) followed by an anti-rabbit goat secondary antibody (1:200, Vector labs) and the ABC Vectastain kit (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA).\nSections were then incubated in 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO) to visualize neurons containing FG. FG positive neurons, defined by punctate labeling, were counted using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope keeping left and right side counts separate (\nFig. 1C\n,\n\u200b\n,1D).\n1D\n). Neurons were counted by visual inspection over the entirety of each cross-section assessed. All injection sites and lesions were sectioned (25\u2009\u03bcm). Fluoro-Gold spread was assessed by auto-fluorescence in every 10th section (250\u2009\u03bcm) to verify that tracer had covered the cross-sectional extent of T11, but had not spread into the lesion site. Cats were excluded from this study if FG spread was identified in the lesion site. Cats also were excluded from specific neuronal subpopulation counts if tracer spread was absent or weak in areas associated with axons of interest\u2014for example, the dorsal lateral funiculus for the rubrospinal tract\n57-59\nand populations of dorsal PSNs functionally contiguous with the mesencephalic locomotor region and referred to as the stepping strip.\n60-62\nThe first section out of every 10 throughout the lesion segment was mounted onto a subbed slide and processed with cresyl violet (cresyl violet with acetate, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and myelin (Eriochrome Cyanine R, Fluka, NY) stains to view basic lesion morphology and verify each hemisection. The extent of each hemisection was determined by first screening through the stained sections to identify the section best representing the lesion epicenter. This section, together with rostral and caudal sections, spanning 2000\u2009\u03bcm across the epicenter were used to generate a pictorial representation of tissue damage on a template of a coronal section of spinal cord for each animal (\nFig. 2\n).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nCross-sectional representations of lesions. Tissue sparing and loss can be readily identified using cresyl violet and myelin stained sections.

Using a drawing of the normal cord as a template, the extent of tissue loss and sparing for each acute\n(C-I)\nand chronic\n(J-O)\ninjury was determined for each animal in the study. The representative drawing composite for the histological cross-section shown (B) lies directly below it (E) and shows the modest sparing of the medial part of the ipsilesional dorsal columns. Although there is some variation at the ventral and dorsal midlines across animals, only one lesion (J) showed notable contralesional damage. This animal was included as the damage did not appear to extend into the area of the rubrospinal tract.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were completed using SPSS (IBM, Armonk, NY). Non-parametric Mann-Whitney U tests were performed to compare the number of neurons between time-points. In all cases a two-tailed (bi-directional) hypothesis was used. Non-parametric Spearman correlational analyses were performed to determine any potential relationships between tracer spread within the dorsal columns and number of labeled neurons. Significance level was set at\np\n\u2264\u20090.05 for all statistical tests."

    "Methods": "Finite element head model\nThe head model\n48\nwas developed from an averaged magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) head template, obtained from the database established by Fillmore and colleagues.\n49\nThe high-resolution T1- and T2-weighted images were segmented using the Freesurfer software.\n50\nThe segmentation was subsequently processed by the 3D SLICER software\n51\nto obtain the surfaces of the skull, brain, and cerebral ventricles, all of which serve as input to the Hexotic software, generating all hexahedron elements based on an octree algorithm.\n52\nThe head model included the skull, subarachnoid CSF (i.e., CSF within the subarachnoid space), brain, and cerebral ventricles (i.e., lateral ventricles and third ventricle) (\nFig. 1\n, upper row). This mesh generation process in combination with an appropriate mesh resolution allows preservation of morphological features of the brain (\nFig. 1B\n) and cerebral ventricles (\nFig. 1C\n). The volume ratio between the cerebral ventricles and brain was 1.9%, approximating the ratio range (1\u20134%) in adults.\n53\nAn in-house algorithm was developed to further classify the brain elements into different components based on the segmentation. The anatomically grouped brain included gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) (\nFig. 1D\n), corpus callosum, cerebellum, thalamus, hippocampus, and basal ganglia (\nFig. 1E\n). The falx and tentorium, which are invisible in the images, were manually created as shell elements based on the classification of brain tissue and anatomical illustrations. The pia mater was generated by finding the faces of brain elements. The resultant mesh of the model consisted of a total of 4.2 million hexahedral elements and 0.5 million quadrilateral elements. The parameters on the mesh quality are summarized in\nAppendix 1\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nIsometric views of the FE model of human head.\n(A)\nHead model with the brain exposed.\n(B)\nBrain model.\n(C)\nModel of the cerebral ventricles.\n(D)\nHead model with the GM and WM visible.\n(E)\nDeep brain structures illustrated with the falx, cerebellum, and dura mater in translucency.

The skull was modeled as rigid without separating the cortical bone from diploe bone.\n47\nAlthough brain tissue was recognized as inhomogeneous and anisotropic, a thorough mechanical characterization was lacking. Thus, the brain was assumed to be a homogenous and isotropic structure with its material properties described by a second-order Ogden-based hyperelastic constitutive model.\n43\nThe subarachnoid CSF was modeled as an elastic fluid constitutive model and shared interfacial nodes with the brain and skull.\n46\nMechanical behaviors of the intracranial membrane were determined by the averaged material stress-strain curves from tissue experiments conducted by Aimedieu and Grebe\n54\nfor pia mater, and by Van Noort and co-workers\n55\nfor dura mater/falx/tentorium, respectively.\nTable 1.\nMaterial Properties Used for the Head Model\nTissue\nYoung's modulus (MPa)\nDensity (kg/dm\n3\n)\nPoisson's ratio\nSkull\n51\n6500\n2.00\n0.22\nBrain\n47\nHyper-viscoelastic\n1.04\n\u223c0.5\nSubarachnoid CSF\n50\nK\u2009=\u20092.1 GPa\n1.00\nN/A\nDura mater/Falx/Tentorium\n58\nAverage stress-strain curve\n1.13\nN/A\nPia mater\n59\nAverage stress-strain curve\n1.13\nN/A\nOpen in a separate window\nCSF, cerebrospinal fluid; K, bulk modulus; N/A, not applicable.\n\nBrain\u2013ventricle interface modeling\nFollowing the approach in previous publications,\n26\u201328\n,\n33\n,\n34\ntwo models with and without an inclusion of the cerebral ventricles are presented (referred to as ventricle-model and no-ventricle-model, hereafter). Such a study design enables comparisons between the current study and previous publications.\nFor the ventricle-model, an FSI approach was used to simulate the brain\u2013ventricle interface. To capture the fluid properties of the intraventricular CSF as well as the potential fluid flow during impact, the cerebral ventricles were modeled using an ALE multi-material formulation.\n35\nPer the requirement of FSI implementation, any locations to which the fluid may potentially flow during the simulation had to be meshed. We expected that the intraventricular CSF could be transported to the space initially occupied by the deep brain structures due to brain deformation and brain\u2013ventricle relative displacement. To account for that, additional meshes, referred to as void mesh in\nFigure 2\n, were generated in these regions, which initially overlapped with parts of the brain mesh. The void mesh was assigned the same material properties and element formulation as the cerebral ventricle elements, except for an extra void definition to ensure no fluid material was filled in the void mesh at its initial configuration. The motion of the ALE elements followed the mass-weighted averaged velocity in the ALE mesh.\n35\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nMesh configuration and material properties of the brain\u2013ventricle interface.

The cerebral ventricles are shown as shaded elements and void mesh as wireframe elements. ALE, arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian.\nAs elaborated by Zhou and co-workers,\n35\nthe ALE multi-material formulation advances the solution in time by dividing the operation into two steps, wherein the material is initially deformed in a Lagrangian step, followed by an advection step with a remapping of the element variables. In the Lagrangian step, the intraventricular CSF deformation was governed by the equation of state (EOS) for dilatational responses and constitutive equation for deviatoric responses with the associated formulations and material constants listed in\nTable 2\n. In the advection step, the element state variables were transported back to the reference domain with potential mass fluxes flowing within the mesh. Given its superiority in terms of numerical stability and advection accuracy, a second-order van Leer scheme was selected.\n35\nTable 2.\nMaterial Constants for the Cerebral Ventricle\nEquation of state\nC (m/s)\nS\n1\nS\n2\nS\n3\na\n\u03b3\n0\nP\n=\n\u03c1\n0\nC\n2\n\u03bc\n[\n1\n+\n(\n1\n-\n\u03b3\n0\n2\n)\n\u03bc\n-\na\n2\n\u03bc\n2\n]\n[\n1\n-\n(\nS\n1\n-\n1\n)\n\u03bc\n-\nS\n2\n\u03bc\n2\n\u03bc\n+\n1\n-\nS\n3\n\u03bc\n3\n(\n\u03bc\n-\n1\n)\n2\n]\n;\n\u03bc\n=\nV\n0\nV\n-\n1\n1482.9\n2.1057\n\u22120.1744\n0.010085\n0\n1.2\nConstitutive equation\n\u03b3 (\nPa.s\n)\nPC\n(MPa)\n\u03c3\ni\nj\nv\n=\n\u03b3\n\u03b5\n\u02d9\ni\nj\n\u2032\n0.001\n\u221222\nOpen in a separate window\nP\nis the pressure,\nC\nis the intercept of\nv\ns\n-v\np\ncurves with\nv\ns\nbeing the velocity of a shockwave traveling through the intermediary material and\nv\np\nbeing the velocity of the shocked material;\nS\n1\n, S\n2\n, and\nS\n3\nare the coefficients of the slope of the\nv\ns\n-v\np\ncurves,\n\u03b3\n0\nis the Gruneisen gamma, and\na\nis the first order volume correction to\n\u03b3\n0\n;V\n0\nis the initial volume;\nV\nis the instantaneous volume;\n\u03c3\ni\nj\nv\nis the deviatoric stress;\n\u03b3\nis the dynamic viscosity;\n\u03b5\n\u02d9\ni\nj\n\u2032\nis the deviatoric strain rate;\nPC\nis the cutoff pressure.\nFor the interface between the cerebral ventricles (ALE solid elements) and brain (Lagrangian solid elements), an FSI coupling algorithm was defined. The chosen algorithm allows sliding in the tangential direction as well as deliverance of tension and compression in the radial direction.\n35\nFor the no-ventricle-model, the ventricular cavities were filled by a substitute with brain material (\nTable 1\n). Given that the substitute was described by a Lagrangian formulation, the void mesh was not needed. Except for these, the material setting and undeformed mesh configuration of the no-ventricle-model were exactly the same as those of the ventricle-model.\nBoth models were validated against experimental data of brain\u2013skull relative motion presented by Hardy and associates\n56\n(see\nAppendix 2\n).\n\nLoading conditions\nTwo sinusoidal-shaped rotational impulses were imposed to both models in three different planes, respectively. One impulse peaked at 10 krad/s\n2\nwith a pulse duration of 5\u2009msec (referred to as the 10 krad/s\n2\n-5\u2009msec impulse, hereafter), whereas the other impulse peaked at 2500\u2009rad/s\n2\nwith a pulse duration of 20\u2009msec (referred to as the 2.5 krad/s\n2\n-20\u2009msec impulse, hereafter). Both impulses approach the tolerance criterion for DAI in man proposed by Margulies and co-workers.\n57\nSuch loading choices were motivated by the histopathological observation that periventricular injury is frequently detected along with DAI.\n6\n,\n58\nTo ensure that the brain peak response was reached, which typically lags behind the peak acceleration impulse, the simulated durations were set to 30\u2009msec for the simulations with rotational acceleration profiles of the 10 krad/s\n2\n-5\u2009msec impulse, and 40\u2009msec for the simulations with rotational acceleration profiles of the 2.5 krad/s\n2\n-20\u2009msec impulse.\nA constant stress integration scheme and hourglass control were used for all the head model components except for the cerebral ventricles. The hourglass energies were controlled to be lower than 10% of the total energy for each component in the models during the entire impact. The massively parallel processing version of LS-DYNA R11 was used with 256 processors requiring 52\u2009h for the ventricle-model and 7\u2009h for the no-ventricle-model for an impact of 30\u2009msec.\n\nStatistical analysis\nFollowing the approach of Miller and co-workers,\n31\nfirst principal Green-Lagrangian strain was selected to evaluate brain injury. To avoid the potential numerical issue, the 95th percentile maximum principal Green-Lagrangian strain (referred to as MPS, hereafter) is presented, the same as the strategies in previous studies.\n59\n,\n60\nTo statistically determine the ventricle influence on the strain responses, the MPS in the regions of interest (ROIs) in two models were analyzed with a Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test. The ROIs included seven subregions of the periventricular tissue (\nFig. 3A\n) and four regions of the paraventricular tissue (\nFig. 1E\n).

    "Methods": "The study protocol was approved by the combined institutional review boards of the University of California, San Diego and Rady Children's Hospital San Diego. All participants and parents/guardians gave written informed consent prior to study procedures. The informed consent followed the ethical guidelines of the Declarations of Helsinki (sixth revision, 2008).\n\nResearch participants\nTwenty-four participants between the ages of 8 and 15 years were recruited for this pilot study as a supplement to already in-progress larger cohort pediatric TBI studies of consecutively treated children and adolescents through the Emergency Department at Rady Children's Hospital San Diego, with inclusion and exclusion criteria described below. A sample of 12 children with mTBI from this consecutively treated series of patients was recruited for the main study and its MEG supplement. A sample of 9 control participants was also recruited from unselected consecutively treated children and adolescents at the same Emergency Department after they presented with an orthopedic injury, but no history of mTBI. Three additional children with no history of TBI or orthopedic injury were recruited through word of mouth.\nBased on parent/guardian and self-report, the control group had no previous history of TBI and the mTBI participants all had no previous history of TBI prior to this injury. The participants were selected to be comparable on age; see\nTable 1\ndisplaying participants' demographic characteristics. The sample included 12 mTBI participants with a mean age of 12.58 (standard deviation [SD]\u2009=\u20091.83) years with an average duration of 6 months between the injury and the MEG exam. The control group mean age was 12.67 (SD\u2009=\u20092.27) years. Consistent with our selection of participants on age, there was no significant difference in age between groups. Both groups comprised predominantly males; the mTBI participant group included 10/12 (83%) males, and the control group included 11/12 (92%) males. Additionally, the demographics table displays Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence-Second Edition (WASI-II)\n16\nfull scale IQ-2 subtest scores with no significant group difference found with respect to IQ scores (mTBI mean\u2009=\u2009106.00, SD\u2009=\u20098.87, control mean\u2009=\u2009108.50, SD\u2009=\u200914.53,\np\n=\u20090.62).

Hospitalization itself did not automatically exclude participation. Exclusion criteria included loss of consciousness greater than 30\u2009min or a GCS score of less than 13. Other exclusion criteria for the mTBI group included the following: 1) associated injury that was deemed severe, as documented by an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS)\n18\nscore greater than 3; 2) associated injury that was likely to interfere with cognitive testing (e.g., injury to dominant upper limb); 3) hypoxia, hypotension, or shock associated with the injury; 4) alcohol or drug ingestion involved with the injury; 5) documented history of previous TBI meeting the above criteria for at least mTBI; 6) pre-injury neurological disorder, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, or intellectual deficiency; 7) any medical contraindication to MRI and MEG; 8) any injury requiring neurosurgical intervention; and 9) currently taking medications (e.g., some sedative neuroleptics and hypnotics) known to alter the power of brain rhythms.\n19\nExclusion criteria for all controls included presence of: 1) documented history of previous TBI meeting the above criteria for at least mTBI; 2) pre-injury neurological disorder, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, or intellectual deficiency; 3) any medical contraindication to MRI and MEG; and 4) taking medications known to alter the power of brain rhythms. Additionally, any participant was excluded if they had extensive metal dental hardware (e.g., braces and large metal dentures; fillings were acceptable) or other metal objects in the head, neck, or face areas that cause artifacts in the MEG data, and not removable during pre-processing.\nMechanism of injury in the mTBI group (\nn\n=\u200912) was a fall in 8 cases, head to head collision in soccer in 2 cases, helmet to helmet collision in football in 1 case, and passenger in a motor vehicle accident in 1 case. Injury in 5 of the cases was related to sports. Initial impact contact for the mTBI group was in the midline in 8 cases, left sided in 3 cases, and right sided in 1 case. Mechanism of injury in the orthopedic controls (\nn\n=\u20099) involved falls in 4 cases including 3 during sports activities, other sports injuries in 4 cases, and collision with an object (ran and hit hand on a car) in 1 case. None of the orthopedic controls hit their heads.\n\nMEG data acquisition and signal pre-processing to remove artifacts\nrs-MEG data (spontaneous recording for detecting MEG slow-wave signals) were collected at the University of California, San Diego MEG Center using the VectorView\u2122 whole-head MEG system (Elekta-Neuromag, Helsinki, Finland) with 306 MEG channels. Participants sat inside a multi-layer magnetically shielded room (IMEDCO-AG).\n20\nPrecautions were taken to ensure head stability; foam wedges were inserted between the participant's head and the inside of the unit, and a Velcro strap was placed under the participant's chin and anchored in superior and posterior axes. Head movement across different sessions was about 2\u20133\u2009mm.\nMEG recording was divided into three 5-min blocks with eyes closed, alternating with three 5-min blocks with eyes open. In the eyes-closed condition, the participant was instructed to keep his/her eyes closed and empty his/her mind. In the eyes-open condition, the participant was instructed to fix his/her eyes on a fixation point and empty his/her mind. The order of blocks was counter-balanced between participants. Data were sampled at 1000\u2009Hz and were run through a high-pass filter with a 0.1\u2009Hz cutoff, and a low-pass filter with a 300\u2009Hz cutoff. The filter associated with MEG data acquisition is a first-order time-domain filter with 3 dB around the cutoff points. Eye blinks, eye movements, and heart signals were monitored. Because the MEG eyes-open data were contaminated with eye blinks in many participants, we focused on analyzing the eyes-closed data in the present study. Due to the non-effort dependent nature of the resting state exam, the data of the solitary participant that was involved in litigation were included.\nSubstantial effort was taken to ensure that participants were alert during the MEG recordings. Prior to all study sessions, participants completed a questionnaire about the number of hours they slept the previous night, how rested they felt, and if there was any reason that they might not be attentive and perform to the best of their abilities (due to headache, pain, etc.). During MEG recording, participants were viewed on camera while technicians also monitored alpha band oscillations, which are consistently associated with tonic alertness.\n21\nEyes-closed MEG data were first run through MaxFilter, also known as signal space separation,\n22\u201324\nto remove external sources of interference (e.g., magnetic artifacts due to metal objects, strong cardiac signals, environment noises, etc.) and to co-register the MEG data by removing the small head movements across the two 5-min eyes-closed sessions. Next, residual artifacts due to eye movements and residual cardiac signals were removed using Independent Component Analysis with Fast-ICA.\n25\n,\n26\n\nStructural MRI, MEG-MRI registration, BEM forward calculation\nStructural MRI of the participant's head was collected using either a General Electric 3T MR 750 (in 21 participants) or a General Electric 1.5T Excite MRI scanner (in 3 participants). The acquisition from the GE 3T system contains a standard high-resolution anatomical volume (T1-weighted three-dimensional inversion recovery spoiled gradient [3D-IR-SPGR]) with a 1.2-mm slice thickness. The acquisition from the GE 1.5T system contains a standard high-resolution anatomical volume with a resolution of 0.94\u2009\u00d7\u20090.94\u2009\u00d7\u20091.2\u2009mm\n3\nusing a T1-weighted three-dimensional inversion recovery fast spoiled gradient (3D-IR-FSPGR) pulse sequence. To co-register the MEG with MRI coordinate systems, three anatomical landmarks (i.e., left and right pre-auricular points, and nasion) were measured for each participant using the Probe Position Identification system (Polhemus). By using MRILAB (Elekta/Neuromag) to identify the same three points on the participant's MR images, a transformation matrix involving both rotation and translation between the MEG and MR coordinate systems was generated. To increase the reliability of the MEG-MR co-registration, \u223c80 points on the scalp were digitized with the Polhemus system, in addition to the three landmarks, and those points were co-registered onto the scalp surface of the MR images.\nThe T1-weighted images were also used to extract the brain volume and innermost skull surface (SEGLAB software developed by Elekta/Neuromag). The Realistic Boundary Element Method (BEM) head model was used for MEG forward calculation.\n27\n,\n28\nThe BEM mesh was constructed by tessellating the inner skull surface from the T1-weighted MRI into \u223c6000 triangular elements with a size of \u223c5\u2009mm. A cubic source grid of 5\u2009mm was used for calculating the MEG gain (i.e., lead-field) matrix, which leads to a grid with \u223c10,000 nodes covering the whole brain. Other conventional MRI sequences typical for identifying structural lesions were also performed: 1) axial T2*-weighted; 2) axial fast spin echo T2-weighted; and 3) axial fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR). These conventional MRIs were reviewed by a board-certified neuroradiologist (JRH) to determine if participants had visible lesions on MRI.\n\nMEG slow-wave source magnitude imaging using Fast-VESTAL\nThe voxel-wise MEG source magnitude images were obtained using our high-resolution Fast-VESTAL MEG source imaging method.\n8\n,\n29\nThis approach requires the sensor waveform covariance matrix. Here, the second 5-min rs-MEG sensor-waveform data set was registered to the first 5-min resting-state data set using MaxFilter. The artifact-free, eyes-closed, rs-MEG sensor-waveform data sets were divided into 2.5-sec epochs. The data in each epoch were first Direct Current-corrected and then run through band-pass filters for the following frequency bands: alpha band (8\u201312\u2009Hz), beta band (15\u201330\u2009Hz), gamma band (30\u201380\u2009Hz), high-gamma band (80\u2013150\u2009Hz), and low-frequency band (1\u20137\u2009Hz) that combined delta (1\u20134\u2009Hz) and theta bands (4\u20137\u2009Hz). Notch filters at 60\u2009Hz and 120\u2009Hz were applied to remove the power line signals and their second harmonics. Frequency-domain band-pass filter with zero phase-shift via discrete Fourier transform was used. At each end of the band-pass filter, the transition of the Hanning window in the filter was selected to be at 10% of the associated cutoff frequency.\nWaveforms from all 306 sensors including 204 planar-gradiometers and 102 magnetometers were used in the analysis. For each frequency band, sensor-waveform covariance matrices were calculated for individual epochs after the band-pass filtering, then the final sensor-waveform covariance matrix was obtained by averaging the covariance matrices across individual epochs for the 10-min resting-state data. Using such a covariance matrix, MEG slow-wave source magnitude images that cover the whole brain were obtained for each participant following the Fast-VESTAL procedure for a given frequency band.\n29\n,\n30\n\nStatistical analysis\nIn all participants, voxel-wise whole-brain MEG source magnitude images obtained from Fast-VESTAL were first spatially co-registered to the MNI-152\n31\nbrain-atlas template using a linear affine transformation program, FLIRT, in the FSL software package.\n32\n,\n33\nThen in MNI-152 space, the MEG source magnitude images were spatially smoothed using a Gaussian kernel with 5\u2009mm full width half maximum (FWHM), followed by a logarithmic transformation using FSL. Next, voxel-wise statistical analyses were performed to assess the group differences between the children with mTBI and the control children.\nFor each frequency band, a voxel-wise, two-tailed\nt\ntest was performed to examine the group differences (i.e., mTBI vs. control group). Family-wise error across voxels was corrected using standard cluster analysis for the\nt\n-value maps to control for family-wise errors at a corrected\np\n<\u20090.01 level, using \u201c3dFWHMx\u201d and \u201c3dClustSim\u201d functions in the latest version of AFNI (\nhttp://afni.nimh.nih.gov\n). A mask that contained the statistically significant clusters was created, and then applied to the\nt\n-value maps to create the corrected group statistical maps for the MEG source magnitude images.\n\nPost-concussion behavioral assessment and psychiatric assessment\nAs part of the larger cohort studies, at 6-months post-injury and coincident with the rs-MEG examination, mTBI participants and their primary caretaker rated their persistent post-concussion symptoms (PCS) on the Health and Behavior Inventory (HBI) scale. The HBI is a 20-item self-report measure of mTBI symptoms validated on youth ages 8\u201315 years and their parents.\n34\nThe scale has two domains consisting of 11 cognitive symptoms and 9 somatic symptoms, where higher scores reflect higher report of symptoms. The cognitive symptoms include problems with attention, distractibility, concentration, memory, following directions, daydreaming, confusion, task completion, problem solving, and learning. The somatic symptoms include headaches, dizziness, vision problems, nausea, and fatigue. The ratings of one participant indicated a clear outlier associated with ongoing litigation. We therefore removed this participant's ratings from the mTBI group analysis. Nine orthopedic injury control participants' ratings were included in the control analysis, as the other 3 controls were uninjured and were recruited from a larger cohort study for pediatric TBI that did not include these measures. It is important to note that those 3 uninjured control participants and their parents were asked a series of questions regarding any PCS and denied having any symptoms.\nDetermination of the presence at 6-months post-injury of a new-onset psychiatric disorder after mTBI or after orthopedic injury, that is, coincident with the rs-MEG assessment, was made by combining data from a baseline psychiatric assessment that recorded pre-injury diagnoses and a 6-month psychiatric interview that recorded all diagnoses present at 6-months post-injury. The psychiatric assessment was accomplished through a baseline interview conducted by a trained-research assistant who was not blind to group affiliation (i.e., mTBI vs. control). The interviewer administered the Neuropsychiatric Rating Schedule (NPRS)\n35\nand the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-aged Children, Present and Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL)\n36\nto generate\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition\n(DSM-5) pre-injury diagnoses including post-traumatic stress disorder. The assessment was repeated at 6-months post-injury by a different research assistant who was blind to the participants' group. This procedure generated DSM-5 diagnoses that allowed for the documentation of new-onset post-injury psychiatric disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder. The K-SADS-PL was administered to the mTBI participants (\nn\n=\u200912) and the orthopedic injury controls (\nn\n=\u20099) but not to the uninjured controls (\nn\n=\u20093)."

    "Methods": "Patient selection and data acquisition\nRetrospective analysis of data recordings from patients admitted to the Neurosciences and Trauma Critical Care Unit (NCCU) at Cambridge University Hospitals, Cambridge, United Kingdom after severe brain injury between 2002 and 2012 was performed. ICP was recorded using an intraparenchymal probe placed as per departmental clinical protocol (Codman & Shurtleff Inc., Massachusetts). Invasive systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) was recorded from an indwelling radial artery catheter. Heart rate (HR) was derived from routine cardiac monitoring. All signals were continuously sampled using ICM+ software (Cambridge, UK,\nhttp://icmplus.neurosurg.cam.ac.uk\n) at a frequency between 30 and 200\u2009Hz. Data were re-sampled by averaging over 10\u2009sec epochs in order to suppress pulse and respiratory waves to focus entirely on the slow fluctuations of ICP.\nThere were 319 patient recordings available; total data recording length varied among patients from <1\u2009h to 14 days. However, we were interested in those that had time for the disease process to evolve, and selected 203 with at least 72\u2009h recording of ICP, BP, and HR. Those without a Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) (\nn\n=\u20095), known to have more than 2\u2009h gaps (\nn\n=\u200910) and >24\u2009h from ictus at the time of admission (\nn\n=\u200917) were excluded. A total of 171 patients entered our analysis. Because recordings in the first 24\u2009h tended to be either incomplete because of surgical intervention, or confounded by artefacts because of sedation holds in apparently less severely injured patients, we selected the second 24\u2009h period for our analysis. All were sedated, mechanically ventilated, and managed according to a cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) orientated protocol during their stay in critical care.\n19\nData collection and analysis were approved by institutional review. The PRx, a moving Pearson correlation between ICP and mean arterial pressure (MAP), was additionally calculated as a measure of cerebral autoregulation.\n\nNonlinear signal information-based features\nComplexity\nApEn was used as the marker for the complexity of HR (ApEn-HR), MAP (ApEn-MAP), and ICP (ApEn-ICP) derived using open source MATLAB (R2017a, MathWorks Inc. Natick, MA) scripts. Following on from our prior findings, we also used a combined \u201cApEn-Product\u201d (interaction term or product of the three individual ApEns), which was found to be most predictive of outcome.\n10\nInformation flow\nConditional multivariate GC values were derived using code published by Seth and coworkers using MATLAB.\n20\n,\n21\nData were aligned for each subject such that the same 24\u2009h recording period as that for ApEn was used. We used the multivariate extension, often referred to as \u201cconditional\u201d GC analysis, as a marker for the causal information flow between our three time-series variables.\n22\nFor example, GC could infer a causal relationship from MAP to ICP only if past information in the MAP helped predict future ICP, after taking into account the influence of HR. Mathematical theory behind GC as well as data preparation workflow is described extensively elsewhere.\n23\u201325\nBased on our prior study,\n14\nthe GC from ICP to MAP (ICP-to-MAP) and from HR to ICP (HR-to-ICP) were identified as significant predictors of mortality. We tested these, and their interaction term \u201cGranger-Product\u201d (product between ICP-to-MAP and HR-to-ICP) in our models.\n\nStatistical analysis\nLinear (PRx, mean values for ICP, CPP, BP, and HR) and signal information-based features (ApEn and GC) for 171 patients over the same 24\u2009h monitoring period was used for analysis. Mortality was assessed at 6 months after brain injury. Between-group comparisons were made using with one way analysis of variance (ANOVA), or Kruskal\u2013Wallis non-parametric testing as appropriate. Categorical data were compared using \u03c7\n2\ntesting. Multivariable logistical regression models (using linear only features, linear with ApEn, linear with GC, and a \u201ccombined\u201d [linear with both ApEn and GC]) were constructed to identify independent predictors of mortality, and reported using odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). We also calculated the pseudo\nR\n2\ngiven that it also takes into account prevalence.\nWe employed chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) for binary recursive partitioning to construct a decision tree model for the prediction of mortality; the patient population is repeatedly split into increasingly homogenous groups based on the optimum predictors of mortality (using both linear and signal information features) at each split. First introduced by Kass in 1980,\n26\nrecursive partitioning with CHAID is particularly powerful when there are many potential complex interactions between the predictors of interest.\n27\nWe set\nn\n=\u200930 (17.5%) as the minimum patient count at which further partitioning occurred, and splits were also pruned if they did not significantly improve the overall model, in order to minimize overfitting. Finally, we used cross-validation for constrained optimization using multiple training sets (10 \u201cfolds\u201d) within the cohort. The stopping rule terminates splitting when improvement in the cross-validation\nR\n2\nis minimal (more specifically, a model is selected when none of the next 10 show an improvement of cross-validation\nR\n2\n>\u20090.005). This optimized misclassification error, prevented overfitting, and limited tree size (number of splits).\nModel performance for all possible thresholds for dichotomizing the predicted probabilities of fatality was then assessed using receiver operated characteristics (ROC), and their corresponding area under the curve (AUC) and 95% CI, as well as differences between model AUCs and corresponding 95% CIs. To assess the accuracy of the prediction models, calibration plots were produced by binning predicted mortality probabilities into deciles, and then plotting the mean observed mortality against the mean predicted mortality within each bin.\n28\nStatistical analysis was performed using JMP Pro 14 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Data are presented as mean (\u00b1 standard deviation), unless otherwise indicated. GC variables were log transformed because of non-normal distribution prior to inclusion in the models.\nP\nvalues are reported as is without thresholds for statistical significance in accordance with the latest statistical guidance from the American Statistical Association.\n29\n,\n30\nAll tests were two tailed and without correction for multiple comparisons."

    "Methods": "Animals and CCI\nAll experimental procedures were approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with the guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Animals were housed up to two rats per cage in the University of Pittsburgh vivarium with a 12:12 light/dark photoperiod (lights on at 7:00 a.m.) and provided food and water\nad libitum\n. Animals were also monitored daily by veterinary technicians.\nA total of 96 adult male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) weighing 275\u2013350\u2009g were used in this study and were randomly assigned to receive either sham or CCI injury (\nn\n=\u20096 per group). Half of the animals were processed for immunoblotting and the other half for iummunohistochemistry. Rats were anesthetized using 4% isoflurane with a 2:1\u2009N\n2\nO/O\n2\nmixture in a ventilated anesthesia chamber. Following endotracheal intubation, the rats were mechanically ventilated with a 2% isoflurane mixture. Animals were placed in a stereotaxic frame and body temperature was monitored by rectal thermistor probe and maintained at 37\u00b0C with a heating pad. Following a midline incision, the soft tissues were reflected and a 7\u2009mm craniectomy was performed over the right parietal cortex, between bregma and lambda, and centered 5\u2009mm lateral of the sagittal suture to expose the dura mater. Control sham injury animals were subjected to anesthesia and surgical procedures but did not receive a TBI. The CCI injury device is a small bore (1.975\u2009cm) double-acting stroked-constrained pneumatic cylinder with a 5.0\u2009cm stroke. An impactor tip (6\u2009mm in diameter, flat tip) was set to produce a tissue deformation of 2.8\u2009mm at a velocity of 4\u2009m/sec with a dwell time of 150\u2009msec. After each sham or CCI injury, the scalp was sutured, gas anesthetics were turned off, and righting time was monitored. Once ambulatory, the animals were returned to their home cages.\n\nImmunoblotting\nAt 24\u2009h or 1, 2, or 4 weeks post-injury, animals received an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (intraperitoneally, 100\u2009mg/kg Fatal-plus, Vortech Pharmaceuticals, Dearborn, MI) and were rapidly decapitated. Ipsilateral and contralateral cortex and hippocampus were dissected on a chilled ice plate and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C. Samples were homogenized by sonication in lysis buffer (0.1\u2009M NaCl, 0.01\u2009M Tris-Cl, 0.001\u2009M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA], pH 7.6) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) The homogenized whole cell samples were centrifuged at 13,000\ng\nat 4 \u00b0C for 30\u2009min, and the supernatants collected. Total protein concentration was determined by a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) using a 96-well microplate reader (Biotek, Winooski, VT).\nTo assess neurogranin and PSD-95 expression, whole cell lysates were boiled for 10\u2009min prior to blotting. 15\u2009\u03bcg of cortical and 10\u2009\u03bcg of hippocampal protein samples and molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) were separated using sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The resolved proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The blots were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 1\u2009h. Rabbit anti-neurogranin (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) primary antibody was diluted (1:1000) in blocking solution and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. The following day, the membranes were washed with 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009TBS buffer, incubated in blocking solution containing horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies for 1\u2009h. Proteins were visualized using a chemiluminescence detection system (Supersignal, Pierce). The membranes were stripped and probed with mouse anti-\u03b2-actin antibody (diluted 1:5000, Sigma-Aldrich) then stripped again and probed with rabbit anti-PSD-95 antibody (diluted, 1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Blots were imaged with the Chemidoc Imager (BioRad). Optical density of neurogranin and PSD-95 were measured using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) and normalized to \u03b2-actin levels. One hemisphere from a single brain region for both sham and CCI-injured animals were loaded on one gel to directly compare injury effect. Values are presented as the ratio of optical densities of samples as a percentage of sham (100%) for each time point. Data are expressed as the group means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nAnimals received an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (intraperitoneally, 100\u2009mg/kg Fatal-plus) at 24\u2009h or 1, 2, or 4 weeks after sham or CCI injury. Animals were transcardially perfused with saline, followed by a mixture of 10% neutral buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The brains were post-fixed for an additional 24\u2009h in 10% neutral buffered formalin, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 48\u2009h at 4\u00b0C. The brains were frozen in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) and cut into 35\u2009\u03bcm thick coronal sections on a cryostat (Leica Microsystems Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL). Sections at -3.0 to -3.7mm post-bregma were selected and processed for immunofluorescence staining.\nImmunohistochemical staining was completed on free-floating tissue sections. One section per animal, at the level of the anterior hippocampus, was rinsed with 0.1\u2009M TBS buffer and blocked with 10% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1\u2009M TBS for 1\u2009h. Sections were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the same rabbit anti-Neurogranin (Abcam), an antibody utilized for immunoblot analysis. Following incubation of horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody, sections were washed, and diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used to visualize the reaction product. Sections were mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific), cover-slipped using Permount medium (Fisher Scientific), and qualitatively assessed by light microscopy using a Nikon 90i microscope (Melville, NY).\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM. Immunoblot data were compared using a non-parametric, Mann\u2013Whitney,\nt\ntest for each time point and a\np\nvalue <0.05 was considered statistically significant for all tests. Statistical tests were completed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nFemale and male Sprague-Dawley rats (\nn\n=\u2009103; 230\u2013500\u2009g, Charles River Laboratories, Raleigh, NC) were maintained under standard conditions of laboratory housing with free access to food and water. Experiments conformed with National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Integrated Laboratory Systems Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nSpinal cord transection and post-surgical procedures\nRats were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine (Henry Schein; 50\u2013100\u2009mg/kg and 5\u201310\u2009mg/kg intraperitoneal, respectively). Using aseptic procedures the skin and muscle over the middle thoracic vertebrae were incised, the spinal cord was exposed by a laminectomy, and the cord was transected at T9.\n15\nAfter the transection, a piece of Gelfoam\nR\nwas placed between the cut ends of the spinal cord, the surrounding muscle was closed with absorbable sterile sutures, and the skin was closed with wound clips (removed 10 days post-surgery). Prior to the surgery, all rats received an SC injection of dual penicillin (3000\u2009U/mL, penicillin G coupled with procaine; PenJect, Henry Schein). Immediately following surgery, rats were given buprenorphine (0.05\u2009mg/kg SC; Henry Schein) and 5\u2009mL of sterile saline SC. Buprenorphine was continued for 2 days (0.03\u2009mg/kg SC, twice a day [bid]), and gentamicin (5\u2009mg/kg SC; Gentafuse, Henry Schein) was administered once a day, for 5\u20137 days to prevent bladder infections. Bladders were manually expressed 2\u20133 times a day until spontaneous voiding was observed (7\u201314 days).\n\nBehavioral monitoring and dosing\nAt 4\u20135 weeks post-SCI, rats were habituated to metabolism cages and randomly assigned to one of three groups to receive twice daily (i.e., bid, at 8\u201310\nAM\nand 1\u20134\nPM\n) SC injections of saline vehicle (10 female, 8 male), 10\u2009\u03bcg/kg LMN-NKA (8 female, 7 male), or 100\u2009\u03bcg/kg LMN-NKA (10 female, 8 male) for 1 month. The doses of LMN-NKA for the daily dosing were based on approximately effective dose 50 (ED50) and ED80 that produced voiding in na\u00efve, anesthetized, chronic SCI rats. Twice each week (i.e., Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday) for 5 weeks, animals were observed for 30\u2009min after the morning dose, and voiding parameters were recorded (see below). A pilot study in females rats verified that drug-induced voiding was similar during the morning and afternoon dosing, and only morning behavioral observations were recorded for efficiency.\nBehavioral parameters were measured by persons blinded to the treatment. The time and volume of each void, the number and wet weight of fecal pellets, and the presence/absence of diarrhea were recorded. At the end of the 30-min observation period, urine was expressed by Cred\u00e9 maneuver and recorded as residual volume. The voiding efficiency (VE) was calculated at 10\u2009min post-dose (voided volume/[voided volume + residual volume]\u2009\u00d7\u2009100%). The responder rate was determined as the number of responders (within 10\u2009min of dosing)/total number of observations\u2009\u00d7\u2009100%. Any unexpected or unusual changes in behavior, the presence of flushing of the extremities, and any atypical muscle contractions were recorded, if present.\n\nUrodynamic and cardiovascular study\nThe day after the last dose of the 30-day regimen, rats from each of the three treatment groups were anesthetized with urethane (1.2\u20131.4\u2009g/kg SC), and voiding cystometry was conducted as previously described.\n3\n,\n4\nA separate group of na\u00efve (i.e., untreated) chronic SCI rats (17 female, 22 male) was also studied.\nArterial blood pressure was continuously recorded by a catheter (PE 50) inserted into the carotid artery. Systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure and heart rate values were calculated off-line (LabChart 8, AD Instruments). Baseline and post-dose parameters were recorded and used to calculate the change in blood pressure or heart rate. Values were expressed as a change from baseline values collected from a 20- to 60-sec period before and 5\u2009min after each dose. Salivation was measured by placing a weighed piece of absorbent paper under each rat's tongue before each dose. At 5\u201310\u2009min post-dosing the paper was removed and re-weighed and the difference in weight recorded. We assumed that 1\u2009g weight change\u2009=\u20091\u2009mL fluid production. Rats did not salivate in response to vehicle injections.\nFor urodynamic studies, a flared-tipped catheter (PE 50) was inserted into the bladder through a small incision at the dome and secured in place with suture. The catheter was then connected via a three-way stopcock to an infusion pump (Perfusion Pump PhD2000, Harvard Apparatus) and a pressure transducer (DelTran II, Utah Medical Products) coupled to a bridge amplifier (Transbridge 4M, World Precision Instruments) to allow for bladder filling (0.04\u20130.1\u2009mL/min with 0.9% saline) and pressure measurement, respectively. Bladder capacity was determined by filling the bladder until release of fluid through the urethra was observed. Subsequently, the bladder was filled to 70% of capacity and the effect of vehicle or ascending doses of LMN-NKA on BP and voided volumes were recorded. The bladder was then emptied to measure the residual volume. When voiding occurred, bladder voiding pressure (BVP) was recorded, and the VE was calculated. Subsequently, continuous infusion cystometry was performed until the bladder returned to pre-dose physiological bladder capacity, and stable baseline characteristics. The next-higher dose of LMN-NKA was then administered.\n\nStatistical analysis\nBP was recorded via Chart software through the PowerLab/8SP data acquisition system (version 7 and 8, AD Instruments). Measurements included: baseline BP; maximal BP; time to onset of voiding; and VE and responder rate (number of animals voiding within 5\u2009min of dosing/total number of animals observed\u2009\u00d7\u2009100%). Data were analyzed using Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) and Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Statistical analysis was performed using a one-way, or a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with Dunnett's or Turkey's multiple comparisons tests, as appropriate. Response rates were analyzed by conditional logistic regression using vehicle as the reference group and stratifying for dosing week. The regression was performed using R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). A\np\n-value <0.05 was considered statistically different. All values are expressed as the mean + standard deviation (SD), except the cardiovascular data, which are presented as mean + standard error (SE).\n\nBladder histology and tissue analysis\nA separate group of rats were treated bid for 30 days with vehicle (\nn\n=\u20093/sex), 10\u2009\u03bcg/kg LMN-NKA (\nn\n=\u20092 females), or 100\u2009\u03bcg/kg LMN-NKA (\nn\n=\u20093/sex) and were euthanized with an overdose of urethane; the bladders were carefully dissected from the abdominal cavity, weighed, and placed into 10% formalin for 2\u20135 days before being embedded in paraffin wax. Sections were cut (5-\u03bcm thickness) at 200-\u03bcm intervals through the bladder (including the mid-bladder and the bladder base). Two consecutive sections from each level were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or Verhoeff/Masson Trichrome and examined for evidence of general tissue damage, by an observer who was blinded to the sex and treatment group.\nAnalysis of female bladder tissue was performed using Definiens Architect Client and Tissue Studio Portal by the University of North Carolina (UNC) Translational Pathology Laboratory (TPL) group. High-resolution images (digital slides) were made by scans on an Aperio ScanScope XT (Leica Biosystems) with a 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009power objective and a camera resolution of 0.4942 microns per pixel. Images were then uploaded to eSlide Manager as JPEG2000-compressed Aperio SVS files and visualized with ImageScope 12.3 (Leica Biosystems). Images were subsequently imported to Definiens Architect XD 2.7 for analysis with Tissue Studio version 4.4.2. Each tissue section was detected separately. The Definiens Composer algorithm was used to segment the tissue into five regions of interest (ROIs): collagen, elastin, urothelium, smooth muscle, and glass or adipose. This algorithm was trained on representative input regions to classify all the tissue within the ROIs in the final analysis. The program then calculated the total tissue area and the area percentages for each of the ROIs."

This study was approved by the National Institutes of Health Intramural Institutional Review Board (NCT01132937). Patients who presented to the emergency department who 1) had a history of acute head injury, 2) were 18 years or older, and 3) were able to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 48\u2009h of injury were approached and enrolled.

The imaging protocol at both time-points included 3DT1w (1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091-mm voxels, \u223c5.25\u2009min) and T2-FLAIR (1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20093.5\u2009mm, \u223c2\u2009min) sequences.

A board-certified radiologist performed a clinical interpretation of all MRI for medical records. Patients were stratified as positive or negative for SAH based primarily on the appearance on T2-FLAIR and T2*-weighted GRE. Traumatic microbleeds (TMBs) were identified using the two T2*-weighted sequences and classified as punctate or having a linear appearance. To reduce the likelihood of false-positive detection of TMBs from vasculature conspicuous on SWI, TMBs were only scored as positive if detectable on both T2* sequences. Hematoma presence was defined as the presence of subdural, intraventricular, or intraparenchymal blood.\n\nImage processing\nThe lesion prediction algorithm (LST, v.2.0.15) for statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was used to segment hyperintense lesions on T2-FLAIR images and correct the 3DT1w images for possible corresponding hypointensities.\n23\nSubsequently, brain volume was obtained with CAT12 (\nhttp://www.neuro.uni-jena.de/cat/\n) as the sum of the gray and white matter volumes, including the lesion volume. The intracranial volume was defined as the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volumes combined, whereas global atrophy was defined as the CSF volume relative to intracranial volume. Segmentation quality was assessed as either \u201cadequate\u201d or \u201cpoor\u201d on visual inspection (L.A.v.d.K.). Patients with a poor brain segmentation quality rating were excluded from data analyses. Brain volume change was defined using the baseline as reference; negative values for brain volume change indicate a decrease in brain volume over time.\nPerfusion analysis was performed on the motion-corrected PWI using two methods: deconvolution-based analysis and temporal similarity perfusion analysis (TSP). Standard perfusion maps (CBF and Tmax) were extracted from the time-series PWI using a block-circulant singular value deconvolution (bSVD) approach.\n30\nA separate perfusion analysis was done using TSP, which is a model-free technique that assesses regional perfusion based on deviation from the whole-brain healthy tissue average.\n31\nBoth perfusion analysis methods were performed using Matlab R2018a (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA).\nTSP provides Pearson's\nr\ncorrelation maps, peak signal intensity (SI) maps (i.e., the maximum gadolinium-induced signal drop per voxel), and relative delay maps (i.e., the time delay at which the voxel perfusion time course is most correlated with the whole-brain average).\n31\nThe TSP peak signal intensity maps were inverted to obtain TSP peak height maps, in which a higher peak reflects a higher gadolinium concentration. Although TSP does not provide perfusion in absolute units, it makes it easier to identify regions where perfusion deviates from normal (e.g., lesions, ischemia) and it is even less sensitive to errors resulting from a poorly chosen arterial input function.\nFor both the bSVD and the TSP technique, the resulting perfusion maps were co-registered to a down-sampled Dartel template (matrix size: 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u200940, voxel size: 0.71\u2009\u00d7\u20090.85\u2009\u00d7\u20094.5\u2009mm\n3\n). Subsequently, a border zone mask in Dartel space was created, where border zone regions were defined as overlapping perfusion territories across subjects on previously obtained territorial arterial spin labeling maps (\nFig. 1\n).\n32\nWhole-brain and border zone perfusion values were retrieved, and the border zone ratio relative to whole-brain values was calculated separately for each perfusion parameter. The rationale behind this was that a lower border zone ratio could signal subtle perfusion abnormalities, which cause reduced CBF or prolonged arterial transit times.\n33\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nThe original fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image\n(A)\n, border zone region mask\n(B)\n, and resulting perfusion maps in Dartel space from a single patient\n(D\u2013H)\n.

Differences between groups were analyzed with a Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, or chi-square test, and differences between baseline and 90 days were analyzed with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Correlations were tested with Spearman's rank correlation. Multiple linear regression with backwards selection (\np\n<\u20090.50) was performed to identify the combination of variables associated with relative brain-volume change. In the initial model, only variables at a\np\n-value <0.15 in bivariate analyses were entered in a regression model."

    "Methods": "Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents\nPrior to enrollment, the research protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, National Institutes of Health, and the Naval Medical Research Center in compliance with all applicable Federal regulations governing the protection of human subjects. All participants provided written, informed consent prior to participation in the study.\n\nStudy design and setting\nAll participants were recruited from service members (SMs) engaged in a 10-day breacher training program for an all-male cohort (\nn\n=\u200950) as previously described.\n14\nBaseline serum samples were collected on day 1 of a 10-day training program, with daily follow-up samples. Pressure sensors were used to measure blast exposure. On day 7, some individuals (\nn\n=\u200929) experienced a moderate blast, defined as a peak overpressure \u22655 psi. Moderate blast cases were matched on age, blast exposure history, and previous TBI to individuals in a no/low blast control group (\nn\n=\u200921), who never experienced blast exposure \u22653 psi at any point during the 10-day training program. All participants were recruited from a well-characterized cohort engaged in a 10-day military blast training program as previously described.\n16\nTraining occurred during the hours of 0600 to 1600 daily.\nAt baseline, self-report data were collected from participants including: age, education, marital status, duration of military service, exercise routine, tobacco use, history of TBI, prior blast exposure (yes/no), and number of lifetime blast exposures. Blood draws were collected on day 1 of training and at the end of each training day between 1600 and 1800; changes in protein levels were assessed using blood collected on days 1 (baseline), 6 (day before moderate blast), 7 (day of moderate blast), and post-blast days 8, 9, and 10. On each day of training, all participants wore a helmet equipped with bilateral sensors mounted above the ear cups (micro Data Acquisition System [\u03bcDAS]; Applied Research Associates, Inc., Albuquerque, NM). This sensor-equipped helmet enabled continuous detection of changes in ambient pressure from each side of the head. Data were recorded when a threshold of 0.4 psi was crossed, based on the technical specifications of the sensors as well as considerations for signal-to-noise ratios as they relate to data interpretation. For each recorded event, the highest peak pressure was recorded (i.e., maximal overpressure during the blast exposure). The peak impulse was also recorded (i.e., integral of the overpressure across time throughout the blast exposure); peak impulse represents the amount of force per unit area applied during the positive pressure phase. Readings from the left and right sensor were averaged to produce the data used in analysis. Cumulative pressure was calculated as the summed pressure exposure over the 2-week training course.\n\nLaboratory methods\nPeripheral blood samples were drawn between 1600 and 1800\u2009h and processed for serum, then aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until processing. An ultra-sensitive immunoassay analyzer capable of single molecule array (Simoa\u2122; Quanterix, Lexington, MA) was used to run an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) measuring GFAP protein levels. This method results in greater sensitivity in the detection of biomarkers compared with a standard ELISA. The GFAP assays have low limits of detection (LLOD) at 0.276\u2009pg/mL, and all intra- and inter-plate coefficient of variation (CV) values were less than 20%. If a sample was measured as 0.276\u2009pg/mL it was used, and if a sample measured below the LLOD the sample was not included in data analysis.\n\nStatistical analyses\nThe Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 24 (SPSS; IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) was used for database management and statistical analysis. GraphPad Prism version 6.02 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) was used to produce the graphs. Concentrations of GFAP were considered as continuous data. Demographic variables including age, duration of service, education, previous blast exposure, tobacco and alcohol use, hours of exercise, and hours of sleep were analyzed using either\nt\ntest (age and duration of service) or chi-square (\u03c7\n2\n). For GFAP distribution we assessed the normality of the concentration data, and we are within the parameters of the assumptions required to perform parametric statistics. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the moderate group with the no/low blast group based on protein levels on days 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 of training; an outlier check was performed on all samples and any values above or below two standard deviations (SDs) from the average were removed prior to analysis. Levene's test was used to check the homogeneity of variance and the Welch test was used if needed. To assess changes in protein levels across groups and across training days, a repeated measures (RM)-ANOVA was used; if the test of sphericity showed significance, the Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied. Multi-variate analysis was performed to determine the effects of age, duration of service, cumulative pressure exposure over the training period, and any interactions of these on the GFAP levels on days 6, 7, and 8, and on the percent change from baseline of GFAP on days 6, 7, and 8. For all categorical variables, chi-square analysis was used to compare the moderate blast cases with no/low blast controls. Self-reported history of exposure was categorized as follows: 1\u2009=\u20090\u201310 events, 2\u2009=\u200911\u201350 events, 3\u2009=\u200951\u2013150 events, 4\u2009=\u2009151\u2013350 events, and 5\u2009=\u2009351+ events."

    "Methods": "Study sample\nIn February 2015, the Football Players' Health Study at Harvard University identified 14,538 former active professional players who had signed a contract with the NFL between 1960 and 2013 and were no longer listed as active players and believed to be alive and eligible. This start year 1960 was chosen, as the transition to the helmet with a hard plastic shell, which was accompanied by major rule changes, was complete and well established by 1960. Of these 14,538 players, we had potential contact information for 13,403 former professional players, all of whom we attempted to contact. We believe that we reached 13,200 potential study participants. At the time of this analysis, 3779 former professional ASF players (28.6%) had responded. Newly retired players continue to enroll, and we plan to follow them longitudinally. The four-page questionnaire assessing self-reported sociodemographic, play-related, health, quality of life, and lifestyle characteristics was sent in either paper or electronic format. In our sample, 1308 former players completed the questionnaire in paper format and 2471 completed it via Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap\nTM\n). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School. The IRBs at the collaborating Harvard institutions Harvard Medical School, Boston Children's Hospital, and Massachusetts General Hospital ceded IRB review to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center's IRB's review. Consent was obtained via an implied consent model with the participant's willingness to complete the questionnaire serving as implied informed consent.

Each item describes a cognitive problem (e.g., \u201cI had trouble thinking clearly\u201d) and asks respondents to indicate how frequently they have experienced this problem over the past 7 days. Answers are provided on a five-point Likert-like scale including the options \u201cnever,\u201d \u201crarely (once),\u201d \u201csometimes (two or three times),\u201d \u201coften (about once a day),\u201d and \u201cvery often (several times a day).\u201d The item bank provides a total of 18 questions loading on a single latent construct (applied cognition) and allows for selection of items of highest relevance to a target population with the recommendation to use at least eight items in order to reliably estimate the ability reflected by the latent construct.\n23\nThe 11 items used in this study (\nTable 1\n) were pilot tested on former professional ASF players prior to inclusion in the initial intake questionnaire.\nTable 1.\nFrequency (%) of Self-Reported Concerns Regarding Cognitive Function in 3758 Former Professional American-Style Football Players Captured with 11 Questions from the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QOL) Item Bank v1.0 for Applied Cognition: General Concerns\na\nItem\nNever\nRarely (once)\nSometimes (2\u20133 times)\nOften (about once a day)\nVery often (several times a day)\nIn the past 7 days,\n1.

Total values of <3758 for a question indicate missing responses.\n\nMental health\nRespondents were defined as having depression, anxiety, memory loss, or attention deficit(/hyperactivity) disorder (ADD/ADHD), if they reported currently taking medication prescribed by a healthcare professional for the treatment of that disorder. We chose this conservative definition, as there are common misconceptions regarding mental health diagnoses among the general population.\n24\nIn addition, we assessed the correlation between cognitive symptoms and self-reported current symptoms of depression and/or anxiety using sum scores on the Neuro-QOL and the Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety (PHQ-4). The four-item PHQ-4 represents a screening tool for depression and anxiety in outpatient or home settings. Based on self-reported symptom presence over the past 2 weeks on a four-point Likert-like scale from 0 (\u201cnot at all\u201d) to 3 (\u201cnearly every day\u201d), the sum score distinguishes between no (0\u20132), mild (3\u20135), moderate (6\u20138), and severe (9\u201312) depression and/or anxiety, providing a quantitative measure of current symptom severity in addition to the more conservative definition of medical management.\n25\nFinally, we used the established cutoff of a PHQ-4 score of \u22656 for a positive screening result for current depressive and/or anxiety symptoms (moderate to severe symptoms).\n26\n\nQuality of life\nQuality of life was assessed employing the widely used Global Health Scale 10-Item Bank v1.0/1.1 of the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS\n\u00ae\n).\n27\nThe items for general quality of life (Global02), mental health (Global04), satisfaction with social activities and relationships (Global05), and emotional problems (Global10) were answered on a five-point Likert-like scale with the categories \u201cpoor,\u201d \u201cfair,\u201d \u201cgood,\u201d \u201cvery good,\u201d and \u201cexcellent.\u201d\n\nOther measures\nAlcohol use was measured by the number of alcoholic beverages (i.e., 12 oz. of beer, 5 oz. of wine, or one shot [2 cL] of alcohol, such as gin, rum, or vodka) consumed weekly. The measure was created based on two questions that asked about (1) the number of days a participant drank alcoholic beverages during a typical week and (2) the number of drinks consumed on a typical day that the person drank. Frequent drinking was defined as consuming \u226515 alcoholic beverages weekly, which is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's classification for heavy drinking.\n28\nAge, height, weight, race (American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian, black/African American, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, white, and other), ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino: yes/no), currently employed (yes, in football, yes, outside of football, retired, and no), domestic status (living with partner: yes/no), seasons of professional football played, position played (positions mirroring each other on the offense and defense were grouped together as appropriate, taking into account the type and number of physical impacts and body composition of the player: offensive/defensive lineman, linebacker, defensive back/wide receiver, running back, tight end, quarterback, kicker/punter), current cigarette use (yes/no), and diagnosis of sleep apnea (yes/no) were self-reported. For race and position played, participants could mark all options that applied.\nExercise regimen was assessed by self-reported weekly engagement in the following types of exercise: walking for exercise, jogging, running, other aerobic (e.g., bicycling, stationary/elliptical machine/other), low-intensity exercise (e.g., yoga, Pilates, stretching), and weight training (e.g., lifting free weights, using weight machines). Low level of exercise was defined conservatively as engaging in <1\u2009h of accumulated exercise activity weekly.\n\nData analysis\nOutlier values were corrected where possible using publicly available data (e.g., for years played in the NFL) or were set to missing. For all analyses concerning cognitive function, participants were included only if they provided valid responses to at least 8 out of the 11 Neuro-QOL items, resulting in a final sample of 3758 former professional players.\nBased on their responses to the Neuro-QOL items, respondents were divided into two groups: (1) former professional players who reported at least one daily problem with their applied cognitive abilities and (2) former professional players who did not report such daily concerns, and group differences were assessed using the \u03c7\n2\ntest. For mental health outcomes, odds ratios adjusted (aOR) for age and sleep apnea, variables known to affect cognitive function,\n29\n,\n30\nwere determined using logistical regression analyses. In addition, to test whether more severe cognitive symptoms are associated with more depressive and/or anxiety symptoms among those with a diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety, we conducted a nonparametric correlation analysis of Neuro-QOL and PHQ-4 sum scores in this subgroup. Finally, we examined the relevance of the presence of current depression and/or anxiety for the depression/anxiety and cognitive function link. Using \u03c7\n2\ntests, we compared how many former professional players with a diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety but no current moderate to severe symptoms of depression and/or anxiety (PHQ-4\u2009<\u20096) reported daily cognitive concerns (%) with that number among (1) former professional players with a diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety and current depression and/or anxiety (PHQ-4\u2009\u2265\u20096) and (2) former professional players without a diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety and no current moderate or severe depressive and/or anxiety symptoms (PHQ-4\u2009<\u20096)."

    "Methods": "Samples and subjects\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (NMRC#2011.0002; WRAIR#1796). The present study obtained samples from 34 healthy, male participants at U.S. Army explosive entry training sites (special operations and combat engineer courses). Biological specimens for epigenetics and transcriptional studies were collected at the start (baseline) and at the end of the training course (pre- vs. post-blast exposure), and serum samples for inflammatory analyses were collected daily. Demographic information, including sex, age, lifetime operational exposure to blast, as well as self-reported traumatic brain injury (TBI) history, were recorded at the start of the training. During the course of the training, self-report symptom assessments were completed daily.\n\nDNA methylation sample processing and quality control\nBlood was collected using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tubes and processed to separate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PBMCs were purified by Ficoll gradient, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. DNA was extracted with the QIAamp DNA Micro Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Genomic DNA was bisulfite converted (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA), and CpG methylation was determined using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylationBeadChip microarrays (HM450; Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA), as described previously.\n22\nData and quality-control (QC) analyses were performed using R Language 3.03 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria),\n23\nan environment for statistical computing, and Bioconductor 2.13.\n24\nRaw data files (.idat) were processed by the minfi package.\n25\nAll samples displayed a mean probe-wise detection call for the 485512 array probes <0.0005 (\nSupplementary Fig. S1\n). Sex QC analysis also confirmed methylation-based sex prediction with those reported (\nSupplementary Fig. S2\n). For QC sample tracking of pre- versus post-breacher training, we used the 65 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) probes included in the HumanMethylation 450k BeadChip, confirming that subjects for which multiple samples were available grouped together (\nSupplementary Fig. S3\n).\n\nDNA methylation data analysis\nFor all DNA methylation analyses, we used the matrix of M-values (logit transformation of beta-values), which correspond to methylation levels. Surrogate variable analysis (SVA) was performed to add surrogate variables and rule out potential batch effects. A linear model was used for the binary variable of interest, while including age and history of TBI as covariates in the model. Performing the comparative analysis in limma\n26\nimplemented in R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing), we obtained\nt\n-statistics and associated\np\nvalues for each CpG site. The point-wise\np\nvalues were then used for the identification of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) using the combined\np\n-value tool.\n27\n\nTotal RNA sample/library preparation and sequencing\nBlood was collected using Paxgene RNA tubes (PreAnalytiX; QIAGEN/BD, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. RNA was extracted with the Paxgene Blood RNA Kit (PreAnalytiX; QIAGEN/BD). Globin messenger RNA (mRNA) was removed with the Globin Clear Human Globin mRNA Removal kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). All RNA samples had RNA integrity numbers \u22656.0. Total RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the Illumina Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Kit with Ribo-Zero Gold (Illumina, Inc.), in accord with the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 290\u2013500\u2009ng of total RNA was used for ribosomal depletion and fragmented by divalent cations under elevated temperatures.\nFragmented RNA underwent first strand synthesis using reverse-transcriptase and random primers followed by second strand synthesis to generate complementary DNA (cDNA). The cDNA fragments underwent end repair, adenylation, and ligation of Illumina sequencing adapters. The cDNA library was enriched using 11 cycles of polymerase chain reaction and purified. Final libraries were evaluated using PicoGreen (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencer (v4 chemistry) using 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009125-base-pair read lengths.\n\nRNA-sequencing data preprocessing and bioinformatics analysis\nReads were aligned to the human reference hg19 using STAR aligner (v2.4.0c).\n28\nQuantification of genes annotated in Gencode v18 was performed using featureCounts (v1.4.3). QC metrics were collected with Picard (v1.83) and RSeQC\n29\n(\nhttp://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/\n). Normalization of feature counts was done. Further, for gene expression analysis, we used the voom function in limma to get logCPM (log counts per minute) matrix, where the design matrix consists of intercept, age, history of TBI, and variable of interest. We used SVA to rule out potential batch effects. Analyses were performed in limma, and point-wise as well as multiple testing adjusted\np\nvalues are reported.\n\nGene Ontology and gene set enrichment analyses\nWe performed Gene Ontology (GO) analysis using the goseq R package, with gene length bias considered. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) version 3.0\n30\nwas run on our ranked list of 8157 genes, which is filtered from the logCPM matrix obtained in pre-post analysis by criteria that average logCPM is \u22654 in either of the comparison groups considered here, and ordered by\nt\n-statistics. GSEA pre-ranked was run with 1000 permutations using gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database (MsigDB)\n31\nas follows: 1) GO gene sets (C5) including biological processes (BP), cellular components (CC), and molecular function (MF) and 2) hallmark gene set (H).\n\nCytokine sample processing by Luminex\nFor assays of inflammatory cytokines, we used the Luminex 63-Plex assay (eBiosciences/Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA), which has the ability to multi-plex, measuring levels of 63 inflammatory cytokines simultaneously. Assays were performed by the Human Immune Monitoring Center at Stanford University (Stanford, CA), and kits were used according to the manufacturer's recommendations, with modifications, as described here briefly. Beads were added to a 96-well plate and washed in a BioTek Elx405 washer (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). Serum samples were added to the plate containing the mixed antibody-linked beads and incubated at room temperature for 1\u2009h followed by overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C with shaking. Cold and room temperature incubation steps were performed on an orbital shaker at 500\u2013600\u2009rpm.\nAfter the overnight incubation, plates were washed in a BioTek Elx405 washer, and then biotinylated detection antibody was added for 75\u2009min at room temperature with shaking. Plates were washed as above and streptavidin-phycoerythrin was added. After incubation for 30\u2009min at room temperature, a wash was performed as above and reading buffer was added to the wells. Each sample was measured in duplicate. Plates were read using a Luminex 200 instrument (Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA) with a lower bound of 50 beads per sample per cytokine. Custom assay control beads by Radix Biosolutions (Georgetown, TX) were added to all wells.\n\nCytokine data analysis\nCytokine data were available for a subset of subjects, for 5 days: day 4, day 7, day 8, day 9, and day 10. Two levels were taken for each subject for each day, and all values were analyzed. All cytokine levels were log-transformed and then graphed. Given that outliers were present in many of the cytokines, values were capped (winsorized) from both below and above, at the lower quartile minus 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR), and the upper quartile plus 1.5 times the IQR, respectively. Separate mixed-effect models were fit for each log-transformed and capped cytokine measure, with day as fixed, categorical predictor, and subject-specific random intercepts.\np\nvalues for each level of the fixed effect were recorded and corrected for multiple testing (for K\u2009=\u200963 cytokines) using the Bonferroni method. To calculate standardized effect sizes for the contrast of each experimental day compared to the baseline, the model coefficients were divided by the standard deviation (SD) of the baseline measure, with the scaleless effect sizes then represented by heatmap plots."

Animals were kept individually under a 12-h light/dark cycle, for a week for acclimatization prior to the experiment. Prior to surgery, each rat was maintained on a five-pellet (approximately 20\u201325\u2009g) per day diet (Purina Mill Lad Diet: Prolab RMH 3000), and water was provided\nad libitum.\nFood and water were given\nad libitum\nafter the surgical procedures. Rats were randomly assigned into one of four groups: sham, HH, PBBI, and PBBI combined with HH (PHH), with a sample size of 10 per group per time-point. Baseline measurements were done in the same rats (\nn\n=\u200950/group; 10\u2009\u00d7\u20095 time-points) that were used for injuries.\n\nPBBI\nIn all animals, anesthesia was induced with 3% isoflurane, reduced to 2.5% for the initial surgeries, and maintained at 1.5% for the remaining procedures in a breathing air/oxygen mixture (fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO\n2\n]\u2009=\u20090.26). The right femoral artery and vein were cannulated for blood pressure monitoring and fluid resuscitation, respectively. In addition, the tail artery was cannulated for inducing hemorrhagic shock by withdrawing blood. All the animal surgery procedures were done in an aseptic manner. Care was taken to sanitize the PBBI probes in between multiple surgeries. The animal head was then fixed on a stereotaxic apparatus. Prior to all surgical incisions, lidocaine was injected subcutaneously near the surgical site.\nFollowing a midline incision, the skull was exposed, the craniotomy location was marked on the cranium (+4.5\u2009mm anterio-posterior, +2\u2009mm medio-lateral from bregma) and a cranial window was created using a hand-held drill. PBBI was induced using a simulated ballistic injury device (Mitre Corp., McLean, VA) with a specially designed stainless steel probe (Popper & Sons Inc., Hyde Park, NY). The probe was mounted to a stereotaxic arm at an angle of 50\u00b0 from the vertical axis and 25\u00b0 counter-clockwise from the anterior-posterior axis. It was then manually inserted through the right frontal cortex via a cranial window to a distance of 12\u2009mm (from dura). The elastic tubing on the probe was inflated by a rapid (< 40\u2009msec) water pressure pulse, forming an elliptical balloon calibrated to 10% of the total rat brain volume to produce an intracerebral temporary cavity. The probe was then gently retracted and the cranial opening was sealed with sterile bone wax, and the incision was closed by wound clips.\n16\nDuring the surgery procedure, blood pressure (at femoral artery using a research grade blood pressure transducer; Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA), rectal temperature, heart rate and breathing were continuously monitored and recorded using a data acquisition system (PowerLab, AD instruments, Colorado Springs, CO). Animals in the sham control and HH groups received craniotomy only (no probe insertion or balloon expansion).\n\nPolytrauma: combined PBBI, hypoxemia, and hemorrhagic shock\nHypoxemia (HX) was initiated 5\u2009min after baseline recording or PBBI and maintained for 30\u2009min in the HH or polytrauma (PHH) groups. HX was induced by replacing air with nitrogen in the inhalation gas mixture until the F\ni\nO\n2\nreached 0.1 (monitored by respiratory gas analyzer). At the end of HX, blood gas was measured (ABL5, Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark) to ensure the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (P\na\nO\n2\n) dropped below 40\u2009mm Hg. Normoxia (F\ni\nO\n2\n=\u20090.26) was restored by switching the nitrogen back to breathing air. Hemorrhagic shock (HS) was then induced by withdrawing blood via the tail arterial catheter using a withdrawal pump (Harvard Apparatus) at a constant rate of 0.25\u2009mL/100\u2009g/min to reduce mean arterial pressure (MAP) to 30\u201345\u2009mm Hg. The hypotensive state was maintained for 30\u2009min. Lactated Ringer's solution [LRS] Hospira, Lake Forest, IL) was given if MAP dropped below 30\u2009mm Hg during the 30-min HS phase. At the end of the HS phase, LRS (three times the blood volume withdrawn) was infused at a rate of 0.9\u2009mL/min (fluid resuscitation phase). After fluid resuscitation, all catheters were removed, and incisions were closed with sutures. Animals in the sham control group received the same procedures that the injury groups did, except for the injuries and fluid resuscitation.\n\nFood and water intake and urine output\nOne day prior to injury and at the specified end-points (1 day, 2 days, 7 days, 14 days, and 28 days post-injury), animals were placed in metabolic cages (Harvard Apparatus) in which food (grams of chow consumed over 6\u2009h) and water intake, as well as urine output were recorded. All rats were placed in metabolic cages for about 6\u2009h (started approximately at 08:30 and ended at 14:30). After 6\u2009h was over, rats were removed from the metabolic cages and returned to their home cages. Urine, remaining water, and remaining rat chow were measured and recorded. If rats had not yet urinated after 6\u2009h, they were tickled gently to induce urination. Urine was collected to a chilled collection cup placed on ice and centrifuged at 5000\u2009rpm for 5\u2009min at 4\u00b0C, to remove any undissolved material, and supernatant was stored at -80\u00b0C, until subsequent processing/analyses.\n\nSample collection\nFor each time-point, separate cohorts were used. One day prior to injury, blood and urine samples were collected for baseline analysis. Baseline blood sample was collected through the tail artery prior to the injuries. At the specified end-points (1 day, 2 days, 7 days, 14 days, and 28 days post-injury), a terminal cardiac puncture was performed, and blood samples were collected for serum separation and subsequently, tissue samples from liver, kidney, and heart were collected and processed for various analyses.\n\nCreatinine assay\nUrine creatinine was measured using creatinine assay kit (MAK080; Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St Louis, MO) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, samples were passed through 10 KDa cut off filter to sieve out unwanted proteins. The urine creatinine concentration was measured by a colorimetric assay at 530\u2009nm using a microplate reader (Synergy MX; Biotek Instruments Inc., VT). Serum creatinine concentration was measured with a serum-specific assay (700460; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), according to the manufacturer's protocol. This kit uses Jaffe's reaction, where picric acid in an alkaline condition reacts with creatinine to give a concentration dependent color.\n\nHeart and liver mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase assay\nAt the end of each experiment, animals were anesthetized with a mixture of 70\u2009mg/kg ketamine and 6\u2009mg/kg xylazine and euthanized by decapitation. Peripheral organs including heart, liver, and kidney were collected immediately for biochemical analysis. Mitochondria were isolated from the heart and liver tissue in ice-cold isolation buffer (215\u2009mM mannitol, 75\u2009mM sucrose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 20\u2009mM HEPES with/without 1\u2009mM EGTA, pH 7.2). The mitochondrial protein concentration was determined using the Pierce\u2122 BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Complex IV activity was assessed using a kinetic assay (K287; BioVision Incorporated, Milpitas, CA). The cytochrome oxidase activity (Units/mg) was calculated using the equation \u0394OD/time (\u0394t)\u00f7\u025bX protein (mg) where: \u0394OD is the difference in OD at time t1 and time t2 and \u0394t is the difference in time (t1 - t2; in min). \u03b5 is the molar extinction coefficient of reduced cytochrome C at 550\u2009nm (i.e., 7.04\u2009mM\n\u22121\ncm\n\u22121\n). Protein is the concentration of sample (mg) used per reaction.\n\nLiver and kidney SOD activity assay\nSOD activity in the liver and kidney tissues was assessed using a SOD determination kit (19160; Sigma-Aldrich Corp.). Tissue was sonicated in lysis buffer (0.25\u2009M sucrose, 10\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1\u2009mM EDTA) centrifuged, and the supernatant collected for the SOD assay. In the presence of a reducing superoxide anion, WST-1, a highly water-soluble tetrazolium salt, is reduced to a water-soluble WST-1 formazan dye. The rate of reduction with oxygen is linearly correlated with the xanthine oxidase activity, which is inhibited by SOD. Therefore, the 50% inhibition activity of SOD can be determined by colorimetric method. Since the absorbance at 440\u2009nm is proportional to the amount of superoxide anion, the SOD activity, as an inhibition activity, could be quantified by measuring the decrease in the color development at 440\u2009nm.\n\nLiver and kidney GSH/GSSG assays\nReduced (GSH) to oxidized (GSSG) glutathione ratio in the liver and kidney tissues was determined using a commercially available quantification kit (G257-10; Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD). A fixed amount of tissue (1\u2009g) was homogenized in 1ml of 5% sulfosalicylic acid. Homogenate was centrifuged at 8000\u2009g for 10\u2009min and the supernatant was diluted with deionized water. Total glutathione (GSH and GSSG) and GSSG in the supernatant were measured using a microplate reader at 412\u2009nm. The amount of GSH was determined by subtracting the amount of GSSG from the total glutathione.\n\nHepatic glycogen\nHepatic glycogen level was measured using a commercially available assay kit (ab65620; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) per the manufacturer's instructions. The tissue sample was weighed and homogenized in distilled water using a tissue homogenizer. The homogenate was kept on a boiling water bath for 10\u2009min and quick chilled on ice, followed by 20-min centrifugation at 17,000\u2009g. Glycogen level in the supernatant was determined based on the hydrolysis of glycogen to glucose catalyzed by glucoamylase in the assay.\n\nQuantitative SAA1 Western blotting\nSAA1 level in the blood serum was measured using an automated Western blotting system (Peggy Sue\u2122; Protein Simple, San Jose, CA). Both baseline and post-injury serum samples (5 uL) were mixed with buffer containing SDS, dithiothreitol, and fluorescent molecular weight standards. Heat denatured samples were loaded onto a microplate along with stacking and separation matrices, blocking and wash buffers, antibody (Rabbit polyclonal -SAA1 from Origene, 1:50, and secondary antibody 1:1000 from Protein Simple) and detection reagents. The Simple Western System loads samples and reagents automatically into the capillaries and proteins are separated by size as they go through the stacking and separating matrices. Separated proteins are then immobilized in the capillaries using ultraviolet method and are then blocked and incubated with primary antibody. Detection was done using horseradish peroxidase\u2013conjugated secondary antibodies and chemiluminescent substrate. Following detection, analysis and quantification was performed using Compass software. The SAA1 protein was quantitated based on the area under the curve of each band.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe sample size is determined by power analysis (power\u2009=\u20090.8; alpha\u2009=\u20090.05) using G*Power 3 (Germany) based on the means and standard derivations of our preliminary data. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 6.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) and SPSS v22 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess data normality (SPSS). Grubbs test was performed to identify outliers (GraphPad Prism) and we did not find outliers in any datasets presented in this manuscript. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey's honestly significant difference or Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test, was used for data analysis at each time-point. The significance criterion was set at\np\n<\u20090.05. Data are presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM)."

    "Methods": "Animals\nFor our studies, 21\u2009\u00b1\u20093-day-old male and female C57BL/6J weanlings bred in-house were used. Average weight on day of craniectomy was 9.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5\u2009g for males and 8.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3\u2009g for females. Mice were housed in the Animal Care Facility at the University of Iowa (Iowa City, IA) under a 12-h light-dark cycle with\nad libitum\naccess to food and water. After craniectomy and FPI, mice remained singly caged. All procedures performed in this study were in accord with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Iowa.\n\nLateral fluid percussion injury\nOn the day preceding injury, mice underwent craniectomy. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (87\u2009mg/kg of ketamine/12\u2009mg/kg of xylazine) by intraperitoneal injection. The head was then mounted in a stereotactic frame, and a midline incision of the scalp was made for reflection of the skin and exposure of underlying skull. A thin (1\u20132\u2009mm) disc of weed trimmer line was glued to the skull using cyanoacrylate superglue, centered between lambda and bregma sutures, and between lateral skull edge and sagittal suture. This served for stabilization of the hand-held trephine. A 3.0-mm outer diameter trephine (University of Pennsylvania Machine Shop) was used for craniectomy, but with an important modification. To prevent compression of the thin, pliable, immature skull, the handle of the trephine was removed, thereby decreasing its weight from 28 to 1.5\u2009g. In the absence of the trephine handle, a stereotactic frame was used for stabilization of the distal end of the trephine shaft while the adherent plastic disc stabilized the proximal end, allowing for manual spinning of the trephine.\nAfter sufficient drilling, the bone flap was gently removed by gripping the adherent plastic disc with small forceps. This creates a 3-mm craniectomy centered on the left parietal skull bone. A modified Luer-Lock hub was placed surrounding the craniectomy site and secured with cyanoacrylate glue. The hub was further secured with methyl-methacrylate dental cement (Jet Acrylic Liquid mixed with Perm Reline/Repair Resin) surrounding the bottom portion of the hub. The hub was filled with sterile saline and closed with a sterile intravenous cap to prevent exposure of the underlying dura to the environment until time of FPI. Mice recovered in a heated recovery cage until mobile. The following day, mice underwent FPI. Pendulum angle of the FPI device was adjusted before each experimental group to achieve a peak pressure between 1.1 and 1.3 atmospheres (atm) when triggered against capped intravenous tubing. For experiments in this study, the pendulum angle varied between 9.8 and 11 degrees. Mice received 3% inhaled isoflurane in an induction chamber before being transferred to a nose cone, where the intravenous cap was removed and any air bubbles in the hub were eliminated.\nOnce deeply anesthetized, mice were connected to the FPI device by 20-inch, 3-mm diameter intravenous tubing and placed on their right side. The pendulum was released, generating a brief fluid pulse against the exposed dura. Peak pressure of fluid pulse was measured for every FPI animal using a Tektronix digital oscilloscope (TDS460A; Tektronix, Inc., Beaverton, OR). After injury, mice were placed on their backs and their righting time was measured as an indicator of injury severity. After righting, mice were reanesthetized with isoflurane, the Luer-Lock hub was removed, and the skin incision was sutured closed. Mice receiving sham injury underwent identical treatment through connection to the FPI device. Sham mice were then disconnected without triggering the FPI device and righting reflex was measured. After skin closure, anesthesia was discontinued and animals were placed in a heated cage until recovered and ambulatory. Given that we were interested in studying moderate-to-severe TBI, FPI mice were included only if righting reflex was >5\u2009min.\n12\u201314\nAcross all studies, the average righting time after FPI was 11.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u2009min, which corresponded to an average peak pressure delivered of 1.29 atm.\n\nReal-time polymerase chain reaction\nFour and 24\u2009h after sham or FPI, juvenile mice were euthanized with isoflurane, followed by decapitation and removal of brains. Brain tissue was dissected and collected by region (left and right parietal cortex, left and right hippocampus, and brainstem) and snap-frozen on liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction; 4\u2009h: male sham (\nn\n=\u20096), male FPI (\nn\n=\u20097), female sham (\nn\n=\u20097), and female FPI (\nn\n=\u20097); 24\u2009h: male sham (\nn\n=\u20096), male FPI (\nn\n=\u20098), female sham (\nn\n=\u20097), and female FPI (\nn\n=\u20099\u201310).\nTotal RNA was extracted from sham or FPI brain regions using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as per the manufacturer's instructions. RNA yield and purity were evaluated using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. First-strand complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized with SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Amplified cDNAs were diluted 1:15 in ultra-pure water and subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on an Applied Biosystems Model 7900HT with TaqMan Universal PCR Mastermix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and the following probes: interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 (Mm00434228_m1); IL-6 (Mm00446190_m1); tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1; Mm00443258_m1); and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; 4308313). PCR reactions were conducted as follows: 2\u2009min at 50\u00b0C, 10\u2009min at 95\u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles for amplification at 95\u00b0C for 15\u2009sec and 60\u00b0C for 60\u2009sec. Biological samples were run in duplicate or triplicate. Genes of interest were normalized to endogenous control GAPDH. Data were analyzed using the comparative cycle threshold method, and results are expressed as fold difference from sham controls.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nOne and 21 days after sham or FPI, mice were deeply anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1\u2009M of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Brains were extracted and immersed in the same fixative overnight. Brains were then paraffin-embedded, 6-\u03bcm coronal sections were cut with a rotary microtome, and sections were mounted on Plus slides. Slides were rehydrated through xylene and graded alcohols, then washed with distilled water. Antigen retrieval was performed, after which slides were cooled for 20\u2009min at room temperature and washed twice with DAKO 1\u00d7 buffer (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 8\u2009min at room temperature, then washed twice with DAKO buffer. Blocking of non-specific antibody staining was done with avidin and biotin blocking solutions, each for 15\u2009min.\nSlides were then incubated with the following primary antibodies: 1) rabbit monoclonal anti\u2013amyloid precursor protein (bAPP; 1:15,000, Abcam ab32136; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) for 30\u2009min at room temperature and 2) rabbit polyclonal anti-Iba1 (ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1; 1:500, Wako, 019-1974; Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA) for 60\u2009min at room temperature. After washing, Dako Rabbit Envision was applied for 30\u2009min, followed by Dako DAB (3,3\u2019-diaminobenzidine) Plus for 5\u2009min and Dako DAB enhancer for 3\u2009min, all at room temperature. Slides were rinsed with distilled water and counterstained with hematoxylin.\n\nQuantification of immunohistochemistry\nAutomated quantification of the extent of axonal injury within regions of interest (ROIs) was performed using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD) to calculate the proportional area with bAPP-stained axon bulbs and varicosities. An average of three sections within the lesion were analyzed for each animal, spaced 600 um apart, extending from approximately bregma \u22121.0\u2009mm to \u22123.0\u2009mm. The ROI analyzed was the fiber tracts running between the cortex and hippocampal formation, including the corpus callosum and external capsule. For all sections, the midline served as the medial border of the ROI. For the rostral-most section, a line drawn horizontally between the fimbria and stria terminalis and extending to the corpus callosum served as the lateral border of the ROI. For the middle section, the lateral border of the ROI was defined by a horizontal line between the hippocampal formation and the thalamus extending to the corpus callosum. Finally, for the caudal-most section, the lateral border of the ROI was defined by a horizontal line drawn from the inferior portion of the dentate gyrus to the external capsule. Images obtained with an Olympus BX-61 microscope or Olympus VS120 slide scanner (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) were transferred to ImageJ and converted to grayscale images. Next, our ROI was outlined and manual thresholding was used to isolate the bAPP positively stained injured axons. Finally, the thresholded area within our defined ROI was measured using the analyze particles tool.\nSimilarly, while assessing neuroinflammation after FPI, we used automated quantification of Iba1-stained microglia/macrophages within defined ROIs. An average of three slides were used per mouse spaced 600 um apart and regions analyzed included ipsilateral cortex, axonal fiber tracts including corpus callosum and external capsule, hippocampus, and thalamus. For the cortex and corpus callosum, ROI was defined by the midline medially and extending to the same lateral borders used for corpus callosum/fiber tracts as described above. For the hippocampus and thalamus, the entire hippocampal formation and thalamus were analyzed.\n\nLesion volume assessment\nSections from brains harvested at 1 and 21 days post-injury were used for analysis of lesion volume. As above, mice underwent the same process for formalin fixation and paraffin embedding. Coronal sections (6\u2009\u03bcm) were collected every 300\u2009\u03bcm, mounted on Plus slides, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for further analysis. An Olympus BX-61 microscope was used to image all sections. Lesion volume was calculated using sections encompassing the lesion from its anterior to posterior border, extending from approximately bregma \u22121.0\u2009mm to \u22123.0\u2009mm. Using ImageJ, the area of the injured and uninjured hemispheres were measured from each serial section and used to calculate hemispheric volumes. Percent volume loss was determined by comparison of injured to uninjured hemisphere as previously reported.\n15\n\nNeurobehavioral testing\nModified Neurologic Severity Score\nA composite measure of neurological function was utilized at serial time points after FPI (3, 24, and 48\u2009h). Function was graded on a scale of 0 to 10 based on motor and sensory tests and assessment of reflexes. Points are assigned for failure to complete tasks or absent reflexes so that higher scores indicate greater deficits. Motor tests included response to tail suspension (1 point each assigned for flexion of forelimb, flexion of hindlimb, and head movement greater than 10 degrees to vertical axis) and placement on a table (1 point each assigned for inability to walk straight, circling toward paretic side, and falling to paretic side). Sensory tests included placing test (1 point assigned if no forelimb placement in response to contralateral whisker stimulation) and proprioceptive test (1 point assigned if no forelimb resistance to contralateral lateral push). Reflexes included corneal (1 point assigned if lack of eye closure in response to touch with cotton swab) and startle (1 point assigned if lack of startle with loud hand clap).\n16\nAccelerating rotarod\nMotor function was assessed using an accelerating rotarod (Columbus Instruments Rotamex-5; Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). The speed of the rotarod was accelerated from 4 to 40\u2009rpm over 300\u2009sec, with an acceleration of 1.2\u2009rpm/10\u2009sec. Mice underwent three trials per day with a 15-min rest interval between trials on post-injury days 1, 2, 3, and 7. Latency to fall was recorded and averaged for the three trials.\nBarnes maze\nCognitive function was assessed using the Barnes maze. The Barnes maze consists of a gray circular table 91\u2009cm in diameter with 20 holes, 5\u2009cm in diameter, evenly spaced around the perimeter. The table was brightly lit and open, motivating the test subjects to learn the location of the dark escape box located under one of the 20 holes. A black curtain surrounded the Barnes maze, and four equally spaced visual cues were hung from the curtain positioned around the table. ANY-maze video tracking software (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL) was used for data collection. Two weeks after sham or FPI, acquisition trials were conducted (four trials per day) for 4 days, during which time an escape box was placed under the target hole. Each trial ended when the mouse entered the target hole or after 80\u2009sec had elapsed. Mice that did not locate the escape were guided to the target hole. All mice were allowed to remain in the escape box for 20\u2009sec. Average latency to the escape hole was recorded for each acquisition day. On day 5 of Barnes maze testing, a probe trial was conducted to assess hippocampal-dependent spatial memory. The escape box was removed from under the target hole and mice were placed in the maze for 60\u2009sec. Each mouse underwent one probe trial, during which the time spent in a 2-cm-diameter zone around the target hole was recorded.\n\nExperimental design and statistical analysis\nTest animals were randomly assigned to treatment group. The tester was blinded to sex and treatment. Data are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM). For cytokine expression, the unpaired\nt\n-test or Mann-Whitney U test were used depending on data distribution. For experiments requiring comparison of greater than two groups, data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Fisher's least significant difference (LSD0 or Dunn's test for multiple comparisons. For multi-day behavioral studies including Modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS), rotarod, and training phase of the Barnes maze, analysis was by repeated-measures two-way ANOVA. Treatment group (FPI vs. sham) was the between-subjects fixed factor, time was the repeated-measure fixed factor, and subject was the random factor. The interaction of time\u2009\u00d7\u2009treatment group was analyzed as well as main effects of time and treatment. If significant effects were detected in the interaction or in the main effects, post-hoc multiple comparison testing was done using Fisher's LSD. Statistical analysis was done using GraphPad Prism software (version 7.0; GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). A value of\np\n<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Study design\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using case-note review of TBI patients presenting to the ED between 2010 and 2017 at three major trauma centers in England: Hull University Teaching Hospital NHS Trust, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, and Addenbrooke's Hospital (Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust). A detailed study protocol has previously been published.\n6\nThe study was conducted and is reported in accordance with international guidelines for prognostic research.\n7\n\nStudy population\nPopulation selection\nWithin each study center ED, CT brain scan requests and reports were screened to identify patients with traumatic findings presenting between 2010 and 2017. Patients were matched to case records and if meeting the inclusion criteria data were extracted on patient deterioration outcomes and candidate predictors (see below).\n\nInclusion criteria\nPatients \u226516 years of age with a presenting GCS 13\u201315 who attended the ED after acute TBI and had injuries reported on CT brain scan were included. The latter was defined as: skull fractures, extradural haemorrhage, subdural haemorrhage with an acute component, intracerebral haemorrhage, contusions, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intraventricular hemorrhage. Intracerebral, intraventricular, and subarachnoid hemorrhages were considered traumatic in etiology when a mechanism of injury or injuries indicating trauma were recorded.\n\nExclusion criteria\nPatients were excluded where: a non-traumatic cause of intracranial hemorrhage was indicated, pre-existing CT abnormality prevented determining whether acute injury had occurred, and patients transferred from other hospitals.\n\nOutcomes\nPrimary outcome\nDeterioration up to 30 days after ED attendance was used, which was a composite including: death attributable to TBI, neurosurgery, seizure, a drop in GCS >1, intensive care unit (ICU) admission for TBI, intubation, or hospital readmission for TBI. Where reason for death, ICU admission, or readmission was unknown, it was attributed to TBI deterioration.\nSecondary outcome\nA composite measure indicating need for neurosurgical specialist admission was used, including: neurosurgery, ICU admission for TBI, or intubation up to 30 days after ED attendance.\n\nPredictors\nPre-injury anticoagulant and -platelet therapy were combined in a variable with two categories: 1) no therapy and 2) use of either or both medications (exploratory multi-variable modeling indicated they had similar effect sizes). Comorbidity was measured using the trauma modified Charlson comorbidity index.\n8\nRockwood Frailty Scale scores were assigned to patients >50 years of age using information in the case notes and data collapsed into established categories.\n9\n,\n10\nSupplementary Material 2\noutlines how injuries described in written CT reports were categorized. Injury severity was coded using the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS), injury size, and presence of midline shift or mass effect. AIS codes were mapped to the Marshall classification using the method described by Lesko and colleagues and the description of midline shift.\n11\nAn additional category of severity of up to two injuries with a combined maximal diameter <5\u2009mm was added. TBI severity, as measured by the Marshall classification,\n11\nwas assessed for inclusion in the final model alongside type of hemorrhage, contusion or skull fracture present, and total number of injuries. This allowed the independent predictive value of each of these components of the CT scan to be simultaneously assessed.\n\nSample size\nA sample size requirement of 2000 patients was calculated using an estimated prevalence of deterioration of 10%.\n6\nInterim analysis found the actual prevalence of deterioration to be around 25%. Therefore, the target was revised to 1700 patients, equating to 425 events and allowing 42 candidate factors to be assessed on the basis of 10 events per factor.\n12\n\nStatistical analysis\nModel selection\nThe primary and secondary outcomes of deterioration were modelled as binary variables using logistic regression.\n13\nWe used stepwise selection to find the smallest number of candidate explanatory variables that accurately predict deterioration.\nTables 1\nand\n\u200b\nand2\n2\nsummarize how candidate variables were included in modeling.

Where medication use was undocumented, it was taken to indicate no pre-injury use. For other variables, we assumed missing data occurred at random. Twenty-five imputed data sets were created (based on missing data in around 25% of cases) using chained equations including all candidate variables and outcomes in the ICE STATA package (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).\n14\nThe midiagplots STATA function was used to compare the distributions of observed and imputed data.\n15\nWhere continuous variables were non-normally distributed and implausible, imputed values were generated; predictive mean matching was used.\n14\nModel selection was performed using multi-variable backward elimination with a statistical significance threshold of 0.1. All candidate predictors were initially included and imputed data sets combined using Rubin's rules at each stage of model selection. For candidate continuous variables, rather than assume a linear relationships, the best predictive form was explored with the MFPMI function using backward elimination for fractional polynomial functions in multi-variable modeling.\n16\n,\n17\nFractional polynomials were limited to 2 degrees of freedom when predicting the secondary outcome.\nModel performance\nModel fit was assessed using the Briers score averaged across imputed data sets.\n18\nA score of 0 implies perfect prediction and 0.25 no predictive value.\nModel discrimination (how well patients with and without deterioration were distinguished) was assessed by the C-statistic, measured by combing estimates across imputed data sets using Rubin's rules.\n17\n,\n19\nCalibration measures how well predictions made by models match observations.\n13\nThe calibration slope of selected predictors was calculated in each imputed data set and averaged.\nSensitivity analysis\nModel selection and evaluation of model performance were repeated in patients with complete data.\nInternal validation\nModels tend to perform better on data from which they are derived (overfitting).\n13\nBootstrap internal validation with 100 bootstrap samples was performed in each imputed data set to calculate the average optimism. Model selection was repeated in each bootstrap sample, and performance of models selected was subtracted by performance in the original data set.\n20\n,\n21\nThe pooled average difference in the calibration slope between the bootstrap samples and original data was averaged across imputed data sets. This was subtracted from the original averaged calibration slope to estimate the shrinkage factor. The shrinkage factor was applied to the derived model coefficients to adjust for optimism.\n13\nThe C statistic was adjusted for optimism using the same method.\nMild traumatic brain injury risk score development and comparison to the Brain Injury Guideline criteria\nTo use our prognostic model for making clinical decisions, we derived a risk score using optimism-adjusted coefficients.\n22\nTo make the risk score clinically interpretable, coefficients were standardised and rounded.\n22\nIndividual patient risk scores were calculated. A risk score for ED discharge was proposed based on the trade-off between risk of deterioration in a discharged patient and number of patients admitted for observation.\nSensitivity and specificity of the proposed discharge score and of the BIG criteria to deterioration were calculated and compared in patients with complete data for both criteria.\n\nEthics\nNHS Research Ethics Committee Approval was granted by West of Scotland REC 4 reference: 17/WS/0204.

    "Methods": "Participants\nThirty-six Division I student-athletes (18 SRC and 18 nearly matched controls) participated (age: 18\u2009\u00b1\u20091 years; gender: 7 male, 9 female; height: 174\u2009\u00b1\u200911\u2009cm; weight: 72\u2009\u00b1\u200920\u2009kg). Participants were divided into two groups: 1) those who were diagnosed with an acute SRC within 24\u201348\u2009h, and 2) a nearly matched control (CON) group (sport, position, age, sex). The concussion diagnosis was determined by the head team physician within 24\u2009h of the incident using somatic, cognitive, or physical self-reported symptoms following an appropriate mechanism (head or body trauma), as well as the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool-5th edition (SCAT5).\n3\n,\n33\nAll student-athletes were recruited to participate in this study via a collaboration between the testing facility and the sports medicine staff. These data were collected alongside a larger research study, which the student-athletes participated in on a volunteer basis. Student-athletes were excluded if they self-reported any pre-injury vestibular, visual (excluding corrected myopia or hyperopia via lenses), metabolic, neurological pathology (excluding the existing concussion), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, learning disabilities, and lower-extremity injury that impaired the ability to maintain upright stance. All student-athletes self-reported being able to clearly see and discern the visual stimuli. All participants signed informed consent documents and all protocols were approved by the University of Nevada, Reno Institutional Review Board.\n\nProcedures\nParticipants completed two blocks (\u22482\u2009min per block) of the Wii Fit\n\u00a9\nsoccer heading game (WF) while wearing a head-mounted monocular eye tracker (H7, 240\u2009Hz, 0.05 degrees precision; Applied Science Laboratory, Medford, MA). The full procedure of this examination has been published in detail in prior articles.\n7\n,\n8\nBefore the task a 9-point calibration procedure was completed. Stimuli were presented on a 55-in LED TV (48.82\u2009\u00d7\u200928.62 in, 1920 x 1080 pixels, Sharp Aquos HD LED Smart TV; Sharp Electronics Corp., Mahwah, NJ) with the individual 55 in from the screen standing on a Wii Balance Board\n\u00a9\n. Participants were instructed to interact with the approaching stimulus (soccer ball, 1.25\u2009Hz) while avoiding distractors (panda heads and cleats). Stimuli traveled a total horizontal displacement of 472 pixels (\u223c21 in). Game score was not incorporated in analyses due to the presence of a lower ceiling effect.\n\nData analysis\nSaccade analysis\nGaze coordinates (eye + head) were exported to MATLAB R2018a (MATLAB 2010; MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA). The data were transformed into azimuth and elevation. Next, we applied a 5 data-point linear interpolation and a 13 sliding data-point boxcar filter. The filtered data were then differenced across 50\u201383\u2009msec temporal windows, to identify saccade end-points and determine durations.\n34\nThese data were categorized into individual vectors that corresponded to the temporal window (i.e., gaze data at 50-msec window, 51-msec window, 52-msec window \u202680-msec window). These differenced saccadic data were included if they were within a predefined dispersion threshold (4 degrees \u2264 amplitude \u226530 degrees).\n34\n,\n35\nFrom these data, velocity data were calculated as the differenced dispersion datum (at each individual temporal window vector) divided by the temporal window length (i.e., 50\u201383\u2009msec) of that trial. These data were then filtered via a velocity threshold (75 degrees/sec \u2264 velocity \u2265500 degrees/sec).\n34\n,\n36\nThe velocity data from each temporal window were then concatenated into a 34-by-n matrix. An average was calculated across each column to obtain a 1-by-n vector of velocity data.\nThe same process was conducted for the amplitude data. From this, mean saccadic velocity (SV) was calculated as the average velocity across the vector, whereas mean saccadic amplitude (SA) was calculated as the average amplitude across the vector. Saccadic count (SC) was calculated as the length of each SV array. Typically, SV should be slower and less accurate in disease populations such as Parkinson's\n37\n; however, in SRC\n9\u201311\nthis is not always the case and is highly dependent upon the task. It is expected based on our prior research\n7\n,\n8\nthat the eye typically travels farther and faster during a sport-like task among those with an SRC compared with healthy controls. This may be a result of faster saccadic eye movements. Thus, increased SV is an expected abnormal outcome.\nSmooth pursuit analysis\nThe filtered azimuth and elevation data were parsed to exclude data below the temporal window threshold (<30\u2009msec); this removed microsaccades and fixations.\n34\n,\n38\nBecause SPEM does not have a set amplitude threshold, 10\u201330\u2009msec temporal windows also removed amplitudes below 0.66 degrees to filter out fixations and saccades.\n34\n,\n38\nA velocity threshold permitted data with velocities between 10 degrees/sec \u2264 and \u226530 degrees/sec.\n34\n,\n39\n,\n40\nWe calculated mean SPEM velocity (SPV) and mean SPEM amplitude (SPA) across the data time series. SPV was calculated as the average SPEM velocity across the vector, whereas the SPA was calculated as the average amplitude across the SPEM SPA vector.\nSPEMs are commonly less accurate (worse or smaller velocity gain),\n11\n,\n20\nlag behind the stimuli,\n9\n,\n20\nhave increased initiation latency,\n11\nand have few saccadic interruptions during pursuit.\n20\nFor analysis of these data, because we are unable to calculate gain (stimuli velocity is unknown) we expect in the SRC group slower SPV as the eye may be lagging behind the stimuli.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData were examined to ensure they conformed to normal distributions and were without influential skewness or kurtosis. After review, SPA and SC were considered non-normal for the SRC group. Therefore, two separate Mann-Whitney U tests were run to assess group differences (SRC, CON) for SPA and SC. A single multi-variate analysis of variance model (MANOVA) was used to assess group differences for the remaining measures of interest: SPV, SV, and SA. In the event of a significant interaction, the simple main effects for direction were tested based on independent\nt\ntests with appropriate Holm-Bonferroni corrections.\n41\nAll trials were averaged to get aggregate values for measures used. Significance was set at alpha\n=\n0.05 for all analyses."

The outcome measures such as the ISNCSCI protocol for the upper extremity motor score (UEMS) (e.g. pyramidal dysfunction), light touch, pinprick, SCIM, and the GRASSP protocol were applied in both SCI and DCM patients to enable the comparison between these two etiologies.\nThe local ethics committee of Zurich, Kantonale Ethikkommission Z\u00fcrich, approved the study (KEK-ZH-Nr. \u22122012-0343), and the study protocols were in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed written consent was obtained from each subject before participation.\n\nMRI measurements\nParticipants were positioned head-first supine and acquisitions were conducted on a 3T MRI system (SkyraFit Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). Radio Frequency (RF) excitation was performed using the body coil and detection was achieved using a combination of 12-channel head-coil, four-channel neck-coil, and 24-channel spine matrix. Subjects were stabilized with an MRI-compatible stifneck (Laerdal Medicals, Stavanger, Norway) to minimize motion artefact effects. As a result of motion artefacts, four patients (three tSCI patients and one DCM patients) and one control were excluded from microstructural assessment.\nAll participants underwent a protocol consisting of a T2*-weighted three-dimensional (3D) multi-echo sequence (multiple echo data image combination; MEDIC) and a diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequence based on the reduced-field of view (FOV) single-shot spin-echo echo planar imaging above the injury and stenosis level. Macrostructural cord neurodegeneration was assessed by determining gray and white matter in the cross-sectional area (SCA) of the cervical cord using T2*-weighted MRI. The T2*-weighted images resulted in five high-resolution axial 3D volumes of the cervical cord with a resolution of 0.25\u2009\u00d7\u20090.25\u2009\u00d7\u20092.50\u2009mm\n3\nwithin 2.8\u2009min acquisition time per volume. MRI parameters were as follows: FOV\u2009=\u2009162\u2009\u00d7\u2009192\u2009mm\n2\n, matrix size\u2009=\u2009648\u2009\u00d7\u2009768, repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u200944\u2009msec, echo time (TE)\u2009=\u200919\u2009msec, flip angle \u03b1\u2009=\u200911\u00b0, and read-out bandwidth\u2009=\u2009260\u2009Hz per pixel. To quantify microstructural changes of the spinal cord at the identical level, a high-resolution DWI scan was applied with cardiac-gating (based on finger pulse oximetry) resulting in 30 diffusion-weighted images (b\u2009=\u2009500\u2009sec/mm\n2\n) and six b0-weighted images. The DWI sequence parameters were as follows: slice thickness\u2009=\u20095\u2009mm with 10% inter-slice gap, 10 slices perpendicularly oriented to the spine, 5/8 Partial-Fourier Imaging in phase-encoding direction, phase oversampling\u2009=\u200950%, and a cardiac trigger delay\u2009=\u2009200\u2009msec, acquisition matrix\u2009=\u2009176\u2009\u00d7\u200940, FOV\u2009=\u2009133\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u2009mm\n2\n, in-plane resolutions\u2009=\u20090.8\u2009\u00d7\u20090.8\u2009mm\n2\n, TE\u2009=\u200973\u2009msec, and TR\u2009=\u2009350\u2009msec. The triggered DWI data were acquired in blocks of two slices per cardiac cycle. The minimal time between successive triggers was 1800\u2009msec. Each DWI dataset was acquired with four averages resulting in 144 images within a nominal total acquisition time of 6.2\u2009min.\n\nData processing\nCross-sectional spinal cord area measurement\nThe serial longitudinal registration in SPM12 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London, UK) was applied to all T2*-weighted images to average the images accounting for intra-participant motion. Jim 6.0 software (Xinapse Systems, Aldwincle, UK) was used to merge the adjacent partitions resulting in 10 contiguous slices (to increase signal to noise ratio [SNR]) and to semi-automatically segment the cross-sectional cervical cord area using an active-surface model after setting a marker in the center of the cord in each of the 10 contiguous slices.\n28\nThe gray matter and white matter cross-sectional areas were manually segmented. The mean inter-observer and intra-observer reliability for these measures were shown to be in the range of previously reported results (less than 7%).\n27\n,\n29\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measurement\nProcessing of DWI data was carried out with a modified version of the Matlab-based ACID toolbox within SPM12 optimized for the spinal cord.\n30\nFirst, we reduced the in-plane FOV to 24\u2009\u00d7\u200924\u2009mm\n2\nto include only spinal cord tissue. Next, diffusion weighted images were slice-wise linearly registered with 3 degrees of freedom\u2013like translation in the frequency- and phase-encoding direction, scaling in the phase-encoding direction to correct for intra-participant motion and eddy-current artefacts.\n31\nA diffusion tensor model was fitted to the DWI data by applying a robust tensor fitting algorithm that accounts for outlier volumes due to motion and physiologic artefacts\n32\nand resulted fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) DTI index maps. The DTI maps were spatially normalized to a self-constructed mean diffusivity template residing in the spinal Montreal Neurological Institute space.\n33\nTo further refine the accuracy of the registration, a manual slice-by-slice registration (in-plane translation and scaling) was performed. Finally, all DTI index maps were smoothed with a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel with 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u20090.5\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009mm\n3\n. All images were visually inspected for artefacts, and the analysis was conducted on three slices from each modality at the same level.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis of macrostructural MRI data, demographics and clinical outcome data was performed with Stata 15 (Stata- Corp LP, College Station, TX). The mean age was not statistically different between tSCI and DCM patients (Mann-Whitney U test: Z\u2009=\u20091.06,\np\n=\u20090.29).\nFirst, we assessed the morphometric differences in cord area, gray matter area, and white matter area between tSCI subgroups and DCM patients by means of analysis of covariance, adjusted for age. For assessing microstructural differences between patient's groups, we used voxel-based analysis of the different DTI indexes (FA, AD, RD) in SPM12, adjusted for age. All statistical parametric maps were initially thresholded with a cluster-defining threshold of\np\n<\u20090.01 (uncorrected) and clusters surpassing a cluster threshold of\np\n<\u20090.05 (family-wise error corrected) are reported. Next, we used linear regression analysis to investigate the relationship between cord macrostructural and microstructural changes and clinical outcome, adjusted for age. The level of significance was set to\np\n<\u20090.05.\nData availability statement\nAnonymized grouped data, study protocols, and processing pipelines will be shared by request from a qualified investigator."

    "Methods": "Animals\nHomozygous male\nV\n1a\n-/-\nmice, their WT littermates,\n21\nand WT C57BL/6 mice (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany) with a body weight of 18\u201325\u2009g were used in this study. The animals were housed at 22\u00b0C with 60% relative humidity and had free access to food and water. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Animal Research Reporting of In Vivo Experiments criteria and were approved by the ethics board of the Government of Upper Bavaria (protocol number 55.2-1-54-2531-117-05).\n\nAnesthesia and TBI induction\nAnesthesia was induced with 4% isoflurane in a chamber and maintained by administration of 2% isoflurane in 30% O\n2\n/68% N\n2\nO delivered via face mask. Core body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C using a feedback-controlled heating pad connected to a rectal probe. To induce trauma, a craniotomy was prepared over the right parietal cortex as described previously.\n22\nControlled cortical impact (CCI) was delivered perpendicular to the surface of the brain using a CCI applicator that was custom-made for use in mice (Mouse Katjuscha 2000, L. Kopacz, University of Mainz, Germany) using the following parameters: 8\u2009m/sec velocity, 3\u2009mm diameter, 1\u2009mm brain displacement, and 150\u2009msec duration. After CCI, the skull was closed by affixing the removed bone flap using tissue glue (Vetbond, 3M, St. Paul, MN). The animals recovered from anesthesia in an incubator heated at 33\u00b0C.\n\nMouse brain preparation\nThe mice were deeply anesthetized and sacrificed using cervical dislocation. The sagittal suture was opened, and the brain was dissected from the spinal cord and skull base. For RNA extraction, the brains were placed on a cooled RNase-free brain matrix. Two coronal sections were prepared 2\u2009mm rostral and 2\u2009mm caudal relative to the site of trauma. The sections were divided into quadrants, and the traumatized upper-right and non-traumatized lower-left quadrants were used for analysis. For protein preparation, each quadrant was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.\nFor immunohistochemistry, animals were deeply anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 0.4\u2009mL chloral hydrate (3.6%) and transcardially perfused with a solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brains were removed and post-fixed for 24\u2009h in 4% PFA at 4\u00b0C, rinsed in water for 1\u2009h, and stored in 70% ethanol. Thereafter, brains were embedded in paraffin and sectioned according to the established protocol (\nSupplementary Table 1\n).\n\nPrimer\nPrimers were designed using the National Center for Biotechnology Information and Ensemble databases and were synthesized by Eurofins MWG Operon (Ebersberg, Germany) (\nSupplementary Tables 2\n\u2013\n4\n). The specificity of the AQP1 and AQP4 primers was proofed in WT mouse liver, pancreas, kidney, and brain tissues by qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR)."

    "Methods": "Experimental design\nIn an SCI rat model of complete thoracic transection injury (T12), we investigated the role of KCC2 in motor recovery after a chronic SCI and its dependence on the activity-dependent regulation of BDNF in the lumbar spinal cord by using VU0240551, a selective inhibitor of KCC2, or chelating the endogenously released BDNF with the fusion protein TrkB-IgG. Both were delivered intrathecally during the rehabilitation program. Rats were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: 1) intact (\nn\n=\u200911); 2) SCI sedentary control rats receiving the vehicle (SCI,\nn\n=\u200914); 3) SCI rats receiving the KCC2 blocker VU0240551 (SCI+VU0240551,\nn\n=\u20098); 4) SCI rats receiving the BDNF scavenger TrkB-IgG (SCI+TrkB-IgG,\nn\n=\u20099); 5) SCI bike-trained rats receiving the vehicle (SCI+Ex,\nn\n=\u200914); 6) SCI bike-trained rats receiving VU0240551 (SCI+Ex+VU0240551,\nn\n=\u200914); and 7) SCI-bike-trained rats receiving TrkB-IgG (SCI+Ex+TrkB-IgG,\nn\n=\u200911). Hyperreflexia was assessed 4 weeks after SCI and the spinal cord tissue was harvested for immunohistochemistry or western blot analysis.\nAll procedures complied with Animal Research: Reporting of\nIn Vivo\nExperiments (ARRIVE), were conducted in compliance with the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health for the care and use of laboratory animals, and were approved by Drexel University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nSurgical procedures and postoperative care\nAdult female Sprague-Dawley rats (225\u2013250\u2009g, Charles Rivers Laboratories) were used in this study and the time line for procedures is illustrated in\nFigure 1A\n. Rats were housed by pairs in cages in a 12-h light-dark cycle and controlled room temperature with\nad libitum\naccess to food. All animals but the intact group underwent a complete spinal cord transection at T12 under aseptic conditions as described previously.\n26\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG 1.\nExperimental time line.\n(A)\nThe surgical procedure took place on day 1. During the procedure, a complete SCI was performed at the thoracic level (T12). An intrathecal catheter was also implanted subdurally and fitted to a programmable microinfusion pump (iPrecio\n\u00a9\n) to deliver drugs to the lumbar enlargement of the spinal cord. During the post-SCI recovery period (\u223c4 days), saline was continuously delivered at a steady flow rate (3\u2009\u03bcL/h) to prevent blockage of the tip of the cannula. The iPrecio\n\u00a9\nManagement System calculates the time at which the reservoir needs to be emptied from saline and re-filled with drug so as to reach the tip of the cannula 30\u2009min prior to the first rehabilitation session. The saline remaining in the reservoir was then replaced through the subcutaneous port with the vehicle (10% DMSO in saline) for SCI controls, VU0240551 (30\u2009\u03bcM) or TrkB-IgG (10\u2009\u03bcg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline).\n(B)\nThe pumps were programmed on a variable 24-h delivery schedule. Delivery started 30\u2009min before the exercise session at a flow rate of 16\u2009\u03bcL/h for 30\u2009min followed by a 4\u2009\u03bcL/h maintenance dose during the 60-min training session. Drug delivery was tapered off during the remaining 22.5\u2009h to 0.2\u2009\u03bcL/h, the lowest delivery flow to prevent clogging of the catheter.\n(C)\nExercised groups received a 60-min bicycling session during which the hindlimbs go through a complete range of motion at a rate of 45\u2009rpm. Sedentary animals are also seated on the apparatus for 60\u2009min.\n(D)\nExample of EMG activity recorded during cycling. DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; EMG, electromyogram; SCI, spinal cord injury.\nBriefly, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (1\u20134%) and their backs were shaved, cleansed, and disinfected. Body temperature was maintained at \u223c37\u00b0C throughout the surgical procedure and post-surgical recovery. A laminectomy (T10\u2013T11) was performed, the dura slit opened, and a 2-mm cavity created by aspiration. A second laminectomy was also performed (L2) and the proximal end of an intrathecal catheter (Alzet\n\u00ae\n, Durect Corporation) was threaded rostrally in the subdural space over an \u223c10\u2009mm distance. The catheter was secured and glued onto a dry, clean transverse process and the distal end coupled to a programmable microinfusion pump (iPrecio\n\u00a9\n, Durect Corporation).\n35\nThe pump reservoir was filled with saline and the drug delivery program activated. Back muscles were sutured in layers leaving the distal end of the catheter exiting between two sutures. The pump was positioned subcutaneously (s.c.) just below the shoulder blades and sutured to back muscles. The remaining portion of tubing was coiled for stress relief and the skin closed with staples. The completeness of the lesion was recognized by the retraction of the rostral and caudal portions of the spinal cord and inspection of the ventral floor of the spinal canal during the surgery and confirmed post-mortem. The animals were given saline (5\u2009mL/day s.c. for 3 days) to avoid dehydration, prophylactic cefazolin (160\u2009mg/kg/day s.c. for 7 days) and slow-release buprenorphine (0.05\u2009mg/kg, s.c., single dose) as an analgesic for pain control. Bladders were expressed manually twice a day until the end of the study.\n\nDrug delivery\nKCC2 activity was blocked using VU0240551 (Sigma-Aldrich). VU0240551 was re-suspended in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a 50-mM stock solution, and was later diluted in saline to the appropriate concentration. Recombinant human TrkB Fc chimera protein (TrkB-IgG; R&D Company), used to chelate the endogenously released BDNF, was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Parameters for drug delivery (dose, volume, time to reach maximal effect at the time of training) were consistent with previous reports.\n28\n,\n36\u201338\nThe specific delivery protocol and dosage are described in\nFigure 1B\n.\n\nRehabilitation program\nBeginning on day 5, exercised groups received a 60-min bicycling session. Animals were seated in a support harness with the hindlimbs hanging while the feet were secured to pedals with surgical tape (\nFig. 1C\n). The custom-built motor-driven apparatus moves the hindlimbs through a complete range of motion during pedal rotation at a rate of 45\u2009rpm\n17\n,\n26\n,\n39\nand triggers rhythmic activity in flexors and extensors (\nFig. 1D\n).\n39\nThe rehabilitation program took place 5 days a week until completion of the study.\n\nElectrophysiological recordings and analysis\nH-reflex recordings were performed 4 weeks post-SCI as described previously.\n17\n,\n26\nRats were anesthetized with ketamine (60\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (10\u2009mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally (i.p.). The tibial nerve was dissected free and mounted on a bipolar hook electrode for stimulation. Skin flaps were used to form a pool of mineral oil to prevent desiccation of the nerve. Bipolar wire electrodes (Cooner Wire) were inserted into the interosseus muscles for electromyogram (EMG) recordings and the ground electrode inserted into the skin of the back. H-reflexes were evoked via an isolated pulse stimulator (A-M Systems) that delivered single bipolar pulses (100\u2009\u03bcsec) to the tibial nerve, and H- and M-waves were recorded in the interosseus muscle in response to a range of increasing stimulus intensities. The intensity that elicited the maximal H-reflex amplitude (below the activation threshold for group Ib\u2013II afferents, \u223c1.2\u20131.4 MT) was then used to determine the properties of the M-wave and H-reflex as well as to evoke frequency-dependent depression (FDD). FDD was estimated using three series of 20 consecutive stimulations delivered at 0.3, 5, and 10\u2009Hz. The experiment was first completed on the left leg, and the protocol then was performed on the right leg.\nEMG recordings were amplified (A-M Systems) and bandpass filtered (10\u20135\u2009kHz), and the signal was digitized (10\u2009kHz) using a 1401 interface (Cambridge Electronic Design, CED) and fed to a computer running Signal 5 software (CED). Properties of the M-wave and H-reflex (\nn\n=\u20098\u201313 animals/group,\nTable 1\n) are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM). For the analysis of the FDD, the first five responses to a train of stimulation were discarded to allow reflex stabilization. The 15 remaining responses were then averaged. Peak-to-peak amplitude of the M and H responses were measured and the H-reflex amplitude was normalized to M\nmax\n. The change in H-reflex peak-to-peak response at 5\u2009Hz and 10\u2009Hz was calculated as a percentage of the response obtained at 0.3\u2009Hz. FDD data (\nn\n=\u20098\u201313 animals/group) are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM.\nTable 1.\nProperties of the M-Wave and H-Reflex: Latency, Amplitude, and Threshold\nN\u2009=\nMotor threshold\nM\nmax\nH\nmax\nM latency\nH latency\nH-reflex threshold\nH\nmax\n(mA)\n(mV)\n(mV)\n(msec)\n(msec)\n(x MT)\n(xMT)\nIntact\n11\n0.013\u2009\u00b1\u20090.003\n9.71\u2009\u00b1\u20091.40\n3.38\u2009\u00b1\u20090.78\n2.46\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11\n9.35\u2009\u00b1\u20090.50\n1.76\u2009\u00b1\u20090.19\n1.76\u2009\u00b1\u20090.19\nSCI\n11\n0.019\u2009\u00b1\u20090.002\n6.79\u2009\u00b1\u20090.53\n2.71\u2009\u00b1\u20090.34\n2.38\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08\n8.84\u2009\u00b1\u20090.18\n0.94\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02\n***\n1.38\u2009\u00b1\u20090.13\nSCI + Ex\n9\n0.017\u2009\u00b1\u20090.002\n5.22\u2009\u00b1\u20090.57\n2.29\u2009\u00b1\u20090.34\n2.19\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08\n8.80\u2009\u00b1\u20090.16\n1.09\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05\n1.49\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08\nSCI + VU0240551\n8\n0.019\u2009\u00b1\u20090.004\n7.77\u2009\u00b1\u20091.33\n2.59\u2009\u00b1\u20090.68\n2.22\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08\n8.65\u2009\u00b1\u20090.19\n1.11\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11\n*\n1.58\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08\nSCI + Ex + VU0240551\n13\n0.019\u2009\u00b1\u20090.003\n7.64\u2009\u00b1\u20090.99\n3.96\u2009\u00b1\u20090.65\n2.50\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09\n8.69\u2009\u00b1\u20090.18\n1.10\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04\n*\n1.37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08\nSCI + TrkBIgG\n9\n0.018\u2009\u00b1\u20090.003\n6.77\u2009\u00b1\u20090.58\n2.13\u2009\u00b1\u20090.31\n2.49\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06\n8.95\u2009\u00b1\u20090.13\n1.05\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05\n*\n1.52\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08\nSCI + Ex + TrkBIgG\n11\n0.024\u2009\u00b1\u20090.005\n6.59\u2009\u00b1\u20091.25\n3.35\u2009\u00b1\u20090.75\n2.37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08\n8.84\u2009\u00b1\u20090.17\n0.99\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04\n**\n1.42\u2009\u00b1\u20090.18\nOpen in a separate window\n***\nP\n<\u20090.001,\n**\np\n<\u20090.01,\n*\np\n<\u20090.05 vs. intact.\nValues are mean/\u00b1/SEM.\nMT, motor threshold, SCI, spinal cord injury; SEM, standard error of the mean.\nAfter completion of the terminal experiment, rats were overdosed with Euthasol (390\u2009mg/kg sodium pentobarbital and 50\u2009mg/kg phenytoin, i.p.) and the animal was either transcardiacally perfused with cold saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS or fresh tissue was extracted for western blotting.\n\nExtraction of fresh tissue and western blotting\nBlocks of spinal tissue (L4\u2013L5) were lysed in modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50\u2009mM Tris buffer pH 6.8, 1% Triton-X, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], 1\u2009mM dithiothreitol [DTT], 0.5% deoxycholate, 150\u2009mM NaCl) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche), 2\u2009mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 1\u2009mM NaF. Protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Pierce). Samples (30\u2009\u03bcm of total protein) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (10\u201316% gels for BDNF, 4\u201320% gradient TGX gels [Biorad] for KCC2/NKCC1).

After brief washes in PBS, spinal cord sections were incubated in secondary antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocynate (FITC) and rhodamine (1:400; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 2\u2009h at room temperature.\nStacked images of motoneurons (40\u2009\u03bcm sections) were acquired with a spectral confocal and multi-photon system (Leica TCS SP2). Only motoneurons showing a clear nucleus were scanned. The fluorescence intensity of KCC2 immunolabeling on the plasma membrane of motoneurons (identified by ChAT\n+\n, typical large size, and location within the ventral horn) was measured by averaging the integrated area of the density curve obtained by drawing three lines across each motoneurons (six data points) using ImageJ software.\n26\n,\n40\nA minimum of 15 lumbar motoneurons were averaged per group.\n\nStatistical analysis\nSignificant differences for the properties of the M-wave and H-reflex as well as immunoblotting data were determined by either using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Holm-Sidak multiple comparisons post hoc test, or a Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA on ranks followed by Dunn's method if the sample variables did not fit a normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk) or were not equally variant (Brown-Forsythes). Significant effects on the amplitude of the H-reflex by stimulation frequency and treatment group for the FDD were determined by a two-way ANOVA followed by the Holm-Sidak post hoc test, and the possible interaction of these factors with the variable was determined. Linear regression analysis was used to correlate NKCC1 to KCC2 and KCC2 to BDNF protein levels obtained by western blotting. All data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using Sigma Plot software 14.0 and statistically significant levels were set to\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Repeated traumatic brain injury model\nC57BL/6NCr mice were purchased from Charles River (Wilmington, MA) and were kept in the animal facility with free access to food and water. Closed head injury by mechanically engineered rotational acceleration (CHIMERA)\n7\n,\n14\nwas used to induce repeated TBI. Mice at 4\u20135 months of age were anesthetized with isoflurane and strapped supine at an angled position on the CHIMERA apparatus with the head resting flat on the base plate. A computer-controlled, pneumatically driven piston was then fired from below to strike the head of the mouse, delivering 0.55\u2009J of energy. The mouse was immediately removed from the apparatus and placed in the home cage to recover. The whole procedure was completed within 5\u2009min per mouse. This procedure was repeated for 3 successive days for the repeated injury group, producing a three-hit model with 24\u2009h between each injury. The single TBI group was injured on the last day of the repeated TBI group so that both groups had the same time post-injury for further testing. The sham group was anesthetized with isoflurane and strapped to the device but not injured. Half the mice in the sham group were anesthetized once whereas others were anesthetized for 3 consecutive days.\n\nMorris water maze\nThe water maze (120\u2009cm in diameter) was filled with water (22\u201324\u00b0C) with non-toxic white paint. The visible platform water maze was conducted at 19 days after injury followed by the hidden platform water maze at 24 days after injury. For the visible platform test, a black disk was placed on the platform, and it was marked with a red and white flag to clearly indicate its location. Each mouse was trained for 3 consecutive days with four trials each day. Mice were released into the water and given 60\u2009sec to locate and climb onto a 10-cm\n2\nplatform. If they were unable to locate the platform within 60\u2009sec, they were gently guided to it. The platform location was changed for each trial.\n\nOpen field test\nMice were tested in the open field at 32 days after injury. Mice were individually placed in the acrylic, black open field apparatus (40\u2009cm\n2\n) and allowed to freely explore the arena for 5\u2009min. Distances covered during the test, time spent in the center, and the periphery were considered as the relevant parameters.\n\nVisual cliff test\nThe visual cliff test has been used to assess depth perception and visual acuity.\n21\nMice were tested at 34 days after injury. A flat, transparent acrylic surface was partly lined by a checkerboard pattern with the rest of the surface overhanging around 50\u2009cm above another surface lined with a similar checkerboard pattern to give the illusion of a \u201ccliff.\u201d A small tube (4\u2009cm in diameter) was taped at the junction of the checkerboard covered and the transparent surface. In each trial, the mouse was gently placed on the tube with its head directed along the length of the tube. It was removed as soon as it stepped down, and the side chosen (checkerboard\u2009=\u2009safe or transparent\u2009=\u2009cliff) was recorded. Each mouse was given 10 trials.\n\nVisual evoked potential\nFlash visual evoked potential (VEP) was used to assess visual function at five weeks after injury using ColorDome Ganzfeld (Diagnosys LLC, Lowell, MA). Mice were injected with ketamine and xylazine intraperitoneally and placed on a heated platform. A reference needle electrode was inserted in the lower lip whereas the ground electrode was inserted in the tail. The test electrode was inserted medially on the head through the scalp such that it was in contact with the skull over the visual cortex. Drops of 1% tropicamide were put in the eyes to dilate the pupils, and the mouse was placed on a heated platform with its head covered by the Ganzfeld dome. The flash stimuli of white light (6500K) were generated by ColorDome Ganzfeld. The flash stimuli had an intensity of 3.0 cd-s/m\n2\nwith each set including 100 sweeps. Three sets of readings were recorded and averaged. The sample frequency was 1000\u2009Hz with the sweep pre-trigger and post-trigger time at 10 and 250\u2009ms, respectively. Espion software (V6.0.56; Diagnosys LLC, Lowell, MA) was used to generate and record the readings and obtain the data table for N1 amplitude. Readings for all sweeps were manually averaged to obtain the VEP wave. After the test, mice were transferred to the home cage on a heating pad and allowed to regain consciousness.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nMice were perfused with chilled phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) followed by chilled 4% paraformaldehyde under isoflurane anesthesia at 5 weeks after injury. Brains were removed, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24\u2009h, and immersed in 30% sucrose. Twenty-five-micrometer sections were cut through the optic tract using a cryostat. Sections were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin and immersed overnight at 4\u00b0C in anti-GFAP (glial fibrillary acid protein) or anti-Iba-1 (ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1) antibody, washed, and immersed in fluorescent-tagged secondary antibody before mounting them on slides. Images of immunostained brain sections were captured using an attached digital camera (Hamamatsu Photonics K. K., Hamamatsu City, Japan) and immunofluorescence quantified for the optic tract using Metamorph software (Version 7.10.0.119; Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA).\nSilver staining was performed using the FD NeuroSilver\nTM\nKit II (FD NeuroTechnologies, Columbia, MD). Brain sections were immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4\u00b0C for 7 days and stained according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. Sections were then mounted on slides and visualized under brightfield illumination.\n\nStatistical analyses\nOne-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's multiple comparisons test was used to analyze data of open field activity and the visual cliff test. Repeated-measures two-way AVOVA, followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons, was used for the analysis of the Morris water maze test. The N1 amplitude for VEP was analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's correction for multiple comparisons. Results are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of mean (SEM), and\np\nvalues <0.05 were considered statistically significant."

    "Methods": "Materials\nAll experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were conducted in accordance with the recommendations provided in the\nGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\n. Protocols were designed to minimize pain and discomfort during the surgical procedures and recovery. A total of 28 male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (Envigo, 300\u2013350\u2009g) were used in these studies with 14 receiving a mFPI and 14 serving as sham-operated controls. For immunohistochemistry, antibodies to neuronal nuclei (NeuN) (cat# MAB377; 1:1000) and microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2) (cat# AB5622; 1:1000) were purchased from Millipore (Burlington, MA), antibodies against parvalbumin (cat # ab11427; 1:1000) were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, United Kingdom), and secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa Fluor (cat # A32723, A32732; 1:500) were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33258; 0.05\u2009\u03bcg/mL) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). We implanted rats with 32 channel electrode arrays (Bio-Signal, Dallas, TX). A 32 channel unity gain headstage was plugged into the electrode array and a Blackrock microsystems data acquisition system (Salt Lake City, UT) was used to record spiking activity from individual CA1 neurons in the pyramidal cell layer. An infrared tracking system (Neuromotive, Blackrock microsystems) was included to enable real-time movement of the animals' head position during task performance.\n\nLateral mFPI and electrode implantation surgeries\nLateral FPI was delivered as described previously.\n13\u201316\nRats were deeply anesthetized using 5% isoflurane with a 1:1 air/O\n2\nmixture, and a surgical level of anesthesia was maintained using with 2.5% isoflurane with a 1:1\u2009N\n2\nO/O\n2\nmixture via a face mask. Rats were mounted on the stereotaxic frame, and a 4.8\u2009mm diameter craniotomy was made in the right hemisphere (midway between bregma and lambda, with the medial edge \u223c1.0\u2009mm from the midline) using a trephine. A hub (modified from a 20 gauge needle) was implanted into the burr hole and affixed to the skull by contact adhesive and dental cement. Once the assembly was secured, the rat was removed from anesthesia and connected via the hub to the fluid percussion device. Upon the rat regaining its toe pinch reflex, a single sterile saline pulse was delivered with a pressure of 2.0 atm over base room pressure (Custom Design & Fabrication, Richmond, VA). After injury, the hub and dental cement were removed, and the incision was closed by wound clips. In order to avoid unintentional contact with the dura or exposed brain, sham animals were anesthetized and received a scalp incision, but not the craniotomy or hub implantation. Animals' body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C during the surgery using a rectal thermometer coupled to a heating pad.\nFollowing a 7 day recovery period, both sham and injured rats were implanted with 32 microwire arrays (BioSignal, Dallas, TX) directed at the dorsal CA1 subfield of the hippocampus. The electrode array was positioned 3.8\u2009mm posterior to bregma and 2.0\u2009mm lateral from the midline, and with a depth of 2.2\u2009mm. To maximize the yield of these fixed arrays, recordings were made during surgery and electrode placement was adjusted to optimize visualization of sharp wave ripple (SWR) events and a maximal numbers of spikes. A topical analgesic and antibiotic ointment was applied for 7 days following implantation to minimize pain and the risk of infection.\n\nElectrophysiological recordings\nRecordings were performed on days 17\u201319 post-mFPI. Local field potentials were sampled at 10\u2009kHz and digitally filtered (0.5\u2013500Hz). Spike data were sampled at 30\u2009kHz and digitally filtered (250\u2009Hz hi-pass filter), and thresholds were set to 50\u201380\u2009\u03bcV. Spikes were sorted using a manual clustering program (Blackrock Offline Spike Sorter) based on peak amplitude, spike width, valley amplitude, area, and principal components 1\u20134. Principal component analysis extracts orthogonal basis vectors compiled from the covariance matrix of every waveform collected by an electrode in a session.\n17\nInter-spike interval histograms were built for each neuron. Neurons having an inter-spike interval of <2\u2009ms were removed from analysis. Tracking data was sampled at 40\u2009Hz with a resolution of \u223c0.2\u2009cm.\n\nData analysis and place field quantification\nData analysis included only neurons with \u226550 recorded action potentials within a 5\u2009min period.\n18\nNeurons were considered putatively pyramidal neurons if they exhibited a peak latency of >400\u2009\u03bcsec and a mean firing rate of <5\u2009Hz.\n19\n,\n20\nNeurons with a peak latency of <400\u2009\u03bcsec and a mean firing rate of >5\u2009Hz were classified as putative inhibitory neurons.\n19\nThe open field was segmented into 3\u2009cm x 3\u2009cm bins and the number of spikes in each bin was divided by the time spent (within that bin) to determine a firing rate. A heat map was generated for each recorded neuron's activity by combining the calculated firing rates for all of the individual spatial bins within the arena.\nSpatial information (SI) is a measure of how unambiguously the cell's firing reflects the position of the animal. SI was calculated according to Skagg and coworkers, using the equation:\nS\nI\n=\n\u2211\ni\n=\n1\nN\np\ni\nR\ni\nR\nl\no\ng\n2\nR\ni\nR\nwhere\np\ni\n=\u2009the probability the rat was at spatial bin\ni\n(out of\nN\nbins),\nR\ni\n=\u2009firing rate at spatial bin\ni,\nand R\u2009=\u2009overall firing rate of the place cell.\n7\nNeurons with an SI of >0.99 are considered to be cells encoding potential place field information.\nA place field was defined according to criteria outlined by Muller and coworkers\n21\n: a group of adjoining bins (sharing at least one side) with the average firing rate of each bin exceeding a threshold of 10% above the overall mean firing rate of each cell.\n21\u201323\nThe boundaries of the place field are defined as the bins around the place field that fall below the 10% threshold. The area of the place field was derived from the number of 9\u2009cm\n2\nbins within the field. Fields with an area of <36\u2009cm\n2\n(four adjacent bins) or >495\u2009cm\n2\nbins (500\u2009cm\n2\n) were excluded from analysis. Neighboring place fields with a gap of \u22646\u2009cm were combined into a single field. In order to reduce the false positive rate associated with short times spent in specific bins, we used a 1\u2009sec threshold for occupancy (within an individual bin). Once the field was established during the familiarization phase of the task, we then measured the in-field firing rate of isolated place cells (the firing rate within the place field). The in-field firing rates and place field sizes/positions were compared between the familiarization and novel location testing phases to determine in-field firing rate changes and place field stability.\n\nPlace field stability\nPlace field stability was determined by comparing the in-field firing rates during the familiarization and testing periods using a Pearson's correlation.\n10\nComparing two rate maps containing bins [x\n1\n,x\n2\n,\u2026,x\nN\nfor map 1 (familiarization)] and [y\n1\n,y\n2\n,\u2026,y\nN\nfor map 2 (novel location)], the Pearson correlation coefficient (\nC\n) was calculated using the following equation:\nC\n=\n1\n\u2215\nN\n\u2211\ni\n=\n1\nN\nx\ni\n\u2212\nx\n\u00af\n\u03c3\nx\n(\ny\ni\n\u2212\n\u0233\n\u03c3\ny\n)\nwhere\nx\n\u00af\nand\n\u03c3\nx\nare the mean and standard deviation (SD) of [x\n1\n,x\n2\n,..x\nN\n] and\n\u0233\nand\n\u03c3\ny\nare the mean and SD of [y\n1\n,y\n2\n,\u2026,y\nN\n], respectively. The correlation coefficient can range from 1 to \u22121, with a higher correlation between the two rate maps indicative of a highly stable place field.\n\nObject location task\nSeven days after implantation, rats were habituated to an empty open field arena (60\u2009cm x 60\u2009cm) with 30\u2009cm opaque walls that were marked with cues for orientation. Cues in the maze, and items in the recording room remained constant across the experiment. Habituation was conducted over 4 days by allowing the rats to freely explore the arena for up to 30\u2009min/day. Each behavioral session consisted of a 10\u2009min familiarization (F) period, a 5\u2009min inter-trial interval, and a 5\u2009min testing period. During the familiarization period, two identical objects were placed in the maze, which the rat was allowed to freely explore. For the testing period, one of the two objects was moved to a novel location while the other remained in its original location. During both the familiarization and testing periods, the animals' location was recorded (via an overhead camera) and neuronal activity was continuously monitored. Between days, the objects were replaced so that new objects in novel positions were used for each familiarization period. Time spent exploring the two objects was measured from the overhead video by an experimenter unaware of the animal group designations. Novelty preference was defined as the difference between time spent exploring the objects in the novel and familiar locations divided by the total time spent exploring both objects. Scores ranged from 1 (exploration of only the object in the novel location) to \u22121 (exploration of only the object in the familiar location).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nGroups of sham (\nn\n=\u20094) and mFPI (\nn\n=\u20094) animals were euthanized on day 17 post-injury by an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (100\u2009mg/kg), and the position of the electrodes was marked by electrolytic lesion (30\u2009\u03bcA, 6\u201310\u2009s). Rats were then transcardially perfused with ice-cold saline (300\u2009mL) and post-fixed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 4% paraformaldehyde for at least 24\u2009h. Brains were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose (in PBS) and 40\u2009\u03bcm thick coronal sections were prepared on a cryostat. Sections corresponding to the position of the electrode were stained with Cresyl violet and the positions of the electrodes were confirmed. For immunohistochemistry, free-floating sections were permeabilized in PBS containing 0.25% Triton-X100, and blocked in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 2.5% normal goat serum for 2\u2009h. Primary antibodies (in blocking buffer) were added and incubated overnight at room temperature (RT). After extensive washing, sections were incubated in species-specific secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor for 1\u2009h at RT. After secondary antibody incubation, sections were washed in bisbenzimide solution for 5\u2009min to stain cellular DNA, then rinsed in PBS. Sections were then slide-mounted, air-dried, and cover-slipped with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). Immunoreactivity was visualized on a Zeiss UV microscope. Images were captured using a Retiga 6000 camera using QCapture Pro software (Qimaging, Surrey, BC) and pseudo-colored for presentation. Parvalbumin-positive cells within the CA1 subfield (restricted to the area above the inner blade of the dentate gyrus) were counted from two sections/animal. The area of the CA1 subfield was measured using Stereo Investigator and the number of cells/mm\n2\nwas calculated for comparisons.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data were subjected to a normality and equal variance test prior to performing statistical comparisons. Statistical comparisons of multi-electrode data from the same neurons' activity during the familiarization and novel location phases were made using a Student's two tailed paired samples\nt\ntest. For comparison of the neurophysiological properties of neurons between sham and mFPI groups, the non-parametric Mann\u2013Whitney\nU\ntest (for data with unequal samples) was used. Cell counts were compared across the two groups using a two tailed Student's\nt\ntest for unpaired variables. Results are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM), unless otherwise specified."

    "Methods": "Participants\nParticipants were patients with traumatic DoC enrolled in the placebo arm of a prospective 6 week multi-center randomized-controlled trial investigating the effectiveness of amantadine hydrochloride in promoting recovery.\n8\nRecruitment was conducted at eight rehabilitation hospitals in the United States and three in Europe between February 2005 and March 2010. All patients were in VS or MCS at enrollment. Of the 184 patients who completed the study, 97 were randomized to the placebo arm (35 in VS\n18\nand 62 in MCS\n2\n). Two patients who were incorrectly assigned to the MCS stratum in the original study were reassigned to the VS stratum for the current analyses. Participants were 16\u201365 years of age, had sustained a non-penetrating TBI 4\u201316 weeks prior to enrollment, underwent withdrawal of psychoactive medications, and received the usual inpatient rehabilitation services. Patients with pre-injury central nervous system-related disability, medical instability, pregnancy, more than one seizure in the prior month, and prior amantadine treatment were excluded. Additional eligibility details and the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram are described in the original publication.\n8\nPatients were stratified by length of time since injury (early\u2009=\u200928\u201371 days; late\u2009=\u200972\u2013112 days) to investigate the effects of injury chronicity on behavioral recovery.\n19\nPatients in MCS were sub-stratified into MCS+ or MCS- subgroups, based on performance on language items from the Coma Recovery Scale \u2013 Revised (CRS-R)\n20\n(see\nFig. S1 and Table S1\n).\n\nOutcomes\nOutcomes were assessed using the CRS-R\n20\nand Disability Rating Scale (DRS).\n21\nThe CRS-R is composed of six subscales designed to assess level of consciousness and track behavioral recovery (\nFig. S1\n).\n20\n,\n22\nReliability and validity are well established,\n23\nsupporting its selection by the National Institute on Neurological Disorders and Stroke TBI Common Data Element Workgroup as the preferred measure for monitoring recovery of consciousness.\n24\nWe chose the most complex behavior assessed on each CRS-R subscale to serve as \u201ctarget\u201d behaviors. The six behaviors selected and their definitions are shown in\nTable 1\n. Emergence from MCS was demonstrated by either reliable yes\u2013no responses to questions (i.e., CRS-R Communication subscale score of 2) or reproducible instances of appropriate object use (i.e., CRS-R Motor subscale score of 6).\n2\nThe DRS is a TBI-specific functional outcome scale that includes the GCS;\n25\nratings of cognitive ability for feeding, dressing, and grooming; degree of assistance required; and employability. Scores range from 0 to 29, with higher values indicating greater disability (\nTable S2\n). Scores were grouped into disability categories to describe outcomes at week 6.\n8\nTable 1.\nOperational Definitions of the Six Target Behaviors\na\nTarget behavior\nOperational definition\nb\nConsistent command following\nA clearly discernible and accurate response to a one-step motor command is observed. Responses must be accurate in 4 consecutive trials of 2 different commands.\nObject recognition\nTwo different familiar objects are recognized when presented together in pairs. Responses must be accurate in at least 3 of 4 trials administered.\nFunctional object use\nFollowing instruction to demonstrate use of a common object placed in the hand, a movement sequence is observed that is generally compatible with the specific function of the object. Responses must be accurate in 2 of 2 trials with two different objects.\nIntelligible verbalization\nTwo different fully intelligible words consisting of a consonant-vowel-consonant blend must be detected during the course of the examination.\nReliable communication\nClearly discernible and accurate verbal or gestural yes\u2013no responses occur on 6 of 6 questions concerning situational orientation (e.g., \u201cAm I touching my ear/nose?\u201d).\nSustained attention\nNo more than 3 instances of failure to respond to a verbal prompt occur during CRS-R administration.\nOpen in a separate window\na\nOperational definitions are extracted from the Coma Recovery Scale- Revised (CRS-R) Administration and Scoring Manual (available at\nhttp://www.tbims.org/combi/crs\n)\nb\nA scoreable response occurs when the target behavior is observed within 10\u2009sec of the examiner's standardized prompt.\n\nProcedure\nStudy staff who were responsible for administering the CRS-R attended a pre-enrollment training seminar taught by the primary author of the CRS-R (J.T.G.), and were required to utilize the CRS-R Administration and Scoring Manual when conducting study examinations. The CRS-R was administered at enrollment and at the 6 week follow-up to track recovery of the target behaviors. DRS scores were obtained independently by consensus of the rehabilitation team at week 6 and were used to investigate the relationship between number of behaviors recovered and degree of functional disability. The number of patients who emerged from MCS at week 6 was determined based on the CRS-R score profile. All patients completed the study within 22 weeks of injury.\nThe protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of participating sites, written informed consent obtained from the legally authorized representative, and the trial was registered with\nClinicalTrials.gov\n(ID# NCT00970944). Independent oversight was provided by a data safety monitoring board and data were stored and analyzed by a data coordinating center.\n\nStatistical analysis\nWe used descriptive statistics to summarize the demographic and clinical characteristics of the entire sample and subgroups stratified by time from injury and diagnosis. Two patients failed to complete the follow-up and were excluded from week 6 analyses, reducing the number of MCS patients from 62 to 60. We calculated the proportions of patients (and exact 95% confidence intervals [CI]) in the sample who recovered each target behavior and the total number of behaviors recovered by week 6. To assess the influence of time post-injury on behavioral recovery, Fisher's Exact Tests (FET) and odds ratios (with 95% CI) or the Mantel\u2013Haenszel \u03c7\n2\ntrend test were used to contrast recovery rates at week 6 between the early and late enrollment subgroups. We conducted the same analyses to compare recovery between conscious (MCS+ and MCS-) and unconscious (VS) patients. For the comparison between patients with and without preserved language function (MCS+ vs. MCS- and VS), we used Mantel\u2013Haenszel \u03c7\n2\nanalysis to compare the number of behaviors recovered at week 6. Mantel\u2013Haenszel \u03c7\n2\nanalysis was also used to determine if there were differences in the frequency of emergence from MCS. We also investigated the influence of age on recovery by comparing the mean age of patients who did and did not recover individual target behaviors by week 6, and by comparing age distributions for the number of target behaviors recovered by week 6.\nTo assess the relationship between behavioral recovery and functional disability, we calculated the median DRS score relative to the number of behaviors present at week 6. We also performed linear regression analysis of the number of behaviors recovered at week 6 against the DRS score. To explore differences in functional outcome at week 6 between patients with and without language function at enrollment, we compared DRS scores using the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test. The Kruskal\u2013Wallis test was also used in a post-hoc analysis to determine if the MCS+ and MCS- subgroups differed in length of time post-injury. We used Holm's Sequential Bonferroni Procedure\n26\nto adjust for multiple comparisons, and considered results to be significant at\np\n\u2264\u20090.05. Analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc.)."

    "Methods": "Experimental design\nThe present work adheres to the ARRIVE guidelines for reporting animal research.\n13\nThe objective of this study was to study the mechanical properties of the chronically injured spinal cord and to determine whether reducing fibrotic scarring through treatment with immune modifying nanoparticles (IMP) alters pathological tissue stiffening after SCI in mice.\n14\n\nMouse spinal cord injury and animal care\nAll animal procedures were approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Animal Care and Uses Committee and adhered to the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Animals were housed in the Northwestern University Center for Comparative Medicine and cared for according to its standard operating procedures. SCI was performed using the Infinite Horizons Spinal Cord Impactor system (IH-0400, Precision Systems and Instrumentation). A severe injury paradigm was used, with 100 kdyn of impact force and a dwell time of 60\u2009seconds to make a severe T11 contusion SCI to mice. These conditions are identical to those used in our previous publication on IMP.\n14\nEight-weeks-old female C57BL/6 wild-type mice (Charles River Labs) were used for all SCI experiments. \u201cSham\u201d control animals were anesthetized and the paraspinal muscles dissected, but no laminectomy was performed. Post-operational care was performed as previously described.\n14\n,\n15\nBuprenorphine anesthetic (0.05\u2009mg/kg, subcutaneously in 1\u2009mL sterile saline) was administered daily for 2 days after injury. Baytril antibiotic (2.5\u2009mg/kg, subcutaneously in 1\u2009mL sterile saline) was administered daily for 3 days after injury to reduce the risk of infection. Bladders were manually expressed daily.\n\nIMP treatment\nBiodegradable carboxylated poly(lactide-\nco\n-glycolide) (PLG) IMP (500\u2009nm diameter) were obtained from Phosphorex, Inc. (Fall River, MA) and diluted in sterile isotonic 0.9% saline (Ricca) to a final concentration of 4.7\u2009mg/mL. 200\u2009\u03bcL of dilute IMP solution was injected via tail vein 2\u2009h after SCI. Subsequent injections were performed at 24 and 48\u2009h post-injury. Treatment was randomized by cage. Control injured animals received equivalent volume injections of sterile saline at the same time-points. No adverse events were observed in connection with IMP or saline treatment.\n\nDissection and preparation of spinal cord tissue\nAt 12 weeks post-SCI (12 WPI), mice were euthanized via CO\n2\ninhalation and perfused with 20\u2009mL ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Spinal cords were quickly dissected and snap frozen. Tissue samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until they were shipped on dry ice from the Kessler lab to the Tschumperlin lab. Spinal cords were embedded in Tissue-Plus O.C.T. Compound (optimal cutting temperature) (Fisher HealthCare) and then frozen in dry-ice-cooled 2-methylbutane and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Transverse sections of spinal cord (10\u2009\u03bcm thick) were cut on a Leica CM1860 UV cryostat, mounted on poly-L-lysine-coated glass slides (Electron Microscopy Sciences), and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. To perform AFM measurements, glass slides with tissue sections were placed in plastic Petri dishes (15\u2009mm diameter, Corning) for about 15\u2009min with droplets of water surrounding them, to thaw slowly to room temperature while also maintaining high humidity to avoid tissue drying. Once defrosted, PBS solution was added to the tissue slices and adequate hydration was maintained throughout AFM characterization. We will refer to this method of sample preparation as the \u201cfrozen/thawing tissue process.\u201d\nThe \u201cfresh tissue process\u201d for spinal cord sample preparation has been adapted from Koser et al.\n17\nSpinal cords were harvested from two uninjured adult (30 weeks old) female C57BL/6 wild-type mice. One segment of spinal cord was embedded in 4% low melt agarose (Roche) at 37\u00b0C and kept on ice to rigidify the agarose. From this agarose-embedded sample, fresh transverse sections of tissue were cut at 500\u2009\u03bcm thickness in PBS by vibratome (Precisionary Instruments, Inc.). Tissue slices were then mounted on glass slides previously coated with Cell-Tak adhesive (Corning). Samples were kept on ice in plastic Petri dishes (15\u2009mm diameter, Corning) for 15\u2009min to complete tissue adhesion, with PBS on the top to avoid tissue drying. In total, the procedure from sacrifice to fresh tissue analysis by AFM was carried out within approximately 2\u2009h. To compare the mechanical properties of spinal cord tissue prepared with these two processes, adjacent segments of spinal cord were dissected from the same mice and preserved in parallel using our frozen/thawing tissue process for analysis.\n\nExperimental optimization for AFM microindentation\nTo assess the micromechanical properties of mouse spinal cord by AFM microindentation, we developed the following experimental protocol (\nFig. 1A\n). Areas of interest in thin sections of spinal cord tissue were identified under phase contrast microscope (200\u2009\u00d7\u2009) (Olympus). Microindentation force curves were performed by AFM on each area of interest in PBS at room temperature using a Catalyst Bioscope atomic force microscope (Bruker) and a 2.5\u2009\u03bcm radius borosilicate sphere AFM tip (Novascan). The spring constant\nk\nof AFM tips was estimated at 100 pN/nm by thermal tune.\n17\nMIRO 2.0 software was used through Nanoscope 9.1 (Bruker) to operate microindentation. The Young's modulus (elastic modulus) was then estimated by fitting each force curve (NanoScope Analysis 1.8 software, Bruker) using the Hertz contact model for spherical indenter\n18\u201320\nand following the relationship:\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nDetermination of AFM experiment and data analysis parameters, and sample preparation to characterize mouse spinal cord stiffness.\n(A)\nSchematic description of AFM microindentation experiment from the identification of area of interest on mouse spinal cord tissue to the determination of the elastic modulus.\n(B)\nRepresentative force curves performed on mouse spinal cord tissue (from control uninjured mouse spinal cord, 12 weeks post-sham injury) at an applied force corresponding to 10, 25, 50, and 75% of the maximal force threshold.\n(C)\nSchematic explanation of the determination of contact point and Hertz's model fitting on a force curve performed on control spinal cord tissue.

In (D), statistical results are presented considering values at 25% as a reference and with significance at *\np\n<\u20090.05. All statistical results are shown in\nSupplementary Table S1\nand\nSupplementary Table S2\n.\n(F)\nThere was no significant difference between the elastic moduli of uninjured mouse spinal cords prepared using the \u201cfresh\u201d and \u201cfrozen/thawing\u201d processes. In box and whisker plots, the box indicates the 25th and 75th percentiles of the values, the line inside the box is the median value, and the whiskers the smallest and largest values. Markers represent the average of 10 force curves performed per area. In total, two control uninjured mouse spinal cords samples were analyzed with two areas (white and gray matter) per slice and two non-consecutive slices per animal.

AFM, atomic force microscopy; SEM, standard error of the mean.\nE\n=\n3\n4\n1\n\u2212\n\u03bd\n2\nR\n1\n\u2215\n2\n\u03b4\n3\n\u2215\n2\nF\nEq.(1)\nwith\nR\nthe tip radius,\n\u03bd\nthe Poisson's ratio assumed at 0.5 for spinal cord tissue,\n12\nand \u03b4 the sample indentation.\nOne important consideration in evaluating the stiffness of soft biological tissues, such as spinal cord, is that the force applied during tissue indentation and the determination of the point of contact must be carefully selected to avoid over- or under-estimation of elastic modulus. When the force curve is performed (graphically represented by the force F as a function of the tip displacement Z-Displacement,\nFig. 1A\n), the AFM system progressively advances the AFM tip toward the sample until a defined value of force is applied. During this process, the tip comes in contact with the tissue (called contact point) and indents it. The force applied on the tissue should be adjusted to avoid experimental noise and the misidentification of the contact point in the case of too low force,\n21\u201323\nand to prevent the damage of the sample and the underlying hard substrate in the case of too high force.\n24\n,\n25\nWith the aim of defining the appropriate force that should be applied to spinal cord tissue, force curves were performed on uninjured spinal cord sample (sham, on white and gray matter areas), with force values corresponding to 10, 25, 50, and 75% of the maximal force threshold allowed by the AFM system (corresponding to \u223c2.8, 7.8, 13.2, and 19.4 nN based on a force threshold of 26.4 nN). This force threshold value depends on the sensitivity of photodiode and the spring constant of cantilever. Representative force curves are shown in\nFig. 1B\n. Between 4 and 5\u2009\u03bcm of Z-displacement, we observed a progressive increase of the force indicating the contact between the sample and the AFM tip (decreasing Z indicates movement closer to the sample). From this contact point, the slope of the force curve reflects the mechanical properties of the tissue sample. Between 1 and 2\u2009\u03bcm of Z-displacement, a change of slope is noted, in particular in the 25, 50, and 75% maximal force threshold curves (\nFig. 1B\n). This change in slope is consistent with a second distinct mechanical behavior likely caused by an effect of the underlying rigid glass substrate when the tissue indentation is over 30% of the tissue thickness (tissue slice cut at 10\u2009\u03bcm thickness).\nFor soft tissue, the contact point can be difficult to determine accurately and depends on the judgment of the experimenter and/or data analysis software. To avoid misidentification and considering the low force variation, a contact point threshold has been determined relative to the force applied on a sample. The contact point is defined when the force reaches a value corresponding to 5% of the applied force (\nFig. 1C\n). As an example, if the force curve is performed at 6 nN as the final applied force, the contact point is at 0.3 nN.\nFrom this contact point, the fitting of the force curve by spherical Hertz's model is used to estimate the elastic modulus.\n18\u201320\nIn the Hertz theory on the deformation of two bodies in contact under load, the mathematical model is based on the assumption that the tissue section is an infinite half-space.\n18\u201320\nExperimentally, all tissue samples have a finite thickness, which is a violation of the assumption. In the literature, several studies have demonstrated the effect of thin finite thickness on elastic modulus values and proposed some corrective factors to re-adjust the hertzian indentation model in case of one or several violating assumptions.\n18\n,\n26\u201328\nIn our study, to be close to Hertz's assumptions, the Hertz model fitting has been restricted to the first micron of indentation from the contact point, as shown in\nFigure 1C\n. This 1\u2009\u03bcm indentation represents 10% of the tissue thickness (tissue slices cut at 10\u2009\u03bcm thickness), as usually recommended in the literature,\n21\n,\n25\n,\n28\nand also minimizes the effect of the underlying hard substrate.\nIn\nFigure 1D\n, the mean elastic values of uninjured spinal cord tissue measured from two uninjured mice are represented as a function of the applied force (percentage relative to the maximal force threshold). Each marker in the graph is the mean Young's modulus value of 10 force curves performed in the area of interest. In total, two areas were analyzed per slice and two non-consecutive tissue slices (cut at 10\u2009\u03bcm thickness) per animal. The elastic modulus increases at the same time that the force applied on the sample goes up with a significant difference in some cases, as between values at 25% compared with 75% of force threshold for example (see full statistical results in\nSupplementary Table S1\n). The mechanical change observed on force curves in\nFigure 1B\ncould explain this difference.\nFor measurements taken at 10% of force threshold, elastic modulus is around 219 Pa, which is 2 times lower than values found for 25% of force threshold (414 Pa) but with no statistically significant difference (\nSupplementary Table S1\n). To respect the Hertz model and the assumption of infinitesimal strains, small loads are recommended, but unfortunately they can lead to low signal-to-noise ratios.\n28\nBased on these observations, our AFM microindentation experiments on mouse spinal cord tissue in the remainder of this study were performed using a 25% maximum force threshold (corresponding to \u223c5\u20137 nN) to avoid experimental noise (may be the case at 10% maximum force threshold) and the influence of the hard substrate (observed for 50% and 75% maximum force threshold,\nFig. 1B\n).\nTo investigate the loading rate effect, force curves were performed on mouse spinal cord tissue at 0.5, 1, and 2\u2009Hz, representing a speed rate of 10, 20.6, and 41.1\u2009\u03bcm/s respectively for a ramp size of 10\u2009\u03bcm. Elastic modulus values from 10 force curves were averaged per area (\nFig. 1E\n). Two different areas were analyzed per tissue slice and two non-consecutive slices were considered per animal for a total of two mice (uninjured animal group) included in this AFM parameter study. Li et al. have demonstrated for cells the dependence of Young's modulus on the loading rate due to the contribution of cell viscosity.\n29\nIn our study on spinal cord tissue, we did not observe any significant relationship between the elastic modulus and the loading rate (\nFig. 1E\nand\nSupplementary Table S2\n). For all following AFM experiments in this study, the scan rate was set at 1\u2009Hz.\nA recently published study by Vishwakarma et al. demonstrated that sample cryopreservation does not affect the structural organization and the ECM composition of meningeal tissue.\n30\nHowever, to verify that a single sample freeze-thaw cycle is not excessively disruptive to the mechanical properties of the tissue being measured, we have compared our frozen/thawing tissue process with a fresh tissue process adapted from Koser et al.\n16\nFrom the same uninjured spinal cords, two consecutive transverse segments were prepared using the frozen/thawing tissue process and the fresh tissue process, and both samples were analyzed by AFM in parallel. Spinal cord stiffness was not significantly different between these two sample preparation processes (\nFig. 1F\n,\n\u200b\np\np\n=\u20090.3823). Experiments on the stiffness of injured mouse spinal cord in the remainder of this study were performed using cryopreserved tissue samples.\nIn total, we analyzed three different tissue sections per mouse and four mice per condition: control/sham (uninjured spinal cords, 12 weeks post-sham injury; Sham 1\u20134), injured with saline vehicle treatment (saline-treated injured spinal cords,12 WPI; Saline 1\u20134), and injured with IMP treatment (IMP-treated injured spinal cords, 12 WPI; IMP 1\u20134). For each tissue section and condition, two different areas of interest were considered: gray and white matter for uninjured samples, and lesion core and rim for injured samples. Finally, 25 force curves at different points were performed in each area.\nAFM microindentation measurements also were used to create stiffness maps to study the spatial distribution of spinal cord stiffness. Taking into account the AFM piezo system limitation (150\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u2009\u03bcm\n2\nmaximum), 64 force curves were performed in a grid pattern using MIRO 2.0 software to complete a map of 8\u2009\u00d7\u20098 pixels with a space of 11\u201315\u2009\u03bcm between each point. The final stiffness maps have spatial dimensions between 90\u2009\u00d7\u200990\u2009\u03bcm\n2\nand 120\u2009\u00d7\u2009120\u2009\u03bcm\n2\n. Dimensions of all stiffness maps are indicated in\nSupplementary Table S3\n. The color maps were made using Prism software (heat map, version 8.0.1) with every color representing the actual elastic modulus value measured on that tissue slice. The scale bar has a gradient of color from blue for the lowest elastic values (200 Pa) to red for the highest values (11,000 Pa) and intermediate values in yellow (approximately 600 Pa).The elastic modulus values determined during the stiffness map experiments were not used to compare injured animal groups with the controls.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nMice were euthanized via CO\n2\ninhalation and transcardially perfused with ice-cold PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Spinal cords were removed and post-fixed for 2\u2009h in 4% PFA on ice. Samples were dehydrated overnight in 30% sucrose at 4\u00b0C and then embedded in O.C.T. compound. Embedded tissues were sectioned into 20-\u03bcm thick sagittal sections on a Leica CM3050S cryostat and collected onto gelatin subbed microscope slides (Fisher Scientific). Slides were washed in PBS-T (0.05% Triton X-100), blocked for 2\u2009h in blocking media (5% normal goat serum in PBS-T), and incubated with primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight in blocking media. Primary and secondary antibodies used are listed in\nSupplementary Table S4\n. Stained sections were mounted in ProLong Gold (Molecular Probes) and images were acquired with a Leica SP5 AOBS confocal microscope. Large format images were stitched using the native Leica Application Suite - Advanced Fluorescence software.\n\nMouse astrocyte cultures\nTimed pregnant C57BL/6 wild-type dams were provided by Charles River. Astrocyte monolayer cultures were prepared from the cortices of post-natal day 2 pups.\n31\nNeonates were decapitated, brains were extracted, and the meninges carefully removed. The neocortex was isolated, washed in sterile Dulbecco's PBS (DPBS; Corning), triturated, and plated on tissue culture treated flasks (Corning) in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM)/F12 (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone) and 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009penicillin, streptomycin, and L-glutamine (Invitrogen). Media were changed the day after plating and every 4 days thereafter. When cells became confluent (approximately 10 days), the flasks were sealed and shaken overnight at 225 RPM, 37\u00b0C to remove oligodendroglia. The following day, the remaining astrocyte monolayers were washed in sterile DPBS (Corning), treated with 0.25% trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Gibco), and passaged onto fresh tissue culture flasks. All experiments described in this article were performed immediately after the second passage (P2).\nBefore use for rigidity experiments, CytoSoft variable elastic modulus plates (Advanced BioMatrix) and control plastic plates were coated with poly-D-lysine (PDL) according to the manufacturer suggested protocol. Briefly, 1\u2009mg/mL PDL stock (Millipore) was diluted 1:50 in warm, sterile DPBS to create a working PDL concentration of 20\u2009\u03bcg/mL. 3 mL of the PDL solution was added to each well and incubated for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Newly coated wells were then washed twice with warm culture medium before use. CytoSoft plates use a 500\u2009\u03bcm thick biocompatible silicone coating to produce a culture surface with a certified elastic modulus. The CytoSoft silicone coating is uniformly functionalized with an anhydride group to ensure efficient and homogeneous protein coating.\n32\nEach lot of CytoSoft plates is independently tested by the manufacturer to ensure that the elastic modulus of the culture surface falls within quality control tolerances.\n33\nWe used 200 Pa and 2000 Pa plates in our experiments.\n\nHuman embryonic stem cell-derived astrocyte cultures\nThe H7 human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line was maintained on Matrigel (Corning) coated six-well plates in mTeSR1 (STEMCELL Technologies) medium. The medium was changed every day and the cells were passaged every 5\u20137 days using ReleSR (STEMCELL Technologies) following the manufacturer's instructions. For astroglial differentiation, H7 hESCs were dissociated using Accutase (Millipore) and plated as single cells on Matrigel or on poly-L-ornithine (PLO) (15\u2009\u03bcg/mL; Sigma)/Laminin (10\u2009\u03bcg/mL; Roche) double-coated culture vessels at a density of 200,000 to 250,000 cells/cm\n2\nin STEMdiff Neural Induction Medium (NIM) (STEMCELL Technologies) supplemented with 10 mol/L ROCK Inhibitor Y-27632 (Stemgent) for 24\u2009h. Medium was replaced daily, and cells were passaged after 7 days using Accutase.\nAfter the first passage, neural progenitor cells (NPCs) were passaged once they reached 70\u201380% confluency and plated at a density between 125,000 and 200,000 cells/cm\n2\n. At passage 3, the medium was switched to STEMdiff Neural Progenitor Medium (NPM) (STEMCELL Technologies). From this point onward, the cells were passaged every 7 days using Accutase and the medium was replaced every other day. At passage 5, the NPCs were either cryopreserved in STEMdiff Neural Progenitor Freezing Medium (STEMCELL Technologies) and stored in liquid nitrogen for future use or re-suspended in STEMdiff Astrocyte Differentiation Medium and plated in either Matrigel or PLO/Laminin at a density of 100,000 cells/cm\n2\n. At passage 7, the astrocyte precursors generated were matured using STEMdiff Astrocyte Maturation Medium (AMM) (STEMCELL Technologies) and maintained in AMM thereafter. Before plating the astrocytes (passages 9\u201312) in the CytoSoft plates, the cells were adapted to poly-D-Lysine (Millipore) for 7 days. For rigidity experiments, the same procedure outlined above in the \u201cMouse astrocyte cultures\u201d section was used.\n\nImmunocytochemistry of cultures\nAstrocyte cultures were washed with sterile PBS and fixed with 4% PFA for 20\u2009min directly on the CytoSoft plates. Fixed cells were washed in PBS-T (0.05% Triton X-100) and incubated with primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight in blocking media (5% normal goat serum in PBS-T). Primary and secondary antibodies used are listed in\nSupplementary Table S4\n. Stained wells were mounted with ProLong Gold (Molecular Probes). Images were acquired with a 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009LD objective on a Zeiss Axiovert 200\u2009m epifluorescence microscope. Cells were quantified in 10 fields from each well. Quantification of astrocyte cell morphology was performed by blinded investigators using the Cell Counter tool and Threshold + the Analyze Particles tool in Fiji Is Just ImageJ (Fiji).\n34\nWhen automatically quantifying cell size and morphology with the Analyze Particles tool, a particle area of 50\u2009\u03bcm\n2\nwas used as the lower cutoff for cell size to exclude background speckles. Quantification of human astrocyte cell morphology was performed by blinded investigators manually outlining individual cells using Polygon Selections + the Measure tool in Fiji.\n\nWestern blot analysis of cultures\nFour days after plating on CytoSoft substrates, cells were lysed in Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (M-PER) (Thermo Scientific) supplemented with HALT protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 21,100 g for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C and protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Thermo Scientific) with a standard curve of bovine serum albumin (BSA). Protein lysates were combined with Laemmli buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol and boiled at 95\u00b0C for 10\u2009min before loading. Samples were resolved with SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore), and blocked with 5% milk. Primary and secondary antibodies used are listed in\nSupplementary Table S4\n. Blots were developed on Amersham Hyperfilm ECL (GE Healthcare) using ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Scientific). Membranes were stripped and re-probed with Restore Western Blot Stripping Buffer (Thermo Scientific). Films were scanned using a CanoScan 9000F scanner (Canon) and quantified using the Analyze Gels tool in Fiji.\n\nComputational quantification of glial process alignment\nConfocal image stacks were acquired from midsagittal spinal cord sections co-stained with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and fibronectin using a 40\u2009\u00d7\u2009oil immersion objective. (see\nSupplementary Table S4\nfor a list of antibodies used.) Image stacks were opened in Fiji and pre-processed with the Max Intensity Z-Projection and Split Channels tools to isolate the GFAP channel. The resulting images were imported into CurveAlign software (\nhttps://loci.wisc.edu/software/curvealign\n).\n35\nIndividual fiber overlay visualizations were generated using the CT-FIRE module. Alignment heatmaps and curvelet overlay visualizations were generated using the default Curvelets Fiber Representation (CFR) mode. Foursquare 128\u2009\u00d7\u2009128 pixel regions of interest (ROIs), approximately 50\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u200950\u2009\u03bcm, were chosen per confocal image (four images per mouse) by a blinded investigator. These ROIs were selected along the GFAP\n+\nlesion rim to contain astrocytes that are in direct contact with the fibronectin\n+\nfibrotic scar core. CurveAlign automatically calculated the mean curvelet angle and alignment coefficient for each image and ROI. The alignment coefficient is a normalized, unitless, measure of fiber alignment with possible values between 0 (perfectly random fiber orientation) and 1 (perfect alignment).\n\nStatistical analyses\nAll data are presented as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM). In box and whisker plots, the box indicates the 25th and 75th percentiles of the values, the line inside the box is the median value, and the whiskers the smallest and largest values. GraphPad Prism software (versions 5.04 and 8.0.1) was used to perform statistical analysis of the data and a pre-determined significance level of\np\n<\u20090.05 was used. No outlier values were excluded from any experiments. For AFM experiments, non-parametric Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis (Dunn's multiple comparison) tests were used to compare two and multiple groups, respectively. For the other experiments, two-group comparisons were performed using Student's\nt\ntest. Multiple group comparisons used analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's post hoc test.\n\nData availability\nThe data presented in this study are available from the corresponding author upon request."

    "Methods": "Participants\nTBI patients were recruited from four different pediatric intensive care units located in level 1 and 2 trauma centers in Los Angeles County. Patients were included if they experienced a moderate-to-severe non-penetrating TBI, with intake or post-resuscitation GCS between 3 and 12 (or higher if there were confirmed abnormalities on clinical imaging), if they were between 8 and 18 years of age at the time of injury, had normal visual acuity or corrected vision with contact lenses or eyeglasses, and had sufficient English skills to understand instructions and participate in neurocognitive testing presuming English competence.\nParticipants were excluded if they had previous head injury, motor deficits precluding them from participating in the test protocols, or other significant pre-trauma history of neurological, developmental, or psychiatric disorders. Healthy control participants were matched on age, sex, and educational level to the TBI patients and were recruited from the community through flyers, magazines, and school postings. With the exception of criteria for TBI injury severity, healthy control participants met the same inclusion and exclusion criteria as TBI patients. Finally, participants were excluded from the MRI part of the study if they were not eligible for MRI (e.g., because of having metal implants that were not MRI compatible). The study was approved by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) institutional review board and the institutional review boards of each site from which patients were recruited.\nThe study design has been described in greater detail elsewhere.\n10\nFifty patients were included in the overall study. However, because fMRI data collection was initiated late in the project, a total of 18 (4 female) patients had both task-fMRI and IHTT data collected at the same time point of sufficient quality to be included in this study. A group of 26 (11 female) demographically matched controls, with both task-fMRI and IHTT data, was also included. The TBI group was further divided into subgroups based on IHTT as previously described.\n10\nBriefly, electroencephalography was recorded using a BIOSEMI system (BioSemi, Amsterdam, the Netherlands; sampling rate\u2009=\u2009512\u2009Hz, low-pass filter\u2009=\u200940Hz, high-pass filter\u2009=\u20090.16\u2009Hz, bandwidth [3 dB]\u2009=\u2009134\u2009Hz) while participants performed a pattern matching task with bilateral field advantage. Stimuli for each trial were presented randomly and pairwise in two of four visual fields (upper and lower; right and left), creating four\nbilateral\nand two\nunilateral\nconditions.\nParticipants were asked to indicate whether the two stimuli (patterns) constituted a \u201cmatch\u201d or \u201cnon-match\u201d by pressing a keyboard. The responding hand (right or left) was alternated in eight blocks of 97 trials each. ERPs time-locked to the stimulus presentation were calculated from parietal (P3/P4) and occipital (O1/O2) electrodes. The peak latency (in milliseconds) of the early visual N1 (typically observed \u223c150\u2013200\u2009ms post-stimulus presentation) component was determined and averaged for the right and left hemisphere. An overall IHTT was calculated by averaging left to right and right to left differences (IHTTs) based on data from the\nunilateral\nconditions. Longer IHTT indicates slower transfer of visual information between the hemispheres, which is a basic and robust measure of neuronal efficiency, given that the N1 component reflects early visual registration occurring before any involvement of domain-specific higher cognitive operations, such as those reflected in\ncognitive\nERPs, such as the P3.\n5\nIn the overall study, IHTT had a skewed distribution in the msTBI patients, with around half of the group having scores within 1.5 standard deviations (SDs) of the normal range, as calculated based on data from the healthy control group.\n4\nThe balance of the TBI group had slow IHTT outside the normal range (>1.5 SDs below the mean of the control group). The bimodal properties of the data therefore supported a meaningful cutoff for defining slow IHTT as being above 1.5 SDs of the mean of healthy controls.\n4\nThis cutoff has been successfully used in our earlier studies showing that TBI patients with slow IHTT had poor white matter organization, long-term neurodegeneration, and poor cognitive outcome.\n4\n,\n13\u201315\nIn the current study, subjects with an IHTT score of >1.5 SDs (\u226518\u2009ms) from the mean of the entire healthy control group that was included in the overall study\n10\nwere allocated to the \u201cTBI slow\u201d group (\nn\n=\u20097, 1 female), and the remaining patients were included in the \u201cTBI normal\u201d group (\nn\n=\u200911, 3 female).

For measures where all groups had data, separate analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with group (TBI slow, TBI normal, and controls) as a between-subject factor and each dependent variable as a within-group factor were performed. Statistically significant main effects were followed up by pair-wise between-group contrasts. For TBI-related measures, pair-wise comparisons using an independent\nt\n-test were applied. The acceptance level for statistically significant results was set to\np\n<\u20090.05, and partial eta squared (\n\u03b7\n\u03c1\n2\n) was calculated as a measure of effect size.\nIBM SPSS Statistics Version 24 was used for statistical analysis of demographic, clinical, and behavioral data.\n\nSpatial working memory task\nBOLD fMRI was acquired during performance of a parametric spatial working memory task. Before each trial, four squares appeared on the screen, indicating the spatial locations where stimuli could appear. After each trial, these squares were replaced with triangles, indicating that the participant should start responding. For each trial, one to five pictures (items) of fruits and vegetables were sequentially presented for 800\u2009ms within the four possible different locations on the screen. Interstimulus time was 200\u2009ms, and intertrial time was 1500\u2009ms (from the last response to the beginning of a new sequence). Subjects were instructed to attend to the four positions on the screen and reproduce the order of the presentation (not what pictures were presented) by using a response box with four buttons (Current Designs, Winona, MN) corresponding to the respective spatial locations. Because several similar objects were presented (e.g., 25 different apples), respondents were not able to associate a unique word with each stimulus, thereby minimizing verbal mediation as a working memory strategy.\nParticipants were asked to respond as quickly and accurately as possible. All participants completed a practice session before the actual fMRI using a mock setup before their scan to ensure understanding of task instructions.\nTask demands were manipulated in a parametric manner giving four trial types with different WML: baseline (one item), WML 3 (three items), WML 4 (four items), and WML 5 (five items). The task consisted of a total of 128 trials divided into 32 trials of each trial type, divided into four equally long time epochs that were balanced with regard to WML and intratrial sequence order to avoid potential order effects. Stimuli were presented through a head-coil mounted mirror system and an in-house custom-built MRI compatible video projector (Staglin Center, UCLA). The task design was implemented using the PsychToolbox in Matlab (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA). A log file containing behavioral data was stored, and response time and the number of correct responses were computed separately for each WML as measures of accuracy and response speed.\n\nAnalysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging behavioral data\nMeans and SDs for each behavioral measure were calculated separately for the respective groups (\nTable 2\n). To investigate within- and between-group effects of WML, separate repeated-measures ANOVAs with group (TBI slow, TBI normal, and controls) as the between-subject factor and WML (baseline, WML 3, WML 4, and WML 5) as the within-group factor were performed. Mauchley's test was used to investigate the assumption of sphericity of the data, and a Greenhouse-Geisser correction was used if this assumption was violated. Statistically significant main effects were followed up by pair-wise between-group contrasts. Subsequent polynomial trend analyses were used to further evaluate the expected linear WML effects. The acceptance level for statistically significant results was set to\np\n<\u20090.05. Partial eta squared (\n\u03b7\n\u03c1\n2\n) was calculated as a measure of effect size.\nTable 2.\nWorking Memory fMRI Task Performance\nVariable\nGroup\nn\nBaseline\nWML 3\nWML 4\nWML 5\nmean (SD)\nmean (SD)\nmean (SD)\nmean (SD)\nAccuracy (correct responses)\nControls\n26\n31.19 (1.88)\n26.92 (4.87)\n24.65 (5.75)\n22.00 (7.38)\nTBI normal\n11\n30.81 (1.47)\n24.64 (5.97)\n22.73 (6.08)\n17.91 (7.11)\nTBI slow\n7\n31.14 (1.21)\n26.57 (4.69)\n25.29 (3.15)\n21.71 (4.79)\nResponse speed (seconds)\nControls\n26\n0.814 (.245)\n1.637 (0.378)\n*\n2.116 (0.533)\n*\n2.784 (1.109)\nTBI normal\n11\n1.113 (.594)\n2.156 (0.523)\n*\n2.766 (0.730)\n*\n3.256 (0.772)\nTBI slow\n7\n0.764 (.065)\n1.731 (0.405)\n2.169 (0.406)\n2.846 (0.649)\nOpen in a separate window\n*\nPair-wise statistically significant difference,\np\n<\u20090.05.\nfMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging; WML, working memory load; SD, standard deviation; TBI, traumatic brain injury; IHTT, interhemispheric transfer time.\n\nScan acquisition\nAll scans were performed on a Siemens Trio with a 12-channel Head Matrix Coil (Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany). Foam pads around the subjects' heads were used to reduce head motion. During the parametric spatial working memory task, T2*-weighted BOLD fMRI was acquired utilizing an echo-planar imaging pulse sequence (repetition time\u2009=\u20092400\u2009ms, echo time\u2009=\u200935\u2009ms, field of view\u2009=\u2009244\u2009mm, matrix\u2009=\u200980\u2009\u00d7\u200980, slice thickness\u2009=\u20093\u2009mm, number of slices\u2009=\u200940, giving an in-plane resolution of 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm). A T1-weighted three-dimensional magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) volume was acquired for anatomical reference.\n\nAnalysis of magnetic resonance imaging data\nAll analyses were performed using the FMRIB's Software Library (FSL) toolbox (version 5.0.7; FMRIB Centre, Oxford, UK). Non-brain structures were removed with BET.\n21\nThe fMRI data were motion corrected with MCFLIRT,\n22\nsmoothed (Gaussian kernel full width at half maximum, 6\u2009mm), grand mean normalized, high-pass temporal filtered (50\u2009sec), and linearly registered to native high-resolution space (T1 MPRAGE), using a 7 degrees of freedom spatial transformation.\n22\n,\n23\nA transformation matrix was created by registration of the high-resolution T1 MPRAGE to a 2-mm Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard template using 12 degrees of freedom, and fMRI data were subsequently transformed into standard MNI space by applying the same transformation matrix.\nBOLD activation was modeled using a general linear model, and the hemodynamic response function was convolved with a standard Gamma variate. A main contrast was computed to model the linear increase of BOLD activation as a function of WML (baseline, WML 3, WML 4, and WML 5). It is important for the validity of fMRI studies comparing patient and healthy control groups that task performance in the included contrasts is highly similar.\n19\nTherefore, only trials with correct performance were included. First, all fMRI contrasts were computed for each participant using a fixed-effects model. Then, mixed-effects models with automatic outlier deweighting were used to create statistical parametric maps (SPMs) and to investigate group differences and within-group associations. The main analysis focused on investigating differences between the predefined IHTT groups: TBI slow, TBI normal, and healthy controls.\nTo substantiate our findings, we evaluated the clinical and functional relevance of the BOLD activations by performing within-group analyses for the full TBI sample, evaluating associations with age, IHTT (as a continuous variable), the CPI, injury severity (GCS score at admission), and time post-injury (number of weeks). In the control group, we evaluated associations with age, IHTT, and the clinical neurocognitive performance index.\nAll SPMs were corrected for multiple comparisons by applying a cluster threshold of\nZ\n>\u20092.3 and a cluster significance threshold of\np\n<\u20090.05. Peak\nZ\n-values with up to five local maxima and the size of clusters (number of voxels) in standard 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009mm MNI space were extracted. For anatomical denotation, visual inspection and the Harvard Oxford cortical and subcortical structural brain atlases as incorporated in FSL were applied."

Treatment with small molecules from day 0 to day 7 was as follows: 1\u2009\u03bcM dorsomorphin (Millipore), 2\u2009\u03bcM SB431542 (Tocris Bioscience), and 3\u2009\u03bcM CHIR99021 (Miltenyi Biotec). On day 8, the neuroepithelial layer was enzymatically dissociated using dispase (GIBCO, 1\u2009mg/mL), plated onto laminin-coated plates and next patterned for 7 days with 0.5\u2009\u03bcM retinoic acid and 1\u03bcM Purmorphamine, followed by further 4 days with 0.1\u2009\u03bcM Purmorphamine. To promote the gliogenic switch, neural precursors were then subjected to a propagation phase (> 60 days) with 10\u2009ng/mL FGF-2 (Peprotech) before terminal differentiation for a minimum of 2 weeks in 10\u2009ng/mL bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)4 and 10\u2009ng/mL leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), allowing the generation of high-purity astrocytic cultures (> 95% astrocytes) as previously described.\n20\nUsing this protocol, we have in previous articles shown that these astrocytes are similar to those of human origin using RNAseq and immunocytochemistry (showing that they express >90% of the astrocytic markers glutamate aspartate transformer [GLAST], glutamate transporter [GLT]-1, glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP], and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member L1 [ALDH1L1]) as well as functionally characterizing these astrocytes by analyzing responses to physiological calcium stimuli (adenosine triphosphate [ATP]) and cytokine stimulation assays.\n19\u201321\nThis study utilized two control lines in total; one commercially available, named CTRL 2 from Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ (cat. number ND41866*C) and the other (CTRL 1) reprogrammed in-house from donor fibroblasts.\n22\nThis line was obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Selina Wray as a gift.\n\nEnriched motor neuron (MN) culture preparation\niPSCs were maintained on Geltrex (Life Technologies) with Essential 8 Medium media (Life Technologies), and passaged using EDTA (Life Technologies, 0.5mM). All cell cultures were maintained at 37\u00b0C and 5% carbon dioxide. MN differentiation was performed using an adapted version of a previously published protocol (Hall et al., 2017). Briefly, iPSCs were first differentiated from neuroepithelium by plating to 100% confluency in chemically defined medium consisting of DMEM/F12 Glutamax, Neurobasal, L- Glutamine, N2 supplement, non-essential amino acids, B27 supplement, \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (all from Life Technologies) and insulin (Sigma).

On day 8, the neuroepithelial layer was enzymatically dissociated using dispase (GIBCO, 1\u2009mg/mL), plated onto laminin coated plates and next patterned for 7 days with 0.5\u2009\u03bcM retinoic acid and 1\u03bcM Purmorphamine. At day 14, MN precursors were treated with 0.1\u03bcM Purmorphamine for a further 4 days before being terminally differentiated in 0.1\u2009\u03bcM Compound E (Enzo Life Sciences) to promote cell cycle exit.\n\nCytokine induction\nEach of the two experimental blocks was technically duplicated (i.e., two culture wells). Each culture well was further technically duplicated (i.e., two supernatants isolated per time point) as described. This resulted in 18 experimental samples (2 technical repeats for each of 3 different inducing cytokine concentrations at 3 different time points) and three unstimulated control samples (technical repeats).\nHuman recombinant IL-1\u03b2 (#11457756001), IL-4 (#I4269), IL-6 (#I1395), IL-10 (#IL010), and TNF (#T6674) (all from Merck, Kenilworth, NJ) were each sourced as lyophilized powder, which was reconstituted according to the manufacturer's instructions. Serial dilution of a stock solution generated the final concentrations seen in\nTable 1\n. Each cytokine was used at three concentrations covering the range of concentrations seen in human microdialysis studies, adjusted for relative recovery determined\nin vivo.\n7\nWe also included somewhat higher doses to adjust for an early phase of injury before microdialysis monitoring was instituted (\nTable 1\n). The cytokine solution (10\u2009\u03bcL) was added to 990\u2009\u03bcL of culture within each well to make up the desired final concentration within 1\u2009mL at the time of medium replacement. Cell cultures were then returned to an incubator.\nTable 1.\nCytokine Concentrations Used to Induce a Downstream Cytokine Response\nConcentration\nIL-1b\nIL-6\nTNF\nIL-4\nIL-10\nRange seen physiologically\n0.02\u201321\n0.15\u20134990\n0.05\u201323\n0.1\u201337\n0.8\u2013173\nLow\n1\u2009pg/mL\n100\u2009pg/mL\n1\u2009pg/mL\n1\u2009pg/mL\n1\u2009pg/mL\nMedium\n100\u2009pg/mL\n10,000\u2009pg/mL\n100\u2009pg/mL\n100\u2009pg/mL\n100\u2009pg/mL\nHigh\n10,000\u2009pg/mL\n1,000,000\u2009pg/mL\n10,000\u2009pg/mL\n10,000\u2009pg/mL\n10,000\u2009pg/mL\nOpen in a separate window\nIL, interleukin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor.\nCytokine concentrations used to stimulate the enriched astrocyte cultures.

Recombinant human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist in severe traumatic brain injury: a phase II randomized control trial. J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 34, 845-851.\n\nSample collection and storage\nSupernatant (60\u2009\u03bcL) was taken from each cell culture well at the given time points (24\u2009h, 48\u2009h, and 72\u2009h), including control lines (\nn\n=\u20093 technical repeats). The cells were collected at 1\u2009h, 24\u2009h, 48\u2009h, and 72\u2009h following addition of the respective cytokine and from untreated cultures (\nn\n=\u20093 per time point). Samples were stored at -80\u00b0C until analysis.\n\nCytokine analysis\nEach experimental condition/technical repeat was analyzed in duplicate (i.e., two samples per experimental cell culture well). The supernatants were analysed using the Procartaplex\u2122 39-PLEX, Human Cytokine/Chemokine 39 (Thermofisher, Waltham, MA) using the manufacturer's instructions as previously described,\n17\nwith overnight incubation. As described, the time points 0 (for control wells), 24, 48, and 72\u2009h were analyzed. The plates were analyzed on a Luminex 200 platform (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX). As per manufacture's recommendation, cytokine concentrations were calculated by reference to an eight-point five-parameter logistical standard curve for each cytokine.\n\nImmunocytochemistry\nFor immunocytochemistry, astrocytes were plated onto clear bottom 96 well plates (Falcon). These were fixed with 4% fresh paraformaldehyde for 10\u2009min at room temperature before being washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Samples were then blocked for 1\u2009h at room temperature with 0.3% Triton/PBS/5% goat serum before being incubated overnight with primary antibody in 0.1% Triton/PBS/5% goat serum at 4\u00b0C. Primary antibodies used were mouse monoclonal anti-GFAP (Clone G-A-5, 1:500, Sigma-Aldrich) and rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3 (1:300, Cell Signaling Technology #9661). After three washes in PBS, a secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 488 or 568, 1:1000) in 0.1% Triton/PBS/5% goat serum was next applied for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (100\u2009ng/mL).\nImages were acquired using the automated Opera Phenix High-Content Screening System (Perkin Elmer). For automated image analysis, the Columbus Image Analysis System (Perkin Elmer) was used. Five non-overlapping fields per well were acquired, and two wells per condition (total >5000 cells) were analyzed.\n\nRNA extraction, sequencing, and analysis\nSingle-stranded RNAseq data was generated from iPSC-derived astrocytes and was analyzed alongside previously published RNAseq data from iPSC-derived MN.\n19\nBoth MN and astrocyte cultures were derived from the same control iPSC lines using two biological repeats in technical duplicate and were processed using the same workflow described subsequently. In addition to using two lines (from two different people), we additionally used two independent neural inductions from each of these lines, as we reasoned that this would allow us to incorporate both inter- and intra-patient variability while increasing the power by conducting a second experimental block for each line. Each of the two experimental blocks was technically duplicated (i.e., two culture wells).\nA Promega Maxwell RSC simplyRNA cells kit including DNase treatment, alongside a Maxwell RSC instrument, was used for RNA extractions. A NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to assess RNA concentration and the 260/280 ratio, and an Agilent Bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was used to assess quality. RNA integrity (RIN) scores were >8 for all samples used in this work. RNAseq libraries were prepared using a Truseq stranded mRNA kit (Illumina) with 1\u2009\u03bcg input RNA. The products were then purified and enriched with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification to create the final cDNA libraries. Libraries were sent for high throughput sequencing, run for 75 cycles on a rapid flow cell, at the Institute of Neurology's next generation sequencing (NGS) core facility using the Hiseq2500. RNA-seq data were generated from poly(A)+ RNA. After removing the adapter sequences and quality checking the data using FastQC, the reads were initially aligned to ribosomal RNA sequences to filter out reads that might have come from ribosomal RNA contamination using bowtie2 (-v 0). The remaining reads were then aligned to the human genome (h19) using the splice aware aligner TopHat2 with default parameters. The absolute quantification of the genes was performed using HTSeqcount. The raw read count files obtained were then processed for unsupervised clustering analysis. The EdgeR package in R was used to generate normalized reads per kilobase of transcript (RPKM) values. For corresponding cytokine receptors for the inducing cytokines, these values were mean centralized and plotted using R version 3.2.3 (\nTable S1\n). All libraries used had <1% ribosomal RNA (rRNA), <1% mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), >90% strandedness, and >70% exonic reads (data not shown).\n\nClinical cytokine data from TBI patients\nWe extracted data from two previously published studies from our group describing the temporal profiles and concentrations of cytokines from severe TBI patients.\n7\n,\n23\nIn a pilot trial of IL-1 receptor antagonist treatment for TBI, we used brain cytokine concentrations from the placebo group.\n23\nDemographic data for all patients are available in\nTable S2\n, including age, gender, admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and head computerized tomography (CT) verifiable injury as defined by the Marshall CT classification (Grades II\u2013IV\u2009=\u2009diffuse and Grade VI\u2009=\u2009focal).\n24\nAs described in detail in the previous studies,\n7\n,\n23\npatients were monitored for a maximum of 5 consecutive days and cytokine/chemokine samples were pooled from 6\u2009h periods. Although there was some disparity in commencement of monitoring following ictus, all data have been adjusted to the trauma time to enable comparison with the\nin vitro\nexperiments.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe statistical program R, with the interface R-studio, was used for the analyses.\n25\nThe effect of each of the added cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF) on the measured cytokines (39 cytokine panel) was analyzed using a two way mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) (to compare concentrations of each cytokine analyzed). The time at which the sample was taken (\u201ctime\u201d; 24\u2009h, 48\u2009h, 72\u2009h) was used as the repeated measure (within-subject) variable. The concentration of added cytokine (\u201cconcentration\u201d; untreated, and three concentrations of added cytokine shown in\nTable 1\n) was used as the independent (between-subject) variable. A \u201ctime and concentration\u201d relationship was also generated to ascertain whether time and concentration as an interactive model affected downstream cytokine generation.\nFor the immunocytochemistry analyses, data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD) from two technical replicates. Two way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparison tests was performed.\nDescriptively, we compared the temporal profiles of cytokine release as well as concentrations\nin vivo\n, including from enriched neuronal cultures\nin vitro\n,\n17\nfrom previous studies and compared it with our results.\n7\n,\n23"

The mice weighed 28\u201346\u2009g; all animals were housed under standard conditions (21\u201323\u00b0C, 12\u2009h light/dark cycle) with unlimited access to standard food (Lactamin AB, Mj\u00f6lby, Sweden) and water.\nThe mice were assigned randomly to one of three experimental groups. Body weight was recorded throughout the study as a measure of general health. The experimental design was to expose 10-week-old mice to CHI using a weight-drop device with 2 or 5\u2009mm cone tip or sham treatment. The skull was then examined for evidence of visible fractures, as defined below. Animals with CHI were subdivided into non-fracture and fracture (mild, moderate, severe) groups for comparison. The neurobehavioral status of the mice was obtained at 2 and 24\u2009h after injury. Blood and brain tissue were collected at 12\u2009h or 1, 3, and 14 days post-TBI for quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), as described below. Before injury, a micro-CT was performed to quantify skull thickness at the impact site.\nThe timeline of experimental procedures is depicted in\nFigure 1\n. All studies involving animals were reported in accordance with the Animal Research: Reporting\nIn Vivo\nExperiments guidelines.\n25\n,\n26\nThe experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines reported in the EU Directive 2010/63/EU and in accordance with local laws and policies; all procedures were approved by the Latvian Animal Protection Ethical Committee of Food and Veterinary Service in Riga, Latvia.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSchematic illustration of the experimental design. TBI, traumatic brain injury; CHI, closed head injury; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; micro-CT, micro-computed tomography; qRT-PCR, quantitative reverse transcription: polymerase chain reaction. Color image is available online.\n\nChemicals\nIsoflurane was purchased from Chemical Point (Deisenhofen, Germany). Tramadol solution was purchased from KRKA (Novo Mesto, Slovenia). Physiological saline (0.9%) was purchased from Fresenius Kabi (Warsaw, Poland). Oxygen and nitrous oxide gases were purchased from AGA (Riga, Latvia).\n\nWD model\nThe WD model was performed as described previously.\n5\n,\n6\nBriefly, the mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane in a mixture of 50% nitrous oxide and 50% oxygen, and 2% isoflurane was maintained during the surgical procedure using a face mask. The depth of anesthesia was monitored by toe pinch. Before trauma induction, the mice received a subcutaneous (\nsc)\ninjection of tramadol (10\u2009mg/kg). A midline longitudinal scalp incision was made, and the skull was exposed. A cone with a tip diameter of 2 or 5\u2009mm was placed 2\u2009mm posterior and lateral to bregma, and a weight of 90\u2009g was dropped from a height of 8\u2009cm onto the cone.\nOxygen was applied for 20\u201340\u2009sec immediately after TBI. Then, the scalp wound was closed with a polypropylene 6-0 suture (Surgipro\nTM\nII, Covidien, Mansfield, MA), and the mice were returned to their home cages with free access to water and food. Sham animals underwent the same procedures as the animals in the TBI group, but without the release of the weight.\n\nNeurological severity score (NSS)\nBehavioral testing was performed by experienced scientists blinded to the experimental group. The neurobehavioral status of the mice was obtained by the NSS.\n5\nThe general neurological state of the mice was evaluated at baseline and 2\u2009h and 24\u2009h post-injury during the light part of the light\u2013dark cycle. The NSS consists of nine individual parameters, including motor function, alertness, and physiological behavior tasks.\nThe following items were assessed: presence of paresis; impairment of seeking behavior; absence of perceptible startle reflex; inability to get down from a rectangle platform (34\n\u00d7\n27\u2009cm); inability to walk on 3-, 2-, and 1-cm wide beams; and inability to balance on a 0.7-cm\u2013wide beam and a 0.5\u2009cm-diameter round beam for at least 15\u2009sec. If a mouse showed impairment in one of these items, then a value of 1 was added to its NSS. Thus, higher values for the NSS indicate more severe neurological impairment.\nThe severity of skull fractures was determined based on the parameters used to evaluate skull fractures in patients with small modifications: non (skull bone without changes/no signs of fracture), mild (isolated linear fracture with no evidence of intracranial lesion), moderate (linear depressed or diastatic fracture with minimal dural tear, no macroscopic evidence of hematoma or parenchyma injury), and severe (complicated fracture with macroscopic intracranial lesions, including parenchyma injury and hematomas).\n27\n,\n28\nThe severity of skull fracture was evaluated immediately after injury by macroscopic visualization, which is a rapid and simple method. Post-mortem micro-CT analysis of the parietal bone plates could provide more detailed results than macroscopic visualization, however.\n\nOpen-field test\nTo detect the motor activity of the animals, an open-field test was performed before and at 12\u2009h and 1, 3, and 14 days after TBI. The test apparatus was a square arena (44\u2009\u00d7\u200944\u2009cm) with a black floor. The moved distance and velocity in a 5-min session were recorded and analyzed using the EthoVision video tracking system (version XT 11.5; Noldus, Wageningen, The Netherlands).\n\nQuantitative RT-PCR analysis\nTo quantify the inflammatory response, the mouse brains were collected at 12\u2009h and 1, 3, and 14 days after trauma. Brain tissues were collected immediately after decapitation of the animals. Individual brain structures from both hemispheres were separated on ice and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. The brain samples were stored at -80\u00b0C until ribonucleic acid (RNA) isolation.\nQuantitative RT-PCR was performed using a previously described method\n29\nwith slight modifications. Total RNA was isolated from brain tissues using an RNA mini kit (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extracted RNA was dissolved in 50\u2009\u03bcL nuclease-free distilled water and stored at -80\u00b0C until further analysis. First-strand complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) was synthesized using a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) following the manufacturer's protocol.\nQuantitative RT-PCR analysis for IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and \u03b2-actin was performed using SYBR\n\u00ae\nGreen Master Mix (Life Technologies). The primer sequences used in this study were as follows: IL-6 (NM_001314054.1), 5 - TCT ATA CCA CTT CAC AAG TCG GA - 3 (forward) and 5 \u2013 GAA TTG CCA TTG CAC AAC TCT TT \u2013 3 (reverse); IL-1\u03b2 (NM_008361.4), 5 \u2013 GGG CCT CAA AGG AAA GAA TC \u2013 3 (forward) and 5 \u2013 TTG CTT GGG ATC CAC ACT CT \u2013 3 (reverse); TNF-\u03b1 (NM_013693.3), 5 \u2013 CCC TCA CAC TCA GAT CAT CTT CT \u2013 3 (forward) and 5 \u2013 GCT ACG ACG TGG GCT ACA G \u2013 3 (reverse); TIMP-1 (NM_011593.2), 5 \u2013 CAG TAA GGC CTG TAG CTG TGC \u2013 3 (forward) and 5 - AGG TGG TCT CGT TGA TTT CTG \u2013 3 (reverse); MMP-9 (NM_031055.1), 5 \u2013 TCG AAG GCG ACC TCA AGT G \u2013 3 (forward) and 5 \u2013 TTC GGT GTA GCT TTG GAT CCA \u2013 3 (reverse); and \u03b2-actin (NM_007393.5), 5 \u2013 CCT CTA TGC CAA CAC AGT GC\u2013 3 (forward) and 5 \u2013 CAT CGT ACT CCT GCT TGC TG\u2013 3 (reverse).\nThe primers were obtained from Metabion (Steinkirchen, Germany). The relative expression levels for each gene were calculated with the \u0394\u0394Ct method, normalized to the expression of \u03b2-actin and compared with the age-matched sham group.\n\nTIMP-1 and TNF-\u03b1 measurement in plasma\nBlood samples were collected after decapitation of the animals. Heparin was used to prevent blood clot formation. Blood samples were centrifuged at 3000\u2009rpm and 4\u00b0C for 10\u2009min (Heraeus\u2122 Biofuge\u2122 Stratos\u2122 Centrifuge, Thermo Fisher Scientific) to separate the plasma. Plasma was stored at -80\u00b0C. The ELISA was performed using Mouse TIMP1 SimpleStep ELISA\n\u00ae\nKit (Abcam, Boston, MA) and a Mouse TNF-\u03b1 ELISA Kit (EMD Millipore, Burlington, MA) following the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nMicro-CT analysis\nThe micro-CT imaging was performed before TBI. The mice were anesthetized using 4% isoflurane in a mixture of 50% nitrous oxide and 50% oxygen, followed by 1\u20131.5% isoflurane throughout the procedure. The micro-CT scans were acquired using 30\u2009keV, 0.95\u2009mA lamp energy with an exposure time of 250\u2009ms using a Trifoil InSyTe FLECT\n\u00ae\nimager (Chatsworth, CA). A total of 720 projections were acquired per rotation. Three-dimensional images on selected skull areas were reconstructed with a voxel size of 25\u2009\u03bcm using FluoroView 1.5 and Cobra 7.12.9 software. Qualitative and quantitative data were analyzed using VivoQuant 1.23 software.\nTo evaluate parietal bone thickness and density, a coronal section was taken. The frontal plane represents the coronal plane at the middle of the bregma and lambda sutures. By using coronal sections, the parietal bone gray scale value (radiological density) was measured in three regions (\nFig. 6B\n) of interest at five points in an equal interval. The coronal skull micro-CT images were divided into bone and non-bone regions by determining the threshold value using the automated Otsu method.\n30\nThe gray scale values of the mouse skull were used to evaluate bone density.\n31\u201333\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 6.\nMicro-CT image of a mouse skull with schematic illustration of the measurement parameters of mouse parietal bone thickness and density.

(\nB\n) The landmarks shown on a coronal section of parietal bone represent thickness and density measurement points (medial periphery\u20131, midline\u20132, and lateral periphery\u20133). Color image is available online.\n\nMeasurement of contusion surface area\nMice were anesthetized using a combination of ketamine (200\u2009mg/kg) and xylazine (15\u2009mg/kg) and perfused transcardially with 0.01\u2009M phosphate-buffered saline (1X PBS) for 5\u2009min at a speed of 3\u2009mL/min to remove blood from the tissue. Perfusion was switched to 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution in 1X PBS until stiffening of the mouse body. The brains were dissected carefully and fixed overnight in 4% PFA at 4\u00b0C. The dissected brains were washed in 1X PBS, dried, and photographed using a digital camera (Sony A900, Japan). The cortical contusion area was quantified using ImageJ software (version 1.52j).\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe statistical calculations were performed using the GraphPad Prism 8.1 software package (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to examine the distribution of the data. The Kruskal-Wallis test followed by the Dunn test was used for non-normally distributed data sets. A\npost hoc\ntest was performed if analysis of variance (ANOVA) or the Kruskal-Wallis test indicated statistically significant differences.\nTime and group interactions were analyzed by using two-way ANOVA and the Tukey test as the\npost hoc\ntest for multiple comparisons. Student\nt\ntest was used to compare differences between mouse weight and occurrence of fracture and differences between parietal bone thickness and gray scale values in animals without and with skull fractures. The Pearson correlation test was used to analyze the correlation between parietal bone thickness and animal weight. The\np\nvalues less than 0.05 were considered significant."

    "Methods": "Participants\nThis study was approved by the Medical College of Wisconsin Institutional Review Board and the Human Research Protection Office (HRPO). All participants provided written informed consent. The study design and methods of the NCAA-DoD CARE Consortium have been described elsewhere.\n13\nThe current report focuses on athletes that completed a 10-min resting-state scan (i.e., without presentation of visual or auditory stimuli) collected on a 32-channel head coil at three of the four CARE sites (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, UNC; University of Wisconsin-Madison, UW; University of California Los Angeles, UCLA) participating in the Advanced Research Core (ARC). For data consistency, data from the fourth site (Virginia Tech) are not included in this report because they were not collected on a 32-channel head coil. Contact sport athletes were enrolled at pre-season. Athletes who sustained a concussion completed multiple follow-up visits that included multi-modal neuroimaging data collection: 24\u201348\u2009h post-injury (24-h), following clearance to begin the RTP progression (asymptomatic), 7 days following unrestricted RTP (post-RTP), and 6 months post-injury. Concussions were diagnosed by research and medical staff of each participating institution based on the following definition: \u201cA change in brain function following a force to the head, which may be accompanied by temporary loss of consciousness, but is identified in awake individuals with measures of neurologic and cognitive dysfunction.\u201d\n27\nNon-injured contact sport athletes participated in multiple visits yoked to the schedule of demographically matched injured athletes. A matching algorithm was used to match control athletes to concussed athletes based on variables of institution, sport, gender, race/ethnicity, estimate of pre-morbid verbal intellectual functioning, concussion history, years of participation, status as a starter, and head impact exposure estimate or data if available. The current study focuses on the acute and sub-acute effects of concussion; thus, only data from the 24-h, asymptomatic, and post-RTP time-points are presented. A total of 93 concussed athletes and 82 control athletes met the criteria for this study. One injured athlete was determined to have acute, injury-related pathology based on a non-diagnostic clinical read of structural MRI scans and was excluded to limit analyses to typical SRC (i.e., without acute injury-related MR findings),\n28\nresulting in a final total of 92 concussed athletes. Data sets from athletes participating in the protocol for multiple injuries (\nn\n=\u200910) or as a control and then subsequently as an injured athlete (\nn\n=\u20097) are treated as independent data sets. Sensitivity analyses showed that findings from analyses with these excluded subjects were identical to those in the complete data set (see\nSupplementary Appendix S1\nand\nSupplementary Tables S1\nand\nS2\n).

The Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR) was used as an estimate of pre-morbid intelligence.\n29\nThe clinical battery for this report focuses on measures of symptom severity (Sport Concussion Assessment Tool \u2013 3rd Edition symptom checklist; SCAT),\n30\npsychological symptoms (Brief Symptom Inventory-18 Global Severity Index, BSI-GSI),\n31\npostural stability (Balance Error Scoring System; BESS),\n32\nand cognition (Standardized Assessment of Concussion; SAC).\n33\nThe WTAR was performed at the baseline visit only; all other measures were repeated at all visits.\n\nImaging parameters and processing\nMRI data were acquired with 32-channel head coils on either Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma (UCLA or UNC), Siemens MAGNETOM Trio (UCLA or UNC), or General Electric (GE) MR750 3T (UW) scanners. A gradient-echo echo-planar image (EPI) sequence was used to collect approximately 10-min resting-state scans on each system, during which athletes were instructed to keep their eyes open. The GE MR750 EPI had the following parameters: repetition time [TR]/echo time [TE]\u2009=\u20092000/33\u2009msec, flip angle\u2009=\u200990 degrees, field of view [FOV]\u2009=\u2009256\u2009mm, matrix\u2009=\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200964, slice thickness\u2009=\u20094\u2009mm, 36 axial slices. EPI collected on the Siemens Trio had the following parameters: TR/TE\u2009=\u20092250/27\u2009msec, flip angle\u2009=\u200990 degrees, FOV\u2009=\u2009245\u2009mm, matrix\u2009=\u200970\u2009\u00d7\u200970, slice thickness\u2009=\u20093.5\u2009mm, 45 axial slices. EPI collected on the Siemens Prisma scanner had the following parameters: TR/TE\u2009=\u20092300/27\u2009msec, flip angle\u2009=\u200990 degrees, FOV\u2009=\u2009245\u2009mm, matrix\u2009=\u200970\u2009\u00d7\u200970, slice thickness\u2009=\u20093.5\u2009mm, 45 axial slices. Scanner and EPI parameters were constant for each individual participant across visits. High-resolution T\n1\n-weighted images (1\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm) were collected during each scan for anatomical reference (see\nSupplementary Appendix S1\n).\nImage processing was performed using Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) programs unless otherwise indicated.\n34\nAnatomical images were skull stripped using segmentations generated from SPM12 and subsequently registered to the MNI-152 template using affine registration with correlation cost ratio function and trilinear interpolation followed by non-linear warp using FSL.\n35\nInitial EPI volumes were removed to allow for stabilization of longitudinal magnetization. Signal spike artifacts were removed from time series data sets by interpolation of data from neighboring time-points. Following slice time correction, head motion correction was performed by registering each volume to the first volume using cubic polynomial interpolation. A 6 degrees-of-freedom registration of the first EPI volume to the native-space anatomical scan was calculated using FSL FLIRT with the boundary-based registration cost-function.\n35\n,\n36\nThis transformation was concatenated with the anatomical-to-MNI-152 matrix, and the resulting matrix was applied with a non-linear warp to spatially normalize the motion corrected data to standard space with 2\u2009mm isotropic resolution.\nThe six motion parameters and their derivatives, the zero through third-order polynomial trends, and the average cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and white matter signals were regressed from the spatially normalized data as signals of no-interest. Average white matter and CSF signals were obtained from masks derived from MNI-152 tissue priors provided by FSL. Volumes for which the Euclidian norm of the motion parameters was greater than 0.30 were censored along with the preceding volume and replaced using interpolation on a subject-by-subject basis. The AFNI program 3dRSFC was used to bandpass filter (0.01 to 0.10\u2009Hz) and to calculate fALFF.\n16\n,\n37\nREHO was calculated across a neighborhood of 27 voxels in resampled space using the bandpass filtered output of 3dRSFC.\n14\n,\n37\nThe calculations of fALFF and REHO were limited to gray matter using a masked derived from the gray matter tissue prior in template space provided by FSL. fALFF and REHO maps were then spatially smoothed within the gray matter mask with varying smoothing kernels (approximately 3.5 to 6\u2009mm full-width at half-maximum kernels; FWHM) until the smoothness of the residual data set reached 10\u2009mm FWHM to account for intrinsic smoothness differences due to vendor and sequence, consistent with recommendations from the Function Biomedical Informatics Research Network (FBIRN).\n38\n,\n39\nThe smoothed fALFF and REHO maps were converted to z-scores by subtracting the mean global metric and dividing by the standard deviation of the mean at each voxel.\nAverage nodal strength was calculated from the unsmoothed bandpass filtered data in regions of interest (ROIs) identified from the whole-brain Craddock r 2-level 200 region parcellation using a combination of 3dNetCorr and the BRain Analysis using the graPH theory Matlab program (BRAPH) as previously described.\n19\n,\n40\n,\n41\nBriefly, average strength was calculated as the sum of all positive Pearson correlations to each individual ROI (i.e., node) averaged across all ROIs in the matrix.\nIn addition, subject-specific abnormalities in fALFF and REHO were quantified using previously described methods.\n24\u201326\nVoxel-wise data from SRC athletes at all visits and controls at the first visit were transformed to z-scores with the mean and standard deviation of the control group at visit 1 serving as the reference group. Z-scores were distribution-corrected based on the number of participants in the reference group to control for known bias. A leave-one-out approach was used to z-score controls at the asymptomatic and post-RTP visits relative to their first visit. The number and volume of clusters with abnormally increased or decreased fALFF or REHO were calculated. Abnormal clusters were defined as clusters with a minimum size of 500\u2009\u03bcL with z\u2009<\u20092 (negative) or z\u2009>\u20092 (positive) following distribution correction.\nAll data were visually inspected for artifacts at multiple processing stages. Scans in which the Euclidean norm of motion parameter was greater than 0.2 or more than 30% of time-points were censored and excluded from analyses to minimize effects of motion on group analyses.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS version 24 (Armonk, NY) unless otherwise indicated. Independent samples\nt\ntests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and chi-square tests were used to compare demographic variables between groups. Generalized linear mixed models were used to assess differences in variables (e.g., clinical, motion parameters, non-voxel-wise imaging metrics) with the fixed factor of group (SRC vs. controls), visit modeled as a repeated factor across participants (i.e., 24-h, asymptomatic, post-RTP), and the group by visit interaction. Continuous data were modeled with normal distributions; count data were modeled with Poisson or negative binomial distributions as appropriate. Degrees of freedom were estimated using the Satterthwaite approximation and robust covariance estimation was used. The primary analyses of the current work focused on the effects of group and potential group by visit interactions; main effects of visit are not reported and will be the focus of subsequent work. Because concussed athletes reported significantly more prior concussions than controls (\nsee Results\n), the number of prior concussions was included as a covariate in analyses of clinical and rs-fMRI metrics of interest. For all analyses of rs-fMRI metrics a single variable was created and used as a factor of no-interest to account for potential site, scanner, and sequence differences (i.e., UW/GE-MR750/TR\u2009=\u20092, UNC/Trio/TR\u2009=\u20092.25, UNC/Prisma/TR\u2009=\u20092.3, UCLA/Prisma/TR\u2009=\u20092.3;\nTable 1\n). Post hoc testing with Bonferroni correction was conducted for significant interactions at\np\n<\u20090.05.\nVoxel-wise linear mixed effects (LME) models were performed for fALFF and REHO using the AFNI program 3dLME as described above.\n42\nFor cluster-wise correction, the smoothness of the spatially smoothed residuals was estimated using a non-Gaussian, spherically symmetric auto-correlation function.\n43\nMonte Carlo simulations (10,000 iterations) were conducted in native voxel space (3.5\u2009mm isotropic, corresponding to Siemens data sets), limited to the interpolated gray matter mask, to determine the necessary correction for a familywise error rate of\np\n<\u20090.05 (smoothness parameters\u2009=\u20090.48, 5.39, and 15.78, effective FWHM\u2009=\u200915.19, voxel\np\n-value 0.001, minimum cluster volume\u2009=\u2009978\u2009\u03bcL for\np\n<\u20090.05). The updated Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas (AAL2)\n44\n,\n45\nand the online Neurosynth database\n46\nwere used to localize and define clusters. Voxel-wise statistical analyses were limited to gray matter where all subjects had coverage. Finally, generalized linear models using normal, Poisson, or negative binomial distributions, as appropriate, and robust covariance estimation were performed to determine the relationship between rs-fMRI metrics and clinical variables that were significantly associated with SRC, controlling for the number of prior concussions and scanner/site."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nIn this study, we evaluated a convenience sample of six male subjects with chronic motor complete SCI (more than 5 years post-injury) and five male subjects without SCI who were enrolled in the Fracture Risk after SCI (FRASCI) Study.\n14\nInclusion criteria for the parent study have been previously reported.\n14\nBriefly, participants with SCI were eligible to participate if they were 18 years of age or older, 1 year or more after injury, were not ventilator dependent, and had no other neurological condition such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, and past polio. Subjects were not eligible to participate if they reported changes in their medical status or symptoms of systemic illness. Subjects without SCI were recruited from our outpatient clinics (Boston, MA) or by advertisement and were eligible to participate if they did not require an ambulatory aid, had no neurological conditions preventing independent walking, and had not been previously diagnosed with osteoporosis. Our institutional review boards approved the study and all subjects gave informed consent.\n\nSpinal cord injury classification\nSCI was confirmed by physical examination by a trained rater according to the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) as previously described.\n14\n,\n15\n\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells isolation\nApproximately 30\u2009mL of peripheral blood extracted from each participant were drawn into a heparinized tube and diluted at a ratio of 1:2 with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution. The whole\u2013blood PBS solution was layered onto one volume of Histopaque\n\u00ae\n-1077 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The layered solution was then centrifuged and white blood cells were isolated from the plasma-Histopaque interface for subsequent analysis.\n\nTotal RNA extraction and complementary DNA preparation\nTotal RNA was extracted from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration and integrity were assessed with the NanoDrop 8000 spectrophotometer (Fischer Scientific, Wilmington, DE). Two micrograms of RNA obtained from each sample were reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).\n\nMicroarray analysis\nMicroarray analysis was performed by SeqWright, Inc. (Houston, TX). Complementary DNA was hybridized to HG-U133A Plus 2.0 GeneChip oligonucleotide arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), each of which contains 54,675 sets of oligonucleotide probes targeting approximately 38,000 human genes. Relative fluorescence of the chip region corresponding to each gene in the GeneChip was determined and the raw data were exported to CEL files for further analysis using the Partek Genomics Suite (PGS Partek Inc., St. Louis, Missouri) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA). PGS was used to generate a list from the raw CEL files of 1453 genes that were significantly over- or under-expressed in SCI versus control subjects (\np\n\u2264\u20090.05). The significance of differentially expressed genes was evaluated based on the adjusted\np\nvalues generated by the Benjamini and Hochberg\n16\nstepwise procedure in order to control the false discovery rate.\nIPA software was used for further analysis of the genes identified by PGS, including the identification of differentially expressed genetic pathways. A significance score was calculated for each pathway and that represents the possibility that the genes in the pathway are found there by chance. The significance score of a network\n17\nis equal to the negative exponent of calculated P value of the network (i.e., a significance score of 4 equals a\np\nvalue of 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n\u22124\n). Each network is composed of individual genes and complexes. Out of all the genes in a particular network, only some are referred to as \u201cfocus molecules\u201d (genes that significantly change their status). Genes included in the network that are not focus molecules are genes which have been reported to interact with the focus molecules. Thus, some genes reported in the network were not shown to have significant changes in expression but were included because of a functional relationship to genes that did. In the resulting network schematic, focus genes are shaded, while other genes are not. Genes of interest identified in the microarray analysis were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).\n\nQuantitative RT-PCR\nComplementary DNA derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells was used as a template for RT-PCR to confirm differential expression of selected genes of interest. All reactions were performed in triplicate with an iCycler Optical Module system (Bio-Rad, Philadelphia, PA) in a 96-well PCR plate (ABgene, Epson, Surray County, UK) with a final reaction volume of 20\u2009\u03bcL/well. Each reaction sample included Sybr-Green PCR Master Mix (Bio-Rad), 50ng of template cDNA and 0.25\u2009\u03bcM of sense and anti-sense primer mix (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA). Optimized thermal cycling conditions were: 95\u00b0 for 7\u2009min followed by 45 cycles at 95\u00b0 for 10\u2009sec, 55\u00b0 for 15\u2009sec, 72\u00b0 for 15\u2009sec, and a final cycle at 95\u00b0 for 1\u2009min. Differential expression of TMEM176A and TMEM176B was confirmed by qPCR using the oligonucleotides described in\nTable 1\n. Human \u03b2-actin was assayed as an endogenous control (\nTable 1\n) and all quantifications were normalized using the cycling threshold method.\nTable 1.\nOligonucleotide Primers for qPCR\n5\u2032 \u2013 3\u2032 oligonucleotide forward and reverse sequences\nHuman\nACTB\n(\nNM_001101.3\n)\nForward\nACCGCGAGAAGATGACCCAG\nReverse\nGTACGGCCAGAGGCGTACAG\nHuman\nTMEM176A\n(\nNM_018487.2\n)\nForward\nCTCTTGGGTGTCTGGATTCTG\nReverse\nTTTCCTTCTGGTCTCTTTTCCC\nHuman\nTMEM176B\n(NM_001101314.1)\nForward\nGCGAAGTCAAGAGAACCAATG\nReverse\nCTACTCCCAAGGAAACCAAGG\nOpen in a separate window\nqPCR, quantitative polymerase chain reaction; TMEM, transmembrane domain protein\n\nStatistical analysis\nTo compare gene expression levels between samples from SCI subjects and uninjured controls, the relative expression of each gene was calculated using the comparative \u0394\u0394Ct method [fold of expression\u2009=\u20092-(\u0394\u0394CT\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD)].

    "Methods": "Experimental design\nAfter C2 hemisection SCI in rats, we placed over the lesion a gelfoam saturated with either the PTP\u03c3 peptide or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-only control. At 1 week post-injury, we added a freshly soaked piece of gelfoam to extend peptide delivery. At 4 days before sacrifice, we performed compound muscle action potential (CMAP) recordings to assess functional diaphragm innervation by PhMNs. At 8 weeks after injury, we conducted electromyography (EMG) recordings at three subregions of the hemidiaphragm (ventral, medial, and dorsal) to assess effects on inspiratory diaphragm activation\nin vivo\nduring eupnic breathing; we then immediately performed a relesion through the hemisection site and recorded EMG activity again after the relesion.

All animal procedures were approved by the Thomas Jefferson University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conducted in compliance with ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) guidelines. We have optimized our injury paradigm, other surgical procedures, and diaphragm functional analyses in females. Nevertheless, we recognize the importance of performing our work in both sexes. Moving forward, we are also testing the peptide in males.\n\nC2 hemisection spinal cord injury\nRats were anesthetized with ketamine HCl (95.0\u2009mg/kg; Vedco, Saint Joseph, MO), xylazine (10.0\u2009mg/kg; Lloyd Laboratories, Quezon City, Metro Manila, Philippines), and acepromazine (0.075\u2009mg/kg; Phoenix Pharm Inc, Burlingame, CA). Hemisection was performed just caudal to the C2 dorsal root with a dissecting knife (Fine Science Tools, Foster City, CA), and a 30 gauge needle was passed through to ensure lesion completeness.\n12\n\nRostral ventral respiratory group injection\nThe caudal portion of the occipital bone was removed to reveal the obex. The rVRG was located relative to obex: 2.0\u2009mm lateral, 0.5\u2009mm rostral, and 2.6\u2009mm ventral.\n13\nAn UltraMicroPump (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) injection system was used to deliver 0.3\u2009\u03bcL of total volume with a microsyringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV) attached to a Micro4 Microsyringe Pump Controller (World Precision Instruments). AAV2-mCherry was used at 2.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n13\nGC/mL.\n\nElectromyography recordings\nFor EMG recordings, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane inhalant anesthesia using the same conditions in all rats (1 LPM O2). A laparotomy was performed to expose the right hemidiaphragm. Bipolar recording electrodes spaced 3\u2009mm apart were inserted into the diaphragm at dorsal, medial, or ventral subregions. Recordings during normal eupnic breathing were averaged over a continuous 60-sec time frame for each animal, and peak amplitude, burst duration, and frequency were taken. Every inspiratory burst over these 60 continuous sec was included in the analysis for both amplitude and frequency measurements. Using LabChart software (version 7; ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO), the EMG signal was amplified and filtered through a band-pass filter (50\u20133000\u2009Hz).\n12\n\nCompound muscle action potential recordings\nRats were anesthetized with isoflurane and stimulating electrodes were transcutaneously inserted near the passage of the phrenic nerve.\n14\nA recording surface electrode was placed over the right rib cage. The phrenic nerve was stimulated between 10 and 20 times with a single burst at 6\u2009mV (amplitude) for a 0.5-ms duration, and recordings were averaged for analysis. The ADI Powerlab8/30stimulator and BioAMPamplifier (ADInstruments) were used for both stimulation and recording, and Scope 3.5.6 (version 3.5.6; ADInstruments) was used for subsequent data analysis.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nFirst, 30\u2009\u03bcm, 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed sections were immunostained according to standard protocols.\n12\nPrimary antibodies included: anti\u2013glial fibrillary acidic protein at 1:400 (Dako, Carpinteria, CA; RRID: AB_10013482); anti-5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine) at 1:500 (Immunostar, Hudson, WI; RRID: AB_572263); anti-DsRed at 1:500 (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, CA; RRID:AB_10013483); and anti-CTB (cholera toxin subunit beta) at 1:10,000 (List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA). Secondary antibodies included: donkey antimouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) H&L (Alexa Fluor 488) at 1:200 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), Rhodamine (TRITC) AffiniPure donkey antigoat IgG (H+L) at 1:200 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), donkey antirabbit IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor 647) at 1:200 (Abcam), and donkey antigoat IgG antibody (DyLight\n\u00ae\n405) at 1:200 (Jackson ImmunoResearch).\n\nRostral ventral respiratory group axon quantification\nFor mCherry tracer quantification, sagittal spinal cord sections were imaged using a Zeiss Axio M2 Imager (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY). For the rVRG axon regeneration analysis (i.e., when axons are labeled from the ipsilateral rVRG), we quantified directed axon growth into and through the lesion site and caudally across the PhMN pool in the caudal intact spinal cord. To do this, we performed the counts of regrowing mCherry-labeled rVRG axon profiles in 100-um-wide (in the rostral-caudal axis) bins at specific distances from the rostral intact-lesion border.\n12\nFor the rVRG sprouting analysis (i.e., when axons are labeled from the contralateral rVRG), we quantified sprouting of axons\u2014by counting the number of mCherry\n+\naxon profiles\u2014ipsilateral to the hemisection at three defined distances from the rostral end of the lesion that correspond approximately to the location of PhMNs in the C3, C4, and C5 spinal cord.\n\n5-Hydroxytryptamine axon quantification\n5-HT axons were identified by immunostaining in sagittal sections of the spinal cord, as described above. 5-HT fiber length was traced using Metamorph software in the ventral gray matter at distances 1.5, 3.0, and 4.5\u2009mm caudal to the lesion-caudal intact border. Lengths of fibers were averaged at each location, and eight sections of tissue were analyzed for each animal.\n\nDiaphragm whole-mount histology\nRight hemidiaphragm was excised and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). Diaphragms were labeled for neuromuscular junction (NMJ) markers, as described previously,\n15\nusing the following: \u03b1-bungarotoxin conjugated to Alexa Fluor 555 at 1:200 (Life Technologies, Waltham, MA; RRID: AB_2313931), anti-SV2 at 1:10 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA; RRID: AB_2314906), and neurofilament marker anti-SMI312 at 1:1000 (BioLegend, San Diego, CA; RRID: AB_2566782). Fluorescein isothiocyanate antimouse IgG secondary (1:100; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was used as the secondary antibody.\n\nNeuromuscular junction analysis\nDiaphragms were analyzed for several NMJ morphologies, as described previously.\n16\nEach NMJ was classified as intact, partially denervated, or completely denervated. Whole-mounted diaphragms were imaged on a FluoView FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA).\n\nStatistical analysis\nIn the figure legends, we provide details of exact\nn\ns, group means, standard error of the mean, statistical tests used, and the results of all statistical analyses (including exact\np\nvalues,\nt\nvalues, and\nF\nvalues) for each experiment and for all statistical comparisons. Statistical significance was assessed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple comparisons (Tukey) post-hoc test. A\nt\n-test was used for analysis involving only two conditions. Graphpad Prism software (version 6; Graphpad Software Inc.; La Jolla, CA; RRID: SCR_002798) was used for statistical analyses, and\np\n< 0.05 was considered significant. PTP\u03c3 peptide studies were conducted on two separate cohorts to ensure reproducibility of the results. Each cohort consisted of 12 animals each (6 rats in each of the two groups) of similar age and weight. Both the EMG and rVRG axon growth analyses in these two studies showed similar results, and data were combined for all analyses. Two animals had to be removed from the study because of technical error: one because of incomplete hemisection and one because of mistargeted rVRG injection. For all quantification, we present the data as scatter plots to show the results for individual animals in each experimental condition.\n\nReagents\nWe authenticated regents to ensure they performed similarly across experiments and to validate resulting data. Whenever we generated in-house a new batch of AAV2-mCherry, we verified that virus performed equivalently from batch to batch by confirming in every animal that the vector transduced cells of the rVRG, transduced predominantly neuronal nuclei\u2013positive neurons, and induced expression of mCherry tracer in the soma and axon projections of these cells. If viral delivery was mistargeted or failed to be expressed, we did not use the animal for analysis of rVRG axon regeneration or sprouting."

Residents of VHCY were recruited for the study through flyers, social events, and word of mouth. The total cohort of 108 had an age range of 50 to 95 years, and all were able to provide informed consent for research. Individuals were excluded because of a cognition level too low to allow informed consent as judged by a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score\n17\n< 20, past penetrating head injury, inability or unwillingness to provide a blood sample, or a comorbid serious medical condition or severe hearing or vision impairment. The study was approved by the Human Research Institutional Review Committee of the University of California, San Francisco, and all participants gave written informed consent.\nTBI was defined for the affected groups three and four as a head injury resulting in any form of medical care. The two groups classified as never having sustained a TBI had no history of any head injury that produced neurological symptoms or required medical care by self-report. A history of TBI was found in VHCY medical records of 52% of the TBI participants and was absent from the medical records of all non-TBI participants. The Ohio State University TBI Identification Method,\n18\na structured clinical interview recommended by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke as a Common Data Element for the retrospective assessment of lifetime TBI in clinical research, was used to assess TBI history and determine the severity of TBI.\nGeneral cognitive abilities were assessed by the MMSE (range of scores, 0\u201330), a frequently used test for general cognition. The Auditory Verbal Learning Task (AVLT)\n19\n,\n20\nis a verbal memory test with five Learning Trials and a 30-min Delayed Recall test. The Learning Trials (total trials 1\u20135) and Delayed Recall were used to determine learning and memory performance, respectively. Mental processing speed was quantified by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) Digit Symbol Task,\n21\na timed task involving number and symbol matching.\nGiven that norms are less established for the very old, we defined CI operationally using a composite Z-score from the AVLT learning score, AVLT delay score, MMSE, and WAIS Digit Symbol. The composite score was based on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite score,\n22\na measure of early cognitive impairment that has been used in multiple studies.\nFirst, each participant's raw cognitive test scores were compared with demographically corrected normative data for each measure\u2014Mayo's Older Americans Normative Studies age-corrected norms for AVLT Learning Trials\n23\nand Delayed Recall and Alzheimer's Disease Centers' Uniform Data Set age-, gender-, and education-corrected norms\n24\nfor MMSE and WAIS-R Digit Symbol. Then, each individual's raw test scores were converted into demographically corrected\nZ\n-scores using these normative data, indicating how much each individual's performance differs from that of healthy, demographically similar peers. Finally, the individual Z-scores for each participant were averaged to create a composite cognitive Z-score.\nCI was defined as a cognitive composite score below normative values by more than one standard deviation, diagnosis of dementia in medical records, or history of taking a dementia prescription medication (donepezil, memantine, or rivastigmine) that was recorded in their medical records.\nThe first and second study groups were composed of subjects who had not experienced any TBI. Subjects of the first group (\nn\n=\u200942) had normal cognition, whereas CI had developed in those of the second group (\nn\n=\u200919). Subjects of groups three (\nn\n=\u200921) and four (\nn\n=\u200926) had experienced one to four episodes of TBI in the one to 74 years before blood sampling that was not followed by CI in those of group three, but was followed by CI in those of group four. Seventy-five percent of subjects of groups three and four had experienced TBI decades ago, and 25% had TBI one to 10 years ago.\nVenous blood was obtained for plasma by the standard phlebotomy technique using EDTA for anticoagulation. Plasma was stored in 0.25\u2009mL portions at -80\u00b0C.\n\nEnrichment of plasma NDEs for extraction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) quantification of proteins\nAliquots of 0.25\u2009mL plasma were incubated with 0.1\u2009mL thromboplastin D (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), followed by addition of 0.15\u2009mL of calcium- and magnesium-free Dulbecco balanced salt solution with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific), as described.\n25\nAfter centrifugation at 3000\ng\nfor 30\u2009min at 4\u00b0C, NDEs were harvested from resultant supernatants by sequential ExoQuick (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA) precipitation and immunoabsorption enrichment with mouse anti-human CD171 (L1CAM neural adhesion protein) biotinylated antibody (clone 5G3; eBiosciences, San Diego, CA) as described.\n25\nThe NDEs were counted and their size ranges were determined, as described previously\n15\nThen NDEs were lysed in mammalian protein extraction reagent (M-PER; ThermoFisher Scientific) that contained protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails prior to storage at -80\u00b0C before ELISAs. These procedures all have been described in greater detail elsewhere along with an estimate that 8\u201310% of NDEs may be attributable to other cellular sources.\n15\nThe NDE proteins were quantified by ELISA kits for human claudin-5 and tetraspanning exosome marker CD81 (Cusabio-American Research Products, Waltham, MA), PrPc, aquaporin-1 and aquaporin-4 (Cloud-Clone Corp.-American Research Products), synaptogyrin-3 (Abbkine, Wuhan, China-American Research Products), IL-6 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), annexin VII (Biomatik, Wilmington, DE), A\u03b242 (ultrasensitive ELISA) and P-S396-tau (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher Scientific, Vienna, Austria), and P-T181-tau (FUJIREBIO, US, Inc., Malvern, PA).\nThe mean value for all determinations of CD81 in the total population was set at 1.00, and relative values of CD81 for each sample were used to normalize their recovery. There were no differences in recovery of NDEs between the groups based on mean (\u00b1 standard error of the mean) relative levels of CD81: no TBI or CI (0.97\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07), no TBI with CI (0.98\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08), TBI without CI (1.11\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12), and TBI with CI (0.91\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07). For each group, there was a significant correlation between NDE counts and CD81 levels with Pearson coefficient r values >0.85 for all. One investigator (EJG) conducted all ELISAs without knowledge of the clinical data for any subject.\n\nStatistical analyses\nThe Shapiro-Wilks test showed whether data in each set were distributed normally. Data for only two analytes (IL-6 and A\u03b242) were not distributed normally, and the significance of the differences between their group values was determined by the Mann-Whitney rank-sum test. For all other analytes, groups were compared using an unpaired Student\nt\ntest, including a Bonferroni correction, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) analyses (Prism 7; GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Correlative evaluations used a Pearson correlation method (GraphPad)."

UCSD (University of California, San Diego) was the INTRuST coordinating center, providing the informatics and biostatistic scores. Remedy Pharmaceuticals, Inc. provided the drug (IV glyburide; a.k.a. RP-1127 or BIIB-093) and placebo (excipients) for the study, under an Investigational New Drug Application from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The study was supervised by the Institutional Review Boards of the individual centers, UCSD, and the USAMRMC (U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command).\nAnalysis of the MRI data was conducted by the Psychiatry Neuroimaging Laboratory at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Department of Psychiatry, which was the core imaging center for the INTRuST consortium. The lead clinical center for this trial was UMSOM (University of Maryland School of Medicine), which later was joined by two other centers, UCSD and UPMC (University of Pittsburgh Medical Center), although ultimately, 76% of the total randomized participants were enrolled at UMSOM. The primary biostatistician (SJ) had full access to all the clinical data in the study. The project principal investigator (HME) had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\n\nSubject enrollment and randomization\nThe study protocol called for enrolling 100 participants into one of two arms, IV glyburide or placebo, at a 1:1 ratio. However, the coordinating center reduced the number of participating sites from five to three, and the study was terminated after 29 subjects had been randomized, 30 months after starting, due to slow enrollment and completion of the allotted period of funding. All participants' legally authorized representatives (LARs) provided written informed consent at enrollment. Subjects were consented and enrolled into the study, but were not randomized until completion of the T1-weighted (T1w) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) sequences of the baseline MRI. Randomization and infusion of drug or placebo then proceeded, as long as infusion could be started within 10\u2009h of the trauma. Participants were randomly assigned to receive IV glyburide or placebo in a 1:1 ratio from a centralized, web-based randomization system (Interactive Web Randomization System). At randomization, subjects were stratified on the basis of their Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (4\u20138 and 9\u201314) obtained free of the effects of sedating and/or paralytic drugs, closest to the time of randomization.\nThe major inclusion/exclusion criteria were age (18\u201375 years), GCS score 4\u201314, start of infusion within the 10-h window, history of treatment with sulfonylurea drugs, and perceived inability to tolerate the initial MRI scan (full inclusion/exclusion criteria are provided in\nSupplementary Appendix S1\n). The INTRuST coordinating center (except for the Biostatistics Core), Remedy Pharmaceuticals, the principal investigator, site investigators, patients, imaging core, and outcomes personnel were blinded to treatment.\n\nTreatments\nThe bolus and the infusion concentrations of glyburide were both 5.3\u2009\u03bcg/mL. Glyburide was infused IV as a loading dose, 0.13\u2009mg over 2\u2009min, then 0.16\u2009mg/h for 6\u2009h, and then 0.11\u2009mg/h for 66\u2009h (total daily dose on day 1 was 3.12\u2009mg and on days 2 and 3 was 2.67\u2009mg/day) versus placebo (similar in appearance to drug and at the same rate). This dose was based on data from a Phase I drug escalation safety study.\n23\nThe infusion protocol and 10-h window were identical to that used in a Phase II trial of glyburide in large hemispheric infarction.\n20\nDrug vials, preparation bags, and tubing were identical in appearance for both treatment groups. Concomitant treatments followed national practice guidelines for TBI patients.\n24\n\nStudy outcome measures\nThe pre-specified primary efficacy objective was to assess whether subjects treated with IV glyburide would show a decrease in MRI-defined edema and/or hemorrhage, compared with placebo-treated patients. The study protocol did not specify which specific measure of edema and/or hemorrhage would be primary (see below for the measures that were quantified). Efficacy outcome was assessed using data from two sequential MRIs, a baseline MRI before infusion of drug or placebo, and another MRI after completion of infusion, specifically indexing water and blood. The interval between the baseline MR scan and the second scan was initially specified as 72\u2009\u00b1\u200912\u2009h. However, very early in the study, we realized that this was not possible in some subjects, when the second scan had to be delayed mainly due to ICP elevations above guideline levels when participants were positioned flat for scanning. The protocol then was revised to extend the interval to 168\u2009h (7 days). The number of patients scanned within the 72-h window, the 168-h window, and beyond 168\u2009h are reported separately.\nA pre-specified secondary efficacy outcome was the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOS-E) at 90 days.\nThe primary safety objective was to assess the safety (the incidence of mortality, adverse events [AEs], and serious adverse events [SAEs]) and tolerability of IV glyburide compared with placebo in subjects with severe, moderate, or complicated mild TBI.\n\nMRI data acquisition\nMRI scans were acquired at each site on a 1.5T scanner. At UMSOM, two identical Siemens Avanto scanners were used (baseline and follow-up scans for each subject were always on the same scanner). At the UCSD and UPMC sites, a single 1.5 Signa GE scanner was used. One single phantom was used to standardize all scanners at all sites. Also, at each site, patients were always scanned using the same scanner.\nThe MRI acquisition was set to minimize differences between vendors and included anatomical sequences: high resolution (1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm\n3\n) T1w (Siemens: magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo [MPRAGE], inversion time of 1100\u2009msec, flip angle 7 degrees; GE: spoiled gradient recalled [SPGR], inversion time of 600\u2009msec, flip angle 10 degrees], high resolution T2, proton density (Dual echo, echo time [TE]: 12\u2009msec and 100\u2009msec; 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm\n3\n), and a clinical fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence (1.3\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009mm; inversion time: 2500\u2009msec). Two additional scans of interest were diffusion MRI and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). The diffusion MRI scan included a multi-shell design with 46 unique gradient orientations and a total of 66 volumes spread over 5 nested b-shells of 1\u2009\u00d7\u20090, 3\u2009\u00d7\u200950, 6\u2009\u00d7\u2009250, 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009500, 30\u2009\u00d7\u2009900, and 16\u2009\u00d7\u20091400\u2009sec/mm\n2\n, and the following parameters: 2.5\u2009mm isotropic, 66 slices (Siemens: repetition time [TR]/TE 8500/85\u2009msec; GE: TR/TE 9550\u2009msec/min). The SWI scan was a 3D gradient-echo scan (1\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20091.5\u2009mm, TR/TE 50/40\u2009msec, flip angle: 15 degrees) outputting the magnitude and phase images.\n\nRegions of interest\nThree regions of interest (ROIs) were analyzed for volumetric changes: the total lesion volume (blood plus edema) (\nn\n=\u200915), blood alone (\nn\n=\u200914), and the total brain volume (\nn\n=\u200924). Four additional ROIs were analyzed for changes in edema: uninjured white matter (\nn\n=\u200924); lesions, that is, contusions (\nn\n=\u200914); all quadrants in a coronal slice (four per subject;\nn\n=\u200996); and the maximally affected quadrant (one per subject;\nn\n=\u200924). For lesion ROIs (blood plus edema), we aligned images from computed tomography (CT) and MRI. Lesion volumes were calculated by electronically tracing the areas of the lesion on sequential slices. Edema was identified predominantly based on hyperintensities in the FLAIR and T2 sequences (\nFig. 1A\n). Hemorrhage was identified based on hypointensities in the SWI contrast (following phase enhancement\n25\n) and blood densities on CT (\nFig. 2A,B\n). The final lesion ROIs were reviewed and modified by a neurosurgeon, a neuroradiologist, and a researcher specializing in image analysis, blinded to treatment arm. Lesions were excluded if they were outside brain (e.g., subarachnoid and extra-axial and interventricular hemorrhages were excluded). Apparent lesions also were excluded if they were directly related to a treatment that took place between the two MRIs (e.g., surgery or insertion of an intraventricular catheter).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nRepresentative FLAIR and T1w images illustrating ROIs that were studied.\n(A,B)\nAxial slices of FLAIR images on day 0 and day 4 showing lesion ROIs (A) and quadrant ROIs (B); to compensate for different gantry angles on different days, the slices illustrated are the first full slice above the right orbital roof\n.

All images are from patient 14, who received IV glyburide. CT, computed tomography; IV, intravenous; SW, susceptibility-weighted.\nFor uninjured white matter ROIs, which were intended as an exploratory approach to identify global effects of the drug, we used expectation-maximization (EM) segmentation of the T1w image (FAST; FSL) (\nFig. 1C\n). The white matter segment was eroded by one voxel to avoid partial volume voxels, and we excluded all lesions that were defined in the previous approach (the lesion segments here were first dilated by one voxel).\nFor all quadrant ROIs, which also were intended as an exploratory approach to identify global effects of the drug, each quadrant within a coronal brain slice was studied separately, whether or not a lesion was present (\nFig. 1B\n).\nFor the maximally affected quadrant, the single quadrant of a coronal brain slice with the maximal change in edema parameters for each subject was used.\n\nMRI data analysis\nAll evaluators and those involved in management of subjects including the PI (HME) were blinded to treatment arm and other clinical or demographic information. All imaging data were subjected to visual quality control to exclude images with severe motion or other artifacts. The diffusion data were manually masked to exclude non-brain areas. The anatomical images were co-registered using rigid transformations (within time-points) and affine transformations (between time-points). In addition, the anatomical images were manually masked based on the T1w image, all by investigators blind to treatment arm.\nThe diffusion MRI data were pre-processed using motion and eddy correction applied by means of affine transformations (FLIRT; FSL). The aligned images then were analyzed using the DTI model,\n26\n,\n27\nand the free-water imaging model,\n28\n,\n29\nyielding voxel-wise maps of DTI measures and free-water imaging measures.\nThree MRI diffusion measures were used to assess edema: (1) mean diffusivity (MD); (2) the volume fraction of free water (FW); and (3) tissue mean diffusivity (MDt). MD was derived from the DTI, whereas FW and MDt were derived from the free-water imaging model. MD provides an overall measure of diffusivity; as water molecules move faster on average, the MD measure is higher. FW and MDt measures further deconstruct the signal contribution into extracellular (FW) and intracellular (MDt) water. The free-water model separates the signal into water molecules that are free to diffuse in the extracellular space (i.e., diffusing at 3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n\u20133\nmm\n2\n/sec), and all remaining molecules that are restricted or hindered by membranes and other tissue-related obstacles.\nHigher fractions of extracellular space, which are expected in vasogenic edema, would increase FW. Changes in the geometry, and hence the speed of water molecules in proximity to tissue, would affect the MDt, whereas less restricted motion would increase MDt. On the other hand, cellular swelling (i.e., cytotoxic edema) would decrease the non-restricted space, decreasing FW, and modifying MDt. Values for MD, FW, and MDt were averaged for each of the four ROIs described above. Because edema was an important end-point due to the expected drug mechanism, and because the ROIs were large, we did not consider anisotropic measures such as fractional anisotropy or radial or axial diffusivities. Hemorrhage was assessed by the number of positive voxels on SWI within the boundaries of the lesion ROIs.\n\nSample size calculation\nA sample size calculation was performed based on a two-sided, two-sample\nt\ntest to compare published differences in absolute values in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in TBI patients relative to normal subjects, and was computed using standardized effect sizes. With an anticipated sample size of 100 participants (equal allocation between active and placebo arms), the study would have 80% power to detect a 60% standardized change in treatment arms, assuming 10% attrition over 72\u2009h and \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05.\n\nStatistical analysis plan\nAnalyses were to incorporate the intent-to-treat principle, namely, all randomized participants would be included in the analysis according to their treatment assigned at randomization. The safety analysis was to be performed on the safety population only, that is, all those who were exposed to any study drug. No adjustments for multiple comparisons were to be made for secondary analyses, and a\np\n-value of 0.05 was be considered statistically significant. The final statistical analysis plan was to be determined by the INTRuST Biostatistics Core within 6 months before study end.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll MRI measures were evaluated as the \u201cpercent change\u201d of the second MRI compared with the screening/baseline MRI, before infusion of study drug or placebo. Summary measures (mean, standard deviation, median, first and third quartiles, minimum and maximum values) described the data overall and by study arm for each outcome at screening/baseline and at the second scan. Summary measures were produced overall and by study arm for each outcome for the percent change from screening/baseline to the second scan. The primary analysis was based on a two-sided, two-sample Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare the glyburide and placebo arms. A secondary analysis of the three MRI measures of edema (MD, FW and MDt) was based on an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare four groups: lesions versus uninjured white matter, in the glyburide and placebo arms. Safety data were summarized overall and by treatment groups. Fisher's exact test was used to compare the number of subjects between groups who experienced any adverse events (AEs). Statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.1.1. (\nwww.r-project.org\n) or GraphPad Prism version 8."

These animals accumulate ptau, and NFT formation can be detected at approximately 6\u20139 months of age.\n45\nThe expression of the mutant human MAPT is five-fold higher than the expression of the endogenous mouse MAPT.\nAnimals were housed in groups of up to five in individually ventilated cages under standard conditions (22\u00b0C, 12h light\u2013dark cycle) receiving food and water\nad libitum.\nAll animal experiments were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) regulations and approved by the committee of animal use for research at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, McGovern Medical School.\n\nInduction of TBI\nGroups of 3-month-old P301S mice and wild-type (WT) littermates were anesthetized with isoflurane, placed on a stereotaxic apparatus with a face mask, and prepared for controlled cortical impact (CCI), as performed previously to induce moderate to severe TBI.\n15\n,\n46\n,\n47\nBriefly, a midline incision was made, and a 5-mm\u2013diameter craniotomy was performed on the right parietal cortex, midway between the bregma and the lambda with the medial edge of the craniotomy 1.0\u2009mm lateral to the midline. A pneumatic impact device (Custom Design and Fabrication, Richmond, VA) was used to deliver an impact at 3.0\u2009m/sec generating a 1.0\u2009mm deformation on the posterior cortex.\nThe incision was closed, and animals were assessed in latency of foot, tail, and righting reflexes as previously described (\nSupplementary Fig. 1A\n; see online supplementary material at\nwww.liebertpub.com\n).\n48\nAnimals were allowed to completely recover in a warm chamber before being returned to their home cages.

Barnes maze consists of a circular platform with 40 holes with one being an exit from the arena, and the animal uses spatial cues to discover the stationary escape hole in a 3\u2009min trial. Mice were trained on day 1 with two acquisition trials and then four trials per day for four days. At seven days later, long-term memory was assessed.\nPrimary latency to the escape hole was used to assess learning and memory. Task performance was recorded and analyzed using the TopScan 2.0 tracking software (Clever Sys, Reston, VA). Behavioral analysis was performed by a single experimenter blinded to subject identities.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nThe TBI and sham mice were sacrificed either one day, one week, 1\u20132 months, or six months after CCI trauma. Mice were sacrificed by CO\n2\ninhalation and perfused transcardially with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Brains were removed, post-fixed into 10% neutral buffered formalin fixative solution, and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin-fixed brain tissue was sliced coronally by microtome obtaining 10-\u03bcm\u2013thick serial sections; these were processed for immunostaining, as reported previously.\n50\u201352\nAfter blocking the endogenous peroxidase activity with 3% H\n2\nO\n2\n-10% methanol for 20\u2009min, sections were incubated overnight at room temperature in monoclonal AT8 phospho-PHF-tau pSer202+Thr205 antibody (1:100, Thermo Fischer). Primary antibody was detected by incubating 1\u2009h with sheep antimouse horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (General Electric, Pittsburgh, PA), and peroxidase reaction was visualized using DAB Kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Finally, all sections were dehydrated in graded ethanol, cleared in xylene, and cover-slipped with DPX mounting medium.\n\nImmunohistochemistry and tau burden quantification\nPathological tau burden was quantified using AT8 antibody assessing the overall, ipsilateral (Ipsi) and contralateral (Contra) side of CCI impact of the cortex and amygdala (Ctx), hippocampal area (Hp), and brainstem (BS). Coronal areas assessed were based on anatomical connectivity and cytoarchitectural patterns. The area rostral to the impact covered interaural (IL) \u00b14.54\u2009mm, bregma (B) \u00b10.74\u2009mm \u2013 IL \u00b13.46\u2009mm, B\u2009\u00b1\u2009-0.34\u2009mm; the rostral impacted area was assessed from IL \u00b12.74\u2009mm, B\u2009\u00b1\u2009-1.06\u2009mm to IL \u00b11.50\u2009mm, B\u2009\u00b1\u2009-2.30\u2009mm; the caudal impacted area included IL \u00b11.34\u2009mm, B\u2009\u00b1\u2009-2.46\u2009mm \u2013 IL \u00b10.00\u2009mm, B\u2009\u00b1\u2009-3.80\u2009mm; whereas the caudal area to the impact was analyzed between IL\u2009\u00b1\u2009-1.16\u2009mm, B\u2009\u00b1\u2009-4.96\u2009mm and IL\u2009\u00b1\u2009-3.16\u2009mm, B\u2009\u00b1\u2009-6.96\u2009mm.\nThree to five sample slides of every 10th section were examined under a bright field microscope (DMI6000B, Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL), and photomicrographs were taken with a digital camera (DFC310 FX Leica), imported into ImageJ 1.45s software (NIH), and converted to black and white images. Threshold intensity was used to quantify AT8 burden in the brain. Threshold intensity was adjusted automatically to remove the background and held constant during quantification of all the analyzed animals.\nBurden was defined as the immune-reactive area per total area analyzed. Likewise, AT8 assessment was measured in 5\u20137 slides of every 10th section and scored from no tau detected (0 score) to highest tau deposition (5 score). This semi-quantitative score was graded by the volume and abundance of AT8 immunoreactivity of disease-associated morphological tau adapted previously.\n37\n,\n40\n,\n53\nScore values were averaged and imported into a custom-designed heat map software to generate an overall view of tau deposition. The experimenter was blinded to the animal identities and groups during processing and subsequent quantification methods.\n\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) quantification\nAdditional 3-month-old mice (\nn\n=\u20093\u20134) were CCI-induced or sham-induced. The TBI and sham mice were sacrificed after one day. The ipsilateral and contralateral sides of the brains were extracted from injured and sham mice. Brain hemispheres were homogenized at 10% w/v in PBS containing protease inhibitors (cOmplete\u2122 Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, MilliporeSigma, Bedford, MA) as described previously.\n54\n,\n55\nBrain homogenates were centrifuged at 32,600\u2009rpm for 1\u2009h at 4\u00b0C in an ultracentrifuge (Beckman-Coulter). The supernatant was removed, and pellets were resuspended in 200\u2009\u03bcL of 70% formic acid followed by sonication. Samples were centrifuged for 30\u2009min under the same conditions, and the supernatant was collected and neutralized in 1\u2009M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 10.8 to measure the fraction of insoluble tau in brain after TBI. Levels of phosphorylated tau at Ser199 were measured using Human tau [pS199] ELISA kit (Invitrogen) per manufacturer's instructions on an ELISA plate reader (EL800 BIOTEK).\n\nStatistical analysis\nGraphs are expressed as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM). Data were tested for normal distribution by Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Student\nt\ntest was used to analyze normal data for AT8 burden quantifications as well as non-parametric data were run with the Mann-Whitney test. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a\npost hoc\nTukey multiple comparisons test and Bonferroni post-test were used to analyze the Barnes maze learning curve, and one-way ANOVA was used for long-term memory. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). Statistical differences for all tests were considered significant at the\np\n<\u20090.05 level."

    "Methods": "Patients and laboratory assays\nWe conducted a single-center, prospective, observational study of major trauma patients presenting to an urban Level I trauma center from October 2011 to December 2014 in accordance with the Declaration Helsinki code of ethics. The primary aim of this study was to examine the association between progression of intracranial hemorrhage and TEG values. The association between intracranial hemorrhage and coagulation parameters was a secondary analysis. Adult trauma patients with isolated blunt TBI (head Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS] \u22653 and \u22642 in other regions) were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included age <15 years, pregnancy, warfarin or clopidogrel use within 30 days of the injury, red cell, platelet, fresh frozen plasma, or cryoprecipitate transfusion in the first 6\u2009h after admission, use of recombinant factor VIIa, or the presence of a known coagulation disorder. Consent was obtained under an institutional review board\u2013approved waiver of informed consent. Attempts were made to consent the patient, or a legally authorized representative if the patient was not able to provide consent, as soon as possible. In the situation where no legally authorized representative was available or the patient did not become consentable, the patient was excluded from the study.\nPatient characteristics, including demographics, admission physiological and laboratory values, AIS scores, and Injury Severity Score (ISS), were recorded. Blood was obtained at admission, 6, 12, 24, and 48\u2009h for coagulation assays, prothrombin time (PT), INR, aPTT, fibrinogen, and D-dimer (STAGO compact; Diagnostica Stago S.A.S., Asni\u00e8res-sur-Seine, France), TEG (TEG 5000; Haemonetics Corporation, Boston, MA), thrombin-antithrombin complexes (MyBioSource, San Diego, CA), prothrombin fragments 1\u2009+\u20092, (MyBioSource), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA; Procarta Biosystems Ltd., Norwich, UK). TEG was performed at the same time points. Fresh whole-blood specimens in kaolin-activated cups were used. Standard TEG measurements, including\nR\nvalue,\nK\nvalue, maximum amplitude, \u03b1 angle, and LY30, were obtained.\n\nImaging\nComputerized axial tomography (CAT) of the head was performed at admission and 6\u2009h after admission in all patients, per institutional protocol. Volumes of subdural, epidural, and intraparenchymal hemorrhages were quantified using the previously validated ABC/2 method.\n17\nBriefly, the CAT slice with the largest area of hemorrhage was identified. The largest diameter (\nA\n) of the hemorrhage on this slice was measured. The largest diameter 90 degrees to\nA\non the same slice was measured next (\nB\n). Finally, the approximate number of 10-mm slices on which the ICH was seen was calculated (\nC\n).\n17\n,\n18\nProgression of hemorrhage was defined as \u226530% increase in the total hemorrhage volume, or by attending radiologist interpretation in the case of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Previous literature has established that hemorrhage growth of \u223c30% on serial head CAT is a conservative definition for progression of intracranial hemorrhage.\n19\n\nStatistical analyses\nBaseline patient characteristics were compared between patients with and without progression of intracranial hemorrhage. Median values of each lab value were plotted over time by progression status. Labs at admission and 6\u2009h were compared between patients with and without progression of intracranial hemorrhage. To determine whether there was a significant difference in lab values between patients with and without ICH progression, linear regression was conducted with the lab value as the outcome and progression status as the primary predictor. The analysis was conducted separately for admission and 6\u2009h. Patient covariates were included in this regression analysis if\np\n<\u20090.25 when comparing those who progressed and those who did not. The covariates included in the linear regression model were sex, aspirin use within week preceding injury, age, ISS, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and AIS head.\nLabs at admission and 6\u2009h were compared between patients who progressed and did not progress. To determine whether there was a significant difference in lab values between patients who did and did not have ICH progression, linear regression was conducted with the lab value as the outcome and progression status as the primary predictor. Lab values were log transformed when heavily right skewed. This analysis was conducted separately for admission and 6\u2009h. Patient covariates were included in this regression analysis if they were thought to be clinically meaningful and\np\n<\u20090.25 when comparing between progressers and non-progressers; therefore, the covariates included were sex, aspirin in week preceding age, ISS, GCS, and AIS head. In order to correct for multiple comparisons, a Bonferroni correction was used and a\np\nvalue of <0.002 was considered significant (13 labs, two times, 26 comparisons, 0.05/26\u2009=\u20090.0019, \u223c0.002).\nDescriptive statistics and plots over time were performed for all time points (admission, 6\u2009h, 12\u2009h, 24\u2009h, and 48\u2009h). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated to illustrate the performance of log-transformed D-dimer at admission and 6\u2009h in classifying patients with and without progression. No other patient characteristics were controlled for in the generation of these ROC curves.\nPatient data were deidentified and maintained in a Microsoft Excel database (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). Data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation or median (interquartile rage; IQR) or percentage, as appropriate. Univariate comparisons were made using Student's\nt\n-test for normally distributed data, Mann-Whitney U tests for non-normally distributed data, and chi-square or Fischer's exact test for proportions. Analyses were performed using SAS software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Oregon Health & Science University and followed the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki."

    "Methods": "Subjects\nFor all experiments, 6- or 8-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Upon arrival, mice were group housed under a 12-h/12-h light/dark cycle with\nad libitum\naccess to food and water. Mice were given a 5- to 7-day period of acclimation to the University Laboratory Animal Research facility at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University (Philadelphia, PA) prior to the administration of experimental traumatic brain injury. Only male mice were used in this study as sex as a biological variable is beyond the scope of this study and is considered in ongoing experiments. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Temple University and the NIDA-IRP Animal Care and Use Committee, and complied with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH, Publication 865-23).\n\nControlled cortical impact\nFollowing the acclimation period, experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI) of three severities (sham, mild, and moderate), was administered to different groups of mice using an Impact One\u2122 Stereotaxic CCI Instrument (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) outfitted with a piston (2-mm diameter) as previously described.\n24\nThe CCI model offers the advantage of reproducing the key pathological features that are seen in human TBI.\n27\n,\n28\nFor instance, the resulting neuropathology closely simulates the cortical tissue loss, acute subdural hematoma, neuronal (cell body and axonal) injury, inflammation (immune recruitment, astrocytic and microglial activation), blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, and concussion. Mice were anesthetized using vaporized isoflurane (5% induction, 2% maintenance) and placed in a Just for Mouse\u2122 Stereotaxic Instrument (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL). An Ideal Micro-Drill\u2122 (CellPoint Scientific Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) with a 0.5-mm rounded burr was used to perform a craniectomy removing a 4-mm bone flap located to the right of the sagittal suture between lambda and bregma under a Zeiss Stemi 2000-C stereomicroscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC, Thornwood, NY) equipped with a SCHOTT EasyLED Ringlight (SCHOTT North America Inc., Elmsford, NY). The electro-magnetically\u2013driven piston was placed at the surface of the exposed parenchyma and a single discharge (moderate: speed: 4.5\u2009m/sec, dwell time: 0.5\u2009sec, depth: 2\u2009mm; mild: speed: 2.0\u2009m/sec, dwell time: 0.5\u2009sec, depth: 1\u2009mm) produced mild- or moderate- (Mod) CCI-TBI in 6-week-old adolescent and 8-week-old young adult male mice. The craniectomy site was then covered by a sterile, 6-mm glass cover slip (ProSciTech Pty Ltd, Kirwan, Australia) adhered to the skull using Vetbond\u2122 tissue adhesive (3M, St. Paul, MN). Post-operatively, mice were individually housed to ensure surgical recovery and weighed and monitored daily for 7 days. Sham controls (craniectomy only) underwent identical surgical procedures except impactor discharge. Na\u00efve controls were individually housed at the same time as experimental mice.\n\nRotarod\nMotor performance was assessed at 48\u2009h and 7 days following induction of experimental TBI. A rotarod apparatus equipped with a 3\u2009cm rotating rod and five lanes each with an automatic timer and falling sensor was used (40\u2009cm width\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u2009cm depth\u2009\u00d7\u200938\u2009cm height; Ugo Basile, Mt. Laurel, NJ). Before the testing sessions, mice were habituated to stay on the rod at a constant speed of 4\u2009rpm for two 3-min trials. During testing sessions, mice were placed on the rod with the speed set to accelerate from 4-40\u2009rpm over a duration of 5\u2009min. Each testing session consisted of three 5-min trials. Latency to fall from the rotating rod was recorded. Post-injury motor performance was compared with within-subject baseline performance recorded the day before injury to evaluate any motor deficits resulting from TBI. For each TBI severity, there were\nn\n=\u20098 mice per group.\n\nConditioned Place Preference\nTwo weeks following TBI, behavior was assessed using a biased CPP assay as previously described.\n24\n,\n25\nBriefly, this assay consists of three phases that each take place in custom-designed Plexiglas two-compartment chambers (13.75 inches length\u2009\u00d7\u20095.25 inches width\u2009\u00d7\u20095.00 inches height; KB Acrylics Inc., Westville, NJ). One compartment was fitted with black walls and a coarse-textured floor, the other was fitted with white and black striped walls and a smooth-surfaced floor. Compartment bias was determined during the first phase (pre-test) when mice had access to both compartments through a door opening in the divider wall for 30\u2009min and time spent in each compartment was recorded. The compartment with a lower residence time was assigned as the drug-paired, least-preferred compartment. During the second phase (conditioning), mice were randomly assigned to receive one of three doses of cocaine, administered in the morning by intraperitoneal (IP) injection (vehicle, 2.5\u2009mg/kg or 10.0\u2009mg/kg). In rodents, cocaine reaches a maximum concentration of 10.1\u2009\u03bcM around 20-30\u2009min post\u2013IP injection and then gradually declines thereafter, especially from 120\u2009min and beyond. Therefore, each mouse was immediately placed in its least-preferred compartment for 30\u2009min following IP cocaine without access to the preferred compartment. After a minimum of a 4-h washout period, mice were injected with 0.9% saline and placed in the preferred compartment for 30\u2009min.\n29-31\nThis schedule persisted for 6 days.\nDuring the third phase (post-test), mice were placed in the chamber again for 30\u2009min with free access to both compartments without any injections. The rewarding effects of cocaine were evaluated by a place preference shift, which was calculated by subtracting the time spent in the drug-paired compartment during the pre-test from the time spent in the drug-paired compartment during the post-test. When testing or conditioning occurred on the same day, mice assigned to various injury severity conditions were distributed equally to control for any influence of time of test. This assay was repeated in Na\u00efve and Mod-CCI-TBI only using vehicle, 30\u2009mg/kg cocaine, or 50\u2009mg/kg cocaine to assess the descending curve of the typical inverted-U shaped dose response curve in adolescent mice. For each TBI severity and dose of cocaine tested, there were\nn\n=\u20098-14 mice per group.\n\nLocomotor activity monitoring\nTwo weeks following TBI, a separate cohort of experimental mice was evaluated for the effect of TBI on cocaine-induced locomotor activity according to procedures described previously.\n24\n,\n32\nLocomotor activity of individual mice was measured in open-field activity chambers (18 inches length\u2009\u00d7\u200914 inches width\u2009\u00d7\u20098 inches height) using the AccuScan Home Cage Activity System (Omnitech Electronics, Inc., Columbus, OH). Sixteen photobeams arranged along the horizontal axis of the activity chamber were used to automatically collect ambulatory activity (horizontal beam breaks) and stereotypy activity (repeated beam breaks) data from the sensor panels in 5-min intervals. Basal locomotor activity was measured for 60\u2009min prior to the administration of either vehicle or 2.5\u2009mg/kg or 10.0\u2009mg/kg cocaine. Locomotor activity was recorded for an additional 60\u2009min following injections. For each TBI severity and dose of cocaine tested, there were\nn\n=\u20098 mice per group.\n\nComposite Neuroscore\nAt time-points ranging from 24\u2009h to 3 weeks post-TBI, mice were assessed for neurological motor function on a 4-point scale known as the Composite Neuroscore. This battery uses a series of five neurobehavioral tests: 1) forelimb extension; 2) forelimb paw placement; 3) hindlimb flexion; 4) lateral pulsion; and 5) observation of abnormal twisting behavior. Animals received scores from +4 (uninjured) to 0 (nonfunctional) for both left and right forelimbs in the forelimb extension task and forelimb paw placement, the left and right hindlimbs in hindlimb flexion, and left and right sides for the lateral pulsion test. If no twisting was observed, the animal was scored as normal (+1), and if twisting was present the animal was scored as abnormal (0). The total possible score was 33. Total number of errors (total possible score of 33 \u2013 total actual score) is reported. Scores are reported as the average error values given by three different experimenters who were blind to animal condition. The maximum standard deviation of scores between experimenters was 0.57 errors. For each TBI severity, there were\nn\n=\u20098 mice per group.\n\nY-Maze\nAdditional experimental mice were evaluated for the effect of TBI on cognition 2 weeks post-TBI using the Y-Maze Spontaneous Alternation test. The maze was comprised of three arms at a 120\u00b0 angle from each other (32\u2009cm length\u2009\u00d7\u2009610\u2009cm width\u2009\u00d7\u200926\u2009cm height; San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA). Individual mice were placed in the center of the Y-shaped maze and allowed to freely explore the three arms for a duration of 5\u2009min. The total number of arm entries and the sequential order of entries were recorded. Spontaneous alternations were defined as three consecutive entries into three different arms. Percent alternation was calculated as the total number of alternations divided by the total number of arm entries. For each TBI severity, there were\nn\n=\u20098 mice per group.\n\nFlow cytometry analysis of immune infiltration and microglia\nBrain tissue was harvested from a separate cohort of mice at either 2, 5, 14, or 28 days post\u2013CCI-TBI and analyzed for both the impacted and non-impacted hemispheres. Tissue was placed into Hank's Balanced Salt Solution and held on ice until processing. The cerebellum was removed, and hemispheres were separated using a mouse brain matrix (Zivic Instruments, Pittsburgh, PA) and clean razor blades. Each hemisphere was homogenized in RPMI in a 5-mL ounce homogenizer (12-16 strokes) using a previous protocol.\n4\nIn short, homogenized brains were combined to a final 30% Percoll solution (9\u2009mL Percoll, 1\u2009mL 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) without calcium/magnesium, 10\u2009mL RPMI), then centrifuged in a fixed angle rotor at 7800\u2009g for 30\u2009min at room temperature (RT). Floating myelin debris was removed, and the remaining cell solution was passed through a 40\u2009\u03bcm cell strainer. The volume was brought up to 50\u2009mL with RPMI and centrifuged at 1500\u2009rpm for 5\u2009min at RT. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1\u2009mL FACS Buffer and transferred to 5\u2009mL polystyrene flow cytometry tubes. A total of 1\u2009mL of Ficoll-Paque PREMIUM was carefully layered under the cell solution, then spun at 2500\u2009rpm for 25\u2009min at RT without brake. The white layer at the interface (\u223c1\u2009mL) was transferred to a new flow cytometry tube, washed with FACS buffer, and pelleted at 1500\u2009rpm for 5\u2009min. Fc receptors were blocked for 15\u2009min, then cells labeled using the following antibodies/reagents purchased from eBioscience Inc./Thermo Fisher Scientific unless indicated otherwise: CD11b (Pacific Blue), CD45 (AmCyan), Ly6G (APC), fixability dye and lineage markers (FVD, CD3, CD9, Siglec F, NK1.1, APC-Cy7), Ly6C (PerCP-5.5), CX3CR-1 (Pe-Cy7, Biolegend). The intracellular protein post-synaptic density scaffolding protein 95 (PSD95; Abcam ab76115, PE secondary) was labeled after fixation and permeabilization. Samples were read on a BD FACS Canto II and data analysis was performing using FlowJo\n\u00ae\nsoftware (FlowJo, LLC).\nOur gating strategy involved gating on singlet populations on FSC-H versus FSC-A, then on live lineage negative populations. Then microglial and leukocytes were gated as CD11b\n+\n, CD45\n+\n. Neutrophils were excluded by Ly6G. Then gating on Ly6C vs. CD45, monocytes (CD45\nhigh\n) and microglia (CD45\nlow\n) could be identified. Monocyte subtypes were identified by differential Ly6C expression (low, intermediate, high [Ly6C\nlow\n, Ly6C\nint\n, Ly6C\nhigh\n]). Microglia were then gated for CX3CR-1\nlow\nand PSD95\n+\ncells. For each TBI severity, there were\nn\n=\u20093-4 mice per group.\nNucleus accumbens (NAc) punch-outs were processed using a modified version of the above protocol with reduced volumes. Brains were sectioned using the mouse matrix and tissue containing the NAc was excised using a brain microdissection tool 1.25\u2009mm in diameter (Stoelting Co.). A total of 1.25\u2009mm punchouts of the NAc from the right (impacted) hemisphere were homogenized using a pestle. Punchouts were resuspended in a 30% Percoll solution as above and centrifuged at 7800\u2009g for 30\u2009min RT. Myelin debris was removed, and cells were washed, centrifuged, and underlaid with Ficoll. The interface was collected after a spin at 2500\u2009rpm for 25\u2009min at RT without brake. Cells were then washed and stained as described above. For each TBI severity, there were\nn\n=\u20094-5 mice per group.\n\nGolgi-Cox staining and imaging\nTwo weeks post-TBI, brains were harvested and placed in Golgi-Cox impregnation solution according to manufacturer's instructions (FD Rapid GolgiStain\u2122 Kit; FD NeuroTechnologies Inc., Columbia, MD). After 24\u2009h, the impregnation solution was refreshed, and brains were incubated for an additional 2 weeks at RT in the dark. Golgi-Cox impregnated brains were transferred to a 30% sucrose/30% ethylene glycol/1% PVP-40 cryoprotectant solution and allowed to equilibrate at 4\u00b0C. Brains were subsequently segmented in 2\u2009mm increments and sectioned at a thickness of 200\u2009\u03bcm using medium speed and frequency settings on the VT1000 S vibratome (Leica Biosystems). Sections were collected in cryoprotectant solution, mounted on gelatin-coated slides (FD NeuroTechnologies, Inc.; Cat. PO101), and allowed to dry for 48\u2009h. Dried sections were rehydrated in water and stained via a 10-min dark immersion in freshly prepared 20% ammonia solution (Fisher, Cat A669-212), and a 10-min dark immersion in freshly prepared 1% sodium thiosulfate solution (Fisher, Cat S445-500). Stained sections were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series and cleared in xylene. Sections were mounted with Permount Mounting Medium (Fisher, Cat SP15-100) and high tolerance No. 1.5 cover glass (Marienfeld, Cat 0107242) and allowed to dry for 72\u2009h prior to imaging.\nGolgi-Cox stained sections were scanned with a long working distance water immersion 20\u2009\u00d7\u2009objective APO lens (NA 0.95) under 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009optimal zoom using a DS-Ri2 color camera outfitted on Nikon's A1R resonant scanning confocal system. Images were collected at a resolution of 4908\u2009\u00d7\u20093264 pixels, with a pixel resolution of 0.24\u2009\u03bcm, to allow for maximal discrimination of dendritic spines. Sections were scanned at multiple z levels and screened against the\nMouse Brain Atlas\n(Paxinos and Franklin, 2nd edition) for coordinate determination. For all treatment groups, 100\u2009\u03bcm multi-point z-stacks medial and ventral to the anterior commissure, with a step size of 0.6\u2009\u03bcm, were collected from the rostral end of sections spanning approximately +1.78 bregma to +1.94 bregma. Resultant brightfield z-stack images were converted to grayscale, inverted and converted to a 16-bit format to create a pseudo-fluorescence image, and three dimensionally deconvolved via the Richardson-Lucy algorithm. All inversions and conversions were carried out on Nikon's NIS-Elements AR 5.11.00 software interface. Subsequent analyses of dendritic spine metrics within the NAc core and shell were performed using the FilamentTracer module within the Imaris v8.1.2 imaging software (Bitplane; Zurich, Switzerland).\nOnce the Z-stacks were loaded in Imaris, the surface module was used to render the images into three-dimensional (3D) volumes. The surface rendered neurons in the volume were then processed with the filament module for the identification and measurement of neuronal dendrite and dendritic spine characteristics. The measurements presented in the results are based on the following parameters. Dendrites starting point diameter\u2009=\u200912 microns, dendrite seed points\u2009=\u20090.5 microns, dendrite diameter threshold\u2009=\u20095.2 microns, and the dendrite diameter algorithm was set to distance map. Spine seed point diameter\u2009=\u20090.3 microns, spine maximum length\u2009=\u200910.0 microns, no branched spine detection was enabled, spine seed point threshold\u2009=\u20091153.46 microns, spine diameter threshold was set to automatic, and spine diameter algorithm was set to distance map. For each TBI severity, there were\nn\n=\u20093-4 mice per group.\n\nReal-time polymerase chain reaction\nThe expression of genes associated with the dopamine system and synaptic plasticity was evaluated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) as previously described.\n24\n,\n25\nBriefly, 2 weeks post-injury, brains were removed following transcardial perfusion with 20\u2009mL 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009PBS (Corning) and segmented in 2-mm segments using the mouse matrix. Segments were immediately placed into RNALater Solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored at 4\u00b0C overnight. A total of 1.25\u2009mm punch-outs containing the NAc were excised as described above, processed to isolate RNA using TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and quantified using a NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and an Eppendorf Mastercycler pro (Eppendorf AG, Hauppauge, NY). The prepared cDNA was then mixed with nuclease-free water, TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the following TaqMan probes for dopamine and plasticity genes:\nDAT, DR1, DR2, TH, VMAT, MAOA,\nand\nPSD-95.\nData were analyzed using ExpressionSuite Software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the delta-delta threshold cycle (Ct) method (Relative Quantification). Data are expressed as the relative fold change compared with age-matched, sham controls. For each TBI severity, there were\nn\n=\u20094 mice per group.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData were analyzed for statistical significance using Prism software (version 6.0h; GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's\npost hoc\ntests were performed to analyze the place preference shift data from our cocaine CPP assay and locomotor activity counts. Analysis of immune infiltration and microglia were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's\npost hoc\ntests. Our gene expression data was analyzed by \u0394\u0394Ct, normalized to 18S, and are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM) fold change, and statistical significance was determined by Student's t-tests, corrected for multiple comparisons using the Holm-Sidak method. For all tests, statistical significance was defined at\np\n<\u20090.05. For any outlier analysis, the Q coefficient was set to 1% using the ROUT method in GraphPad Prism in order to generate strict thresholds for ruling out outliers."

    "Methods": "Four juvenile crossbreed neutered male sheep (Ovis aries) weighing 26.5 and 24.2\u2009kg (age: 14 weeks), 34.5 and 32.0\u2009kg (age: 22 weeks) were supplied by Thomas D. Morris, Inc. (Reisterstown, MD). The lambs were pair housed, provided with environmental enrichment, and acclimated in the Yale Animal Resource Center for 9\u201310 days before surgery and imaging procedures. The room temperature was maintained at 22.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1\u00b0C with a photoperiod of 12\u2009h of light and 12\u2009h of darkness. Water and hay were providedad libitum,and animals were fed 2\u20133% of body weight daily with commercially prepared ruminant diet (Teklad 7060) supplemented with fresh vegetables. Each animal was examined and determined to be healthy and free of clinical disease by Yale veterinary clinicians.\n\nThe Animal Care program is fully accredited by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation for Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC), and all procedures and experiments were approved in advance by the Yale University Institutional Animal Care and Use committee (IACUC).\n\nEach fasted lamb was premedicated with acepromazine (0.05\u2009mg/kg) dosed intramuscularly and then induced with ketamine (2.7\u2009mg/kg) and diazepam (0.2\u2009mg/kg) intravenously to allow endotracheal intubation and subsequent maintenance on isoflurane gas (1\u20133%) via mechanical ventilation. Buprenorphine (0.01\u2009mg/kg) was given intramuscularly to provide opioid analgesia and lactated Ringers solution was administered intravenously at the continuous rate of 4\u2009mL/kg/h for fluid maintenance. Thermal support was provided with a circulating warm water pad to control and maintain body temperature (38\u201339\u00b0C), and an orogastric tube was placed to allow venting of gas, thus preventing excessive rumen distension.\n\nBefore the initial incision, a local anesthetic injection of 0.5% bupivacaine solution (1\u2009mg/kg) was made at the surgery site to provide multimodal analgesia. Continuous monitoring of the depth of anesthesia and stability of vital signs in the surgery suite was accomplished using a Mindray DPM6 patient monitor (Mindray DS USA, Inc). Burr holes were made bilaterally 1.5\u2009cm anterior and lateral to the posterior fontanelle at an angle of 10 degrees from the sagittal plane on each side. A pediatric slotted stylet was inserted through each burr hole and guided anatomically into the lateral ventricle. Proper location in the lateral ventricle was confirmed by CSF flow, and pressures were measured by manometry.\n\nThe cooling catheters were designed by CoolSpine, LLC (Woodbury, CT) and contain three lumens: two lumens accomplish the delivery and removal of supersaturated saline in a closed loop circuit, which is maintained at -7 to -10\u00b0C. In addition, the third lumen functions as an external ventricular drain for intracranial pressure management. This lumen was modified to allow contrast agent infusion during the imaging procedures. TmDOTMA-(7\u2009mg/kg) was infused directly into the lateral ventricles at an infusion rate of 1\u2009mL/h. Two cooling catheters were placed via the burr holes directly into both the right and left lateral ventricles (named right and left catheters, respectively). This technique is consistent with capabilities of common clinical practice in neurological intensive care units. Continuous monitoring of the depth of anesthesia and vital signs in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suite was accomplished using an Invivo Precess 3160DCU patient monitor (Invivo Corporation Orlando, FL). After the completion of the imaging procedures, each animal was euthanatized with an intravenous dose of sodium pentobarbital-based euthanasia solution (Euthasol\u00ae).\n\nThe MRI and spectroscopy (MRS) datasets were obtained on a Varian 7.0T/68\u2009cm horizontal-bore spectrometer (Magnex Scientific Ltd.) using a1H resonator/surface coil RF probe. The MR images were acquired using a 128\u2009\u00d7\u2009128 gradient-echo (GE) pulse sequence with a field of view (FOV) of 10\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009cm, with 17 slices of 5\u2009mm thickness with a repetition time (TR) of 200\u2009msec and an echo-time (TE) of 5\u2009msec. The 17\u2009\u00d7\u200917\u2009\u00d7\u200917 three-dimensional (3D) chemical shift imaging (CSI) datasets were acquired with spherical encoding of k-space as described previously20with a TR of 20\u2009msec and a FOV of 15.3\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u200915.3\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u200915.3\u2009cm. A single-banded refocused 90-degree Shinnar-Le Roux radiofrequency pulse of 40\u2009kHz bandwidth and 500\u2009\u03bcsec was used for selective excitation of the TmDOTMA-methyl group protons.\n\nThe CSI data were reconstructed to 34\u2009\u00d7\u200934\u2009\u00d7\u200917 resolution with a voxel size of 4.5\u2009\u00d7\u20094.5\u2009\u00d7\u20099.0\u2009mm3. The spectra were line broadened (200\u2009Hz), phased (zero order), and baseline corrected (first order) in Matlab. The temperature was calculated in each voxel from the chemical shift of TmDOTMA-methyl group\u03b4CH3according to the equation:\n\n\n\nwhere \u03b4CH3is the measured chemical shift of the methyl resonance of TmDOTMA-and a1, a2, and a3are 34.45\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01, 1.460\u2009\u00b1\u20090.003, and 0.0152\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0009, respectively, from linear least square fitting of calibration data over the physiological range of temperature values.19The temperature from each voxel was measured and plotted in an axial slice, which was coregistered with anatomical imaging to show the spatial distribution of the temperature values throughout the brain.\n\nDuring the imaging session, baseline anatomical images were acquired before the TmDOTMA-infusion. Next, baseline temperature maps were acquired to establish the basal brain temperature. Then the flow of cooling solution was started through the right catheter at a rate of 35\u2009mL/min, during which CSI data for temperature mapping were obtained. Each animal underwent a cooling paradigm with temperature maps acquired at 10\u2009min intervals throughout all phases of cooling and recovery.\n\nIn two animals, flow was initiated in the right catheter, and after cooling for 40\u2009min, flow was then directed through both catheters with increasing flow rates up to 48\u2009mL/h before cooling was stopped and the temperature was allowed to recover. In two additional animals, flow was initiated in the right catheter for 30\u2009min and then stopped for 10\u2009min to allow the temperature to recover. The flow was then restarted in only the left catheter for 30\u2009min. Again after a cooling period, the flow was either stopped and the temperature was allowed to recover or flow was initiated through both catheters.\n\nThroughout all phases of cooling and recovery, CSI data were obtained every 10\u2009min for temperature mapping. A final CSI dataset for temperature mapping was obtained at the end of the experiments after the cessation of cooling to show the return of temperature toward normothermia.\n\nFor consistency of the analysis when calculating cooling or recovery rates, we used temperature measurements obtained during the first cooling event in each sheep. The initial cooling phase was considered to be the period after the baseline temperature mapping and until the first period of recovery (during which the flow through the catheter had been stopped). Similarly, the initial recovery phase was the first period during which flow through the catheter was stopped, but before flow of the cooling solution was restarted. The rate of temperature change k was calculated based on the change in temperature (\u0394T) divided by the time interval over which the change occurred (\u0394t).\n\n\n\nThe subsequent diverse time courses of temperature change in individual animals (when flow was initiated either through each catheter or when flow was increased through both catheters) were used to show the robustness and reproducibility of the cooling technique.\n\nRegional variations of temperature were assessed by assigning voxels to regions of interest (ROIs) corresponding to different brain regions based on a previously published high-resolution sheep brain atlas.21All statistics were performed based on average ROI temperature values. All temperature measurements, changes in temperature, and rates of change of temperature are all reported as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation. All comparisons were assessed using a two-tailedttest wherepvalues <0.05 were considered to be significant."

    "Methods": "Design\nThis study was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data.\n\nCohort\nOver a 13-year period, from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2017, 950 MRI-proven isolated cervical TSCI patients were admitted to this level I trauma center for management. From this cohort, we screened and selected 72 patients who were eligible for this investigation. The\ninclusion criteria\nwere being \u226516 years of age; Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score \u226514; no concurrent life-threatening injury or disease; imaging studies compatible with subaxial cervical spine fracture dislocations; available good quality pre- and post-operative computed tomography (CT) and MRI studies indicating complete spinal cord decompression following surgery;\n35\nand follow-up of at least 6 months after trauma and surgical management. The\nexclusion criteria\nwere being obtunded, stuporous, and non-testable; having penetrating subaxial TSCI; having upper cervical SCI; a post-operative MRI indicating inadequate spinal cord decompression; non-operative management; having had a cervical CT myelogram and not an MRI as the primary imaging study; dying or being lost to follow-up; or having poor-quality imaging studies. This study was performed after approval from the institutional review board (IRB) of the Human Research Protection Office (HRPO).\n\nResuscitation, survey, and neurological examination\nPatients were transferred to the trauma resuscitation unit (TRU) by emergency medical technicians (EMTs).\n49\nWe received intubated and non-intubated patients supine on a backboard with the head and neck secured with a hard collar and chin strap. Median scene or transfer time after the accident was 1\u2009h (mean, 2.3; standard deviation [SD], 3; range, 0.3\u201315\u2009h). In the TRU, primary and secondary examinations were performed by one of three teams of trauma surgeons who received the patients. Once the patients were medically stable, members of the neurosurgical team (senior resident or nurse practitioners) first examined and then presented them to the attending neurosurgeon. Admission ASIA motor score and AIS grade were determined according to the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI).\n50\nASIA motor scores and AIS grades, which were used for statistical calculation were the ones with no effect from sedatives, analgesics, or mental confusion. In the majority of our patients, the TRU examination was definitive; however, in a minority of patients, the neurological examination within the first 72\u2009h following trauma was used once the sedatives, analgesics and anesthetics were cleared from the patient's body.\n\nImaging studies\nEligible patients had imaging studies performed when they were medically stable. Cervical spine CT was performed within a median of 2\u2009h (mean, 3.2; SD, 3.1; range, 3.5\u201315.8\u2009h) and MRI was performed within a median of 5.8\u2009h (mean, 7.2; SD, 5.1; range, 2.4\u201339.5\u2009h) from the time of the accident. The median time between the accident and MRI was 5\u2009h for the ultra-early patients (mean 5.9\u2009h, range 3\u201312\u2009h), 6\u2009h for the early patients (mean 6.8\u2009h, range 2.9\u201314\u2009h), and 6\u2009h for the late patients (mean 10.4\u2009h, range 3.5\u201339.5\u2009h). Fracture morphology was based on the Harris and coworkers,\n51\nAllen and coworkers,\n52\nand AO Spine\n53\nclassification systems. Admission T2-weighted and short T1 inversion recovery (STIR) sequences were used to measure the IMLL and the extent of spinal cord compression/decompression before and after surgery.\n18\n,\n35\nAn attending trauma neuroradiologist and the principal investigator independently measured the IMLL, and the mean value was taken for statistical analysis.\n18\n\nMedical management\nFrom 2005 to 2009, 22 of the study patients were administered methylprednisolone following SCI: 30\u2009mg/kg within the first hour and 5.4\u2009mg/kg/h for the next 23\u2009h.\n54\nIn 2010, this trauma center stopped the use of steroids for SCI. Patients' mean arterial blood pressure was maintained between 85 and 90\u2009mm Hg for 7 days following trauma.\n54\n,\n55\n\nTraction and surgical intervention\nWhen indicated, we applied traction for the reduction of cervical spine deformities immediately following CT and/or MRI studies.\n35\n,\n56\nWe set up traction in the TRU, on a Stryker Wedge Turning Frame (Stryker Global Headquarters, Kalamazoo, Michigan) using real-time fluoroscopy. We applied incremental weights of 2\u20134 kgs per skeletal segment within a maximum of 30\u201345\u2009min. If this was not successful, we reduced the deformity during surgery. Twenty patients had traction for unilateral (\nn\n=\u20093) or bilateral (\nn\n=\u200914) jumped facets or for compression fracture with >3\u2009mm translation (\nn\n=\u20093). We did not apply skeletal traction in 52 patients for several reasons: no evidence of fracture dislocation (\nn\n=\u200917); flexion or extension injury without translation (\nn\n=\u200920); compression fracture with <3\u2009mm translation (\nn\n=\u200912); or unilateral locked facets (\nn\n=\u20093).\n\nSurgical management\nPatients were decompressed and internally fixed within a median of 12\u2009h (mean, 18.8; SD, 19.4; range, 4.5\u2013138.5\u2009h). Thirty-two (44.5%) patients were operated on in <12\u2009h, 25 (34.7%) were operated on within 12\u201324\u2009h, and 15 (20.8%) were operated on >24\u2013138.5\u2009h after the trauma. Nine neurosurgeons including four spine fellowship-trained neurosurgeons performed the surgeries. Surgeries included anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) in 10, ACDF+laminectomy in 25; anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF) in 9; ACCF+laminectomy in 11; and only laminectomy in 17.\n35\n,\n46\n,\n57\nPost-operative CT and MRI were performed to confirm appropriate technique and to verify spinal cord decompression. Post-operative MRI studies were performed within a median of 34\u2009h (mean, 45.1; SD, 30.8; range, 13.5\u2013148.5\u2009h). Post-operative MRI in the ultra-early group was performed a median of 31.5\u2009h following trauma (mean 34.2, range 13.5\u201395.5\u2009h). In the early group, the median time following trauma was 29.8\u2009h (mean 42.4 and range 18.8\u2013139.5\u2009h). In the late group, the median time following trauma to MRI was 56.9\u2009h (mean 72.9 and range 39.8\u2013148.5\u2009h). Two spine fellowship-trained neurosurgeons, one fellowship-trained neurotrauma neurosurgeon, a trauma neuroradiologist, and the principal investigator independently verified complete spinal cord decompression on postoperative MRI studies.\n35\nSpinal cord decompression was defined as presence of cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space around the spinal cord circumferentially in all patients.\n\nPost-operative ICU care and follow-up\nThe post-operative course in the ICU included deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis by enoxaparin (Lovenox\n\u00ae\n, Sanofi, USA), 30\u2009mg twice daily starting within 24\u201348\u2009h of admission, and screening by duplex ultrasound for venous thromboembolism (VTE). When needed, patients had early tracheostomy for ventilator support and percutaneous gastroenterostomy for nutrition. When fully weaned from ventilator support, the patients were transferred to rehabilitation centers. While in the ICU, daily neurological examination including digital rectal examination was performed to determine ASIA motor score and evidence for AIS grade conversion. Following discharge, the patients returned at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months (or longer) for follow-up neurological examinations. Certified neurologists, rehabilitation specialists, the principal investigator, senior residents, and nurse practitioners performed neurological examinations to document any change in ASIA motor score and AIS grade conversion.\n18\n,\n35"

    "Methods": "Summary of patients included in study\nWe retrospectively studied records from 99 patients who had been admitted to the Midlands Centre for Spinal Injuries (MCSI) between 1980 and 2017. These patients were from a cohort who had previously consented for their patient records to be accessed as part of two other ethically approved studies (National Research Ethics Service [NRES] Committee North West Liverpool East [11/NW/0876] and NRES Committee West Midlands, Staffordshire [13/WM/0158]). Seventeen patients were excluded: one patient because of previous acute myeloid leukemia, the remaining because of incomplete data on initial and 3 month follow-up International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI (ISNCSCI) AIS (American Spinal Injury Association [ASIA] Impairment Scale) scores, or their injuries being non-traumatic.\nEighty-two SCI patients (age range 17\u201381 years) whose initial blood samples were taken on average at 7\u2009\u00b1\u20094 days following traumatic injury were included in the statistical analyses (\nTable 1\n). The blood data were reviewed, and information regarding full blood counts, urea/electrolytes, liver function, bone profile measures including magnesium, C-reactive protein (CRP), and other parameters such as prothrombin time were recorded (Table S1). Routine blood analyses were conducted in the Haematology and Biochemistry department located at the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital. Hematology analyses were performed on either a Beckman Coulter LH-500 or a Sysmex XN-1000, whereas biochemical analyses used VITROS slides (dry multi-layered chemistry slides) in conjunction with the VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System to measure albumin, alanine transaminase (ALT), calcium, creatinine, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), potassium, magnesium, sodium, phosphate, total bilirubin, total protein, and urea.\nTable 1.\nSummary of Clinical Information for the Patient Cohort\nSCI Patients (\nn\n)\nAge (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD) 44.4\u2009\u00b1\u200917.2 years\n82\nMales\n60\nFemales\n22\nLevel of injury:\nCervical\n47\nThoracic\n27\nLumbar\n8\nInjury level:\nAbove L1\n72\nAt L1\n6\nBelow L1\n2\nNeurologically intact\n2\nInitial AIS score:\nA\n34\nB\n9\nC\n26\nD\n11\nE\n2\nOutcome AIS score:\nA\n29\nB\n7\nC\n15\nD\n29\nE\n2\nComplete\n34\nIncomplete\n46\nNeurologically intact\n2\nTetraplegic\n46\nParaplegic\n34\nImprovers:\nA\u2009\u2192\u2009B\n3\nA\u2009\u2192\u2009C\n2\nB\u2009\u2192\u2009C\n2\nB\u2009\u2192\u2009D\n3\nC\u2009\u2192\u2009D\n15\nCCS patients\n11\nVertebral fracture\n67\nSurgery required following injury\n34\nInitial infection\n7\nDiabetes\n8\nPressure sores\n9\n*\nComorbidities:\nNone\n60\nOne\n11\nTwo\n7\nThree\n3\n**\nSmoker:\nNo\n47\nPrevious\n13\nYes\n20\n**\nAlcohol:\nNo\n16\nYes\n64\nMedications with potential to impact blood analytes:\nNo\n34\nYes, but no known impact\n18\nYes, and potential to impact\n30\nImpact of existing ailments on blood samples:\nNone\n46\nOne ailment\n19\nTwo or more ailments\n17\n*\nPolytrauma\n47\nNon-polytrauma\n34\nBritish\n70\nOpen in a separate window\n*\nAsterisks indicate that information regarding these parameters were unavailable for one (\n*\n) or two (\n**\n) of the patients respectively. Characteristics in italics were not inputted into the multiple regression models.\nSCI, spinal cord injury; SD, standard deviation; AIS, American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale; CCS, central cord syndrome.\nAIS scores were collated and broken down into muscle function (AIS motor [M]) and sensory (AIS Sens) scores with the sensory scores being split further into touch (T) and pain (P) scores. AIS scores for muscle function focus on 10 key muscle groups,\n24\nso whenever possible, a functional score for all muscle groups (total M) was collated.\nAdditional information that could impact on the blood analytes was included in the predictive model analysis. Comorbidities were coded and represented the number that the patient currently had, and included musculoskeletal, respiratory, abdominal, cardiovascular, and mental health issues. The presence of vertebral fractures and the necessity for surgical intervention following injury were also recorded. As to whether patients had an infection, diabetes, or pressure sores, were smokers, or had previously smoked and/or drunk alcohol were noted. If the patient had sustained a polytrauma at the time of the SCI, such as other broken bones including additional fractured vertebrae, severe contusions, or burns, this was documented. If the patient was receiving medications in addition to the typical painkillers and anti-stomach acid and anticoagulant preparations received following a SCI, these were recorded and grouped into those that may have influenced blood biomarker outcome such as statins, steroids, certain antibiotics, and antidepressants, and those that would likely not.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical calculations were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics version 24.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Data were assessed for normality using both the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov and Shapiro\u2013Wilk tests. As the majority of data were not normally distributed, non-parametric tests were performed. Clinical features with binary outcomes that could potentially influence levels of the various blood biomarkers, such as gender and infection, were assessed via the Mann\u2013Whitney\nU\ntest (exact, two tailed) whereas features with more than two possible outcomes, such as injury level, were assessed via Kruskal\u2013Wallis. All variables were assessed for significant associations using Kendall's tau for non-parametric rank correlations.\nIn total, five neurological outcome measures were assessed: total M (total muscle function), T (touch), P (pain), AIS M (muscle function focused on key groups), and AIS Sens (sensory function, T and P combined) at \u223c3 and 12 months post-injury, to account for the potential of the blood analytes to predict subtle improvements/worsening in motor or sensory function.\nAs the number of blood analytes being assessed was relatively high compared with the number of participants, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to determine the possibility of reducing the number of blood analytes into related factors. Factor analysis via PCA was conducted on both blood analytes and initial neurological measures following removal of any high (\nr\n>\u20090.8) or low (\nr\n<\u20090.3) correlations via oblique rotation (direct oblimin). The resulting factors were named to reflect their most appropriate biological function.\nThe potential of individual blood analytes and factors generated from PCA were assessed in combination with compounding clinical factors (\nTable 1\n) and either the initial neurological scores (M, T, P, AIS M, and AIS Sens) or the appropriate neurological factor generated from PCA via multiple regression analysis to determine their potential to predict outcome neurology at 3 and 12 months. Values of\np\n<\u20090.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses and\np\nvalues were not adjusted for multiple testing and should be interpreted accordingly."

MSCs were isolated at \u22648 weeks of gestation through mechanical and enzymatic digestion and cultured as previously reported.\n20\nCells had been stained positive for the cell-surface protein markers, CD29, CD34, CD44, and stem cells antigen-1 (>70%), and negative for CD117 (<5%) in flow cytometry assays performed by the manufacturer.\n\nLentiviral transduction of mesenchymal stem cells\nMSCs were transduced with lentivirus particles consisting of a bicistronic control vector with an mCherry reporter gene (control) or with the open reading frame of Mus musculus FGF21 containing mCherry reporter gene (GenCopoeia, Rockville, MD) under the control of the human elongation factor 1-\u03b1 promoter. Briefly, MSCs were seeded at a density of 5000 cells/well in a 12-well plate. On the following day, MSCs were transduced with the lentiviral transduction particles at a multiplicity of infection of 30; media were replenished with standard MSC growth media 20\u2009h later. The mCherry control and FGF21-mCherry MSCs underwent three rounds of fluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate a highly enriched population of MSCs expressing mCherry reporter gene.\n\nExperimental animals\nWild-type C57B/L male mice (total number\u2009=\u200956) were obtained from the National Laboratory Animal Centre in Taipei, Taiwan. Animals were housed in cages under a standard 12-h light/dark cycle with food and water available\nad libitum\n, and their body weights were measured biweekly. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and with the approval of the Ethics Committee for animal use in Taipei Medical University (Taipei, Taiwan).\n\nControlled cortical impact\u2013induced traumatic brain injury\nTBI was induced in 8- to 9-week-old male mice using a controlled cortical impact (CCI) device. The unilateral, moderate CCI injury was induced as described previously.\n26\nBriefly, mice were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of zolazepam (50\u2009mg/kg) and rompun (20\u2009mg/kg) and positioned in a stereotaxic frame (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL) before TBI. Under sterile conditions, the skin was retracted, and a 4-mm craniotomy was performed on the right cerebral hemisphere (2.0\u2009mm posterior to the bregma and 2.0\u2009mm lateral to the sagittal suture). To expose the intact dura, the skullcap was carefully removed. To induce a mild-to-moderate TBI, an impacting tip with a diameter of 3\u2009mm driven by pneumatic piston was used to impact the exposed cortical surface at a velocity of 5\u2009m/s, a depth of 1\u2009mm, and a dwell time of 250\u2009ms. After the CCI injury, the scalp was sutured and the mouse was placed on a heating pad to maintain a body temperature of 36\u201337\u00b0C throughout the recovery phase. Sham (non-injured) mice underwent craniotomy, but not CCI injury (14 mice).\n\nTransplantation of mesenchymal stem cells\nTwenty-four hours after TBI induction, MSCs were collected from the culture flasks and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4). Cell viability and number were examined by the Trypan Blue exclusion assay, and cell concentration was then adjusted to 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n4\ncells/5\u2009\u03bcL of PBS. Anesthetized mice were positioned on a stereotaxic frame, and a hole was drilled on the contralateral side of the injury hemisphere at coordinates of 0\u2009mm caudal to bregma and 1\u2009mm lateral to the midline. Using an automatic syringe pump system (Singa, Taoyuan, Taiwan) and a Hamilton syringe (27 gauges), 5\u2009\u03bcL of cell suspension was ICV-infused at a depth of 3\u2009mm beneath the dura mater. The cell suspension was infused over 5\u2009min at a rate of 1\u2009\u03bcL/min, and the needle was left in place for another 5\u2009min. TBI animals were infused with either vehicle (in this case, PBS;\nn\n=\u200914), mCherry control MSCs (\nn\n=\u200914), or FGF21-MSCs (\nn\n=\u200914). The scalp was then sutured. Animals were kept at 37\u00b0C during the recovery phase and closely monitored. No animals died after transplantation.\n\nBehavioral assessments\nMorris water maze test\nTo evaluate spatial learning and memory impairments in mice, the Morris water maze (MWM) test was performed at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after TBI. The experimental procedure is outlined in\nFigure 1A\n. The experimental procedure was similar to those described previously, with some modifications.\n27\u201330\nThe apparatus included a circular pool (150\u2009cm in diameter and 60\u2009cm in depth) filled with water (30\u2009cm in depth) and a Plexiglas platform (10\u2009cm in diameter), which was surrounded by visual cues visible to the mice. The pool was subdivided into four equal quadrants, and the platform was placed 1\u2009cm beneath the surface of the water located in one of the four quadrants. Animals were trained for 4 consecutive days with five trials daily before the CCI injury, with an intertrial interval of 10\u2009min. During the training trials, animals were gently placed into the tank in one of the four quadrants and facing the target quadrant; they were allowed 2\u2009min to locate the hidden platform. The location of the platform was kept constant in the acquisition trials. If an animal failed to find the platform within 120\u2009sec, it was gently guided toward it. Once on the platform, the animal was allowed to remain there for 15\u2009sec.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nMSC-FGF21 treatment suppressed learning and memory deficits in mice with traumatic brain injury (TBI) induced by controlled cortical impact (CCI). Twenty-four hours after TBI, mice were treated with MSC-mCherry control or MSC-FGF21 by intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion. Learning and memory performance was assessed by the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test (\nA\n) at the indicated time points (\nB\nand\nC\n) and by the novel object recognition (NOR) test on day 14 (\nE\n). The characteristic path traced by each group in the MWM test to find the hidden platform (the red dot represents the starting point, and the green dot represents the end point) at day 28 post-injury is shown in (\nD\n). Data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM (\nn\n=\u20096\u20138 per group). *\np\n<\u20090.05; **\np\n<\u20090.01; ***\np\n<\u20090.001 between indicated groups using one-way ANOVA. ANOVA, analysis of variance; FGF21, fibroblast growth factor 21; MSC, mesenchymal stem cell; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SEM, standard error of the mean.\nAfter each trial, animals were towel dried and returned to their cages. We exclude only the mice that failed to swim in five attempts with a 15-min intrainterval in the first day of training to reduce the pre-injury performing bias that could confound with the testing results as previously reported.\n31\nAfter TBI induction, animals were tested on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 (sham,\nn\n=\u20096; TBI + PBS,\nn\n=\u20097; TBI + MSC-mCherry,\nn\n=\u20098; TBI + MSC-FGF21,\nn\n=\u20098). The time that animals spent reaching the underwater platform within 2\u2009min was defined as the escape latency, which was used as an indicator of spatial memory retention. All animals were monitored and tracked by computerized video tracking system software (FG34PATH; HaSoTec, Rostock, Germany). Escape latencies for five trials with a 15-min intertrial interval were recorded.\nNovel object recognition test\nThe novel object recognition (NOR) test, which evaluates the tendency of rodents to discriminate between new and familiar objects, was conducted to assess the extent of impaired memory in mice at day 14 after TBI (sham,\nn\n=\u20098; TBI + PBS,\nn\n=\u20098; TBI + MSC-mCherry,\nn\n=\u20098; TBI + MSC-FGF21,\nn\n=\u20098). Two days before the test, animals were individually habituated for 10\u2009min every day in an open field box (60\u2009\u00d7\u200960\u2009cm) made of dark Plexiglas. On the day of the experiment, animals were habituated in the box for 10\u2009min and then transferred to their home cage. After 2\u2009min, animals were placed back into the same box for 10\u2009min after two objects of the same material and shape, that were placed in a symmetrical position, had been added. After 1\u2009h (acquisition phase), one of the objects was replaced with a novel object and each mouse's exploratory behavior was analyzed for 10\u2009min. Exploration was defined as reaching the object, sniffing it from a distance of <2\u2009cm, and/or touching it with the nose. After each session, the objects were cleaned with 75% ethanol to prevent odor recognition.\nData were analyzed and expressed as the time spent at each object and as a discrimination index (DI), which is the amount of time spent exploring the novel object compared with the familiar one. Specifically, the DI was defined as (time spent at the novel object \u2013 time spent at the familiar object) / (time spent at the novel object + time spent at the familiar object)\u2009\u00d7\u2009100.\n\nWestern blot analysis\nAfter the final behavioral assessments on day 28, animals were anesthetized with a mixture of zolazepam/rompun and then decapitated (\nn\n=\u20096 for each group). Brains were then carefully removed, and the ipsilateral hippocampi were dissected and collected in vials and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were then homogenized in modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL). Lysates were chilled on ice and then centrifuged at 130,000\ng\nfor 5\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. Supernatants were collected and the protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Irvine, CA).\nProtein samples from tissue lysates were denatured at 95\u00b0C for 5\u2009min after a proper dilution with 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009sodium dodecyl sulfate buffer. Protein samples (30\u2009\u03bcg) were resolved using electrophoresis in a 10% polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After the transfer, membranes were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin/1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline for 1\u2009h at room temperature and then incubated overnight with the specific primary antibodies (anti-\u03b2-actin, 1:2,000; Abeomics, San Diego, CA; and anti-FGF21, 1:1,000; Aviscera Bioscience, Santa Clara, CA) at 4\u00b0C. After washing with Tris-buffered saline/Tween solution, membranes were incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase\u2013conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G antibody (1:5,000) for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Blots were developed and enhanced with a chemiluminescence plus detection kit (Amersham Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ). Protein bands were then detected by enhanced chemiluminescence western blot detection reagents (Millipore, Billerica, MA). All western blot images were acquired using the ChemiDoc Touch System; signal intensity of the bands was quantified by Image Lab (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) band signals.\n\nTissue collection and processing\nAnimals anesthetized with a mixture of zolazepam/rompun underwent transcardiac perfusion with PBS followed by chilled 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (\nn\n=\u20096 for each group). Brains were then carefully removed from the skull and post-fixed for 1 day at 4\u00b0C overnight. After post-fixation, brains were dehydrated in 20%, and then 30%, sucrose for cryoprotection. Brains were embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) and frozen on a dry ice/ethanol bath for cryosectioning. Coronal sections were cut at a thickness of 14 microns using a sliding microtome (CM3050S; Leica, Tokyo, Japan) and stored at \u221220\u00b0C.\n\nImmunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence\nAfter a series of PBS washes, sections were incubated in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15\u2009min followed by blocking with 3% normal goat serum and 3% bovine serum albumin for 1\u2009h. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with diluted primary antibodies in blocking buffer that included rabbit anti\u2013neuronal nuclei (ABN78, 1:250; EMD Millipore, Burlington, MA), guinea pig anti-doublecortin (DCX; AB2253, 1:200; EMD Millipore), and rabbit anti-mCherry (GTX128508, 1:100; GeneTex, Irvine, CA). After primary antibody incubation, sections were incubated with the appropriate Alexa Fluor 488\u2013, 555\u2013, or 647\u2013conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1,000; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 1\u2009h, then washed with cold PBS and cover-slipped with Fluoroshield mounting medium containing 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; GeneTex). Microscope analyses were performed using a wide-field Olympus microscope (BX43) equipped with bright field and fluorescence microscopy. Digital image documentation was performed with a DP80 camera (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Quantification of immuno-positive cells was accomplished using the Particle Analysis command in ImageJ (National Institutes of Health [NIH], Bethesda, MD).\nTo analyze dendritic morphology of immature neurons\nin vivo\n, projection images were traced using the plug-in, \u201cSimple Neurite Tracer and Sholl analysis\u201d from Fiji (ImageJ; NIH). Dentate granule cells with dendritic trees were analyzed for total dendritic length. Dendritic complexity was measured using Sholl analysis plugged into NIH ImageJ by counting the number of dendrites that crossed a series of concentric circles from the cell soma. For each group (\nn\n=\u20096), six neurons per animal were drawn from randomly selected sections and analyzed for neuronal morphology.\n\nStatistical analysis\nExperimental results are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM) and were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA; one-way or two-way; GraphPad Prism; GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA), as appropriate. Post-hoc analyses were performed using Bonferroni tests. Statistical significance was defined as\np\n<\u20090.05."

    "Methods": "Patients in the Trondheim mTBI follow-up study\nThe inclusion period in the prospective cohort study Trondheim mTBI follow-up study was April 2014 to December 2015. Patients were recruited from two emergency departments (EDs): at St. Olavs Hospital (Trondheim University Hospital), a regional level 1 trauma center in Trondheim, Norway, and Trondheim Municipal Emergency clinic, a general practitioner-run, outpatient clinic. In the study period, the two EDs were located in the same building and used the same CT service. Patients could be referred from the municipal ED to the trauma center for hospitalization as clinically indicated; that is, in cases with CT findings.\nInclusion criteria were: (1) having sustained an mTBI according to the World Health Organization criteria (a) Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score 13\u201315 and (b) either loss of consciousness (LOC) <30\u2009min, confusion, or post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) <24\u2009h\n20\nand (2) age between 16 and 60 years. Exclusion criteria were: (1) non-fluency in the Norwegian language; (2) having a pre-existing severe neurological, psychiatric, somatic, or substance use determined to be severe enough to likely interfere with follow-up and outcome assessment; (3) having a prior history of a complicated mild (prior traumatic lesions on CT), moderate, or severe TBI; (4) other major trauma; or (5) presentation >48\u2009h after the initial trauma.\nThe patients included in the Trondheim mTBI follow-up study have been shown to be largely representative of patients with mTBI as described in detail elsewhere.\n19\n\nPatients in the MRI study and their matched control subjects\nIn total, 378 patients were enrolled in the Trondheim mTBI follow-up study (\nFig. 1\n). Of these, 194 patients participated in a comprehensive data collection (MRI study) if they consented to MRI, had no MRI contraindications, MRI scanning could be performed very early, and they lived within a 1\u2009h drive from the study hospital. MRI scans were acquired within 72\u2009h (very early), and at 3 and 12 months post-injury. The remaining patients (\nn\n=\u2009184) received a basic follow-up with telephone interviews and questionnaires (basic follow-up).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nFlow chart of patients included in the Trondheim mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) follow-up study. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at all time points in 148 patients.\nA convenience sample of community controls (\nn\n=\u200978) was recruited, matched at the group level, to the participants in the MRI study for age, sex, and education. Exclusion criteria were the same as for the mTBI group, except that they could not receive treatment for severe psychiatric conditions, even if they might be able to comply with follow-up. The latter criterion was slightly different for patients and controls, because our goal was to establish an mTBI cohort as representative as possible, and a control group with reasonably good brain health. The controls underwent the same follow-up as the patients in the MRI study, including MRI at inclusion at 3 and 12 months, and outcome evaluation at 3 and 12 months.\n\nClinical variables and outcome\nClinical variables and outcome data were collected from patient interviews and medical records. Previous mTBI was defined as one or more brain injuries fulfilling the same diagnostic criteria as applied for the current injury. The GCS score was assessed by study personnel or obtained from the patient's medical records. If lacking, the history and clinical descriptions in the medical record were used to estimate a score. LOC was registered as yes or no if witnessed, otherwise it was as unknown. Duration of PTA was recorded as the time after injury for which the patient had no continuous memory, and dichotomized into <1\u2009h and 1\u201324\u2009h.\nOutcome was assessed by telephone at 3 and 12 months 1\u20132 weeks before the patients and controls came for the MRI examination, and the interviewer was blinded to clinical information. Outcome was measured with the British Columbia Post Concussion Symptom Inventory (BC-PSI),\n21\nwhich is a symptom inventory based on the 10th Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) symptom criteria for PCS.\n22\nThe patients and controls were asked to rate the frequency (0\u2009=\u2009not at all, 5\u2009=\u2009constantly) and intensity (0\u2009=\u2009not at all, 5\u2009=\u2009very severe problem) of 13 symptoms: (1) headaches, (2) dizziness, (3) nausea, (4) fatigue, (5) sensitivity to noises, (6) irritability, (7) sadness, (8) feeling nervous or tense, (9) temper problems, (10) poor concentration, (11) memory problems, (12) difficulty reading, and (13) poor sleep. Additionally, three co-occurring life problems were registered: (1) effects of alcohol consumption, (2) worrying/ dwelling on symptoms, and (3) self-perception of brain damage. Participants were classified as having PCS if their symptoms scored on the BC-PSI items as being moderate or greater on three or more of six ICD-10 Category C criteria.\n23\n\nHead CT\nNon-contrast CT (\nn\n=\u2009162) was performed on a Siemens Somatom Sensation 64 row scanner as part of the initial clinical assessment, according to the Scandinavian Guidelines for Head Injury Management.\n24\nCT readings were first obtained from the radiology report. The intracranial traumatic findings on CT were classified into: (1) contusion, (2) epidural hematoma (EDH), (3) traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (tSAH), and (4) subdural hematoma (SDH). The CT scans from patients with intracranial traumatic findings on MRI were later reviewed by an experienced neuroradiologist (K.A.K.) and a consultant in physical medicine and rehabilitation (C.E.E.). Two additional findings were thereby identified, one tSAH and one SDH.\n\nBrain MRI\nMRI was performed on a 3.0T Siemens Skyra system (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany), software version E11C, with a 32 channel head coil. The image protocol consisted of a series of clinical MRI sequences: (1) three dimensional (3D) T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE) (repetition time [TR]: 2300\u2009ms, echo time [TE] 4.21\u2009ms, slice thickness 1.0, voxel size: 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u20091.0\u2009\u00d7\u20091.0\u2009mm\n3\n); (2) two dimensional (2D) diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) (TR: 6800\u2009ms, TE 91\u2009ms, slice thickness 4.0, voxel size: 1.2\u2009\u00d7\u20091.2\u2009\u00d7\u20094.0\u2009mm\n3\n); (3) 3D T2 space (TR: 3200\u2009ms, TE 371\u2009ms, slice thickness 0.9, voxel size: 0.4\u2009\u00d7\u20090.4\u2009\u00d7\u20090.9\u2009mm\n3\n); (4) 3D T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR): (TR: 5000\u2009ms, TE 389\u2009ms, slice thickness 1.0, flip angle: T2var, voxel size: 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u20091.0\u2009\u00d7\u20091.0\u2009mm\n3\n); and (5) 3D T2-weighted susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) (TR: 27\u2009ms, TE 20\u2009ms, slice thickness 1.5, voxel size: 0.9\u2009\u00d7\u20090.9\u2009\u00d7\u20091.5\u2009mm\n3\n).\nThe MRIs from all three time points were read and reported by K.A.K. and a resident in radiology (J.X.). The intracranial traumatic MRI findings were categorized into: (1) TAI, (2) contusion, (3) EDH, (4) SDH, and (5) tSAH.\nThe SWI scans were inspected for hypointense foci or microbleeds.\n25\nThe microbleeds were classified as TAI lesions when they had the appearance of small, rounded, or circular, well-defined hypointense lesions with clear margins, often in clusters, located in the typical locations (the lobar white matter, corpus callosum, brainstem, basal ganglia, or thalamus), and not in the gyrus-sulcus pattern.\n26\nSuperficial microbleeds in the cortex were defined as contusions.\nThe FLAIR and DWI scans were inspected for hyperintense lesions, and the lesions were classified as TAI lesions if they occurred in the typical locations for TAI, and as contusions if they were located in the cortex. The early edema observed on acute (< 72\u2009h) FLAIR and DWI resolved with time. Depending on the resulting type of tissue injury, in the chronic phase, the signal can remain elevated in presence of gliosis, reduced in cases of necrosis, or appear similar to normal tissue, albeit its microstructure may be altered.\n26\n,\n27\nAn additional evaluation of the FLAIR and the SWI scans of all participants at all time-points was performed by C.E.E. supervised by K.A.K., to assess the presence of microbleeds or non-traumatic WMH in the patients with mTBI and the controls. A WMH was classified as non-traumatic if present in white matter on FLAIR, if no hypointense lesion could be observed in the same region on SWI, and, when there were follow-up scans, if the WMH retained its contrast, size, and shape across MRI time points (\nFig. 2\n). Participants were classified having WMH if one or more WMH was found. The lesions were not described with relation to size and location, and no attempt was made to distinguish non-traumatic WMH into unspecific versus age related.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\n(A\u2013C)\nA non-traumatic white-matter hyperintensity (WMH) on fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) scans in the sagittal plane of the same patient at three different time points.\n(A)\nThe very early FLAIR scan showed a hyperintense lesion in the deep gray matter in the left frontal lobe (arrow) that persisted at the\n(B)\n3 month and\n(C)\n12 month examination. The lesion was not present at the susceptibility weighted image scan at any time point.\n\nInter-rater reliability (IRR)\nA resident in radiology (K.G.M.), blinded to clinical information and results of previous readings, read the very early MRIs of all patients with intracranial findings (detected in the first step of the reading,\nn\n=\u200922) and of an approximately threefold higher number of patients without intracranial findings (\nn\n=\u200960). The scans were presented in a random order. K.G.M.'s findings were compared with the consensus-based findings reported by C.E.E., J.X., and K.A.K. to examine the IRR of the method applied to the clinical MRI reading.\n\nStatistical analysis\nPatient and injury characteristics are presented as percentages, means with standard deviation (SD), or median with interquartile range (IQR) (25th to 75th percentile). Between-group differences were analyzed with the Mann\u2013Whitney\nU\ntest because of non-normal distribution. The \u03c7\n2\ntest was used for comparison of proportions, and the exact unconditional test was used when the expected cell values were <5.\n28\nThe association between MRI findings and PCS was explored with binary logistical regression and presented as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI), where \u201cnon-traumatic MRI lesions\u201d was the reference category. IRR was evaluated with Cohen's \u03ba statistics for categorical variables. A \u03ba value <0.20 was poor, a value of 0.21\u20130.40 was fair, a value of 0.41\u20130.60 was moderate, a value of 0.61\u20130.80 was good and a value >0.80 was very good.\n29\nA\np\nvalue of <0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analysis. IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS\n\u00a9\n) Statistics version 25 was used for all analysis.\n\nEthics\nThe study was approved by the regional committee for research ethics (REK 2013/754) and was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki declaration. All participants, and a caregiver of participants <18 years of age, gave informed consent. Participants received a gift card worth 40 or 60 USD, depending on the length of the session, as compensation for costs."

    "Methods": "Participants\nBetween 2003 and 2017, a consecutive series of severe TBI patients were enrolled into the Brain Trauma Research Center (BTRC) database, an institutional review board\u2013 (IRB)-approved prospective, longitudinal cohort study. Five hundred fifty-nine severe TBI patients were enrolled during the study period, and neurological outcome assessments were performed at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post-injury on the surviving adults. To be included in the study, patients must be 16\u201380 years old with a post-resuscitation GCS \u22648 and not following commands (GCS motor score \u22645). Patients were excluded if they had a GCS of 3 and bilateral fixed pupils, neurological deterioration more than 24\u2009h after admission, or imminent brain death. Because this study focuses on long-term outcome trajectory, we choose to exclude those patients who did not survive the acute hospital setting.\n\nMeasures\nThe database included clinical data collection and functional outcome (as measured by GOS-E) at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. GOS-E is widely used for assessing global long-term outcome after a TBI and was administered by structured in-person or telephone interview by trained, qualified neuropsychology technicians. It consists of eight outcome categories: upper and lower good recovery, upper and lower moderate disability, upper and lower severe disability, vegetative state, and death.\n7\n,\n14\u201316\nNeed of assistance, work restrictions, and social limitations differentiate between upper and lower scores. Upper good recovery included survivors who resumed normal life with the capacity to work with or without minor neurological or psychological deficits.\n2\nIf these deficits are disabling, the survivor would fall within the lower good recovery category.\n2\nUpper moderate disability described survivors who are independent at home, but dependent outside of home.\n2\nThese survivors have some disability, such as aphasia, hemiparesis, epilepsy, and/or memory or personality deficits.\n2\nIf they are not able to return to work, the rating is lower moderate disability.\n2\nUpper severe disability included survivors who were dependent for daily support for mental and/or physical disabilities.\n2\nIf they could not be left alone at home for more than 8\u2009h, they are rated as having lower severe disability.\n2\nOutcome scores were dichotomized as favorable outcome (upper severe disability or better [GOS-E score of 4\u20138]) or unfavorable outcome (lower severe disability or worse [GOS-E score of \u22643]), based on the dichotomization utilized in the RESCUE-ICP trial and other trials.\n17\u201319\nThe favorable outcome category included survivors who were independent in the home, but relied on others for assistance outside the home. As with previous trials, the dichotomization was chosen with the understanding that survival with considerable disability instead of death may be acceptable to some survivors and caregivers and not acceptable to others.\n19\n\nProcedures\nTrained research assistants collected information regarding injury severity (initial GCS) and medical course from hospital and emergency medical service records. All initial GCS scores were recorded upon admission by a trained neurosurgeon post-resuscitation and off paralytics and/or sedative medications. A verbal subscale score of 1 was assigned to subjects who were intubated. Demographic information, such as date of birth, education, and pre-morbid functioning, was collected in interviews with the subjects or family/significant others. Subjects and their families were contacted at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post-injury to assess the subjects' level of functioning, including completion of GOS-E. If the patient was not able to provide accurate information, data were collected from family members or care providers who were familiar with the subject.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe distributions of the data were checked for normality. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to assess whether the observed changes in GOS-E scores between time points was significantly different from no change in GOS-E scores. Descriptive statistics were used to quantify the nature of the change. The proportion of survivors who exhibited an increase in GOS-E score was calculated. Moreover, the proportion of survivors changing from unfavorable to favorable outcomes between each time point was calculated. An additional descriptive calculation was used to assess the mean initial GCS between the unfavorable and favorable outcome groups. A comparison of demographic characteristics was made between survivors with favorable outcomes and unfavorable outcomes at 2 years. Demographic characteristics of those deceased at 3 months were compared to survivors. Also, patients who were deceased at 24 months were compared with those who were alive at 24 months and patients deceased at 3 months. Last, among those with GOS-E at three or more time points, a within-subjects analysis using a generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was applied to evaluate the change in GOS-E across time points."

Further, we searched the reference lists of the included studies for additional relevant studies.\n\nSelection criteria\nWe included prospective and retrospective observational studies, such as cohort studies, case-control studies, and cross-sectional studies. All studies that examined patients with TBI in a civilian population were included. Studies with mixed populations, for example TBI and non-head injury or military TBI and civilian TBI, were included if the authors analyzed the results of civilian TBI separately. Studies that focused only on military personnel were excluded. All studies that measured mental health symptoms of PTSD were included, irrespective of how the PTSD was diagnosed and at what time-point after the TBI. We included studies that used self-report questionnaires or (semi-)structured interviews. Only articles published after 1980 were included because the diagnosis of PTSD was described in 1980 in the\nDiagnostic Manual of Mental Disorders\n(DSM-III) for the first time.\n32\nWe included articles written in English, French, or Dutch.\n\nData extraction\nTwo authors independently screened all titles and abstracts identified in the searches and determined whether they were eligible for inclusion. Relevant articles were retrieved in full text and screened independently by the same two authors for the final review and data extraction. Disagreement was resolved by discussion until consensus was reached or by consulting a third author. The Covidence platform was used for the screening and selection of studies for the review.\n33\nArticles with the same sample of patients were identified to avoid double counting of prevalence rates, and only the study with the largest sample size was included.\nThe following data were extracted: study characteristics (study design, year of publication), setting (country), participants (number, age, severity of TBI, control population), and outcome (type of PTSD instrument, time-point after TBI, percentage with PTSD).\n\nQuality assessment\nThe methodological quality of the studies was evaluated with the checklist for Methodological evaluation of Observational REsearch (MORE).\n34\nThis checklist contains six criteria for external validity and five criteria for internal validity. External validity is the extent to which results can be generalized to the population and contains the evaluation of sampling strategies, sampling bias, estimate bias, exclusion rate from the analysis, and address bias. The internal validity is the extent to which the results are correct for the subjects in the study and contains the evaluation of source of measure, definition of measure, validation of measures and reliability of the estimates, definition of outcomes in subpopulations, and reporting of prevalence. Each domain was rated as Good, Minor flaw, Major flaw, or Poorly reported according to the MORE criteria.\n34\nStudies that had one major flaw were classified as \u201cModerate risk of bias.\u201d Studies that had more than one major flaw, or one major flaw plus at least two minor flaws were classified as \u201cHigh risk of bias.\u201d Studies without major flaws but with minor flaws in three or more domains were classified as \u201cModerate risk of bias\u201d as well. All other studies were classified as \u201cLow risk of bias.\u201d Two authors used the checklist to rate each study independently. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion until consensus was reached or by consulting a third author.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe studies were grouped by severity of TBI (mild, moderate, severe, and mixed severity) as defined in the reports. Criteria used by studies varied, but were mostly based on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS: mild 13\u201315, moderate 9\u201312, severe 3\u20138), post-traumatic amnesia (PTA: mild TBI <24\u2009h, moderate and severe >24\u2009h) and loss of consciousness (LOC: mild <20 or 30\u2009min). Studies were grouped by type of measurement (self-report questionnaire, semi-structured interview, or structured interview) and time-point of measurement (3, 6, 12, and over 12 months up to 5 years post-injury). The Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software was used to perform a meta-analysis including a sensitivity analysis using the chi-square test and computed the I\n2\n-statistic. An I\n2\n-value of 50 or more was considered to represent substantial levels of heterogeneity."

    "Methods": "Study design and conduct\nThe Copenhagen Head Injury Ciclosporin (CHIC) study was an open-label, uncontrolled, single-center, phase II study to investigate the PK and safety of two dose levels of NeuroSTAT in patients with severe TBI. The study was conducted in accord with applicable regulatory requirements, the principles of International Council for Harmonisation\u2013E6 Good Clinical Practice, and the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients included in this study were temporarily incapacitated because of impaired consciousness, and the informed consent process was designed accordingly based on local regulations for emergency research. Consent was obtained for study patients in accord with this procedure.\nPermits were obtained from the national ethics committee and the regulatory authority (Danish Medicinal Agency). The study was registered with EudraCT number 2012-000756-34 and at\nClinicalTrials.gov\nas NCT01825044. The study was performed at the Department of Neurosurgery, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Denmark between June 2013 and May 2017. The study had planned to include 20 patients, but was closed after inclusion of total 16 patients because of slow recruitment. The study started with the lower dose level for the first 10 patients and then was completed with 6 patients at the higher dose. Safety oversight of the study was under the direction of an independent data safety monitoring board that approved dose escalation to the higher dose level.\n\nStudy patients and procedures\nPre-screening of potential study patients was conducted at the neuro-intensive care unit (neuro-ICU). After obtaining informed consent, 16 patients were screened and subsequently enrolled after clinical stabilization (\nFig. 1\n). Thereafter, patients received a 2.5-mg/kg bolus dose infusion of ciclosporin, followed by either 5 or 10\u2009mg/kg/day of ciclosporin as a continuous infusion for 5 days. The study procedures included 3 additional days of study-specific monitoring in the neuro-ICU after the termination of the study treatment. After an additional 30 days, a follow-up phone call was made to the patient, or the patient's nursing staff, checking patient status and potential serious (SAEs) adverse events (AEs).\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nPatient disposition. A total of 16 patients were screened. All 16 patients received the investigational medicinal product (IMP). Ten patients received ciclosporin at a dose of 5\u2009mg/kg/day, and 6 patients received ciclosporin at a dose of 10\u2009mg/kg/day for 5 days after an initial loading dose of 2.5\u2009mg/kg. Study treatment was discontinued prematurely in 1 patient in the 10-mg/kg/day cohort, but study measurements continued throughout the study according to the investigational plan.\nThe studied patient population included patients with non-penetrating severe TBI with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 4\u20138. Only patients who required admission to the ICU and had a clinical indication for the placement of an external ventricular drainage (EVD) were eligible for enrollment in the study. Patients with bilaterally fixed dilated pupils, spinal cord injury, or pure epidural hematoma were not included in the study. A medical history of hepatic or renal disease were also among the exclusion criteria. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in\nTable 1\n.\nTable 1.\nStudy Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria\nInclusion criteria\n\u2022\u2002Male or female patients, age between 18 and 75 years, inclusive\n\u2022\u2002Requirement for intensive care unit admission and clinical indication for external ventricular drainage and intracranial pressure monitoring\n\u2022\u2002Evidence of non-penetrating severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), confirmed by history and abnormalities consistent with a non-penetrating trauma on computerized tomography scan upon admission\n\u2022\u2002Clinical examination with post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale of 4\u20138, inclusive\nExclusion criteria\n\u2022\u2002Bilaterally fixed dilated pupils\n\u2022\u2002Penetrating TBI\n\u2022\u2002Spinal cord injury\n\u2022\u2002Pure epidural hematoma\n\u2022\u2002Currently developed, known, or a medical history of renal disorder, significant renal failure, or high-risk renal failure\n\u2022\u2002Known or a medical history of hepatic disease\n\u2022\u2002Ongoing pre-injury therapy with any of these drugs: rosuvastatin, tacrolimus,\nHypericum perforatum\n(St. John's wort; a herbal dietary supplement), stiripentol, aliskiren, bosentan, diltiazem, verapamil, and antiepileptics\n\u2022\u2002Participation in other clinical trials\n\u2022\u2002Any significant disease or disorder, including abnormal laboratory tests, which, in the opinion of the investigator, may either put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or may influence the results of the study\nOpen in a separate window\n\nStudy endpoints\nThe primary study objective was to establish safety and characterize the PK profile of two dosing regimens of ciclosporin in a severe TBI population. The primary endpoints were related to PK parameters based on ciclosporin levels in blood, as well as specific safety endpoints that included markers of renal and liver function, intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, assessment of infections, and AEs. The secondary endpoints were related to PK parameters based on ciclosporin levels in CSF, as well as further evaluation of safety.\nThe safety variables included markers of renal function based on blood samples (plasma creatinine, plasma cystatin c and blood urea nitrogen), markers of hepatic function based on blood samples (prothrombin time, aspartate transaminase [AST], alanine transaminase [ALT], and bilirubin), assessment of infections, intracranial pressure, electrocardiogram abnormalities, safety biomarkers for renal function in urine, vital signs, and physical findings (mean arterial pressure, heart rate, body temperature, cerebral perfusion pressure, GCS, pupil size, and pupil response).\nThe study also included exploratory efficacy endpoints with assessment of biomarkers of brain injury, measured using microdialysis in the more and less traumatized side, brain tissue oxygen measured through a Licox\n\u00ae\ncatheter, as well as CSF biomarkers of brain injury; glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light (NF-L), tau, and ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1). Microdialysis was measured using the M Dialysis ISCUSflex Microdialysis Analyzer (M Dialysis AB, Johanneshov, Sweden). CSF biomarkers were analyzed using a Quanterix SIMOA Neurology 4-plex assay (Quanterix Corporation, Billerica, MA).\n28\n\nStatistical analyses\nThe details of the statistical analyses were predefined in a detailed statistical analysis plan.\nThe PK analysis was described using a population PK approach performed in the non-linear mixed-effect modeling software, NONMEM (Version 7.3; ICON, Dublin, Ireland). The software R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used for goodness-of-fit analyses, model evaluation, and computation of C\nav,ss\nand t\n1/2\nbased on results from NONMEM. The remaining data were analyzed and presented using the SAS software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).\nThe CSF biomarker data were defined as an exploratory endpoint in the statistical analysis plan without pre-defining the method of statistical analysis. The analysis was, because of the small sample size, performed using the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare the slopes during (48\u2013120\u2009h after infusion start) and post-treatment (120\u2013168\u2009h after infusion start)."

    "Methods": "Materials\nAll high-purity deionized water (dH\n2\nO) used was of high-performance liquid chromatography grade (18.2\u2009M\u03a9.cm, Millipore Direct Q5 UV water purification system with LC-Pak polisher; Millipore, Burlington, MA). All reagents were also of analytical grade, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, UK), and used as received, unless otherwise stated. Sodium chloride and potassium chloride were purchased from BDH Laboratory Supplies (Poole, UK).\nM Dialysis 71 CMD catheters (100-kDa nominal MWCO, polyarylethersulfone 10-mm membrane length), microdialysis vials, Perfusion Fluid CNS, Perfusion Fluid CNS Dextran, M Dialysis 106 microdialysis pumps, and corresponding batteries and syringes were purchased from M Dialysis (Stockholm, Sweden). Both PFs contain 147\u2009mM of NaCl, 2.7\u2009mM of KCl, 1.2\u2009mM of CaCl\n2\n, and 0.85\u2009mM of MgCl\n2\n, but with an additional 3% 500-kDa molecular-weight Dextran in the Perfusion Fluid CNS Dextran. This newly commercially available product was purchased from M Dialysis.\nIn vitro\nmicrodialysis sampling experiments were performed using a VWR (Radnor, PA) advanced hotplate magnetic stirrer with temperature probe. Catheters were held in place during\nin vitro\nsampling using a triple-lumen cranial access device (Technicam, Newton Abbott, UK). Custom Invitrogen eBioscience ProcartaPlex\nTM\nhuman cytokine and chemokine 39-plex bead assays and human cytokine and chemokine standards (referred to by the manufacturer as \u201cA,\u201d \u201cB,\u201d \u201cC,\u201d \u201cD,\u201d \u201cE,\u201d \u201cG,\u201d \u201cK,\u201d \u201cL,\u201d and \u201cMMP\u201d standard mixes, plus individual standards for Galectin-3, metalloproteinase domain-containing protein [MDC], and transforming growth factor [TGF]-alpha) were purchased from Thermo Fisher (Paisley, UK). A complete list of the cytokines and chemokines analyzed is provided in\nSupplementary Table S1\n. ProcartaPlex multiplex assays were analyzed using a Luminex 200 analyzer (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX) operating with Luminex xPONENT\n\u00ae\nsoftware. Wash steps were performed using a ProcartaPlex hand-held magnetic plate holder.\n\nIn vitro\nmicrodialysis sampling\nIn vitro\nmicrodialysis sampling was performed using an artificial external solution (ES) representative of the brain extracellular environment. The ES comprised PF with 0.05% (w/v) sodium azide, 1\u2009mg/mL of human serum albumin (HSA), and 39 human cytokines and chemokines, prepared in a 50-mL centrifuge tube (Falcon\n\u00ae\n) as follows. Microdialysis PF for the external solution was made in-house (147\u2009mM of NaCl, 2.7\u2009mM of KCl, 1.2\u2009mM of CaCl\n2\n, and 0.85\u2009mM of MgCl\n2\n; pH \u223c6.0), to the same specifications as Perfusion Fluid CNS used for CMD in patients. The mixed cytokine and chemokine standards (A, B, C, D, E, G, K, L, and MMP standard mixes, plus individual standards for Galectin-3, MDC, and TGF-alpha), received as lyophilized powders, were resuspended in accord with the manufacturers' instructions and subsequently diluted to 1:100 in PF with 0.05% (w/v) sodium azide and 1\u2009mg/mL of HSA (final concentration). The total volume of the ES was 25\u2009mL. The final cytokine and chemokine concentrations are shown in\nSupplementary Table S1\n.\nThe centrifuge tube (50\u2009mL) containing the ES (25\u2009mL) was suspended using a clamp stand in a thermostatically controlled glycerol bath (to avoid condensation) set to 37\u00b0C. Very gentle agitation of the external solution was applied using a magnetic stirrer. Two M Dialysis 71 brain microdialysis catheters were placed into the external solution through a triple bolt cranial access device, which was secured within the centrifuge tube using self-adhesive plastic film. Each catheter was perfused at 0.3\u2009\u03bcL/min using M Dialysis 107 pumps, with syringes loaded with approximately 1.5\u2009mL of either normal PF or PF containing 3% Dextran 500. Both the normal PF and Dextran PF were used as received from the manufacturer. The microdialysate samples were collected in microdialysis vials at the end of each catheter. Pumps and collection vials were kept at the same height either side of the glycerol bath, to nullify any hydrostatic pressure differences.\nSampling was performed for 48\u2009h in total; the microdialysis vials were changed every 6\u2009h, and sample from the ES was drawn at the 0-, 24-, and 48-h time points. A schematic of the\nin vitro\nsampling setup is shown in\nFigure 1\n. If no fluid was apparent in the microdialysis vial during the first 30\u201360\u2009min after an exchange, that pump was flushed. This flush sequence was discarded and fluid collection started after the flush was completed. The pumps were randomly changed between fluid carriers and experiments as to not introduce any systematic bias. The\nin vitro\nsampling test was repeated in three independent experiments over the course of 4 weeks (eight time epochs per experiments, a total of 24 epochs). All samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C before analysis.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1.\nSchematic overview of the experimental setup. Color image is available online.\n\nSample analysis\nQuantitative analysis of cytokine and chemokines was performed using custom ProcartaPlex\nTM\nhuman 39-plex bead-based immunoassay kits. Samples were thawed and gently mixed before analysing. In total, 25\u2009\u03bcL of sample was used per well; all samples were analyzed in duplicate. The assay was performed as per the manufacturers' instructions. Wash steps were carried out using a hand-held magnetic plate holder (ProcartaPlex). All assays were analyzed on a Luminex 200 platform. We established that Dextran 500 did not interfere with the analysis by running a standard curve using the Dextran PF as a diluent and compared it to a normal PF standard curve, and Dextran PF had no discernible effect on the standard response.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were conducted using the statistical software R, and its graphical interface Rstudio\n\u00ae\n(R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).\n19\nFor each described analysis below, complete case analyses were conducted. A\np\nvalue \u22640.05 was considered significant in all analyses. Graphical presentation was conducted using the R packages tidyverse,\n20\ncowplot,\n21\nand RColorBrewer,\n22\nunless otherwise stated.\nTo assess how flushing the pumps affected cytokine recovery in the remaining fluid collected in that epoch, we used the R package nlme\n23\nand conducted a linear mixed model per cytokine, using cytokine recovery as a dependent variable and time together with flush as independent variables.\n24\nIn each model, the independent experiment was considered to be the random intercept. Some cytokines (Fractalkine, interferon [IFN]-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF] receptor type I [TNF-RI]) could not be quantified in the microdialysates, given that the concentrations recovered were below the lower limit of detection (as specified by the kit manufacturer) for the assay. Assumptions were examined graphically with regard to equal variance, linearity, and normal distribution.\nSimilarly, for absolute recovery analysis, time and carrier were used as independent variables in a mixed model.\n23\u201326\nThe dependent variable was the recovered cytokine value. For random intercepts, we used independent experiments. IFN-\u03b3 was excluded from analysis because the returned levels were below lowest levels of detection for both PFs. Assumptions were examined graphically as described above.\n27\n,\n28\nRR was calculated as the ratio between the recovered cytokine in the microdialysis vial (numerator) and the recovered cytokine in the ES (denominator) obtained concomitantly at 24 and 48\u2009h. For inferential analysis, cytokines exhibiting less than three positive observations (chemokine [C-C motif] ligand 20 [CCL20]/macrophage inflammatory protein 3 alpha [MIP-3\u03b1], Fractalkine, Galectin-3, IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, matrix metalloproteinase [MMP]-2, TNF-RI, and vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]-D) were excluded. For the remainders, the cytokine retrieval capacity of the different carriers (Dextran and the conventional CNS PF) were compared using a two-sided Student's\nt\n-test (not assuming equal variances) or (if not normally distributed) a two-sided Mann-Whitney U test."

    "Methods": "A retrospective before/after observational study was conducted. Data were collected from all participants served between 2010 and 2015 within a national network of eight residential and outpatient programs across six states. Upon admission to the programs, participants consented to having their progress and outcome data available for analysis. The Indiana University Institutional Review Board provided exemption for analysis of de-identified data.\n\nThe initial sample included 462 cases. Cases with atypical lengths of stay who were in the Intensive Rehabilitation programs were excluded. This included 2 cases with less than 7 days and 35 cases with more than 365 days in the program.\n\nThe final sample included 425 individuals in six treatment tracks within the residential rehabilitation setting: 1) Neurorehabilitation (n=\u2009161); 2) Neurobehavioral Rehabilitation (n=\u200957); 3) Day Treatment (n=\u200938); 4) Supported Living (n=\u2009131); 5) Neurobehavioral Supported Living (n=\u200925); and 6) Day Activity (n=\u200913). These six program types were further grouped into two major program categories: 1) IRR (program types 1\u20133), in which the overarching goal was to achieve significant gains through an intensive rehabilitation process in the residential setting, and 2) RSL (program types 4\u20136), in which the goal was to assist the individual in maintaining current status over the long term and enhance quality of life. Characteristics of participants in each program category on admission are described inTable 1.\n\nThe primary outcome measure analyzed was the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory-4 (MPAI-4). The MPAI-423consists of 30-items selected to assess commonly occurring limitations after acquired brain injury. It is divided into three subscales: Ability Index, Adjustment Index, and Participation Index. Lower scores indicate lesser impairment and limitations. Earlier studies have demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency, construct validity,24\u201326as well as concurrent27and predictive validity28\u201330for the full measure and its indices. The MPAI-4 has been found to be responsive to the effects of rehabilitation interventions.28\u201332The MPAI-4 and a manual for its use are freely available on the Center for Outcome Measurement in Brain Injury (COMBI) website (www.tbims.org).\n\nDemographic information, injury-related characteristics, and MPAI-4 consensus ratings were recorded at admission for all 425 participants. MPAI-4 consensus ratings were recorded for the IRR group at discharge (mean length of stay\u2009=\u2009113.0 days; standard deviation [SD]\u2009=\u200984.40) to compare pre-treatment and post-treatment scores. MPAI-4 ratings for the RSL group were recorded on admission and annually to assess change over time. For the purpose of this analysis, we compared the admission MPAI ratings to the first annual reassessment ratings for the RSL group.\n\nDifferences in demographic, injury-related, and MPAI-4 variables on admission between the two major program categories were examined usingt-tests or chi square tests, as appropriate. Differences on these variables among the program types in the IRR category were also examined using the same procedures. Differences among program types in the RSL category were not analyzed because of small numbers in two of the program types in this category. Because chronicity (days post-injury) was highly skewed, the log10conversion of this variable was used in all computations. T-scores for the MPAI-4 Total and Index scores were derived with reference to a large sample used to compute T-scores in a previous study5to make results comparable to those obtained in the earlier study. Algorithms for T-score derivation were provided by Inventive Software Solutions. Differences among the two major program categories on MPAI-4 Index and Total scores at discharge were evaluated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with MPAI-4 score on admission, sex, age at injury, and log chronicity as covariates. Using similar procedures, ANCOVA analysis of discharge MPAI-4 scores were also conducted contrasting the program types within the IRR category.\n\nA previous publication also identified the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) and the robust clinically important difference (RCID) for the MPAI-4.33The MCID, defined as the smallest change in score that indicates a clinical significant change in functional status, was determined to be 5 T-score points or 0.5 SD. The RCID, defined as a change in score that indicates a clearly substantial change in functional status, was determined to be 9 T-score points. We compared the proportion achieving an MCID and an RCID between program categories and types.\n\nTime post-injury (chronicity) was much greater for the RSL group than for the IRR group, and this variable was significantly related to outcome. In order to evaluate the degree to which chronicity explained the differences between the two major program categories more rigorously than can be accomplished through covariate analysis, we matched a group of RSL participants to a group of the IRR participants on chronicity. We then compared these two matched groups on the discharge/second assessment MPAI-4 T-scores."

Final product had high specific activities (95\u2013280 GBq/\u03bcmol).\nPET image data was acquired using an ECAT EXACT HR+ scanner. Prior to collection of emission data, a 6-min transmission scan was acquired using Ge-68 rod sources for purposes of attenuation correction. Three-dimensional (3D) PET emission data collection was initiated with the bolus injection of 187\u2009\u00b1\u20097\u2009MBq (SA: 90\u2009\u00b1\u200937\u2009MBq/nmol) of [\n18\nF]AV-1451 and was acquired for 120\u2009min with a 15-min break from 60\u201375\u2009min. Pre-break data (0\u201360\u2009min post-injection) was binned into time frames of 6\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009sec, 8\u2009\u00d7\u200915\u2009sec, 6\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u2009sec, 8\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009min, 8\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009min, and 8\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009min; post-break data (75\u2013120\u2009min) was binned into 7\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009min frames. Dynamic PET sinograms were reconstructed using filtered back projection while applying corrections for scatter, attenuation, deadtime, random coincident events, and detector normalization. Final reconstructed images had a grid size of 128\u2009\u00d7\u2009128\u2009\u00d7\u200963 and voxel dimensions of 2.06\u2009\u00d7\u20092.06\u2009\u00d7\u20092.42\u2009mm.\nMRI\nMagnetic resonance images were acquired using a Siemens 3 Tesla Trio Tim scanner with a 32-channel RF head coil.\nAnatomical\nA high-resolution anatomical MRI was acquired using a 3D Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acquisition Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) sequence with the following parameters: repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u20092.10\u2009msec, echo time (TE)\u2009=\u20092.89\u2009msec, flip angle\u2009=\u200912\u00b0, inversion time\u2009=\u20091100\u2009msec; acquisition matrix size\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256 in-plane, 206 slices; voxel size 1\u2009mm isotropic.\nDTI\nDiffusion tensor magnetic resonance data was acquired using a multi-slice diffusion-weighted balanced spin echo planar pulse sequence with 60 diffusion directions. The imaging parameters were TR/TE 8800/84\u2009msec, b\u2009=\u2009700\u2009sec mm\n\u22122\n, pixel bandwidth\u2009=\u20091457\u2009Hz, flip angle\u2009=\u200990\u00b0, 72 slices, acquisition matrix\u2009=\u2009104\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 with isotropic spatial resolution of 2.5\u2009mm.\nResting-state fMRI\nChanges in blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) T2* signals were measured using an interleaved gradient-echo echo planar imaging sequence. The subjects lay quietly for 5\u2009min, during which 90 whole\u2013brain volumes were obtained with the following parameters: TR\u2009=\u20093\u2009sec, TE\u2009=\u200930\u2009msec; flip angle\u2009=\u200990\u00b0; 64\u2009\u00d7\u200964 pixel matrix; and 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093.75\u2009mm voxel dimensions.\n\nImage processing and analysis procedures\nPET/[\n18\nF]AV-1451\nReconstructed dynamic PET images were rigidly realigned to a common orientation to reduce head movement effects followed by co-registration of the post break PET session to the pre break PET session. Next, the realigned images were summed from 0\u201310\u2009min, representing a diffuse distribution of radiotracer, and were then rigidly aligned to the MPRAGE image. PET images were co-registered and warped to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) reference space using the transformation applied to the MPRAGE as described below. Final co-registrations and transformations to MNI space were applied back to the original dynamic PET images to reduce interpolation errors. Regions of interest (ROIs) were delineated using standard atlases available through FSL including (MNI structural atlas, Harvard-Oxford cortical and subcortical structural atlas, and the probabilistic cerebellar atlas).\n12\nROI masks were transformed to PET native space for each individual subject to allow extraction of time activity curves (TACs) for analysis of radiotracer uptake throughout the course of scanning.\n[\n18\nF]AV-1451 uptake was quantified using the distribution volume ratio (DVR) calculated using the Logan method\n13\nwith a 55-min t* and non-vermis cerebellar gray matter available through FSL as suggested in our recently published pharmacokinetic analysis of [\n18\nF]AV-1451.\n14\nLogan DVR estimates were performed on ROI-based TACs and dynamic PET images for the creation of voxelwise [\n18\nF]AV-1451 DVR maps. ROI based estimates of DVR and max DVR were compared in regions potentially affected by head injury including of frontal lobe, occipital lobe, parietal lobe, cerebral white matter, cerebral cortex, thalamus, caudate, putamen, medial temporal cortex (MTC), and nucleus accumbens.\n\nMRI/DTI\nMPRAGE images were transformed into MNI space using sequential linear affine and nonlinear warping methods available through the FSL (Functional MRI of the Brain Software Library)\n12\nsoftware package. Diffusion-Toolkit/TrackVis was used for fiber tracking reconstruction, display, and analysis of diffusion data.\n15\nFinal tractography images were aligned to a common space using affinemethods based upon the subjects MEMPRAGE image allowing inter-subject comparisons of tractography images. FSL was used to generate FA images which were then transformed to MNI space.\n12\nWhite matter tracts were quantified using two methods. First, tractography images were visually compared using TrackVis to make inter-subject comparisons and bilateral comparisons in the same subject when appropriate. Second, TrackVis statistics tools were used to count the number of tracts penetrating ROIs guided by [\n18\nF]AV-1451 uptake. When inter-subject comparisons were made using TrackVis, all visualization and statistics parameters were identical between the subjects.\n\nMRI/fMRI\nPre-processing\nThe resting-state fMRI data were preprocessed using the FSL (FMRIB Software Library v5.0). The first volume for each subject was discarded due to magnetic saturation effect. Next slice-time correction was applied for temporal alignment. Motion correction was applied and Friston 24 parameters were computed.\n16\nThe frame-wise displacement (FD), which represents the scalar quantity of instantaneous head motion of each volume relative to its earlier neighboring volume, was also calculated based on the head motion parameters.\n12\nBecause several recent studies have shown that high levels of head motion can significantly influence the estimation of resting-state FD,\n17\u201319\nthe following steps were adopted to reduce these motion effects. First, the fMRI data were excluded from further analysis if the maximum displacement in one or more of the orthogonal directions was >1\u2009mm or a maximum rotation >1.0\u00b0 and second, the data were also excluded if the average FD of the subject exceeded 0.5\u2009mm. After realignment, the individual structural images were linearly registered to the mean functional images.\nNext, the structural images were segmented into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and projected to the mean BOLD volume. The nuisance variables, including 24 head motion parameters and the average BOLD signals of the CSF and white matter, were linearly regressed out from the data. A band-pass filter was applied between 0.01\u20130.08\u2009Hz.\n20\nThe functional volumes were then spatially normalized to the MNI space and resampled to 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm\n3\nvoxels using the normalization parameters for their respective structural images. To make group comparisons all voxels were spatially smoothed with a 6\u2009mm full width at half maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel. Finally spline interpolation for the scrubbing was applied to all the time-points that presented a FD greater than 0.5\u2009mm. Subjects with less than 80% of the time-points with FD values lower than 0.05\u2009mm were not included for further analysis.\nPost-processing\nLocal and distant connectivity\nWeighted degree graph theory analysis was used to compute the local and distant connectivity. Functional MRI images were down-sampled to 8\u2009mm, then correlation matrices were computed at the voxel level, resulting in connectivity matrices of 5138\u2009\u00d7\u20095138. Only positive correlations were retained due to ambiguous interpretations of negative correlations\n21\n,\n22\nand to prevent further misinterpretations in the weighted degree connectivity values. R to z Fisher transformation was applied. We calculated the local and distant weighted degree centrality value for each voxel of the brain based on an Euclidean distance optimal segregation previously described.\n23\nThe weighted degree measures the sum of the z values for all the links in a node, with local defined as within a 16\u2009mm radius of each node and distant everything outside that radius.\n23\n\nRelationship between [\n18\nF]AV-1451 binding and fMRI connectivity\n[\n18\nF]AV-1451 images were transformed to the individual T1 space by rigid alignment with a mutual information algorithm and the T1 was projected to the MNI standard space. To be able to work in the same resolution of 8\u2009mm, a down-sampling of the images was performed. Due to the heterogeneity of the TBI cohort we implemented individual analysis for this study. In order to study the individual distribution of [\n18\nF]AV-1451 in each participant, we transformed their DVR intensities into z-score values and investigate their relationship with local and distant connectivity as follows:\na) At the subject level comparing to controls\nFunctional connectivity scores (local and distant) associated with [\n18\nF]AV-1451 uptake were calculated by computing the average degree connectivity within regions in which [\n18\nF]AV-1451 z-score were greater than 1.96SD. Therefore, we focus our investigation on specific regions of presumably abnormal tau depositions, both in TBI individuals (TBI-related tau binding) and adult controls (non-TBI-related tau binding).\nb) At the subject level compared with [\n18\nF]AV-1451 binding\nTo investigate the spatial relationship between functional connectivity scores and [\n18\nF]AV-1451 uptake, we extract the mean weighted degree of local and distant connectivity in regions of interest, which were preciously selected based on the z-score values of [\n18\nF]AV-1451 images. We used specific intervals of the z-score values to capture all possible types of tau-related lesions across the cortex. Thus, mean local and distant weighted degree was displayed for each of the tau-related z-score intervals: <1, 1.0\u20131.2, 1.2\u20131.4, 1.4\u20131.6, 1.6\u20131.8, 1.8\u20132.0, >\u2009=\u2009-2. Of note, as data points in this approach are not independent between each other and our interest was to investigate their spatial relationships, we reported the curvilinear fits as descriptive findings."

    "Methods": "The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research/Naval Medical Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in compliance with all applicable federal regulations governing the protection of animals in research.\n\nBlast overpressure exposure\nAnesthetized male, 7\u20139 weeks old, hooded Long Evans rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA), weighing 357\u2009\u00b1\u20094\u2009g, were exposed to blast overpressure in a compressed air-driven shock tube as previously described.\n21\n,\n22\nMylar sheets (DuPont Co., Wilmington, DE), 350\u2009\u03bcm thick, were used to separate the compression and expansion chambers in the tube to generate a blast wave with a mean peak pressure of 130\u2009\u00b1\u20090.61\u2009kPa (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean [SEM]; equivalent to \u223c18.9 psi), overpressure duration of 9.26\u2009\u00b1\u20090.21\u2009ms (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM), and overpressure impulse of 510\u00b10.004kPa.ms (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM). Under 4% isoflurane anesthesia, each rat was placed in a plastic cone (DeCapi Cones; BrainTree Scientific Inc., Braintree, MA) to restrain head and body movements induced by the shock wave. The rat was then placed under three rubber tourniquets in an animal holding basket inside the shock tube to further stabilize the head, chest, and lower torso during blast exposure. All rats were exposed to a single blast in the frontal facing position (i.e., nose and head 180 degrees relative to the pressure wave propagation. Sham (non-blast) rats were exposed to all procedures but the blast.\nAfter blast exposure, rats were allowed to recover from anesthesia and returned to their cages until the appropriate study time point. For intravital microscopy studies, rats were randomized into 2\u2009h, 1, 3, 14, or 28 days post-BOP groups before exposure to blast. For immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot studies, a randomized block design was used. Because of the large number of animals needed to complete the studies reported here, only male rats were used in this initial investigation to control for sex-related differences. The majority of reports of clinical outcome after exposure to blast are based on observations in male military service members attributed to higher participation and incidence of injury in males.\n23\n,\n24\nThe findings of our study are limited to males, and sex differences in cerebrovascular responsiveness after exposure to blast remain unknown. It will be crucial that future studies investigate the effects in females.\n\nIntravital microscopy: pial arteriolar reactivity\nAfter exposure to sham procedures or BOP and on the day of surgery, rats were weighed and anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of acepromazine (4\u2009mg/kg) and ketamine (72\u2009mg/kg). Buprenorphine (0.01\u2009mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously for analgesia. Surgical plane of anesthesia was maintained subsequently with intramuscular injections of ketamine. Throughout the study, core body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C with a warming pad (MouseVent; Kent Scientific, Lichtfield, CT). Because pilot studies showed that rats breathing room air (21% oxygen) became hypoxemic, all animals were mechanically ventilated by an endotracheal tube with a small animal ventilator (MouseVent) using 40% medical grade oxygen (O\n2\n) and 60% nitrogen (N\n2\n; Airgas, Alexandria, VA). Ventilator settings were adjusted to maintain normocapnia (partial pressures of carbon dioxide [p\na\nCO\n2\n] of 35\u201345\u2009mm Hg) and normoxia (partial pressures of oxygen [p\na\nO\n2\n] \u226580\u2009mm Hg).\nThe right femoral artery was cannulated with PE-50 tubing for continuous blood sampling and invasive arterial blood pressure and heart rate (HR) monitoring (MouseVent). Blood samples were analyzed on an automated blood-gas system (ABL 700; Radiometer Medical ApS, Copenhagen, Denmark) for pH, p\na\nCO\n2\n, and p\na\nO\n2\n, lactate, and bicarbonate (HCO\n3\n\u2212\n). Pial microcirculation was accessed through a rectangular craniotomy (\u223c3\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u2009mm) prepared in the right parietal bone as described in Levasseur and colleagues.\n25\nThe dura was cut and removed to the side to expose pial microvasculature. To maintain moisture and electrolyte balance, the surface of the brain was superfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; Na 150\u2009mM, K 3.0\u2009mM, Ca 1.4\u2009mM, Mg 0.8\u2009mM, P 1.0\u2009mM, and Cl 155\u2009mM; Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) and covered with a glass cover-slip. A stereomicroscope (SZ16; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a DP-73 digital camera was used for imaging pial microvessels. A total magnification of 40\u2009\u00d7\u2009and a resolution of 0.8063 pixel/micrometer for both X and Y dimensions were used for image collection. Pial arterioles were measured at the same locus throughout the experiment using the computer program CellSens (2010; Olympus).\nAfter a 10-min stabilization period after surgery and under anesthesia, vessel reactivity was assessed by measuring pial arteriolar diameters before and after treatment with each of three mechanistically varied vasoactive mediators: carbon dioxide (CO\n2\n), barium chloride (BaCl\n2\n), and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT). The vasodilatory response of CO\n2\nwas assessed by switching the ventilator air supply from 40% O\n2\nto a certified gas mixture of 7% CO\n2\n, 40% O\n2\n, and 53% N\n2\n(Airgas). The CO\n2\ntest was terminated when end-tidal CO\n2\nreadings reached 10%, which typically occurred after \u223c90\u2009sec. An arterial blood-gas sample was analyzed at the end of the CO\n2\ntest to confirm that p\na\nCO\n2\nincreased to at least \u223c70\u2009mm Hg. After a 10-min washout period with artificial CSF, 5% aqueous BaCl\n2\n(0.3\u2009mL) was applied topically to the pia dropwise to probe vascular reactivity to this potent vasoconstrictor.\n26\n,\n27\nFor the 5-HT response, 0.3\u2009mL of 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n\u20134\nM of 5-HT HCl (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) was applied topically to the pial surface after a 10-min washout period with artificial CSF after the BaCl\n2\ntest. At the end of the experiment, reactivity of the pial microcirculation was tested again with BaCl\n2\nand CO\n2\nto ensure that the vessels remained reactive and able to constrict or dilate, respectively, until the end of the experiment.\nFigure 1\nillustrates examples of vasoconstriction and -dilation of pial arterioles as seen through a cranial window.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG 1.\nAn example of pial microcirculation as seen through a cranial window in the parietal bone under baseline conditions (left, p\na\nCO\n2\n=\u200935\u201345\u2009mm Hg), after topical application of BaCl\n2\n(middle, p\na\nCO\n2\n=\u200935\u201345\u2009mm Hg), and after ventilation with 7% CO\n2\n(right, p\na\nCO\n2\n=\u200980.6\u2009mm Hg in the illustrated example). Pial arterioles (arrows) respond with vasoconstriction to BaCl\n2\nand \u223c4% dilation to 7% CO\n2\n. Scale bars, 100\u2009\u03bcm. p\na\nCO\n2\n, partial pressure of carbon dioxide.\nFor analysis of microvascular diameter changes, pial microvessels were grouped into either a \u201csmall\u201d (<50\n\u03bc\nm) or \u201cmedium\u201d (50\u2013100\n\u03bc\nm) size category based on the pre-treatment baseline size.\n28\u201335\nThe increase in the amount of smooth muscle with vessel size correlates with the ability of vessels to contract justifies dividing the vessels into size categories.\n27\nA power analysis of pilot data indicated that 40 vessels per size category were required to detect a 10% change in diameter with 80% power. All animals were euthanized with 150\u2009mg/kg of sodium pentobarbital at the end of the experiment administered by intracardiac puncture.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nTo characterize blast-induced changes within the vascular wall and astrocytes and the time course of these changes, the expression of the following proteins was examined using IHC: vascular smooth muscle protein smoothelin (SMTH), smooth muscle \u03b1-actin (SMA), smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC), myosin light chain II-20\u2009kDa (MLC), endothelin type A receptor (ET\nA\n), endothelin type B receptor (ET\nB\n), and the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Rats were exposed to BOP or sham procedures as described above, and, at each of the time points studied (2\u2009h and 1, 3, 14, and 28 days post-BOP), rats (\nn\n=\u20095 rats/group for each time point) were euthanized with sodium pentobarbital (150\u2009mg/kg) and brains were collected and immediately embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) on dry ice.\nFrozen cryostat sections (5\u2009\u03bcm) from 0.8\u2009mm anterior to bregma to 4.8\u2009mm posterior to bregma were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15\u2009min and blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30\u2009min at room temperature. Sections were then incubated with rabbit or mouse antibodies against SMTH (1:2000; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), SMA (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), SM-MHC (1:500; Invitrogen), MLC (1:500; Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA), ET\nA\n(1:500; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), ET\nB\n(1:500; Abcam), or GFAP (1:1000; Millipore, Burlington, MA) overnight at 4\u00b0C. After three washes in PBS, the sections were incubated with the appropriate cyanine (Cy) 2\u2013 or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) at room temperature or overnight at 4\u00b0C. Sections were then washed in PBS, dehydrated through a graded (50, 70, 80, 90, and 100%) series of water-ethanol, cleared with xylene, mounted with Permount, and cover-slipped. For all proteins, with the exception of the endothelin receptors, sections were examined with an Olympus AX80 (Olympus) and images were captured with a DP72 camera (Olympus) using the software, cellSens Dimension (Olympus).\nImmunofluorescence intensity, blood vessel thickness, and vessel luminal diameter were measured using the software, ImagePro Premier (Version 9.3; Media Cybernetics Inc., Rockville, MD). Images from six to eight sections from each animal were used for semiquantitative analyses. For analysis of SMTH, SMA, SM-MHC, and MLC immunostained sections, the threshold was adjusted so that only the fluorescent staining (and not the background) was visible. Image color was converted to black and white, with white representing the immunostained areas and black representing non-stained areas. For consistency, the same threshold was applied to all sections. Individual vessels were selected, and densitometry of immunolabeled vessels was used to obtain intensity values.\nTo determine whether exposure to blast leads to change in expression pattern of endothelin receptors within the blood vessel wall and astrocytes, tissue sections were double-labeled against endothelin receptors A or B and GFAP or SMA to label astrocytes or smooth muscle, respectively. For colocalization studies, the same standard immunolabeling procedures described above were used and the sections that were incubated with anti-ET\nA\nor ET\nB\nantibodies were combined with anti-SMA or anti-GFAP antibodies. Immunofluorescence was examined using confocal microscopy (Fluoview FV1200; Olympus). For quantification of ET receptors, single immunofluorescence intensity for the whole slide was obtained. Double-labeled cells were counted manually and were expressed as percentage of ET\nA\nor ET\nB\nand GFAP-positive cells or ET\nA\nor ET\nB\nand SMA-positive cells.\n\nWestern blotting\nFor western blotting, anesthetized rats (\nn\n=\u20096 rats/group for each time point) were exposed to blast or sham procedures and euthanized as described for IHC. Harvested brains were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen until further processing. For protein extraction, tissue from the frontoparietal cortex was sonicated and lysed on ice in a buffer containing 150\u2009mM of NaCl, 50\u2009mM of Tris-HCl, 0.25% deoxycholate, 1\u2009mM of ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, 1\u2009mM of NaF, 1\u2009mM of Na\n3\nVO\n4\n, and a cocktail of proteinase inhibitors. Protein assays and western blot analyses were determined as previously described.\n36\nBriefly, equal amounts of protein from each sample (25\u2009\u03bcg) were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, which were then blocked in 5% nonfat milk. Membranes were then probed overnight at 4\u00b0C using the following dilutions of the same antibodies used for IHC: SMTH (1:2500), SM-MHC (1:1000), SMA (1:1000), MLC (1:1000), ET\nA\n(1:1000), and ET\nB\n(1:2000).\nIn addition, antibodies against endothelin-1 (ET-1; 1:1000; Invitrogen), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS; 1:1000; Abcam), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS; 1:1000; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and serine 19 phosphorylated MLC (p-MLC; 1:1000; Cell Signaling) were also used to assess expression of these proteins. After incubation with the appropriate antimouse or -rabbit secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked immunoglobulin G secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling), blots were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (SuperSignal WestFemto; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and imaged in a Fuji Image analyzer (LAS-3000; Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) to detect the HRP-conjugated antibody complex. Band density was quantified using the NIH software, ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Each membrane was then incubated in a stripping buffer for 15\u2009min to remove the immune complex and probed for the housekeeping protein, \u03b2-actin.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll results are reported as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (2012; IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY). Data for each variable were assessed for normality before inferential statistical analyses. For pial arteriolar diameters, percent change from pre-treatment baseline for each vasoactive mediator was compared among the groups using the Mann-Whitney U test because the data were not normally distributed and a transformation was not feasible. Adjustments for multiple comparisons against the sham group were performed, and, when appropriate, the adjusted\np\nvalues were used to determine statistical significance. GraphPad Prism software (version 6; 2009; GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) was used for generating graphs. IHC and western blotting data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Dunnett's test for post-hoc pair-wise comparisons."

    "Methods": "TBI procedure\nThe Committee on Animal Use for Research and Education at the University of Pittsburgh approved all animal studies, in compliance with National Institutes of Health guidelines. The procedures were conducted based on our previously published protocol.\n47\u201350\nBriefly, 8\u201312-week-old adult male or female C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory) were anesthetized and subjected to sham or controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury. Mice were placed in a stereotaxic frame (Leica Impact One Controlled Impact Device #39463920 for CCI, Leica Microsystems) and mice were impacted at 4.5\u2009m/sec with a 20-msec dwell time and 1.2-mm depression using a 3\u2009mm in diameter convex tip, mimicking a moderate TBI. Sham-operated mice underwent identical surgical procedures but were not impacted. In another set of experiments, mice were treated with lithium (5mg/kg; intraperitoneal injection) immediately after TBI and treatment continued up to 3 days once per day. Then peri-contusional hippocampus was isolated after 72\u2009h to carry out biochemical studies as described below.\n\nWestern blot and co-immunoprecipitation\nThe peri-contusional hippocampus was isolated and hippocampal lysates were prepared as described before to perform western blot and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP).\n47\u201350\nBlots were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in the primary antibody Doublecortin (Dcx) (Santa Cruz Biotechology, 1:500 dilution), Ngn2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:500 dilution), Mash1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:500 dilution), vGlut1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:500 dilution), HDAC4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:500 dilution), and Actin (Sigma-Aldrich, 1:5000 dilution) followed by incubation with a LicorIRDye secondary antibody at room temperature. Blots were visualized using a Li-Cor Odyssey system and ImageJ software determined the intensity of each band, and the changes in the band intensity were represented as the fold change as described previously.\n47\u201350\nFor Co-IP, hippocampus collected from all sets of experiments was homogenized in lysis buffer (50\u2009mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 0.5% [v/v] Tween-20, 50\u2009mM Tris [pH 7.5], 1\u2009mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) with protease and phosphatase inhibitor) by passage through a 26-gauge needle, and 400\u2009\u03bcg of the total protein for each sample was incubated overnight with either Pax3 (1:100) or NRF1 (1:100) antibody. The immune precipitates were resolved and analyzed by western blotting with either the HDAC4 antibody or acetyl-lysine antibody.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nThe immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed per our method as described previously.\n47\u201350\nSeventy-two hour TBI brain samples were subjected to cryosectioning (20-\u03bcm thickness) and for immunofluorescence analysis sections were incubated 10\u2009min at room temperature with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), followed by overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C with the primary antibody against Dcx (1:100; Cell Signaling Technology), Mash1 (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), vGlut1 (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechology), Flag (1:300, Abcam), or Ngn2 (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechology). Sections were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with the appropriate Alexa Fluor-tagged secondary antibody for 2\u2009h at room temperature in the dark. Sections were then washed three times with PBS and mounted with Prolong Glodantifade mounting media with DAPI (Invitrogen). Imaging was performed with the help of an Olympus fluorescent microscope (IX83).\n\nGlutamate assay\nAmounts of glutamate released during TBI were measured with an Amplex Red Glutamic Acid/Glutamate Oxidase Assay Kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described before\n51\nwith modifications. Briefly, 50\u2009\u03bcL of brain tissue lysate were mixed with 50\u2009\u03bcL of a reaction buffer containing Amplex red, glutamate oxidase, glutamate pyruvate transaminase, alanine, and horseradish peroxidase. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min, the fluorescence of the reaction mixture emitted at 590\u2009nm was measured every 10\u2009min with a fluorescence microplate reader (Synergy H1 Hybrid Multi-Mode Microplate Reader) at an excitation wavelength of 555\u2009nm.\n\nChromatin immunoprecipitation assay\nThe chromatin immunoprecipitation\n(\nChIP) assay was performed per our previously published method\n47\u201350\nusing the ChIP Assay Kit from Millipore. Briefly, after sonication, 72-h post-TBI ipsilateral hippocampal lysates containing soluble chromatin were incubated overnight with an anti-Pax3 antibody (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The eluates were used as templates in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the primers 5\u2032-ggcagatctgattgttttct-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-gcagctcgcccgagtctcgt3\u2032 (Invitrogen). The expected DNA fragment that was amplified is in the Ngn2 promoter region encompassing the Pax3 binding site.\n\nIn vivo\ntransfection of HDAC4 in the dentate gyrus\nPolyethyleneimine (PEI) complexes including Flag-HDAC4 (Flag-HDAC4 insert was in the pcDNA3.1 mammalian vector and under the CMV constitutive promoter from Addgene) were injected into the hippocampus as described previously.\n52\u201355\nFor\nin vivo\ntransfection the plasmid was mixed within\nin vivo\n-jetPEI transfection reagent at an N/P ratio of 7, as suggested by the manufacturer (PolyPlus Transfection) to final doses of an oligonucleotide of 2.5\u2009\u03bcg/mouse. C57BL/6 mice were injected in the DG at bregma: \u22120.2 AP, \u22120.13 ML, and 0.2 DV with 5\u2009\u03bcL of DNA transfection reagent mix.\n\nQuantitative real-time PCR\nQuantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed per our method.\n55\nTotal RNA was isolated using the kit (QIAGEN), and the complementary DNA (cDNA) was subjected to qRT-PCR analysis with fast-standard SYBR green dye (Applied Biosystems) using an AB7500 RT-PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems). Results were normalized using total input DNA and expressed as bound/Input (fold). Ipsilateral hippocampal tissues were taken 72-h post-TBI induction on the mouse brain. The primers used to carry out PCR analysis are as follows: vGlut1 (Forward 5'-TGC CAA GCT AAT CTG TAG GG3', Reverse 5'-GAA TGG GCG AAT CCT AAA AT-3'), Mash1 (Forward 5'-TCAACCTGGGTTTTG CCACC-3', Reverse 5'-TCGTTGGAGTAGTTGGGGGA-3'), Ngn2 (Forward-5'CTGTGGGAATTTCACCTGTC-3', Reverse 5'-CTAAATTTCCACGCTTGCAT-3'), ND1 (Forward 5'CGATTAGAGGCACGTCAGTT-3') Reverse 5'-TTCTTCCAAAGGCAGTAACG-3').\n\nPreparation of primary neurosphere and glutamate treatment\nPrimary neurosphere culture was prepared from E14.5 C57BL/6 mice as described previously with some modifications.\n47\u201350\nBriefly, the pregnant mouse was anesthetized, and the brain hemispheres were dissected out. Trypsinized tissue was washed and re-suspended in neurosphere complete medium. For differentiation of neurospheres, each neurosphere was re-suspended into neurosphere differential medium, and differentiated cells were treated with 100\u2009\u03bcM glutamate. After 24\u2009h, cells were subjected to IHC using MAP2 antibody (1:2000; Novus Biologicals). The quantitation of differentiated processes was measured by Sholl analysis plugin in ImageJ and data have been represented as the distance from soma versus several intersections.\n\nOpen field test\nAnxiety-like behavior was assessed 2 weeks after TBI using an open field apparatus divided into a 5-cm\n2\ngrid by black lines (81 squares in total) as described previously with modifications.\n56\u201358\nBriefly, mice were placed in the center of the open field, and activity was measured and recorded for 5\u2009min. The total movement time and time spent in the center of the open field were analyzed by an investigator who was blinded to experimental conditions.\n\nSpontaneous alternation behavior (Y-maze)\nThe Y-maze spontaneous alternation behavior (SAB) test, to assess hippocampal-dependent working (short-term) memory, was performed 2 weeks after TBI following previously published protocols with minor modifications.\n59\nEach mouse was placed at the end of a randomly chosen arm and allowed to explore the maze for 5\u2009min freely. Visits to arms were scored, and an alternation was counted when the mouse visited three different arms consecutively; and the percent correct alternation was calculated as: (total number of alterations/total arm entries \u2013 2)\u2009\u00d7\u2009100.\n\nTail suspension test\nMice were individually suspended by the tail on a horizontal bar using adhesive tape placed approximately 4\u2009cm from the tip of the tail as described previously with minor modifications.\n60\nThe duration of immobility was monitored and recorded for 5\u2009min.\n\nBarnes maze\nThe maze consisted of a circular platform with 20 holes around the periphery (5\u2009cm diameter) with an escape box attached to the bottom of one of the holes, following previous publication with minor modifications.\n61\n,\n62\nBriefly, during a spatial training period of 4 days, mice explored the maze freely for 3\u2009min once per day. The escape latency and errors to find the holes were recorded. During the probe trial conducted 1 day after the last training trial, the escape tunnel was blocked, and mice explored the maze for 90\u2009sec. The time spent around holes along with target was analyzed.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe biochemical studies, confocal analysis, Sholl analysis, and all behavioral tests except the Barns maze test were statistically analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple comparisons were performed using the Tukey-Kramer post hoc test (\np\n<\u20090.05) unless noted otherwise. Two-way ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer post hoc test was used to assess the Barns maze test. Mean values were calculated for each biochemical experiment (\nn\n=\u20097) and each behavioral experiment (\nn\n=\u200910), and all the datawere depicted as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM)."

    "Methods": "Animal care and surgical procedure\nIn vivo\nstudies were conducted on spontaneously breathing, adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats (open-loop stimulation\nn\n=\u20091, 415\u2009g, 4.3 months old; adaptive stimulation spinal cord intact\nn\n=\u20099, 372\u2009\u00b1\u200974\u2009g, 4.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9 months old; adaptive stimulation left C2hX\nn\n=\u20097; 419\u2009\u00b1\u2009121\u2009g, 4.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2 months old) with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Florida International University (Miami, FL). Rats were initially anesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital (50\u2009mg/kg) followed by supplemental inhaled isoflurane (1.0\u20132.5%) in 100% O\n2\n. The plane of anesthesia was assessed by a toe-pinch reflex. Body temperature was maintained between 36 and 38\u00b0C by a heating lamp. A pulse oximeter sensor monitored SpO\n2\n. A tracheal tube was inserted after a tracheostomy and sutured to the trachea. A small animal pneumotachometer (PTM Type HSE-73-0980; Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA), connected directly to the tracheal tube, measured air flow. Flow was integrated (PI-1000; CWE Inc., Ardmore, PA) to obtain breath volume. A capnograph (CapStar-100; CWE Inc.) monitored etCO\n2\nthroughout the experiment. Stainless steel needle electrodes (30G) were inserted subcutaneously to monitor cardiac activity by electrocardiogram.\nStainless steel wire intramuscular recording electrodes (SS-304, 44 AWG; AM-Systems, Carlsborg, PA) were inserted below the tongue for recording of genioglossus (GG) muscle activity in some animals (\nn\n=\u20092). GG activity was recorded to assess synchrony between the intrinsic inspiratory drive and paced breaths.\nA ventral incision provided access to the caudal aspect of the diaphragm muscle. A hand-held stimulator (DigiStim 3 plus; Neuro Technology, Inc., Vilnius, Lithuania) with a blunted needle delivered constant-current pulses at 1\u2009Hz to map the location of the neuromuscular junction. Stimulation electrodes were implanted near this location. The peritoneal incision remained open to provide visualization of the diaphragm during assessment of muscle twitch thresholds, after which the incision was sutured closed.\nA lateral C2 hemisection was performed before stimulation in 7 rats to use as an iSCI model. A dorsal C2 laminectomy was performed to expose the cervical spinal cord. Once exposed, a microscalpel was used to perforate the dura and sever the left half of the spinal cord at the C2 level. Observing a considerable decrease in tidal volume provided a functional assessment of a proper hemisection. Spinal tissue was also collected for histological assessment to ensure that the hemisection resulted in severance of all descending phrenic pathways.\n\nDiaphragmatic stimulation\nDiaphragmatic pacing was conducted using single-stranded, stainless steel electrodes (SS-304, 44 AWG; AM-Systems) implanted bilaterally through the abdominal fascia of the diaphragm or through the muscle itself with the use of a suture needle (10\u2009mm, 3/8th circle, cutting; Havel's Inc., Cincinnati, OH). Stimulation was performed using a constant-current programmable stimulator (FNS-16; CWE Inc.) delivering cathodic first, biphasic current pulses of 200\u2009\u03bcs/phase at 75\u2009Hz with amplitude modulated every 40\u2009ms by the adaptive PS controller. The 75-Hz stimulation frequency was shown to provide tetanic contractions in rat skeletal muscle.\n22\n,\n23\nPulses delivered at 75\u2009Hz were also found to consistently elicit effective tetanic contractions of the diaphragm during preliminary trials, and thus this pulse frequency was maintained for all trials in this study.\nIn all experimental trials, the initial current pulse amplitude was set to zero, which automatically changed once the PS controller was initiated. Current amplitude was determined by scaling the PS controller output to the maximum limit for current amplitude set for each stimulating channel. The maximum current amplitude was set for each stimulating channel at 4 times the twitch threshold amplitude observed for each hemidiaphragm during open-loop stimulation. Maximum current-amplitude values for the stimulated hemidiaphragms ranged from 0.5 to 4.0\u2009mA; the FNS-16 stimulator resolution for the current amplitude is 0.001\u2009mA.\n\nExperimental protocol\nTo assess the controller's ability to achieve a desired ventilatory profile in both spinal cord intact and left C2hX rats, the controller was set to modulate stimulation to match a desired breath-volume profile with a constant cycle period. The desired breath-volume profile and cycle period were obtained from baseline ventilatory data recorded for at least 1\u2009min preceding stimulation in each trial in spinal cord intact animals and in multiple intermittent recordings before injury for the trials in left C2hX animals. The desired breath-volume profile was defined by averaging all recorded breathing cycles except for sighs. The averaging algorithm automatically excluded breaths identified as sighs based on preliminary data and literature that describe sighs as being breaths with a tidal volume of at least twice the normal tidal volume.\n24\nTo illustrate the ability of the controller to modulate breath volume in spinal cord intact animals, the desired breath-volume profile was scaled by 120%. This scaling factor was selected to match the approximately 20% increase in tidal volume observed in preliminary studies on anesthetized spinal intact rats that were exposed to a hypercapnic challenge. In left C2hX animals, the desired breath-volume profile was maintained at pre-hemisection values unless an increase in desired breath volume was required to promote in-phase synchronization. The duration of the desired breath cycle was set to match the duration of the breath cycle before the trial; if required to improve the likelihood of synchronization, this value was adjusted (within \u00b110%). The desired breath-volume profile was maintained constant throughout the trial.\nIn trials in spinal cord intact animals, each trial consisted of at least 1\u2009min of spontaneous breathing, followed by at least 100 cycles of pacing with an increased desired breath volume of 120% of the baseline breath volume. There were one to eight trials per spinal cord intact animal. In animals with iSCI, before hemisection, trials were defined as multiple recordings of 1\u2009min each of spontaneous breathing (\nn\n=\u20093 per rat, with the exception of rat 11 where\nn\n=\u20092). After hemisection, trials were defined as at least 1\u2009min of spontaneous breathing followed by at least 200 pacing cycles. There were two to six trials post-hemisection per animal.\nExpiratory muscles were not stimulated and therefore expiration was passive. A rest period of 15\u2009min was allowed between trials to allow the diaphragm to recover from stimulation-induced fatigue. In left C2hX animals, a mechanical ventilator was used to maintain proper ventilation during these rest periods and to maintain etCO\n2\nat nominal levels.\n\nPerformance measures\nThe adaptive controller adapts the stimulation output to the magnitude of the error between the desired volume and the measured volume at a given instant. To quantify the deviation from the desired volume and the achieved volume traces over the portion of the respiratory cycle directly affected by inspiratory muscle activation, the inspiratory root mean square error (iRMSE) percentage for each pacing cycle was defined as shown by\nEquation 1\n:\nwhere\nmax(V\nD\n)\nis the peak value for the desired volume,\ndenotes the time step at the start of inspiration,\nq\nthe number of time steps in the inspiratory phase of the desired breath volume profile, and\ne\ni\nthe instantaneous error at time step\ni\n.\nThe basis of this error value across several pacing cycles has been used as an indicator of controller accuracy in previous studies regarding evaluation of the PG/PS controller.\n17\n,\n25\n,\n26\nIn the current study, the number of pacing cycles required for iRMSE percentage to fall below a certain threshold and maintain it for at least 10 pacing cycles served as an indicator of controller speed of adaptation. A threshold of 5% iRMSE was selected for simulation studies. In animal studies, because of inherent breath-to-breath variability in the inspiratory volume profile, the iRMSE threshold was elevated to 10%. The mean and standard deviation of the iRMSE of the last 40 pacing cycles of the pacing period were used to assess controller performance.\nIn addition to the iRMSE measures, the effectiveness of pacing in left C2hX animals was assessed by evaluating tidal volume and etCO\n2\nduring pacing. Values for these measures were tabulated under pre-hemisection, post-hemisection without pacing, and post-hemisection with pacing conditions from 40 pacing cycles for tidal volume and 10 pacing cycles for etCO\n2\nper condition. Analyzing tidal volume over 40 cycles allowed assessment of the controller's ability to maintain a constant tidal volume over a large number of cycles, whereas selecting 10 cycles of etCO\n2\nallowed assessment of the transient response of etCO\n2\nto pacing.\nFor tidal volume, breath cycles post-hemisection without pacing were obtained just before initializing pacing. For etCO\n2\n, breath cycles post-hemisection were collected after synchronization between the pacing and intrinsic breathing occurred. This was done to utilize tidal volumes similar to eupnea, thus minimizing the potentially confounding effect of expiratory breath volume on etCO\n2\nvalues. Post-hemisection with pacing cycles was obtained before the end of the 200-pacing cycle pacing period in both cases.\n\nHistology\nAfter completion of the experimental protocols, each left C2hX animal was perfused with phosphate buffer solution followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The spinal cord was extracted from the atlas to the C7 vertebra and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then transferred to 30% sucrose for dehydration. Spinal cords were then frozen and cryosectioned to obtain 15-\u03bcm longitudinal sections. The presence of a gap in the ventrolateral tissue observed under light microscopy of unstained sections was used to indicate completeness of the spinal cord hemisection.\n\nExperimental design and statistical analysis\nA post-hoc\nt\n-test power analysis was performed to assess whether the number of spinal cord intact (\nn\n=\u20099) and spinal cord left C2hX (\nn\n=\u20097) animals provided sufficient power for statistical analysis of the number of pacing cycles required to achieve \u226410% iRMSE. Based on descriptive statistics obtained for this measure (spinal cord intact\u2009=\u200916.06\u2009\u00b1\u20096.66 pacing cycles, left C2hX\u2009=\u200958.8\u2009\u00b1\u200927.25 pacing cycles) and an alpha of 0.05, the test provided a power of 0.98 (Df\u2009=\u200914). A repeated-measures analysis of variance power analysis was also performed post hoc to assess whether 40 pacing cycles was sufficient to identify a difference in tidal volume among the pre-hemisection, post-hemisection without pacing, and post-hemisection with pacing conditions in the left C2hX rats. A similar analysis was done to determine whether 10 pacing cycles of etCO\n2\nwere sufficient. The resulting power was 1.00 and 0.95 for tidal volume and etCO\n2\n, respectively. All power analysis was performed using G*Power software (version 3.1.9.2).\n27\nDescriptive statistics were obtained using SPSS software (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY).\nTo assess the effect of pacing on tidal volume and etCO\n2\nafter hemisection, a general linear mixed model\n28\nwas used with fixed effects of trial number and condition (spinal cord intact, hemisection without pacing, and hemisection with pacing) and random intercept effects of both trial number and measurement occasion (last 40 breath measurements within each trial for tidal volume and last 10 breath measurements for etCO\n2\n). The generalized linear mixed model was performed using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).\n\nPattern generator/pattern shaper controller design\nThe PG/PS controller utilized in this study is based on the original PG/PS controller that was designed and used to control cyclic limb movements using functional neuromuscular stimulation. The PG/PS controller had the ability to compensate for muscle fatigue by adapting stimulation pulse parameters and charge delivery to achieve the desired functional outcome.\n17\n,\n22\n,\n23\n,\n25\n,\n26\n,\n29\n,\n30\nThe PG module generates the pacing cycle period while the PS module adapts to define stimulation parameters that elicit a desired action. In the current study, a fixed frequency oscillator was used as the PG to produce a fixed respiratory frequency that did not change from breath to breath. The PS module consisted of a single-layer neural network with the output profile of each neuron being a raised cosine function; the outputs of the neurons in the set are time shifted with respect to each other.\nIn its current implementation, the number of neurons was set as 25, with one reaching its peak every 40\u2009ms (which matched the frequency at which the controller sends an update to the stimulator). To create a stimulation pulse train with frequency of 75\u2009Hz, each update to the stimulator resulted in the production of three pulses of identical amplitude. Each neuron reaches its peak activity at a specific time step, but its temporal profile overlaps across a specified number of neighboring neurons. The width of the temporal profile determines the number of overlapping activation profiles and is defined in the controller by the parameter\nn\na\n. The output,\nz(t)\n, of the PS at each time step is the weighted summation of the non-zero neuron outputs at that time step and is given by\nEquation 2\n:\nwhere the output of a neuron\nj\nat time\nt\nis defined as\n, with the weight for that specific neuron set as\n. The output,\n, is restricted to the range of values between 0 and 1 and then scaled by the maximum current amplitude defined for each channel.\nEach scaling factor, or weight, for each neuronal output is modified based on an instantaneous error between a pre-established target breath-volume cycle profile and the measured volume signal. The controller works in a feed-forward manner by modifying each neuron's weight at each time step based on the measured value of error at that time. The change in weights for neuron\nj\nis shown by\nEquation 3\n:\nwhere\nis the learning rate,\nis the instantaneous error at time\nt\n,\nT\nis the update period,\nn\np\nis number of past activations over which the error is averaged, and\ni\nthe\nn\np\nindex.\nComputer simulations were carried out to elucidate the range of parameters over which adaptation would be stable and errors minimized. These ranges were then used in animal studies to assess\nin vivo\nimplementation of the controller.\n\nMusculoskeletal diaphragm model\nA computational model of diaphragm and chest biomechanics was used as a testbed to design and develop the PG/PS adaptive controller before\nin vivo\nevaluation. The musculoskeletal model and PG/PS controller were implemented in the LABVIEW programming environment using the Control Design and Simulation module (National Instruments Inc., Austin, TX). The chest model is a biomechanical model in which the mechanical action of diaphragm muscle displacement is assumed to correspond linearly to breath volume.\n31\n,\n32\nA proportionality constant,\nk\np\n, was implemented to calculate breath volume from muscle displacement. The mechanical action of the diaphragm is defined by the inertance of the chest system,\nm\nL\n, the elastance of the system,\nK\nL\n, and the damping coefficient of the system,\nB\nL\n. Chest biomechanics was described mathematically as a function of diaphragm contractile force by the following equation (\nEquation 4\n):\nwhere the input to the model is the force exerted by the diaphragm muscle,\nF\ndia\n, and the output is the displacement of the diaphragm,\nx\n. The mechanical circuit is shown in\nFigure 2A\n.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 2.\nA diaphragm muscle model (\nA\n) and chest biomechanical model (\nB\n) are used for simulation of closed-loop pacing of the diaphragm muscle. The mechanical model output is the displacement of the diaphragm (\nx\n), which then translates to volume through a conversion factor (\nk\n). The displacement and velocity are delivered back into the muscle model to factor into the force-length and force-velocity contributions. The controller modulates stimulation delivered based on the error between a desired volume and the output of the model.\nThe diaphragm muscle model was based off the multiplicative quadriceps muscle model with reverse recruitment shown in\nFigure 2B\n.\n29\n,\n33\nBriefly, the total force exerted by the muscle,\n, is given by the product of a dynamic muscle activation model output\nA\nk\n, force-length factor\nA\nFL\n, and a force-velocity factor\nA\nFV\n(\nEquation 5\n).\nIntrinsically, fatigue-resistant fibers are recruited first while fast-fatigable fibers are recruited later when there is a higher demand for recruitment of muscle fibers. However, because of the nature of extraneural electrical stimulation in which larger fibers have a lower threshold, the larger fast fatigable fibers are recruited before the slow fatigue-resistant fibers are activated, resulting in reverse recruitment.\n34\nThis reverse recruitment produces non-linear input/output properties that were modeled using\nEquation 6\n:\nin which muscle recruitment,\nr(t),\nis calculated to mimic the intrinsic recruitment curve observed experimentally in previous studies in rats.\n35\nD\nrepresents the dead band, or the pulse amplitude below which no fibers are recruited, and the constants,\n,\n, and\n, were modified to obtain a cubic curve that fit these experimental results.\nThe force generated as fiber recruitment increases is a dynamic process which was modeled using a second-order autoregressive, moving average model with input and output delays (\nEquation 7\n).\n29\nConstants\na\n1\nand\na\n2\ndefine the linear dynamics of the model, whereas\nb\n0\ndefines the muscle input gain. The delay,\nT\n, was based on the model update period of 14\u2009ms.\nThe force-length component,\n, and force-velocity component,\n, serve as scaling factors to the force generated by the dynamic model. Force-length factor was estimated with a quadratic equation (\nEquation 8\n):\nwith\nL\nbeing the length at instant\nt\n,\nL\no\nthe reference length, and\nL\nw\nthe maximum length of the muscle.\nThe force-velocity factor was obtained by\nEquation 9\n:\nwith\nK\nV\nbeing the force-velocity slope and\nV\nmax\nthe maximum shortening velocity. Constants for all equations and their values can be found in\nTable 1\n.\nTable 1.\nChest and Diaphragm Biomechanical Model Parameters\nm\nL\n1.8\u2009g\na\n1\n0.6679\nB\nL\n8.4\u2009g\u00b7s\n\u22121\na\n2\n\u20130.1001\nK\nL\n11.5\u2009g\u00b7s\n\u22122\nb\n0\n20\nk\np\n7\u2009g\u00b7cm\n3\n\u00b7s\n\u22122\nL\nw\n6\u2009cm\n\u03b3\n0\n0\nL\n0\n0\u2009cm\n\u03b3\n1\n0.01909\nV\nmax\n48\u2009cm\u00b7s\n\u22121\n\u03b3\n2\n\u20130.0001152\nK\nV\n0.2\n\u03b3\n3\n2.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n\u20137\nD\n3.5%\nOpen in a separate window\n\nComputational trials for parametrization of suitable controller parameters\nA previous study has illustrated the ability of the PS controller to adapt across a wide range of controller parameters.\n26\nHowever, in this study, the PS was assigned to follow a trajectory for limb movement that differs considerably in profile, amplitude, and duration from one derived from respiratory volume. A LabVIEW implementation of the PS controller and musculoskeletal model was used to carry out the computer simulations. All simulations utilized a pre-determined desired trajectory from a baseline volume profile obtained from experimental data.\nThe controller parameters varied in computer simulation studies were: number of active neurons at any one time step, number of past neuron activations over which to average the instantaneous error, and learning rate. The controller update frequency was set at 25\u2009Hz, and the number of neurons was set to 25. Learning rate values tested were 0.0001, 0.0005, 0.001, 0.002, 0.003, and 0.004. The values tested for the number of active neurons tested ranged from 1 to 19 (in steps of 2) and the values tested for the number of past activations ranged from 2 to 20 (in steps of 2). Each of these simulated trials was done for a length of 100 pacing cycles.\nTo determine the controller parameters suitable for fast, accurate, and stable performance, only parameter triads that would pass selection criteria were selected. These criteria were: iRMSE below 5% within 20 pacing cycles, mean iRMSE below 5%, and a standard deviation below 2.5% iRMSE after <5% iRMSE was attained. Processing of trial results for parameter set selection was performed using MATLAB software (The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA)."

    "Methods": "Study design and study population\nThis population-based, controlled, prospective cohort study included three study groups: one group exposed to MTBI, one group exposed to minor orthopedic injuries but no head injury (trauma controls), and one group of community controls not exposed to any injury. The MTBI group and the trauma controls were recruited from two emergency departments (EDs) in Trondheim, Norway: St. Olav's Hospital (Trondheim University Hospital), a regional Level 1 trauma center, and Trondheim Municipal Emergency Clinic, a general practitioner-run, outpatient clinic, with a catchment area of 229,000 inhabitants. The community control group was recruited from the same catchment area and matched to the MTBI group with regard to age, sex, and education. The trauma control group was matched with regard to age and sex.\n\nInclusion in the Trondheim MTBI follow-up study\nDetails of how the MTBI group was recruited, diagnostic criteria, and exclusion criteria have been described earlier.\n15\nThe inclusion period was April 2014 to December 2015 for the MTBI group and June 2014 to December 2017 for the controls. Inclusion criteria for the MTBI group were having experienced MTBI and age 16\u201359 years. TBI was categorized as mild according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score 13\u201315 at presentation, and either witnessed loss of consciousness (LOC) <30\u2009min, confusion, or post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) <24\u2009h.\n16\nInclusion criteria for trauma controls were fractures or symptoms from soft-tissue injuries lasting \u226548\u2009h. Exclusion criteria were the same as for patients with MTBI; also excluded were head or neck injury (including whiplash injury), multi-trauma, and trauma to dominant upper extremity.\n\nStudy variables\nInformation regarding the injury resulting in an MTBI and clinical symptoms at the ED, including information about alcohol influence at the time of injury, was collected through medical records and by interviewing the participants. The GCS score was observed by the study personnel or recorded from the medical record. If lacking, the history and clinical descriptions in the medical records were used to estimate a score. This method was used on 29 (7.7%) of the MTBI participants. Duration of PTA was recorded as the time after injury for which the patient had no continuous memory (<1\u2009h, or 1\u201324\u2009h). Previous MTBI was defined as having experienced one or more head injuries fulfilling diagnostic criteria for MTBI. The clinical radiology report was used to classify CT findings into intracranial findings and cranial fractures. An MRI examination was performed on a 3.0 Tesla Siemens Skyra System (3T, susceptibility-weighted imaging [SWI], fluid-attenuated inversion recovery [FLAIR], diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI]) if the patient lived within a 1-h drive, there was a time slot for MRI available within 72\u2009h, and the patient consented to MRI (see\nSupplementary Appendix S1\nfor protocol). Intracranial traumatic pathology and cranial fractures on MRI or CT were dichotomized into \u201cimaging findings on CT or MRI\u201d (yes/no).\n\nHeadache variables\nInformation regarding the participants' headache status was collected through self-administered questionnaires at three points in time (\nFig. 1\n). In the questionnaire at baseline the participants were asked the headache screening question, \u201cHave you suffered from headache during the last year?\u201d; those who answered \u201cyes\u201d were recorded as suffering from headache at baseline. Participants answering \u201cyes\u201d to the headache screening question answered the subsequent headache questions that enabled classification into definite migraine, probable migraine, and tension-type headache (TTH) according to the ICHD-3 criteria.\n1\nThe participants answered the same headache questions after 3 and 12 months and were then asked to report headache during the previous 3 and 9 months, respectively.\nOpen in a separate window\nFIG. 1\nTimeline illustrating the time periods covered in each questionnaire. Baseline questionnaire: headache suffering last 12 months prior to injury (MTBI and trauma controls) or first questionnaire (community controls). Three-month questionnaire: headache suffering the first 3 months post-injury. Twelve-month questionnaire: headache suffering 3- 12 months post-injury. MTBI, mild traumatic brain injury. Color image is available online.\nParticipants who answered \u201cno\u201d to the first screening question were considered non-sufferers. Participants were not specifically asked about the duration of untreated headache attacks, because some individuals always use attack medication for their headaches. Because of this, the ICHD-3 criteria for migraine were modified so that duration of <4\u2009h was accepted as well. Chronic migraine was defined as headache >14 days/month without medication overuse and fulfilling criteria for migraine. Chronic TTH was defined as headache >14 days/month without medication overuse and fulfilling criteria for TTH. Chronic daily headache (CDH) was defined as headache occurring >14 days/month. The participants were also asked to report use of acute medication for headache during the previous month, enabling the diagnosis of medication overuse headache (MOH) defined as CDH with acute medication use >14 days/month. The validity of these questionnaire-based diagnoses has previously been evaluated and found to be acceptable.\n17\nTo be able to examine predictors for new headache or exacerbation of previously reported headache from baseline to the first 3 months post-injury (acute HAIH) and from baseline to 3\u201312 months post-injury (persistent HAIH) respectively, headache sufferers were classified with regard to headache frequency. Each participant was then categorized into one of the following four groups: no headache suffering, headache suffering <7 days/month, headache suffering 7\u201314 days/month, and headache suffering >14 days/month. We defined exacerbation of headache as new onset of headache or increased frequency of previously reported headache.\n\nOther variables\nDemographic variables and other health-related variables were collected through an interview with the study participants within 2 weeks after the injury. These were the known confounders: age, sex, socioeconomic status, and AUDIT score (alcohol use identification test), categorized from a continuous variable into two categories with score boundaries <8 and \u22658.\n18\nLower secondary school grades were chosen as measure of socioeconomic status because of the young age of many of the participants, making it difficult to use the traditional measures such as income or duration of education. In Norway, lower secondary school grades have been found to correlate strongly with the socioeconomic status in the family.\n19\n\nStatistical analysis\nContinuous data are presented as means and standard deviations (SDs), whereas categorical data are presented as frequencies and percentages. We used a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) to compare the development of headache status regarding headache suffering or no headache suffering between the three groups (MTBI, community controls, and trauma controls) over time (baseline, and 3 months and 12 months post-injury). To control for known confounders, the model included age, sex, socioeconomic status, and alcohol use as covariates, in addition to group, time, and a group-time interaction term. A random, subject-specific intercept on the logit scale was included to account for within-subject dependencies. Missing outcome variables for subjects with at least one observation on outcome were handled by the model, whereas missing explanatory variables were handled by listwise deletion.\nWe used logistic regression to identify predictors for exacerbation of headache within the first 3 months post-injury (acute HAIH) among the participants answering both the baseline and 3-month questionnaires, and exacerbation of headache 3\u201312 months post-injury (persistent HAIH) among the participants answering both the baseline and 12-month questionnaires, for the MTBI participants. We examined sex (male/female), age (continuous variable), socioeconomic status (continuous variable), GCS score (13\u201314/15), PTA (1\u201324\u2009h/<1\u2009h), previous MTBI (yes/no), pathological imaging findings (fracture or intracranial pathology) on CT or MRI (yes/no), and being influenced by alcohol at time of injury (clinically assessed or self-reported) (yes/no) as potential predictors. In addition, we performed a separate analysis examining acute HAIH (yes/no) as a predictor for persistent HAIH, including the previously mentioned predictors as covariates. Missing data were handled by listwise deletion.\nLinearity of age as a continuous variable with respect to the logit of the probability of headache (yes/no) was assessed with the Box-Tidwell procedure.\n20\nAge was found to be linearly related to the logit of the dependent variable and could thus be included as a continuous variable. The results for both analyses are presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nP\n-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. We used IBM SPSS Statistics software version 25 for the logistic regression and Stata/MP version 15.1 for the GLMM.\n\nEthical approval and patient consents\nThe Regional Committee for Research Ethics approved the study (REK 2013/754). Participants, or parents of participants <18 years of age, gave informed consent."

    "Methods": "Controlled cortical impact (CCI) animal model\nAdult male Sprague-Dawley rats (\u223c275\u2009g, Harlan Laboratories) were used after a week of acclimation under approval from the Virginia Commonwealth University Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines and the\nGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\n(U.S. Department of Health and Human Services). Animal facilities were accredited fully by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. Food and water were provided\nad libitum\nin ventilated cages in a temperature and humidity-controlled environment on 12\u2009h light/dark cycle.\nThe CCI was performed using a Leica Impact One Stereotaxic Impactor as described previously (\nSupplementary Fig. S1A\n).\n29\nBriefly, rats were anesthetized using 4% isoflurane and maintained at 2% throughout the surgical procedure. Rectal temperature was monitored to maintain 37\u00b0C via heating pad. Further, heart rate, respiratory rate, and arterial blood oxygenation were monitored via pulse oximetry (MouseOx, Starr Life Sciences) using a rat foot sensor to affirm physiological homeostasis (\nSupplementary Fig. S2A\u2013E\n). A 5\u2009mm craniotomy was centered 1.6\u2009mm caudal from bregma and 3.4\u2009mm lateral (\nSupplementary Fig. 1B\n). Focal injury was administered using a 3\u2009mm flat-tip stainless steel impactor translating perpendicular to the brain surface at 4.0\u2009m/sec to a depth of 2\u2009mm with a dwell time of 0.5\u2009sec. The scalp was sutured closed with Neosporin and 2% lidocaine applied topically. Anesthesia was discontinued and righting reflex was monitored as a correlate measure of injury severity, with TBI animals falling within the mild to moderate range (4.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.94\u2009min), which was significantly greater than sham (2.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.56\u2009min;\np\n=\u20090.001).\n30\nBrains were collected at 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 days post-injury by decapitation under isoflurane anesthesia. Brains were removed from the skull, rinsed with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. A 2\u2009mm thick coronal frozen tissue block centered on the lesion was mounted on a ThermoFisher HM 525 cryostat. The block was sectioned interleaving two adjacent 150\u2009\u03bcm sections for protein lysate with five 10\u2009\u03bcm sections for imaging. Each 150\u2009\u03bcm cut was dissected further by scalpel to extract perilesioned tissue between 0.5\u2009mm and 1.5\u2009mm lateral from the core boundary (\nSupplementary Fig. 1C\n), with pieces combined for protein analysis.\n\nProteomic mass spectrometry\nTissue lysis (\nn\n=\u20096/group) and mass spectrometric analysis were performed as described previously.\n29\nIn summary, we sequentially homogenized brain tissue to resolve the neuroproteome into matrix-associated and membrane-associated compartments. Sample protein concentration was assessed and balanced to a nominal 1\u2009\u03bcg/\u03bcL concentration. A 50-\u03bcg aliquot of each sample was reduced, alkylated, trypsin-digested, and concentrated into 20\u2009\u03bcL of 100-mM ammonium formate buffer (pH 10). We injected protein digests (4\u2009\u03bcL each) in a treatment-interspersed order for five-fraction two-dimensional nanoACQUITY ultra performance liquid chromatography.\nAn XBridge BEH C\n18\n1\u2009mm x 50\u2009mm fractionation column was used ahead of a Symmetry C\n18\n180\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u200920\u2009mm trap column and an HSS T3 75\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u2009mm analytical column (Waters). Eluting peptides were electrosprayed via a 10\u2009\u03bcm i.d. PicoTip emitter (New Objective) online with a Synapt G2 mass spectrometer (Waters) operated in a data-independent acquisition mode with ion mobility enabled. For quality control, instrument tuning, mass calibration, and a system performance evaluation for chromatographic separation (mean 0.16\u2009min peak width), resolution (nominally 26,000 at 785\u2009m/z), accuracy (0.5\u2009ppm, RMS), and sensitivity (nominally 1e5 intensity, a.u., at 750\u2009pg/\u03bcL) were performed daily using a [Glu1]-Fibrinopeptide B external mass standard (Waters) and a Pierce HeLa Protein Digest Standard (ThermoFisher).\n\nProteomic informatic analysis\nIon-mobility enabled data-independent analysis (\nHDMSe\u2122\n) results were processed using Waters PLGS software (v.3.0.2). Peak picked ion tables were generated using precursor and product intensity cutoffs of 325 and 30 counts for matrix fractions and 200 and 30 counts for membranous fractions, respectively. Processed results for the five chromatography fractions per sample were combined into a single ion table, merging duplicate ions within \u00b11\u2009min and \u00b110\u2009ppm difference in elution time and mass for precursor ions and \u00b11\u2009min and \u00b130\u2009ppm difference for product ions. Ion tables were then searched against a Uniprot KB Rattus Database (rel. 2017_01) with parameters: trypsin specificity; one missed cleavage; a minimum of two peptides per protein ID each with a minimum of three fragment ions; fixed carbamidomethylation; variable oxidation, phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation; neutral loss of ammonia or water; \u00b110\u2009ppm precursor ion tolerance, \u00b120\u2009ppm product ion tolerance. Peptide annotations were filtered to a 1% false discovery rate (FDR) using the reversed-decoy method.\nProcessed data were imported into IsoQuant (v1.7b) software for peptide clustering across biological replicates using the tolerance bands: \u00b112\u2009ppm for mass; \u00b12\u2009min for elution time; \u00b14 bins for drift time.\n31\nPeptide intensity data were merged when variably split by methionine oxidation, missed cleavage, or the neutral loss of water or ammonia, as can occur during experimentation. Data were then filtered to preserve replicating ions, measured in \u2265four of six biological replicates per group. We chose this conservative level of replication to balance the need for sufficient statistical power and comprehensive assessment of the TBI-responsive neuroproteome. Data were imputed for non-random missing values that consistently fell below the limit of detection (across all replicates per group) as described previously.\n29\nIntensity values were then median-centered within each treatment group and log2 transformed. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing was performed at the peptide-level, adjusted to a 5% false discovery rate (FDR) using the Q-value method. The TBI responsive peptide features were then dimensionally reduced in an unsupervised fashion by generating a self-organizing feature map (SOM), from which concerted temporal trends were identified (Multiple Experiment Viewer, v4.9).\n32\nProteins matched to each distinct temporal node from the feature map were assessed by enrichment analysis, using a Fisher inverse chi-squared method corrected to a 5% FDR (ToppGene).\n33\n\nImmunoblot analysis\nProtein-balanced samples (2\u2009\u03bcg) were resolved on a NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris gel system with MOPS buffer (ThermoFisher). Protein was transferred via the semi-dry method to 0.22\u2009\u03bcm PVDF membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked in 0.5% (w/v) powdered milk for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Blots were then probed with primary antibodies overnight (\u223c16\u2009h) at 4\u00b0C: anti-mouse KCC2 (Antibodies Inc., 75-013, 1:300); anti-rabbit KCC2 (Cell Signaling 94725, 1:2500); anti-mouse \u03b2-actin (load control, Sigma A5441, 1:5000). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the SuperSignal West Femto chemiluninescence reagent were used for detection (ThermoFisher).\nBlots were imaged on an Image Station 4000MM Pro 16-bit CCD imager (Carestream). Blot measure were normalized for load and standardized to control. The KCC2 relative abundance was assessed across post-injury time using the average control-standardized measure for two independent KCC2 antibodies for a robust assessment. An effect of time post-injury was assessed using JMP software (v13) by one-way ANOVA, with Tukey's honest significant difference\npost hoc\nanalysis for paired comparisons against control.\n\nImmunofluorescence microscopy\nFresh-frozen brains were cut into 2\u2009mm thick coronal blocks centered about the lesion and thin-sectioned (10\u2009\u03bcm) on a Microm HM 525 cryostat. Sections were thaw-mounted on charged glass slides, air dried, and fixed in 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. Slides were blocked for 1\u2009h at room temperature with a buffer containing: 5% goat serum (v/v); 2.5% bovine serum albumin (w/v); 0.1% Triton in 1x PBS (v/v). The sections were then probed overnight at 4\u00b0C with a mixture of anti-mouse lgG2a KCC2 (Antibodies Inc., 75-013, 1:40), and the excitatory neuronal marker anti-mouse IgG1 NeuN (Millipore MAB377, 1:500). Washed slides were then probed with Alexa Fluor 488 and 568 conjugated secondary antibodies (ThermoFisher) for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Prolong Diamond Antifade Mountant and a 0.17\u2009mm thick coverslip were applied (ThermoFisher).\nImages were collected at 400x magnification on a multi-channel fluorescence Axioimager.M2 motorized microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a constant-illumination solid-state light source, structured illumination, and a model 506\u2009m high-sensitive CCD camera. Image capture and analysis were performed in Zen v2.0 with consistent exposure settings across sample groups (five animals per group, four sections per animal). Slides were stained in cohorts that contained an equal representative number of animals per sample group. Each slide cohort was imaged in one session to further minimize within-cohort variance.\nNine multi-channel fluorescence 150\u2009\u03bcm\n2\nperilesional images per section were collected in a sequential-random stereological fashion within layers 4/5 of barrel cortex, between 500\u2009\u03bcm and 1500\u2009\u03bcm lateral from the lesion periphery. Integrated mean intensity gray-level measures (14-bit) on the target fluorescence channel were averaged across images per animal and background subtracted using the mean immunofluorescence imaged over the adjacent corpus callosum (exhibited negative staining for target antibodies). Measures from each staining cohort (with equal sample group representation) were mean-centered to correct for between-cohort variance. Measures were then standardized as a percentage of sham control staining. Statistical testing in JMP was performed across animals between sample groups with an effect of CLP290 on post-TBI KCC2 recovery assessed at each administration time relative to vehicle control using the Student\nt\ntest with a \u0160id\u00e1k correction for multiple comparisons.\n\nCLP290 pharmacological TBI treatment\nA follow-up cohort of CCI animals then were treated by oral gavage (p.o.) with the KCC2-selective enhancer compound CLP290 (5-fluoro-2-[(Z)-(2-hexahydrophyridazin-1-yl-4-oxo-thiazol-5-ylidene)methyl]phenyl]-pyrrolidine-1-carboxylate,\nSupplementary Fig. S3A\n, PharmaBlock USA, Sunnyvale, CA) as demonstrated previously.\n28\n,\n34\nCLP290 is a carbamate prodrug designed to enhance the pharmacokinetics of the active compound CLP257, which itself was effective in modulating KCC2 at a 100\u2009mg/kg intraperitoneal (i.p.) dose, but was limited pharmaceutically by a short <15\u2009min half-life. The kinetic profile was substantially improved with the metabolism of the orally administered prodrug CLP290 at the same 100\u2009mg/kg dose, extending the active compound's circulating half-life out to 5\u2009h along with a greater overall plasma concentration in the rat.\n28\nTo examine CLP290's pharacodynamics after TBI, we conducted a dose-response analysis starting with the previously published 100\u2009mg/kg dose. A minimum effective dose of 50\u2009mg/kg (p.o.) was identified in demonstrating improved somatosensory functional recovery by four days after TBI using the whisker adhesive removal and Rotarod behavioral tasks described below (\nSupplementary Fig. 3B,C\n). Animals were weighed daily with an appropriate mass of CLP290 freshly suspended in 2\u2009mL of 1% methylcellulose vehicle (w/v). The CLP290 (2\u2009mL) was delivered via gavage, with different administrations tested, initiated at 1\u2009h, 1 day, and 2 days after injury, or vehicle alone. Following behavioral testing four days after CCI, animals were sacrificed and brain tissue collected as described earlier. Animals showed no abnormal behavior or significant weight changes in response to the drug (\nSupplementary Fig. 2F\n), which previously was found to show no overt toxicological effects in a seven-day repeat-dose toxicity study up to a maximum 2000\u2009mg/kg dose.\n28\n\nWhisker adhesive removal task\nThe whisker adhesive removal task (w-ART)\n35\nwas performed to assess whisker sensory perception after injury adjacent to barrel somatosensory neocortex. Briefly, rats were trained before injury to remove a 113\u2009mm\n2\nadhesive sticker within 5\u2009sec of being placed on their whiskers. The sticker removal task was performed again with video recording four days after CCI or sham procedures, with CLP290 drug or vehicle administration as indicated. Latency to initiate sticker removal was then assessed. In JMP, an effect of CLP290 on post-TBI w-ART performance was tested at each administration time relative to vehicle control using the Student\nt\ntest with a \u0160id\u00e1k correction for multiple comparisons. Within-animal correlation between latency outcomes and perilesional KCC2 abundance were assessed at day 4 using a Spearman rank-order test.\n\nRotarod coordination performance task\nThe Rotarod task\n36\nwas performed to assess recovery of sensory integration for limb placement after CCI to limb-associated areas of somatosensory neocortex using the previously described method.\n37\nBriefly, animals were trained to walk on the rotating device before TBI or sham injury, which was accelerated from 0 revolutions per minute (rpm) to a maximum of 30\u2009rpm over a 100\u2009sec time interval. Animals were then tested one and four days after CCI or sham procedures, with CLP290 drug or vehicle administration as indicated. Latency to fall from the Rotarod on day 4 was determined as the average time on the device over three trials, normalized within each animal to day 1 performance, with a maximum cutoff time of 120\u2009sec for any given trial. In JMP, an effect of CLP290 on post-TBI Rotarod performance was tested at each administration time relative to vehicle control using the Student\nt\ntest with a \u0160id\u00e1k correction for multiple comparisons. Within-animal correlation between Rotarod performance and perilesional KCC2 abundance were assessed at day 4 using a Spearman rank-order test."

Male SHR (300\u2013350\u2009g,\nn\n=\u200925) and age-matched normotensive male Wistar rats (300\u2013350\u2009g,\nn\n=\u200915) were purchased from Janvier Labs (Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France) and Toxi-Coop (Budapest, Hungary). Mild impact acceleration diffuse brain injury was induced by Marmarou's weight drop model. In brief, with the rats under isoflurane (2%) anesthesia, the skull was exposed by a midline incision between lambda and bregma, and a steel disc was fixed with cement on the skull. A 450\u2009g cylindrical weight from 200\u2009mm was dropped onto the disc causing mild diffuse TBI to the animals. All animals survived the procedure. SHRs with mTBI had been treated with either vehicle (physiological saline,\nn\n=\u20095) or the antioxidative tetrapeptide SS-31 (elamipretide; 5.7\u2009mg/kg/day, i.p., dissolved in physiological saline,\nn\n=\u20095) for 14 days after mTBI.\n16\nThe SS compound SS-31 is a tetrapeptide with an alternating aromatic-cationic amino acid motif (H-D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH\n2\n), which concentrates in the inner mitochondrial membrane >1000-fold compared with the cytosolic concentration.\n17\nTreatment of laboratory rodents with SS-31 was shown to effectively decrease mitochondrial oxidative stress in the cerebral microvasculature.\n16\nBlood pressure was measured at the end of the treatment period before further experiments in all groups of animals using the tail cuff method.\n\nMeasurement of ROS and mtROS production in isolated MCAs\nTwo weeks after mTBI,\n18\nrats were decapitated, the brains were removed, and segments of the MCAs were isolated under an operating microscope using microsurgical instruments for imaging studies, as reported.\n8\nTo characterize cytosolic ROS production in cells within the walls of cerebral arteries, we used the DHE fluorescence method. To study mitochondrial oxidative stress, we applied MitoSOX Red, a mitochondrion-specific hydroethidine-derivative fluorescent redox indicator dye, as previously reported.\n19\nIn brief, artery segments were immediately placed, upon dissection, into physiological Kreb's solutions containing fresh, non-oxidized DHE (10\u2009\u03bcM/L; Sigma Aldrich Hungary, Budapest, Hungary) or MitoSOX (10\u2009\u03bcM/L, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Life Technologies, Budapest, Hungary). The vessel segments were incubated for 30\u2009min (at 37\u00b0C, protected from light). In a different series of experiments, arterial segments isolated from SHRs with and without mTBI (\nn\n=\u20095 in each group) were pre-treated with the NADPH-oxidase inhibitor apocynin (10\u2009mM/L for 90\u2009min; Sigma Aldrich Hungary, Budapest, Hungary,\nn\n=\u20096 in each group). After incubation, the vessels were washed in Krebs' buffer three times for 15\u2009min. Then, MCAs were placed on slides, cover-slipped, and imaged with a laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus Fluoview FV1000, excitation 488\u2009nm, emission between 540 and 640\u2009nm) using a\u2009\u00d7\u200940 objective. Average fluorescence intensities of the arteries measured in the optical sections of the endothelial and smooth muscle layers were quantified with ImageJ software, and expressed as a fold change compared with vessels from Wistar rats without mTBI (controls). The experimenter was blinded to the treatment groups.\n\nQuantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)\nTotal RNA from isolated MCAs was isolated using NucleoSpin RNA (Macherey-Nagel GmbH) and purity and concentration were analyzed by NanoDrop. RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA with the High Capacity cDNA RT Kit (Life Technologies). RT-PCR was run on an ABI-PRISM 7500 device in duplicates using SensiFast SYBR Green (BioLine). The following primers were used: Nox4, forward: CTT TCC GTC CCA AGC ACC G, reverse: GGG ACA GCC AAA CAA GCA GA; \u03b2-actin, forward: GTA ACC CGT TGA ACC CCA TT, and reverse: CCA TCC AAT CGG TAG TAG CG. Results are shown as a percentage of the housekeeping gene. Quantification was performed using the \u0394\u0394CT method.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA).

At two months post-SRC1, she started amantadine (Endo, Ballsbridge, Dublin, Ireland) because of concentration problems. She was asymptomatic by late June, released to resume exertional activity, and cleared for RTP by her clinical provider in July 2012, nearly five months post-injury.\nAt age 18, Jane sustained SRC2 in January 2015 when her head hit the ground during a soccer game. Similar to SRC1, she reported no loss of consciousness, and she denied post-traumatic amnesia (PTA). When examined in clinic on day 3, she stated that the mild headache and balance difficulties that had been present on the day of injury had cleared. ImPACT composite scores on Verbal Memory and Visual Memory, however, were below her pre-season baseline. The RTP protocol was initiated on day 4. On day 7, she returned to clinic and complained of balance problems and dizziness; her ImPACT Visual Memory Composite was still below baseline. On post-SRC2 day 10, Jane was asymptomatic, her ImPACT composite scores had returned to baseline, and she was cleared to RTP.\nHaving met the eligibility criteria for enrollment in a study that was ongoing, including the criterion for undergoing brain imaging (asymptomatic status and clearance for RTP by day 30), she had DTI and MRI on day 30. As an\nad hoc\nanalysis, FC was measured from her rs-fMRI data in a limited number of regions located near WM structures that were aberrant in the DTI analysis.\nComparison groups\nWe compared Jane's imaging findings with data collected from two groups of participants in the ongoing study, including 11 concussed adolescents (SRC comparison group) who were closest in age to Jane, had played a contact sport, and had also been cleared to RTP by day 30, and were imaged (mean age at injury\u2009=\u200916.41 years, standard deviation [SD]\u2009=\u20090.98, range 15\u201318 years,\nn\n=\u200910 males, one female). Nine adolescent contact athletes who had sustained a mild OI (Abbreviated Injury Scale \u22642;\nwww.aaam.org/abbreviated-injury-scale-ais/\n; accessed November 6, 2018) (age: mean\u2009=\u200916.64, \u00b11.02,\nn\n=\u2009four male, five female) were in the OI comparison group.\nOne of the contact athletes in the OI comparison group reported a previous concussion, whereas none of the athletes in the concussed comparison group reported a previous concussion. The number of seasons that the athletes in the concussed and OI comparison groups had played a contact sport and the age when each athlete was first exposed to a contact sport were not available. Although the post-injury interval for imaging was longer in the OI group, (SRC: mean\u2009=\u200933.1 days \u00b11.7; OI: mean\u2009=\u2009124.7 days \u00b169.0), we have found in previous studies that imaging findings are stable between the first week and three months after OI.\n12\nBecause Jane fell asleep during the resting state acquisition, we were unable to use her resting state sequence. An additional resting state sequence, however, testing a different protocol was acquired in a subset of participants (\nn\n=\u20096 SRC, 6 OI), and Jane was fully awake during this acquisition. Participants not scanned with this sequence were excluded from rs-fMRI analysis.\n\nProcedure\nDuring the resting state acquisition, which immediately preceded DTI in the same imaging session, the MRI technologist instructed the participants to lie still and to keep their eyes fixated on a red circle in their line of sight. Immediately after the rs-fMRI sequence, participants were queried to assess their wakefulness, and none reported sleepiness or had fallen asleep.\nImage data acquisition\nWhole brain imaging was performed using a 32-channel head coil on a Siemens 3T Magneton system (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) at the Center for Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX. Regular quality assurance testing was performed throughout the study, and no issues were detected. Transverse multi-slice spin echo, single shot, echo planar imaging (EPI) sequences were applied (9000\u2009msec repetition time [TR], 85\u2009msec echo time [TE], 2.0\u2009mm slices, with no gap, 73 slices) with iPAT3 for DTI acquisition. Diffusivities were measured along 64 directions using a low\nb\n-value of 0, and high\nb\n-value of 1000\u2009sec/mm\n2\n. Eddy current distortion and head motion artifact were corrected.\nFor fMRI, blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) T2*-weighted echo planar (EPI) were acquired as 200 volumes with 48 axial slices of 3.3- mm thickness with a 0\u2009mm gap, using a 212-mm field of view (FOV), 64\u2009\u00d7\u200964 matrix, TR of 3000\u2009msec, TE of 30\u2009msec, and an 80-degree flip angle. A set of three dimensional high-resolution T1-weighted images were also acquired in 176 sagittal slices of 1.2 mm thickness (no gap) with 240\u2009mm FOV, 240\u2009\u00d7\u2009256 matrix, TR of 2300\u2009ms, TE of 2.96\u2009ms, and a 9.0-degree flip angle. Additional anatomical sequences were acquired to evaluate neuropathology. A senior neuroradiologist (JVH) reviewed and coded the structural MRI findings without knowledge of group membership.\nDTI analysis\nConsistent with meta-analyses reporting the WM tracts most frequently affected by SRC and non-sports mTBI,\n13\nwe measured fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) for the genu of the corpus callosum, the total corpus callosum, the left and right sides of the uncinate fasciculus, and the cingulum bundle. The genu of the corpus callosum was also reported to be especially vulnerable to SRC in female athletes.\n14\n,\n15\nShear and eddy current distortion, as well as head motion artifact, were corrected by using the Philips' Research Image Development Environment (PRIDE\n\u00ae\n) registration tool. Regions of interest of the corpus callosum were traced manually on the midsagittal plane, following a published protocol.\n16\nThe automated Philips three-dimensional fiber tracking 4.1v3 Beta 2 program was utilized to examine fiber tracks passing through the corpus callosum, the left and right sides of the uncinate fasciculus, and the cingulum bundle.\n16\nThe algorithm for fiber tracking was based on the fiber assignment by continuous tracking method.\n17\nIf the FA in the voxels was <0.2, or if the angle between adjacent voxels was >7 degrees, fiber tracking terminated. To evaluate interrater reliability, DTI analysis of the subregions was performed for six randomly selected participants (\nn\n=\u20093 concussed, 3 OI controls) by two experienced raters. To ensure intrarater reliability, each region of interest was analyzed independently by each rater twice. Shrout-Fleiss intraclass correlation coefficients were >0.90 for intra- and interrater reliability.\n18\nfMRI image processing and analysis\nThe FC image processing and analyses were conducted using the Functional Connectivity Toolbox (CONN)\n19\nwithin SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, University College, London, UK), implemented in Matlab (Mathworks Inc., Sherborn, MA), as reported in Newsome and coworkers.\n1\nSeeds to measure the integrity of FC around the genu and total corpus callosum were located in the anterior, posterior, and subcallosal gyri. Significance was defined by voxel (height) threshold\np\n<\u20090.001,\n20\nand cluster threshold (\np\n<\u20090.05) false discovery rate (FDR) corrected for multiple comparisons across the whole brain. Bonferroni correction for three seeds for both tails of two between-group\nt\ntests was applied (\np\n=\u20090.05 / [3\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20092]\u2009=\u20090.0042)."
