    "Section": "This study is not a clinical trial and was not formally registered. The analysis plan was also not formally pre-registered. However, the study design and methods were assessed and pre-approved by the study's external funders.1Our power analysis showed that a sample size for detecting an interaction in the 2-way between subject ANOVAs with a moderate effect size of f\u2009=\u20090.25 with an alpha level of 0.05 and power of 0.80 was 128 subjects. Our final sample size for the between subject ANOVAs wasn=\u2009104, which allowed us to detect a moderate effects size of f\u2009=\u20090.028 with an alpha level of 0.05 and power of 0.80. Additionally, our power analysis showed that a sample size for detecting a within-between interaction in a 2-way mixed model ANOVA with a moderate effect size of f\u2009=\u20090.25 with an alpha level of 0.05 and power of 0.80 was 34 mild TBI subjects. Our final sample size for the mixed model ANOVA wasn=\u200956, which allowed us to detect an effect size of f\u2009=\u20090.195 with an alpha level of 0.05 and power of 0.80.3\n\nEighty participants with mild TBI and 50 control participants enrolled in the larger study. One participant with mild TBI was a screen fail after enrollment. Sixteen participants with mild TBI and 9 control participants did not identify as Caucasian or AA and therefore were not include in this study, which resulted in a total ofn=\u2009104 (63 mild TBI). Seven participants with mild TBI withdrew before the 1-month visit and therefore were not included in the analysis across time (n=\u200956). At the 1-week visit, 1 participant did not complete the PPT and TS assessments on the head, 2 participants did not complete the CPM test due to equipment malfunction, and 2 participants did not correctly complete the CES-D.4Participants were not told the results of their assessments.5\n\nDetails of data acquisition and handling are provided in the article. All data sets were analyzed at the same time.6All surveys and questionnaires are widely available. All equipment used to conduct the quantitative sensory testing is available from Medoc Advanced Medical Systems and North Coast Medical & Rehabilitation Products.7The key inclusion criteria and outcome evaluations are established standards.8CIs and effect sizes are reported inTable 3and the main text for primary outcome variables.9Tukey's test was used for follow-up comparisons, which accounts for multiple comparisons and maintains experiment-wise alpha at the specified level.10No replication or external validation studies have been performed.11De-identified data from this study will be made available (as allowable according to institutional review board standards) by e-mailing the corresponding author.12The authors agree to provide the full content of the manuscript on request by contacting the corresponding author.14"

    "Section": "To assess cluster generalizability in an external validation data set, we developed a supervised K-NN classifier to determine the cluster assignments of subjects in the TRACK-TBI Pilot data set using the GLRM-selected features. Briefly, K-NN is a nonparametric algorithm in which the target class of a new observation is determined by the majority target class of theKneighboring observations used to train the model. COBRIT data were split into a training data set (80%,n=\u2009970 subjects) and a holdout data set (20%,n=\u2009243 subjects). Model hyperparameterKwas tuned using 10-fold cross-validation on the training data for values ofKbetween 1 and 20 (K-NN implemented usingcaretpackage in R, version 6.0-78).36The performance of the trained K-NN model was evaluated by measuring the accuracy of labeling the correct cluster in the holdout data set. The trained K-NN model was then used to predict the subtypes (i.e., cluster membership) of TRACK-TBI Pilot subjects with predictor feature data available (n=\u2009385). To determine the resemblance of TRACK-TBI-predicted clusters to the original COBRIT-derived clusters, the pairwise Gower's dissimilarities between TRACK-TBI and COBRIT patients in the same clusters were calculated and compared between the two data sets using the cross-match test.37The cross-match statistical test is a distribution-free permutation test that compares two multivariate distributions of different sample sizes by using distances between observations. Observations are divided into pairs with the goal of minimizing the distance between observations. The cross-match statistic is defined as the number of times a subject from one group was paired with a subject from another group; small values of the statistic (i.e., fewer pairs with observations from both groups) reject the hypothesis that the observations come from the same distribution. Lastly, to determine if TRACK-TBI clusters had similar long-term recovery outcomes to COBRIT clusters, 90- and 180-day GOS-E scores for TRACK-TBI subjects were examined for inter-phenotype differences."
