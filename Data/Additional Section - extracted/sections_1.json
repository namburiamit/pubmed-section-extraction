As such, a formal power analysis was not performed at the outset of the investigation. Twenty-one subjects were recruited for the study, and data were successfully analyzed in 18 subjects. Participants were told the results of clinically significant or potentially clinically significant imaging findings after the final clinical observations had been made. Imaging acquisition and analyses were performed by team members blinded to relevant characteristics of the participants, and clinical outcomes were assessed by team members blinded to imaging results. MRI data were acquired using a Siemens Prisma 3T scanner, software version VE11C. All MRI data were acquired on the same scanner. All equipment and software used to perform imaging and pre-processing are widely available from commercial sources. The key inclusion criteria and outcome evaluations are established standards.\n\nNeuroimaging processing and statistical analyses were performed by Brian B. Avants and Nicholas J. Tustison using the open-source ANTsR package, of which they are the founders and principal developers.

    "Section": "All experimental procedures were approved by the University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The study was conducted and data are reported in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines.30F0 male rats were randomized into two treatment groups using a random number generator. F0 na\u00efve female rats were used as breeders only to generate offspring (generation F1). Sample size calculations were done, assuming a range of anticipated differences in mean outcomes and standard deviation based on background data and past experience with similar measurements in Sprague-Dawley rats.27The primary outcomes of this study were intergenerational neuroendocrine and behavioral effects of paternal traumatic brain injury (TBI); all other outcomes were secondary outcomes. Inclusion and exclusion criteria: the animals were of the same age and a similar weight and have similar baseline behavioral outcomes. Exclusion criteria include immediate post-procedural issues, or any pathophysiological conditions developed later. Animals excluded from the study are reported in the manuscript. A cohort of 18 breeding pairs of F0 rats was used to produce F1 offspring for a given experimental group (18 F1 rats/group/sex). A given F1 offspring experimental group included 1 to 2 rats from a given F0 litter. In all experiments, control and treatment groups were tested using the same experimental conditions (e.g., O2/air mixture in the animal cage during the procedures, time of day). This study investigated both male and female offspring to elucidate sex-specific intergenerational effects of paternal TBI. Data analyses included experimental group (treatment) and sex as the main effects and experimental group (treatment)\u2009\u00d7\u2009sex interactions."

Groups of 10 mice are sufficient to detect differences (p<\u20090.05) between groups in locomotor recovery and tissue pathology using repeated measures ANOVA with post hoc comparisons. To account for attrition a total of 32 mice were injured (16 in each group). Of the 32 mice that were originally injured, 1 died during surgery, 5 were excluded for technical reasons, 1 was excluded for poor incision healing, and 1 was euthanized 1 day after SCI. Of the 8 mice that were excluded in behavioral analysis 4 were in the vehicle group and 4 were in the ethanol group. During analysis of tissue pathology, the first block of tissue was excluded due to poor tissue sectioning. This excluded 2 mice that were already excluded for technical reasons and 3 additional animals (2 in the vehicle group and 1 in the ethanol group). Ethanol administration occurred \u223c40\u2009min prior to SCI to achieve stable PECs at the time of injury. After baseline behavior was collected, all mice were randomized to either ethanol or vehicle using a random number generator. BMS scoring, Catwalk XT gait analysis testing, and Hargreaves heat sensitivity testing were all performed by observers blinded to the treatment group.

Although our analysis plan was not formally pre-registered, the team members with primary responsibility for the analysis (A.M.G. and J.P.J.S.) certify that the analysis plan was pre-specified. A sample size of 84 TBI subjects was planned based on the availability of subjects with plasma and data available in our biorepository. The actual sample size was 84 subjects in the TBI group (with 32 subjects having a late time point available) with the inclusion of 35 control subjects based on availability and age and sex matching. All patients with TBI admitted to Memorial Hermann Hospital were approached for enrollment into our biobank. Among 311 TBI subjects with biosamples available, 84 subjects had mTBI as well as outcomes data, and were included in this study. Handling of biosamples and analysis was performed by team members blinded to relevant characteristics of the participants, and biomarkers were labeled using de-identified codes with a linking list required to obtained participant identifying information. Samples were acquired between December 2017 and August 2019. Samples were collected within 24\u2009h from TBI and also at 3 months after TBI. Samples were collected at Memorial Hermann Hospital. Blood samples were collected in EDTA-containing tubes and were centrifuged to generate plasma. Samples were stored at -80\u00b0C prior to analysis. Aliquots were prepared prior to freezing to minimize freeze\u2013thaw cycles. All mTBI samples were analyzed within the same batch. All analysis was performed by Metabolon, Inc (Morrisville, NC), and all equipment and reagents used were owned by Metabolon. The key inclusion criteria for mild TBI as well as outcome metrics (GOSE) are established standards in the field. Statistical tests used were based on the assumptions of non-normal distribution of the data. Multiple comparisons were addressed using an FDR correction, with significance after FDR correction set conservatively at 0.05. External validation studies are ongoing.

Portions of the abstract were previously published in Abstracts from The 40th Annual Symposium of the National Neurotrauma Society held between June 25 and 28, 2023 in Austin, Texas, with the abstract being entitled \u201cSex and age-related differences in child and parental reporting of persistent post-concussive symptoms\u201d (doi: 10.1089/neu.2023.29130.abstracts). A total sample size of 291 patients with pmTBI and 224 HC were consecutively recruited from local emergency rooms and seen at SA, EC, and LC or equivalent time points. Study attrition occurred for 53 pmTBI and 19 HC for the EC visit. Study attrition occurred for an additional 29 pmTBI and 15 HC for the LC visit. A total of 48 participants were not yet eligible for their LC visit at the time of manuscript preparation during this ongoing study. Inclusion criteria for pmTBI was based on published criteria (American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine [ACRM] and Zurich) and was independently verified by at least two clinicians prior to study enrollment. Participants were provided with a copy of their radiological findings, but were blinded to the results of their clinical assessments. Data were analyzed separately for HC and pmTBI using SPSS version 20.0 using information criterion tested distributions. Effect sizes are reported to enhance transparency, with primary results corrected for multiple comparisons. All surveys and questionnaires used in the current study are publicly available. The current study replicated previous findings in a subset of the cohort while also examining the effect of host factors (biological sex and age at injury) on key psychometric properties of the post-concussive symptom reporting. All data from this study will be publicly available in the Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research (FITBIR) database upon completion of the study, or can be obtained sooner by requesting it from the study principle investigator.

Key inclusion criteria and outcome measures are established standards in the field (time from injury, AIS grade, neurological level of injury). A sample size of 100 participants was assumed based on the average number of patients admitted to study sites and using a simplified power calculation for estimating Spearman correlations between AIS grade and a given biomarker level, a sample of 100 would have yielded 80% power to detect a correlation of 0.28 or greater (2-tailed alpha\u2009=\u20090.05, with no adjustment for multiple testing.) There were 1117 individuals assessed for eligibility. Of these, 33 declined to enroll, 47 were excluded due to medical reasons, and 998 did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria. There were 42 participants who were enrolled, but one was withdrawn due to lesion level criteria ineligibility. Of the remaining 41, the following number completed these study visits with RNA-Seq samples that passed quality controls: V1 (N\u2009=\u200938, V2 (N\u2009=\u200914), V3 (N\u2009=\u200914), V4 (N\u2009=\u20098). In total, 12 participants were selected for this longitudinal analysis because they had sequential non-missing biological samples for study visits 1-3. Participants were not told and were unable to guess results of the fluid biomarkers measurements. Sample handling and quality control decisions were performed by personnel blinded to participant characteristics. De-identified participant IDs were used for all analyses. Equipment and analytical resources were from commercial suppliers described in methods. There were no analytic codes generated; all statistical analyses were performed in Prism GraphPad and Partek Genomics Flow, using algorithms and methods pre-specified by the commercial software. Biological samples used in this study were obtained by the investigators and are being used for additional analyses; limited quantities of some samples remain. We are not conducting replication studies.

    "Section": "This study was not pre-registered. Statistical power and sample size calculations were based on previous studies withSarm1KO mice and an expected effect size at Day 7 after IA-TBI of 0.6 with regard to protection of intact axons. A sample size of nine subjects per group was planned and calculated to yield >90 % power to detect at least 50% protection in intact axons. Statistical power for the major secondary outcome measure of pathological profiles was >80%. Subjects were randomly assigned to groups and due to the scale of the project mice and tissues were processed in multiple batches. Experimental manipulations were performed with subjects in the fed state between 1 and 5pm. Whenever possible care was taken to include multiple groups per batch. Analyses of experimental materials were performed by investigators blinded to relevant characteristics of the subjects. Wt and transgenic mice are available from Jackson Labs. While detailed in the method sections, further information on equipment and analytical reagents used to perform experimental manipulations are available upon request. The statistical tests used were based on the assumption of normality, and heteroskedeity in the case of CD68 quantifications was addressed by log-transformation of the data. The sample sizes and degrees of freedom reflect the number of independent measurements (i.e., mouse) while in the case of proximal-distal ON comparisons, non-independence of measurements has been addressed using mixed effect models as detailed in themethodssection. Data are available upon request. A limited number of histological samples from each of the experimental groups are available for future analyses on request.

The sample size calculation was performed with G*Power v3.1.9.7 software.58We excluded two rats for technical reasons, so we added two more rats because of attrition. Rats were randomly assigned to groups using a random number generator. All 42 rats received the allocated treatment. Because of a scheduling conflict, we could not perform the MRI studies for one rat. Another rat died on day 5 from peritonitis unrelated to the procedure, so we could not perform the MRI study on day 7. Therefore, complete data were obtained for 40 rats. Investigators who performed behavioral outcome assessments and MRI data analysis were blinded to treatment groups. The nVNS therapy was applied 30\u2009min post-injury. A dose-response relationship was performed using two doses (2-min nVNS and 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092-min nVNS)."

The planned sample size was 180, and we used 160 cases in power analyses to account for likely attrition from the targeted sample. We used regression to estimate power using ordinary least squares instead of maximum likelihood.\n\nIn considering such models, effect sizes are determined by the amount of variance attributable to a specific predictor relative to the error variance. Cohen's f2varied from about .05 to about .15. We estimated a model with 10 predictors and considered power for the test of the overall model and for the effect of a single variable within the model using an alpha of .05 and a sample of 160. Power for testing the overall model exceeded .80 when the R2was at least .10 (f2=\u2009.111) and the power to detect a single variable as a significant contributor to prediction was .80 even if the R2change was only .05 and the overall R2was .05. The study was amply powered.\n\nFigure 1contains the consort diagram. The key inclusion criteria and behavioral outcomes are Common Data Elements for pediatric TBI. All salivary assessments were handled using standard protocols, and analyses were completed by Salimetrics LLC as described in Methods. Persons performing the analyses and patients were blinded to results of biomarker measurements. Outliers for salivary data were defined as >2.5 SD above the mean and were winsorized. Correction for multiple comparisons used the Bonferroni or Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. No replication or external validation studies have been performed or are planned at this time to our knowledge.\n\nDe-identified data and analytic code are not available in a public archive but will be made available according to institutional IRB standards by emailing the corresponding author as of 12-31-2023.

An equal number of males and females were included in each group. The final sample size was 39 (injured group\u2009=\u200930, sham group\u2009=\u20099). One sham rat (female) was excluded because of a surgical error and was not replaced. One injured rat died before completing all time points because of a complication from anesthesia, and a surgical error occurred in one injured rat. Both were replaced with rats of the same injury severity and sex. Behavioral acquisition and analyses were performed by team members blinded to the injury severity of the rats, and imaging acquisition and analyses were automated to limit bias, because meaningful blinding to injury severity was not possible.

To identify TBI in Medicare administrative claims, we used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case definition. We adopted diagnosis codes from the Barell Injury Diagnosis Matrix to identify non-TBI trauma injuries. Nursing home stays were identified based on a validated algorithm described by Intrator et al. Chronic diseases were identified from the claims based on validated algorithms that search for specific diagnostic codes. Requiring continuous enrollment during the study period ensured that all events of interest were captured. We examined the balance of observed covariates in the weighted sample by computing standardized mean differences (the difference in means between TBI and no-TBI (non-TBI trauma and uninjured) groups divided by the overall standard deviation) on pre- and post-matched samples, following published guidelines. We further adjusted for covariates with standardized differences greater than \u00b1\u20090.03 in the regression model as a form of doubly robust estimation."

    "Section": "The cross-over study design and analysis plan were preregistered onClinicalTrials.gov(NCT02323698). Prespecified sample size wasn=\u200917, yielding statistical power of 0.70 for detection of a change in 10MWT time (f=\u20090.7, F3,12=\u20093.5;p=\u20090.4, \u03b1\u2009=\u2009.05). During enrollment, subjects were assigned to C+AIH, P+AIH, and C+SHAM intervention arms using a random number generator. The order of interventions was balanced across subjects. We consented 34 individuals, 22 lost during allocation due to relocation, change in medical status, and COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions. Ten participants completed the study (seeSupplemental Material). In the present study, we hadn=\u20099 cross-over participants complete daily (5 consecutive days) of C+AIH, C+SHAM, and P+AIH. Although the calculated variances are larger than the planned value, the observed change in 10MWT is larger than expected. That leads to an observed effect size of 0.64 using the change of 10MWT at D19from baseline in the C+AIH group withn=\u200910, which is close to the planned effect size of 0.7. Apost hocpower calculation with multivariate T2test for the 4-period cross-over design, a sample size ofn=\u200910 would be required to have the statistical power of 80% at \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05 when the effect sizes of change from baseline are estimated to be 0.5 (D5), 0.55 (D12), 0.65 (D19) from the current study, and the correlation between outcomes from different periods is 0.8. A minimum of a 2-week washout yielded intervention arms with baseline 10MWT medians the same across the intervention rounds (Median Test,p=\u20090.638). The distribution of baseline 10MWT also is the same across the intervention rounds (Kruskal-Wallis Test,p=\u20090.731). All primary outcomes were assessed by investigators blinded to the intervention arm assignment. All materials required to perform the assessments and interventions may be available upon request. The primary outcome measure (10-meter walk test) and secondary outcome measure (6-minute walk test) are standard in the field and have high test-retest reliability. We used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test for the primary outcome measure at D19for each intervention arm: P+AIH (p=\u20090.200), C+AIH (p=\u20090.088), and C+SHAM (p=\u20090.200). Correction for multiple comparisons was performed for the outcome measures. The findings have not yet been replicated or externally validated. Data are available upon request and the manuscript is open access."

    "Section": "We addressed the potential for local dependency among persons in the full sample (since the dataset included repeated measures of the same individuals) by generating two random subsamples\u2014calibration and validation sub-samples\u2014in which each individual is represented once by either their first or last record.20The calibration and validation sub-samples were represented by 242 participants with either their first or last record. Twenty participants with a single record were randomly assigned for a total of 252 participants in the calibration and validation sub-sample, respectively (Fig. 2).\n\nThe calibration sub-sample was used to produce step and item anchors; these were validated with the validation sub-sample. Luppescu's method of cross-plotting person measures and item calibrations with 95% confidence intervals was used to evaluate whether there were significant deviations between the calibration and validation sub-samples.21Step and item anchors were validated by evaluating item displacement >0.50 logits.22Once validated, the step and item calibrations from the calibration sub-sample were applied as anchored values to the full sample.19"
