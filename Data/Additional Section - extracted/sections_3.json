    "Section": "As reviewed in preceding sections and tables, a number of studies have provided evidence of CNS consequences of infection by SARS-COV-2, either by inferences from changes in neurological status or by more direct neuropathological assessments such as imaging. Studies to date have primarily been observational and used differing criteria for reporting CNS injury. For example, altered mental status is commonly used as a sign of possible CNS injury in COVID-19 patients (e.g., see earlier works102,103,135,136). However, functional neurological assessments can be non-specific, and neurological symptoms attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infection must be distinguished from exacerbation of pre-existing neurological and psychiatric conditions, especially in the elderly.137,138Moreover, CNS pathology may not be reliably related to the severity of respiratory symptoms in COVID-19 patients.67Methods to enable accurate prognoses of patients' vulnerability to neurological disturbances as well as the extent and durations of cognitive and functional deficits attributable to infection by SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed.\n\nThe most urgent unanswered questions relate to the frequency and severity of brain injury in COVID-19 patients, identification of primary and secondary injury mechanisms contributing to this injury, risk factors for injury, and the nature and duration of neurological deficits in COVID-19 patients diagnosed with brain damage. Investigators have initiated important retrospective studies to begin to address these questions.139The researchers felt, based in part on extrapolation from previous data from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), that neurological complications in COVID-19 patients are infrequent. However, given potential that 50\u201380% of the world's population might be infected before herd immunity develops, they recognized the significant need for clinical, diagnostic, and epidemiological studies to characterize neurological manifestations in COVID-19 patients and the resulting disease burden.\n\nWe argue that conclusions about the frequency and severity of CNS injury and resulting neurological deficits are premature in the absence of established diagnostic and outcome measures. Our goal is to provide a framework in which such studies can be rapidly implemented to provide these much needed data. As we reference in this review, the framework incorporates technologies and clinical approaches previously successfully used in studies of other acute CNS injuries, notably TBI.\n\nDoes infection with SARS-CoV-2 increase risk for later emergence of new neurological symptoms or development of neurodegenerative diseases? Cell senescence and a stable state of proliferative arrest is an adaptive response to viral infections,140and investigators have posited that SARS-CoV-2 invokes CNS cellular senescence and neurodegenerative processes.141Inflammatory and neuroimmune responses to CNS infection are thought to be important mediators of Alzheimer's disease (AD).142\u201cCytokine storms\u201d and immunosuppression have both been reported to occur during the course of COVID-19.143However, levels of inflammatory markers in COVID-19 patients may be lower than levels observed in secondary insults such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that could be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.144\n\nThe interleukin (IL)-6 inhibitor, tocilizumab, reduces cognitive deficits in a mouse model of AD,145and IL-6 inhibitors are being studied in clinical trials for their efficacy in treating severe SARS-CoV-2 disease.143Long-term follow-up of these patients will enhance understanding of the role of IL-6 and SARS-CoV-2 in any subsequent neurodegeneration. The hypothesis that initiation of AD could be attributable, in part, to systemic pathogens entering the CNS and initiating aberrant A-beta cascades146or stimulating inflammation that facilitates the cascades highlights the need for such studies. There is an interesting reciprocity between COVID-19 and dementia and neurodegenerative diseases. As we document in a later section of this review, AD, Parkinson's disease (PD), and dementias are associated with more complicated clinical courses and poorer outcomes in COVID-19 patients."
